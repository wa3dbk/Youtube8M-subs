00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.899
 moon studios worked for four years 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.030
 an oriental and forest microsoft 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.680
 early saw its potential for bot 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.180
 already one year after the beginning of the 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.920
 development as a publisher at 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.660
 Now the time has come and you can 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.040
 make a picture of it yourself 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.570
 for microsoft has been worth the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.570
 to acquire exclusive rights 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.329
 already shortly after the beginning of the story 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.670
 Clearly the oriental and forest will open 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.290
 Strong emotions are playing 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.769
 rather a big and superior 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.809
 role 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.879
 but also mourning hope and 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.460
 melancholy are part of the repertoire of 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.720
 extraordinary platform as 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.539
 hatched the eponymous creature 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.490
 orie this is small agile and features 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:13.039
 is a cat-like in courage 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.660
 accompanied by a light that helps him 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.759
 to bring the light up again soon 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.080
 and dispel the darkness 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.729
 that is not easy 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.770
 underpinned by the darkness 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.780
 also have dark monsters in the forest 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.580
 in the fight against this, ori becomes 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.450
 magical places on the light 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.130
 was robbed 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.170
 while encountering him other beings of the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.940
 waldes pursue their own motives 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.890
 the story is reminiscent of indian 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.209
 This is also said by the narrator 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.429
 he supports in an unknown 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.429
 language background information supplies 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.280
 Nevertheless, the action has its own 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.390
 charm and seems the no historical 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.610
 drawer to fit 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.810
 this reinforces the fascination of mori and 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.810
 his arduous way 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.200
 Even at night, look at various pictures 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.480
 and videos to the game you get only 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.490
 An idea what to expect 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.200
 only if one plans Oriente for the time being 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.479
 Playing yourself becomes clear 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.860
 fantastic looks this is 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.110
 not just the technology of that too 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.690
 Thanks to the unity 5 engine 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.700
 everything is already liquid and the colors 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.440
 are wonderfully powerful, but that's it 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.390
 design that captivates you 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.490
 the game world is alive and well 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.500
 multi-layered every scene consists of 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.750
 several levels that give you the feeling of 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.070
 mediate deeper in space and have here 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.730
 the developers are particularly hard 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.620
 given 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.810
 no element was copied and again 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.130
 Every little detail is used 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.750
 was redesigned 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.480
 an effort at the size of this 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.650
 game world quite remarkable is the 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.660
 itself acts similar to the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.350
 playing figures in revelations in the world 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.209
 drawn 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.860
 his movements are very smooth 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.750
 and always stay sharp 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.040
 come nice particles and light effects 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.930
 These fit seamlessly into that 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.790
 happen if it is not the right one 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.050
 Picturesque landscapes are then inviting 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.790
 the music to dream 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.010
 an asian smoke and catchy 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.090
 melodies summarize acoustically what 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.090
 presents itself to the eye 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.190
 The voice of the narrator also fits 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:14.780
 perfect and supports the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:16.580
 mystical atmosphere orient the black 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.710
 forest is in the genre 2d 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.210
 platformer one more precisely in the 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.920
 category with people line 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.750
 that's what you mean by one 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.850
 huge map is moving and increasing 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.920
 forces get through her further 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.600
 Some could reach parts of the map 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.580
 Doors need an explosion 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.230
 some a rammer other 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.120
 turn the ability enemies and 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.620
 bullets push away that 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.420
 movement repertoire of ori is 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.190
 versatile and very resourceful 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.960
 both the idea does not directly fend off 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.970
 combat as well as the impact attack 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.800
 feel fresh but directly 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.900
 in meat and blood about audi still has 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.790
 you have further innovations in luggage 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.650
 You can get enough energy cells that well 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.360
 as everywhere to build a memory point 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.190
 so that after her death from there 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.820
 could start the flip side of the 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.170
 medal 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.730
 should you die you lose 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.770
 really the whole progress since 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.240
 the last memory point at 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.470
 This can be a lot bigger 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.210
 be angry that the 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.040
 various possibilities for movement 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.640
 This mechanic will quickly become too 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.980
 routine 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.780
 The world of the game, on the other hand, is everything else 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.400
 as routine instead of you to everyone 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.770
 time to take the hand and the 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.330
 giving exact directions gives you oriente 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.890
 Blind is a lot of freedom 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.930
 Nails are not always obvious 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.210
 and rarely act as if they were 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.310
 Intended it is nice to see that 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.200
 here partly in the years come 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.180
 habits are left aside 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.870
 and the explorer's urge to explore 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.000
 is appealed 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.500
 this creates pure joy of playing because 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.370
 technically there is absolutely nothing 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.620
 exposing 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.660
 Something goes wrong in any case 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.710
 on your own disability 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.480
 attributed where we already at 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.050
 the topic will be a lot wrong 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.730
 go 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.530
 Orient planned for the time being 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.720
 methods and frictional moments do not return 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.790
 However, these are dosed just right 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.860
 In this way is by often enough 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.870
 experience of success so that the 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.640
 Exhausted players live quickly from 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.470
 tricky jump passages are annoyed 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.420
 should probably be here a few directly 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.500
 order extra controller and 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.390
 possibly a new one 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.860
 tv so that your chances in the 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.750
 improve the course of the game 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.850
 gather gates from his opponents spirits 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.300
 one in turn to score skill 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.770
 to lead 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.080
 through these are existing forces 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.990
 improved and new skills like that 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.490
 breathe under water unlocked 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.230
 even if the roads now and then 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.300
 are a bit longer with oriente black 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.860
 forest never boring on the contrary 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.600
 from the first to the last second 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.970
 provides the gameplay motivating 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.800
 entertainment without the playing time too 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.630
 It is difficult to say how to measure 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.340
 It took a long time for the first one 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.650
 pass can say that the 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.330
 playing time around ten hours is moving that 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.070
 depends however on how many on 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.690
 collects your way and if you the 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.460
 especially crisp passages directly 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.290
 Master here sometimes longer 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.940
 sections without memory possibility on 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.720
 that can wait a while 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.940
 take longer 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.930
 You only get a replay value 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.300
 based on the successes 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.890
 However, these have become so in themselves now 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.720
 It requires a success from you 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.370
 to master the game without death 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.960
 especially the mentioned sections in 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.370
 you can flee with them 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.080
 quickly a dash through the bill 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.520
 unfortunately you can do it at the end of the 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.170
 Do not play around with the game world anymore 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.910
 to look for missed items 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.410
 the score has reached the end 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.820
 can not be restarted 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.950
 it would be the only one 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.020
 real criticism of oriente platform 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.140
 here's a hint would be at least 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.700
 The point of no return has been helpful 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:20.440
 the billing detailed scenes 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.750
 beautiful representation technically 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.900
 impeccable gameplay innovative 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.490
 Game mechanics after playing none 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.470
 Return to the game world possible 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.990
 you should also only rudimentary 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.490
 for 2d platformer will inspire you 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.620
 Oriente blind is the finest 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.150
 pamper both visually and 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.460
 playfully this is 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.900
 masterpiece at the highest level something 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.580
 However, you should have frustration resistance 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.090
 his mistakes are rare 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.090
 warp
