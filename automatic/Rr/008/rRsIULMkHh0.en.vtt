it's got a trigger down here the calls

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.870 
it's got a trigger down here the calls
this<00:01:42.930> trigger<00:01:43.230> is<00:01:43.620> what<00:01:44.250> squeezes<00:01:44.730> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
this trigger is what squeezes the

continually<00:02:35.210> reduce<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.870> trigger

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:50.330 

who's<00:03:17.870> this

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.649 

that's<00:03:51.340> how<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.519> spread<00:03:51.909> the<00:03:52.090> ceilings<00:03:52.510> in

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
that's how you spread the ceilings in

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:53.339 
that's how you spread the ceilings in
the<00:03:52.780> walls

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
the walls

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:54.860 
the walls
it's<00:03:53.650> pretty<00:03:53.860> important<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.370> have<00:03:54.519> a<00:03:54.549> gun

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
it's pretty important to have a gun

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.690 
it's pretty important to have a gun
adjust<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.079> to<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.200> proper<00:03:56.319> angle<00:03:57.220> before<00:03:57.610> you

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
adjust it to the proper angle before you

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.369 
adjust it to the proper angle before you
start<00:03:57.970> spraying<00:03:58.329> this<00:03:58.629> and<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:58.930> could<00:03:59.170> mean

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
start spraying this and it could mean

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.170 
start spraying this and it could mean
yet<00:03:59.650> display<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.549> ceilings

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
yet display the ceilings

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.339 
yet display the ceilings
if<00:04:01.659> the<00:04:01.780> gun<00:04:01.989> is<00:04:02.700> facing<00:04:03.700> too<00:04:03.939> far<00:04:04.239> down<00:04:05.079> this

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
if the gun is facing too far down this

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.110 
if the gun is facing too far down this
weather<00:04:05.650> they<00:04:05.890> got<00:04:06.040> stand<00:04:06.370> back<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.819> spray<00:04:07.060> the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
weather they got stand back to spray the
