no Natural Balance or anything that to

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.660 
no Natural Balance or anything that to
have<00:00:49.500> people<00:00:49.829> holding<00:00:50.070> me<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.250> either<00:00:50.370> side<00:00:50.640> of

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
have people holding me on either side of

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.889 
have people holding me on either side of
the<00:00:50.850> horse<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.180> someone<00:00:51.449> leading<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.809> horse

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the horse and someone leading the horse

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.229 
the horse and someone leading the horse
around<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.760> stuck<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
around and just just stuck with it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.639 
around and just just stuck with it
really<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.750> I've<00:00:54.870> eventually<00:00:55.230> got<00:00:55.379> my<00:00:55.530> own

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
really and so I've eventually got my own

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.090 
really and so I've eventually got my own
balance<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.309> once<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.059> could<00:00:57.239> sort<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.660> ride

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
balance and once I could sort of ride

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.349 
balance and once I could sort of ride
with<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.460> leader<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.820> joined<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> neighbor

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
with just a leader I joined the neighbor

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.060 
with just a leader I joined the neighbor
bodied<00:01:00.719> ride<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.020> school<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:01.770> trying<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
bodied ride in school so I was trying to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.130 
bodied ride in school so I was trying to
keep<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.430> with<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.699> able-bodied<00:01:03.690> norm<00:01:03.930> or

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
keep up with the able-bodied norm or

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140 
keep up with the able-bodied norm or
whatever<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.619> correct<00:01:05.220> terminology<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.970> um

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
whatever the correct terminology is um

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.510 
whatever the correct terminology is um
and<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.439> think<00:01:07.590> that's<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:07.860> pushed<00:01:08.070> me<00:01:08.220> really

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and I think that's what pushed me really

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.060 
and I think that's what pushed me really
obviously<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.939> wanted<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:10.020> good<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.590> them

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
obviously I wanted to be as good as them

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.219 
obviously I wanted to be as good as them
so<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> was<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.670> know<00:01:11.700> trying<00:01:11.820> hard<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.600> having

so I was you know trying hard and having

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.140 
so I was you know trying hard and having
extra<00:01:13.590> lessons<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.909> took

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
extra lessons and it just really took

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.429 
extra lessons and it just really took
off<00:01:15.299> from<00:01:15.420> there<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.720> then<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.170> started

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
know that's a really tough question I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.760

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
think that they just know I think it's a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.840 
think that they just know I think it's a
special<00:01:34.079> relationship<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.610> quite<00:01:35.820> a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
special relationship and it's quite a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.749 
special relationship and it's quite a
nice<00:01:35.970> feeling<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.420> go<00:01:36.600> into<00:01:36.810> an<00:01:36.930> arena<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.759> you

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:26.060 
firmly set on each major
yeah<00:06:21.139> you<00:06:21.289> know<00:06:21.409> see<00:06:21.470> we<00:06:21.800> can<00:06:21.919> do

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.310 

I<00:06:26.130> think<00:06:26.820> Paris<00:06:27.150> sport<00:06:27.420> in<00:06:27.540> general<00:06:27.750> is<00:06:28.260> just

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
I think Paris sport in general is just

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.040 
I think Paris sport in general is just
snow<00:06:28.740> balled<00:06:29.040> you<00:06:29.430> know<00:06:29.550> since<00:06:29.880> then<00:06:30.210> since<00:06:30.870> I

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
snow balled you know since then since I

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.870 
snow balled you know since then since I
was<00:06:31.200> put<00:06:31.380> on<00:06:31.410> the<00:06:31.560> team<00:06:31.740> at<00:06:31.860> 40<00:06:32.250> in<00:06:32.370> every<00:06:32.610> year

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
was put on the team at 40 in every year

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.000 
was put on the team at 40 in every year
there's<00:06:33.300> been<00:06:33.360> more<00:06:33.630> and<00:06:33.690> more<00:06:33.840> publicity<00:06:34.500> and

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
there's been more and more publicity and

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.430 
there's been more and more publicity and
I<00:06:35.160> think<00:06:35.370> for<00:06:35.580> UK<00:06:36.240> and<00:06:36.540> the<00:06:37.020> fact<00:06:37.200> that<00:06:37.230> we<00:06:37.350> had

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
I think for UK and the fact that we had

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.650 
I think for UK and the fact that we had
the<00:06:37.590> London<00:06:37.890> Games<00:06:38.040> last<00:06:38.400> year<00:06:38.670> it's<00:06:39.270> given<00:06:39.570> it

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
the London Games last year it's given it

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.710 
the London Games last year it's given it
such<00:06:39.840> a<00:06:39.870> massive<00:06:40.350> boost<00:06:40.560> and<00:06:41.040> you<00:06:41.880> know<00:06:42.180> I'm

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
such a massive boost and you know I'm

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.030 
such a massive boost and you know I'm
not<00:06:42.840> the<00:06:42.990> most<00:06:43.140> politically<00:06:43.500> correct<00:06:43.590> person

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
not the most politically correct person

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.890 
not the most politically correct person
so<00:06:44.400> if<00:06:44.490> what<00:06:44.850> I<00:06:44.880> say<00:06:45.090> nose<00:06:45.330> out<00:06:45.510> of<00:06:45.540> term<00:06:45.750> I

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
so if what I say nose out of term I

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.170 
so if what I say nose out of term I
apologize<00:06:46.410> but<00:06:46.710> I<00:06:46.980> think<00:06:47.550> Paralympic<00:06:48.030> Games
