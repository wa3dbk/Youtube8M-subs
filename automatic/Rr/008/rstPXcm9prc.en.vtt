00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
normally you take food waste and you

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.740 
normally you take food waste and you
make<00:00:34.430> into<00:00:34.640> compost<00:00:34.940> and<00:00:35.240> that's<00:00:35.390> all<00:00:35.540> very

futuristic here and actually extracting
the<00:00:40.430> energy<00:00:40.820> out<00:00:40.910> of<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.060> what's<00:00:41.300> amazing<00:00:41.960> is

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
the energy out of it what's amazing is

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.990 
the energy out of it what's amazing is
that<00:00:42.350> this<00:00:42.829> stuff<00:00:43.070> it's<00:00:43.340> like<00:00:43.520> a<00:00:43.550> massive

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
that this stuff it's like a massive

00:00:44.000 --> 00:01:01.240 
that this stuff it's like a massive
stomach<00:00:44.570> it's<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:45.140> huge<00:00:45.620> stomach<00:00:46.010> in<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.700> shed<00:01:00.250> so

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
stomach it's a huge stomach in a shed so

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:10.050 
stomach it's a huge stomach in a shed so
how<00:01:01.670> do<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:02.329> build<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:02.750> farm

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.310 

bringing<00:01:11.060> kids<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:11.510> somewhere<00:01:11.780> like<00:01:11.840> this<00:01:12.080> is

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
bringing kids to somewhere like this is

bringing kids to somewhere like this is
a<00:01:12.940> genius<00:01:13.940> idea<00:01:14.150> because<00:01:14.900> what's<00:01:15.860> happening

a genius idea because what's happening
to<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:16.490> food<00:01:16.700> waste<00:01:16.970> that<00:01:17.180> we<00:01:17.390> chuck<00:01:17.690> away

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
to the food waste that we chuck away

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.030 
to the food waste that we chuck away
normally<00:01:18.229> is<00:01:18.350> it<00:01:18.470> doesn't<00:01:18.650> just<00:01:18.860> disappear

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
normally is it doesn't just disappear

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.080 
normally is it doesn't just disappear
into<00:01:19.580> landfill<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:20.630> gets<00:01:20.900> digested<00:01:21.880> in<00:01:22.880> here

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
into landfill it gets digested in here

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.109 
into landfill it gets digested in here
it<00:01:23.960> gets<00:01:24.080> turned<00:01:24.470> into<00:01:25.010> farts<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:25.640> poo

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
it gets turned into farts and poo

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.910 
it gets turned into farts and poo
now<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:26.450> can<00:01:26.840> simply<00:01:27.140> like<00:01:27.290> about<00:01:27.530> about

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
now you can simply like about about

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.430 
now you can simply like about about
being<00:01:28.220> polite<00:01:28.760> about<00:01:29.090> about<00:01:29.450> food<00:01:29.750> but<00:01:30.200> that's

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
being polite about about food but that's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.899 
being polite about about food but that's
what<00:01:30.710> happens<00:01:31.040> inside<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:31.580> at<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.700> same

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
what happens inside you so at the same

what happens inside you so at the same
time<00:01:32.240> as<00:01:32.510> showing<00:01:33.140> them<00:01:33.290> that<00:01:33.409> they<00:01:33.470> should<00:01:33.680> be

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
time as showing them that they should be

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.020 
time as showing them that they should be
recycling<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:34.460> is<00:01:34.520> what<00:01:34.640> should<00:01:34.820> happen

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
recycling and this is what should happen

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.149 
recycling and this is what should happen
to<00:01:35.210> our<00:01:35.450> waste<00:01:35.630> materials<00:01:36.049> they<00:01:36.560> are<00:01:36.799> learning

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
to our waste materials they are learning

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.250 
to our waste materials they are learning
about<00:01:37.970> what's<00:01:38.240> happening<00:01:38.600> inside<00:01:38.720> their<00:01:39.140> own

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
about what's happening inside their own

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.170 
about what's happening inside their own
bodies<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:39.619> about<00:01:39.830> why<00:01:40.369> they<00:01:40.640> food<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:41.060> what

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
bodies and about why they food and what

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.550 
bodies and about why they food and what
people<00:01:41.510> are<00:01:41.630> always<00:01:41.720> banging<00:01:42.049> on<00:01:42.229> about<00:01:42.260> when

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
people are always banging on about when

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.469 
people are always banging on about when
they<00:01:42.619> talk<00:01:42.799> about<00:01:42.830> energy<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:43.520> foods<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.880> think

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
they talk about energy and foods I think

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.820 
they talk about energy and foods I think
it's<00:01:44.630> not<00:01:44.810> just<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:45.140> great<00:01:45.290> way<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:45.470> teach<00:01:45.710> about

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
it's not just a great way to teach about

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.679 
it's not just a great way to teach about
recycling<00:01:46.460> it's<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.909> great<00:01:47.119> way<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.270> teach

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
recycling it's a great way to teach

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.960

about nutrition and health and digestion

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.330 
about nutrition and health and digestion
and<00:01:50.240> concepts<00:01:50.630> like<00:01:50.720> obesity<00:01:51.110> because<00:01:51.619> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
and concepts like obesity because the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.160 
and concepts like obesity because the
energy<00:01:52.790> coming<00:01:52.970> out<00:01:53.090> of<00:01:53.180> this<00:01:53.270> is<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.720> energy

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
energy coming out of this is the energy

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.260 
energy coming out of this is the energy
in<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.710> food<00:01:54.890> that<00:01:54.920> we<00:01:55.159> that<00:01:55.430> we<00:01:55.640> get<00:01:55.939> to<00:01:56.150> be

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
in the food that we that we get to be

in the food that we that we get to be
enable<00:01:56.750> us<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:57.350> run<00:01:57.560> around<00:01:57.650> anyway<00:01:58.040> so

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100
