these<00:00:09.000> for<00:00:09.450> my<00:00:09.690> Honda<00:00:10.559> Element

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
these for my Honda Element

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.680 
these for my Honda Element
so<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.660> brakes<00:00:13.019> here<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.790> DP<00:00:14.790> six<00:00:15.150> seven<00:00:15.509> eight

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
so the brakes here is DP six seven eight

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.429 
so the brakes here is DP six seven eight
one<00:00:16.820> -<00:00:17.820> -<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.650> let<00:00:19.800> me<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:19.920> open<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.609> up<00:00:20.760> here

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
one - - so let me just open it up here

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.970 
one - - so let me just open it up here
and<00:00:24.560> and<00:00:25.730> again<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.980> rotors

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
and and again just just like the rotors

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.339 
and and again just just like the rotors
that<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.220> got<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.939> are<00:00:30.060> EBC<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.689> got<00:00:31.140> these

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
that I got that are EBC I got these

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.540 
that I got that are EBC I got these
mainly<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.579> safety<00:00:32.969> reasons<00:00:33.360> um<00:00:34.430> you<00:00:35.430> know

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
mainly for safety reasons um you know

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.600 
mainly for safety reasons um you know
that<00:00:35.820> they<00:00:36.540> work<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> rotors<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:38.430> also

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
that they work with the rotors but also

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.110 
that they work with the rotors but also
if<00:00:39.030> if<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.840> could<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.770> break<00:00:41.190> an<00:00:41.460> inch<00:00:41.910> or

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
if if I could you know break an inch or

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.920 
if if I could you know break an inch or
two<00:00:42.270> earlier<00:00:43.730> it's<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:45.000> well<00:00:45.239> worth<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.780> in

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
two earlier it's it's well worth it in

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.110 
two earlier it's it's well worth it in
emergency<00:00:46.800> situations<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.700> once<00:00:48.450> again

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
emergency situations and once again

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.610 
emergency situations and once again
people<00:00:51.120> might<00:00:51.390> think<00:00:51.420> these<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:51.840> more

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
people might think these are more

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.350 
people might think these are more
expensive<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.460> worth<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.120> in

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
expensive and not worth it but in

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.540 
expensive and not worth it but in
reality<00:00:54.390> when<00:00:55.199> when<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.590> buy<00:00:55.739> your<00:00:55.949> own<00:00:55.980> parts

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
reality when when you buy your own parts

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.660 
reality when when you buy your own parts
and<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.629> ask<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.230> mechanic<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.010> put<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.430> it's

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and you ask a mechanic to put it on it's

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.460 
and you ask a mechanic to put it on it's
I<00:00:59.989> find<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.460> cheaper<00:01:02.460> then<00:01:03.120> if<00:01:03.629> you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
I find it to be cheaper then if you

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.130 
I find it to be cheaper then if you
actually<00:01:05.119> just<00:01:06.119> bought<00:01:06.360> their<00:01:06.540> whole<00:01:06.720> package

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
actually just bought their whole package

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:16.600 
actually just bought their whole package
so<00:01:08.390> here's<00:01:09.390> here's<00:01:09.720> what<00:01:09.990> comes<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:14.420> let<00:01:15.420> me

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
so here's here's what comes with let me

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.999 
so here's here's what comes with let me
let<00:01:17.610> me<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:18.570> what's<00:01:18.750> out<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> box<00:01:19.380> so

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
let me get what's out of the box so

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:36.240 
let me get what's out of the box so
there's<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:21.170> brakes<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.530> brake<00:01:23.009> pads

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.510 

and<00:01:37.250> I'll<00:01:37.370> show<00:01:37.580> these<00:01:37.790> a<00:01:37.820> close<00:01:38.630> up<00:01:38.840> later

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
and I'll show these a close up later

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.870 
and I'll show these a close up later
just<00:01:40.520> wanna<00:01:40.700> do<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.180> unboxing<00:01:41.300> first<00:01:44.710> and

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
just wanna do the unboxing first and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.210 
just wanna do the unboxing first and
these<00:01:46.880> are<00:01:47.150> made<00:01:48.110> of<00:01:48.260> some<00:01:48.500> type<00:01:48.710> of<00:01:48.740> semi

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
these are made of some type of semi

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.570 
these are made of some type of semi
metallic<00:01:49.760> material<00:01:50.710> they're<00:01:51.710> not<00:01:51.890> ceramic

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
metallic material they're not ceramic

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.280 
metallic material they're not ceramic
but<00:01:53.030> at<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.510> same<00:01:53.660> time<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:55.640> really<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:56.240> has<00:01:57.110> to

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
but at the same time it really is has to

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.870 
but at the same time it really is has to
do<00:01:57.440> with<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.710> quality<00:01:58.160> and<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.340> mix<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.790> the

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
do with the quality and the mix of the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.310 
do with the quality and the mix of the
material<00:01:59.420> more<00:01:59.660> so<00:01:59.900> than<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.200> material

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
material more so than the material

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:18.970 
material more so than the material
itself<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:07.750> basically<00:02:15.220> just<00:02:17.980> instructions

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
itself and basically just instructions

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.690 
itself and basically just instructions
so<00:02:19.430> let<00:02:19.640> me<00:02:19.840> get<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.870> close-up<00:02:21.440> of<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.950> brake

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
so let me get a close-up of the brake

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:51.720 
so let me get a close-up of the brake
pads<00:02:23.420> themselves<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:29.950> that's<00:02:30.950> how<00:02:31.250> they<00:02:31.520> look

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:09.839 

try<00:02:52.210> to<00:02:52.270> get<00:02:52.480> all<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.810> sides<00:02:53.110> here<00:02:53.500> for<00:02:53.770> you

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:21.620 

and<00:03:10.390> what<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.749> angles

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:04:19.910 

and<00:03:21.840> again<00:03:22.470> these<00:03:22.650> are<00:03:22.710> the<00:03:22.920> rare<00:03:23.190> breaks

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.340

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
really the rear brakes there all right

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.010 
really the rear brakes there all right
thank<00:04:25.140> you<00:04:25.200> for<00:04:25.290> watching
