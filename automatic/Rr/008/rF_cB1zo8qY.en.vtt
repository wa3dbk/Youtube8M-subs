have to have their vehicles changed and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.559 
have to have their vehicles changed and
that<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.369> want<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.759> places<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.360> we

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
that is that we want to go places and we

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.570 
that is that we want to go places and we
actually<00:02:09.720> put<00:02:10.110> all<00:02:10.289> our<00:02:10.319> kit<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.039> vehicle

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
actually put all our kit in the vehicle

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.790 
actually put all our kit in the vehicle
itself<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.629> we<00:02:12.840> need<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.500> in

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
itself so we need to in

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.530 
itself so we need to in
increase<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.220> suspension<00:02:14.850> lift<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.510> that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
increase the suspension lift so that

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.540 
increase the suspension lift so that
when<00:02:15.810> we're<00:02:16.020> fully<00:02:16.290> loaded<00:02:16.620> we<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.400> actually

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
when we're fully loaded we can actually

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.910 
when we're fully loaded we can actually
come<00:02:17.970> back<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.360> where<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.630> ought<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:18.960> this

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
come back to where we ought to be this

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.830
