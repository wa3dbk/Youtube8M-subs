00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
difficult because I'm going to put jumps

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.710 
difficult because I'm going to put jumps
in<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:58.980> well<00:01:59.210> something's<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> make<00:02:00.540> me

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720

in as well something's going to make me
counter<00:02:01.170> over<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.560> jump<00:02:01.910> try<00:02:02.910> to<00:02:02.970> get<00:02:03.210> him<00:02:03.300> to

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
counter over the jump try to get him to

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.300 
counter over the jump try to get him to
trot<00:02:03.690> after<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.140> jump<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.680> trot<00:02:05.010> over<00:02:05.040> the

poles and then counter again to jump to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.380 
poles and then counter again to jump to
the<00:02:07.410> last<00:02:07.650> list<00:02:07.890> jump<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.460> this<00:02:09.179> can

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the last list jump and this can

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.330 
the last list jump and this can
sometimes<00:02:09.630> be<00:02:09.840> very<00:02:10.410> difficult<00:02:10.619> because<00:02:10.979> once

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
sometimes be very difficult because once

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.400 
sometimes be very difficult because once
you're<00:02:11.550> jumping<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.300> horses<00:02:12.810> wants<00:02:13.260> to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
you're jumping the horses wants to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.460 
you're jumping the horses wants to
counter<00:02:13.800> but<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:16.140> make<00:02:16.320> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
counter but this is just to to make the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.520 
counter but this is just to to make the
horses<00:02:16.860> listen<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:17.970> it's<00:02:18.270> it's<00:02:19.260> really

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
be trotting in the ring but it's just to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.800

it's thanks to me starting with the
pulse

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
pulse

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.950 
pulse
quietly<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:47.000> only<00:03:47.210> doing<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.570> trotting

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.700 
before should have strayed away have
gone<00:03:49.490> to<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.240> jump<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:50.870> asked<00:03:51.230> him<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.380> trot

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
gone to the jump and asked him to trot

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.470 
gone to the jump and asked him to trot
he<00:03:51.860> probably<00:03:52.070> would<00:03:52.310> have<00:03:52.340> tried<00:03:52.550> in<00:03:53.180> his

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
he probably would have tried in his

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.910 
he probably would have tried in his
counter<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:53.990> jump<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.380> whole<00:03:54.500> thing<00:03:54.770> with

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
counter to jump the whole thing with

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.860 
counter to jump the whole thing with
pulse<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.340> then<00:03:55.460> jump<00:03:55.670> the<00:03:55.820> last<00:03:56.030> one<00:03:56.270> he's<00:03:56.840> a

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
pulse and then jump the last one he's a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.420 
pulse and then jump the last one he's a
show<00:03:57.110> jumper<00:03:57.470> so<00:03:57.590> he<00:03:57.680> should<00:03:57.830> think<00:03:58.070> like<00:03:58.220> this

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
show jumper so he should think like this

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.550 
show jumper so he should think like this
but<00:03:58.640> today<00:03:59.510> we're<00:03:59.840> training<00:04:00.080> something

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
but today we're training something

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:12.480 
but today we're training something
differently<00:04:00.950> oh<00:04:06.100> haha<00:04:09.100> make<00:04:10.100> a<00:04:10.130> circle<00:04:10.640> again

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
differently oh haha make a circle again

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.580 
differently oh haha make a circle again
that<00:04:13.120> made<00:04:13.300> it<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.540> little<00:04:13.750> bit<00:04:13.960> more<00:04:14.140> difficult

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
that made it a little bit more difficult

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.770 
that made it a little bit more difficult
I'll<00:04:15.340> do<00:04:15.520> it<00:04:15.610> again<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:16.060> I<00:04:16.120> move<00:04:16.330> up<00:04:16.450> speed<00:04:16.750> a

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
I'll do it again and I move up speed a

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.230 
I'll do it again and I move up speed a
little<00:04:16.959> bit<00:04:19.709> so<00:04:20.709> this<00:04:20.920> is<00:04:21.100> his<00:04:21.459> plan<00:04:21.730> to<00:04:21.970> do<00:04:22.090> the

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240
