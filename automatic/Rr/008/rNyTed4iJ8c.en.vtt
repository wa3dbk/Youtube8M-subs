that<00:01:04.140> had<00:01:04.320> fallen<00:01:04.559> off<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.400> able<00:01:05.610> to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
that had fallen off so I was able to

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.899 
that had fallen off so I was able to
repurpose<00:01:06.659> them<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.260> reuse<00:01:07.439> them<00:01:07.560> with<00:01:08.549> my

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.700 
repurpose them and reuse them with my
buttons<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.720> think<00:01:09.930> they<00:01:10.020> turned<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.380> so

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710

and here are completed button hair ties
and<00:03:07.549> clips<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.299> think<00:03:08.810> they<00:03:08.900> turned<00:03:08.959> out<00:03:09.260> so

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
and clips I think they turned out so

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.740 
and clips I think they turned out so
cute<00:03:09.980> my<00:03:10.219> favorite<00:03:10.609> one<00:03:10.760> has<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.209> be<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.569> one

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
cute my favorite one has to be the one

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.209 
cute my favorite one has to be the one
on<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:12.019> bottom<00:03:12.140> of<00:03:12.530> course<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:13.010> most

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:13.219 
on the bottom of course the most

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.190 
on the bottom of course the most
difficult<00:03:13.700> one<00:03:13.849> to<00:03:14.030> make<00:03:14.209> but<00:03:14.689> I<00:03:14.719> think<00:03:14.959> it<00:03:15.079> was

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
difficult one to make but I think it was

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.110 
difficult one to make but I think it was
totally<00:03:15.709> worth<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:16.069> extra<00:03:16.219> time<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.700> make<00:03:17.090> it

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
totally worth the extra time to make it

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.709 
totally worth the extra time to make it
