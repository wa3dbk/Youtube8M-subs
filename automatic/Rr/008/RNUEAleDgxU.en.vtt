00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.080 
realism I found it quite disturbing at
different<00:02:16.500> parts<00:02:16.709> not<00:02:17.160> just<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.640> romantic

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
different parts not just the romantic

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.490 
different parts not just the romantic
scenes<00:02:18.330> although<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.630> did<00:02:18.900> have<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.050> find<00:02:19.380> this

scenes although I did have to find this
quite<00:02:19.650> disturbing<00:02:20.040> but<00:02:20.220> again<00:02:20.430> like<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.670> say

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
quite disturbing but again like I say

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.080 
quite disturbing but again like I say
I'm<00:02:20.880> quite<00:02:21.060> brutish<00:02:21.390> but<00:02:21.930> also<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:23.090> graphic

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
I'm quite brutish but also the graphic

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.990 
I'm quite brutish but also the graphic
pneus<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.770> what<00:02:25.770> happens<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.400> trenches<00:02:26.850> it

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
pneus of what happens in the trenches it

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.170 
pneus of what happens in the trenches it

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
for quite a while what but I'm thinking

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.240 
for quite a while what but I'm thinking
about<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:33.420> making<00:02:33.720> me<00:02:33.840> quite<00:02:34.050> it's<00:02:34.950> very

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
about it it's making me quite it's very

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.090 
about it it's making me quite it's very
detailed<00:02:35.700> not<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.120> /<00:02:36.630> graphic<00:02:36.930> way<00:02:37.380> but<00:02:37.709> just

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
detailed not in / graphic way but just

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.630 
detailed not in / graphic way but just
in<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.310> very<00:02:39.080> powerfully<00:02:40.080> literal<00:02:40.739> stance<00:02:41.310> on

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
in a very powerfully literal stance on

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.850 
in a very powerfully literal stance on
the<00:02:42.090> subject<00:02:42.239> matter<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.410> can't<00:02:43.680> be

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
the subject matter and it can't be

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.979 
the subject matter and it can't be
ignored<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.610> that's<00:02:45.120> what<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.480> think<00:02:45.540> makes<00:02:45.840> us

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
ignored and that's what I think makes us

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.930 
ignored and that's what I think makes us
noble<00:02:46.230> quite<00:02:46.440> powerful<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.100> ending<00:02:47.610> of

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
noble quite powerful the ending of

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
Stevens experience in the trenches is

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.330 
Stevens experience in the trenches is
really<00:02:51.390> politically<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.440> poetically

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
really politically and poetically

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.340 
really politically and poetically
beautiful<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.540> cannot<00:02:54.780> emphasize<00:02:55.050> enough

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
beautiful and I cannot emphasize enough

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.540 
beautiful and I cannot emphasize enough
that<00:02:55.830> it's<00:02:56.370> really<00:02:56.880> worth<00:02:57.620> just<00:02:58.620> sitting

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
that it's really worth just sitting
