00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hi all today at super 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.040
 happy to find you in a 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.170
 new video to introduce you to three 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.570
 techniques that I often do for myself 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.400
 curly hair without heat so I'm 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.750
 do his hairstyles during the night and the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.309
 morning frozen facts I have hair 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.540
 curly 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.699
 so I can get three types of 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.740
 different loops more or less tight 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.210
 I'll let you watch more then 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.119
 the first hairstyle is going to be 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.830
 pretty loose ripples and so for that 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.809
 you will need a jump to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.640
 the transparent elastic first we take 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.160
 a separation on the aude of the head and one 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.440
 starts a very simple at this level 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.510
 we add a lock to each section 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.590
 hair to make a truce that me 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.590
 I call African 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.520
 then we continue in the same way 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.970
 until we have more meeschart 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.970
 added 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.979
 from that moment on we continue in 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.150
 13 basic 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.740
 do not hesitate to pass it on a 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.780
 side so it's easier to 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.250
 to achieve or if you have a sore arm 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.250
 was also much more practical 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.280
 think about and as high as possible for 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.540
 that your spikes do not stay smooth 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.540
 when you pick up the address 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.679
 the next day I gently undo and 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.679
 this is the result 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.530
 you can obviously lake and for 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.680
 that it absolutely holds all the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.480
 day the second hairstyle and on the 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.480
 same principle but the ripples 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.520
 will be much tighter then first 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.530
 we split our hair into two sections to 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.270
 about the same, you have the task of 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.270
 on it so that it does not bother us 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.330
 you then make an African braid 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.950
 as I showed for the hairstyle 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.170
 number one if you do not have a lot of 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.060
 hair or if like me you do not have 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.060
 enormously a basic braid will suffice 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.420
 always thought to go the farthest 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.980
 possible for it to make 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.250
 ripples up to the tip of your 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.250
 hair 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.360
 one of the tasks then the part 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.190
 superior and have reproduced the same 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.500
 process only for the first hairstyle 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.620
 that is to say, an African braid where 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.060
 add one strand to each strand before 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.060
 pass it on the other side 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.750
 this is the result when we are done the 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.640
 13 and so what I love in this 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.760
 hairstyle is we really have a max 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.170
 volume the last hairstyle allows 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.170
 to have real curl in the hair 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.249
 so first we share our 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.560
 hair in two sections I take 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:00.749
 first one from the top and I'm going to twister 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.269
 the hair makes the tours the 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:04.400
 wick for the bun to be very 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.569
 easily 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.519
 you have to be careful that it is well 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.609
 tight for the hair to take on 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.170
 fold and be curled the next day 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.760
 be careful not to bend the tip 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.979
 hair by tying them because 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.539
 it would break the end and it would not 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.049
 very nice when we remove 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.049
 elastic 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.360
 we then reproduce exactly the same 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.250
 process for the bottom section and one 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.250
 tie with a simple elastic 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:57.869
 and that's the result when I undo the 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:59.279
 so we're actually doing what I like in 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:00.989
 this one is that it's really 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:08.339
 natural it looks like it's 

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:09.359
 completely natural loops so here is 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:11.039
 it was not techniques 

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:13.979
 revolutionary I think you 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.179
 knew but I wanted to make a 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.649
 video since it's really the 

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:19.259
 techniques that I use every day 

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:21.479
 and I do not curl the hair only 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.039
 with this one I find that these 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.749
 practices because in the morning we just have 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.039
 to remove the hairstyle and we did not 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:28.139
 tried it's hair or if it's 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.489
 looped it takes two seconds I 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.339
 just to take care of my wick 

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:33.089
 either there high schools or did not do it and 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.949
 It's over 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:36.299
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.659
 I make short kisses and I tell you to 

00:05:36.299 --> 00:05:39.199
 soon 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.199
 bye
