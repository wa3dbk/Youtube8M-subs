00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.529
 the institute of internal auditors 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:08.050
 organized his twenty-seventh day and 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.750
 under the motto inspirational time leaves 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.210
 fly your ideas your guest star does not 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.580
 It could be none other than Carlos Soria 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.220
 mountaineer from Avila reviewed his last 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.260
 expeditions in the Himalayas highlighting 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.770
 all that has befallen him since 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.720
 He turned 70 years old there Carlos Soria returned 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.140
 to demonstrate his great capacity for work 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.140
 of perseverance and also of sense 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.379
 of humor these two photos of the year 79 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.870
 and in the year 2000, 30 years apart 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.460
 it's the first time that Spaniards were going 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.640
 to the baltoro glacier to try a 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.739
 Ochomil and of course I already see that shoulders 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.019
 I have arms and baby and in the other that 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.929
 sideburns there with horrible ankles 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.149
 but with the same illusion or even more 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:55.420
 and more effectively the first time the year 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.219
 79 thirty years before we went to a 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.039
 mountain we did not get to climb and in this 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.989
 I did my project and I went up that 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.670
 mountain also as a source of 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.500
 inspiration for many people 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.640
 Carlos awarded the more than 500 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.800
 participants 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.110
 the key that you have applied so much in your 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.630
 mountaineer facet as in his stage of 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.960
 upholsterer as well now in his life 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.030
 of retired me now to train me 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.250
 I get up at 6 in the morning I would not have 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.780
 why but I do it because why not 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.900
 the phone rings at 6 in the morning 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.360
 until 11 does not sound like that and also I 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.250
 I used to think that the great efforts 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.110
 I usually do early when I'm 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.060
 in the mountains and I'm going to climb high 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.770
 we went to the best of a camp 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.840
 the four the morning everything is doing it with 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.170
 common sense and think about what you're 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.360
 making the risk to minimize him at 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.979
 limit in what is the same in the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.780
 business that in whatever there is that 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.580
 take on some risk because if you do not 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.820
 you stay for or not but to the limit and 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.399
 studying well the whys the cons 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.320
 and the threads and the things in favor that 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.110
 have if you do it one way or another 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.000
 common sense in the background not illusion by 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.509
 do things right as I said before 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.149
 little more with 73 years and an experience 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.280
 unequaled carlos's life example 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.769
 soria extends to all sectors 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.799
 of society both Spanish and 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.799
 international 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.460
 thank you very much
