these good for you these are great for

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.390 
these good for you these are great for
say<00:01:03.239> your<00:01:03.390> TV<00:01:03.780> remote<00:01:04.189> especially<00:01:05.189> if<00:01:05.280> your

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
say your TV remote especially if your

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.250 
say your TV remote especially if your
remote<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.909> through<00:01:06.150> your<00:01:06.240> cable<00:01:06.479> company<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
remote is through your cable company and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.609 
remote is through your cable company and
the<00:01:08.220> remote<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.750> rented<00:01:09.750> essentially<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.530> if

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the remote is rented essentially so if

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.289 
the remote is rented essentially so if
the<00:01:10.740> batteries<00:01:11.100> leak<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.549> no<00:01:11.700> big<00:01:11.909> deal<00:01:11.939> you

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
the batteries leak it's no big deal you

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.820 
the batteries leak it's no big deal you
just<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> new<00:01:12.840> remote<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.500> too<00:01:13.680> bad

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
just get a new remote and it's too bad

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.820 
just get a new remote and it's too bad
on<00:01:14.010> them<00:01:14.509> these<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.689> working<00:01:15.960> flashlights<00:01:16.590> as

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
on them these are working flashlights as

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.010 
on them these are working flashlights as
well<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.520> don't<00:01:17.700> want<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.030> use<00:01:18.240> these<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.509> any

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
well you don't want to use these in any

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.380 
well you don't want to use these in any
sort<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.409> high<00:01:19.650> current<00:01:20.340> application<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
sort of high current application like a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.240 
sort of high current application like a
digital<00:01:21.630> camera<00:01:22.080> these<00:01:22.740> aren't<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.159> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
digital camera these aren't going to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.770 
digital camera these aren't going to
work<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> takes<00:01:23.970> too<00:01:24.210> much<00:01:24.330> current<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
work and it takes too much current to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.950 
work and it takes too much current to
run<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.259> they<00:01:25.799> simply<00:01:26.220> can't<00:01:26.460> provide<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
run it and they simply can't provide it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.179 
run it and they simply can't provide it
also<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.259> use<00:01:28.320> these<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.920> flashlight

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
also if you use these in a flashlight

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.490 
also if you use these in a flashlight
they<00:01:29.610> will<00:01:29.820> work<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.840> what<00:01:30.990> will<00:01:31.079> happen<00:01:31.110> is

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
they will work but what will happen is

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.130 
they will work but what will happen is
it'll<00:01:31.650> seem<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.040> go<00:01:32.159> dead<00:01:32.400> very<00:01:32.610> quickly<00:01:33.140> if

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
it'll seem to go dead very quickly if

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.990 
it'll seem to go dead very quickly if
you<00:01:34.350> then<00:01:34.560> turn<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.009> flashlight<00:01:35.280> off<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
you then turn the flashlight off and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.399 
you then turn the flashlight off and
leave<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.479> while<00:01:36.540> when<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.110> put<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
leave it for a while when you put it

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.830 
leave it for a while when you put it
back<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.799> later<00:01:38.100> it'll<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:39.090> brighter<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.750> they

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
back on later it'll be brighter so they

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.870 
back on later it'll be brighter so they
can't<00:01:40.110> deliver<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.770> amount<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.220> current<00:01:41.579> for

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
can't deliver that amount of current for

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.600 
can't deliver that amount of current for
a<00:01:42.119> particularly<00:01:42.810> long<00:01:43.110> time<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:44.369> still

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
a particularly long time but still

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.460 
a particularly long time but still
definitely<00:01:44.939> great<00:01:45.420> for<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:45.750> TV<00:01:45.990> remotes

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
definitely great for your TV remotes

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.490 
definitely great for your TV remotes
things<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:48.060> are<00:01:48.180> used<00:01:48.420> often<00:01:48.780> enough<00:01:49.200> but

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
things that are used often enough but

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.770 
things that are used often enough but
