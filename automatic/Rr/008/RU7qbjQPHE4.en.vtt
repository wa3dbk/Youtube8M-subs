 and further the old real old team crawls 9 as it is hot than to win more 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.019
 than the herbs but once tasty is a cross the garlic like 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.989

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.649
 herbs 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.359
 especially the afterwards seasoning we are going to start with just the steak 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.359
 little oil in the pan 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150
 not to film a little butter 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.010
 and then the first child 6 it is furnished 3 takes about ten minutes 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.929
 He arrived last week, but this time it is a bit 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.210
 bigger problem is that not set but because the ten minutes 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.090
 because you understand that in trays and I can make them very cool very simply 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.750
 source and these are bones to load 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.410

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.410
 very easy 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.400
 Another one 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.820
 And then very cool way to get cucumbers is to put the cucumber in garlands 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.080
 instead of just cutting watson with a peeler whole cool strings 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.480
 na tora bora donors 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.090
 and mix everything nicely 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.180
 to turn the gap between the vlis once on the other side to active 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.990
 her husband 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.020
 and they walk 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.020
 nice in the corner on the plates 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.960
 sell perfect 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.620
 you also see very tasty 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 that is sad and also lies here 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.310
 so won at 180 degrees 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.880
 until he is beautiful the golden yellow 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.529
 Fred is for an explanation 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:10.750
 from me you can still see some kind 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.510
 here you have one or more times the park will be an extra few minutes 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.750
 to literally lay it out and let it rest I know it's always better that 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.999
 Learn to draw the city into therapy 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:25.379
 in particular the pan quenching a little red wine than what will make us fat first 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.069
 shoot away a bit 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.699
 the excess fat 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.129
 what a taste is in the pan and then and how you tear rotterdam 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.679
 and therefore a minute later must be purchased 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:42.679
 meanwhile, to be most fit you think the veterans are wreathing 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:48.059
 but here again a child 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.239
 church the city is also under pressure 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.350
 as a kind of very small doll 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.590
 so no longer in the wrong direction, then you will see that but this will not last too long either 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.460
 let the cup boil if you pan the purmer then they go from the wharf 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.849
 reduce yourself 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.849
 leaving little white aside twitter his customers 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.719
 conrad and drain 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:16.369
 and then won with rides 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.369
 on the boat 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.569
 and now could mix herbs 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.849
 lunging and roasted garlic 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.359
 and that it is only perfect for cycling bart van doorne salt 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:33.489
 by scattering the perpetrator in class 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.689
 then you also get the warmth of the fries 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.759
 now covered that the herbs come out of the herb butter 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:43.849
 and different as is 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.849
 we keep the plus on the signs 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.609
 and then season with 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.969
 garlic 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.119
 and forest 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:01.269
 and you can see the forest hut is our team and the woodlander who fitted perfectly with meat 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.539
 with all types of meat actually 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:07.359
 that is getting us 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.789
 and now fixed 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.489
 just a little bit like 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.569
 on the meat side 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.719
 what of course 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:18.049
 it can be this simple with flu but it is quite different 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:18.720
 absolute top
