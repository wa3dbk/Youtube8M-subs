this<00:00:00.299> is<00:00:00.510> these<00:00:00.750> two<00:00:00.989> pendous<00:00:01.319> way<00:00:01.469> forth<00:00:01.829> a

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
this is these two pendous way forth a

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.400 
this is these two pendous way forth a
video<00:00:02.250> today<00:00:02.669> and<00:00:02.939> this<00:00:03.570> one<00:00:03.840> we're<00:00:04.020> going<00:00:04.200> to

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
video today and this one we're going to

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.550 
video today and this one we're going to
be<00:00:04.529> talking<00:00:04.799> about<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.970> metry<00:00:06.540> acanthus<00:00:07.140> aris

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
be talking about the metry acanthus aris

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.520 
be talking about the metry acanthus aris
that<00:00:08.550> will<00:00:08.940> be<00:00:09.150> appearing<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.780> Jurassic<00:00:10.290> world

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
that will be appearing in Jurassic world

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.400 
that will be appearing in Jurassic world
now<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.280> reason<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:12.179> love<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.990> pic<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.200> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
now the reason I love the pic of the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.919 
now the reason I love the pic of the
metric<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.130> Tsarist<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.730> because<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:15.690> have

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
metric and Tsarist is because we have

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.010 
metric and Tsarist is because we have
our<00:00:16.350> larger<00:00:17.160> dinosaurs<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.480> been<00:00:18.660> set

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
our larger dinosaurs that have been set

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.210 
our larger dinosaurs that have been set
up<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:20.160> our<00:00:20.840> medium-sized<00:00:21.840> well<00:00:22.230> on

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
up and we have our medium-sized well on

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.769 
up and we have our medium-sized well on
the<00:00:23.490> smaller<00:00:23.789> side<00:00:24.119> like<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
the smaller side like with the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.870 
the smaller side like with the
velociraptors<00:00:25.619> being<00:00:25.830> around<00:00:26.039> six<00:00:26.400> feet<00:00:26.490> tall

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
velociraptors being around six feet tall

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.169 
velociraptors being around six feet tall
and<00:00:27.119> around<00:00:28.050> ten<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.680> twelve<00:00:28.949> feet<00:00:29.039> long<00:00:29.429> but

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
and around ten to twelve feet long but

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.330 
and around ten to twelve feet long but
the<00:00:30.359> Metra<00:00:30.689> acanthus<00:00:31.170> horas<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.800> somewhere<00:00:32.160> in

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the Metra acanthus horas is somewhere in

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.850 
the Metra acanthus horas is somewhere in
between<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.940> around<00:00:33.210> 12<00:00:33.690> feet<00:00:33.899> tall<00:00:34.110> which

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
between it's around 12 feet tall which

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.100 
between it's around 12 feet tall which
is<00:00:34.890> shorter<00:00:35.579> than<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> t-rex<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.570> it's

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
is shorter than the t-rex and it's

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.910 
is shorter than the t-rex and it's
around<00:00:37.290> 28<00:00:37.829> feet<00:00:38.100> long<00:00:38.129> which<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.530> not<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.710> long

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
around 28 feet long which is not as long

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.560 
around 28 feet long which is not as long
as<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.190> t-rex<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:41.879> still<00:00:42.090> bigger<00:00:42.360> than

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
as the t-rex but it's still bigger than

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.319 
as the t-rex but it's still bigger than
the<00:00:42.750> Raptor<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.070> finds<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.640> happy<00:00:45.059> middle

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the Raptor so it finds this happy middle

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.940 
the Raptor so it finds this happy middle
ground<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.530> that

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
ground and I really like that

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.459 
ground and I really like that
now<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.670> dinosaur<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.660> probably<00:00:48.989> what<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
now this dinosaur is probably what the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.310 
now this dinosaur is probably what the
size<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> thought<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.809> original

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
size of what I thought the original

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.100 
size of what I thought the original
diable<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.860> Rex<00:00:53.100> would<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.750> until<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:54.870> learned

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
diable is Rex would be until we learned

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.830 
diable is Rex would be until we learned
that<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> was<00:00:55.710> much<00:00:55.980> much<00:00:56.219> larger<00:00:56.579> than<00:00:57.149> we

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that it was much much larger than we

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.860 
that it was much much larger than we
actually<00:00:58.020> assumed<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.949> was<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.180> guy<00:01:00.420> I

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
actually assumed it was but this guy I

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.049 
actually assumed it was but this guy I
think<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.530> he's<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.070> perfect<00:01:02.340> size<00:01:02.699> to

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
think that he's just the perfect size to

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.600 
think that he's just the perfect size to
hunt<00:01:03.420> humans<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.170> honest<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.799> mean<00:01:05.159> he's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
hunt humans to be honest I mean he's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880 
hunt humans to be honest I mean he's
small<00:01:06.510> enough<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.990> he<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.320> still<00:01:07.590> maneuver

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
small enough that he can still maneuver

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.460 
small enough that he can still maneuver
around<00:01:08.189> things<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.390> he's<00:01:09.600> large<00:01:09.900> enough<00:01:10.229> that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
around things but he's large enough that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.500 
around things but he's large enough that
he's<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.760> able<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.210> kicked

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
he's not going to be able to be kicked

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.570 
he's not going to be able to be kicked
away<00:01:12.810> or<00:01:13.020> shoved<00:01:13.320> away<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.189> that's<00:01:14.310> why<00:01:14.549> I

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
away or shoved away and that's why I

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.700 
away or shoved away and that's why I
love<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.330> metric<00:01:15.720> anthis<00:01:16.110> Eris<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
love this the metric anthis Eris on the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.539 
love this the metric anthis Eris on the
Baryonyx

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
Baryonyx

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.850 
Baryonyx
are<00:01:17.970> two<00:01:18.390> dinosaurs<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.530> are<00:01:19.680> being

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
are two dinosaurs that are being

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.609 
are two dinosaurs that are being
introduced<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.869> still<00:01:21.869> large<00:01:22.259> but

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
introduced that are still large but

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.770 
introduced that are still large but
they're<00:01:22.770> more<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> medium<00:01:23.729> sized<00:01:24.090> which

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
they're more on the medium sized which

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.719 
they're more on the medium sized which
in<00:01:24.960> my<00:01:25.140> opinion<00:01:25.290> makes<00:01:25.619> them<00:01:26.100> absolutely

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
in my opinion makes them absolutely

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.310 
in my opinion makes them absolutely
perfect<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.479> hunting<00:01:27.750> people

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
perfect for hunting people

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.230 
perfect for hunting people
now<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.009> make<00:01:29.250> sure<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.460> can't<00:01:29.670> SAR<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.150> we

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
now the make sure you can't SAR so we

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.380 
now the make sure you can't SAR so we
know<00:01:30.390> they're<00:01:31.110> an<00:01:31.380> extremely<00:01:32.189> extremely<00:01:32.909> fast

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
know they're an extremely extremely fast

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.679 
know they're an extremely extremely fast
dinosaur<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.860> could<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
dinosaur so could is this is a

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.469 
dinosaur so could is this is a
comparable<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> Velociraptor<00:01:38.479> probably

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
comparable to a Velociraptor probably

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.080 
comparable to a Velociraptor probably
not<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.650> still<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.340> there<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.820> being

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
not but it's still up there as being

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.510 
not but it's still up there as being
really<00:01:42.299> fast<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.500> think<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> idea<00:01:44.220> of

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
really fast and I think the idea of

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.100 
really fast and I think the idea of
having<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.119> adventure<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.600> can't<00:01:45.810> source

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
having the adventure you can't source

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.100 
having the adventure you can't source
hunt<00:01:46.860> may<00:01:47.399> be<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.610> part<00:01:47.970> guess<00:01:48.270> down<00:01:48.600> would<00:01:48.899> just

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
hunt may be a part guess down would just

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.940 
hunt may be a part guess down would just
be<00:01:49.259> crazy<00:01:50.250> because<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
be crazy because we know that it is a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.520 
be crazy because we know that it is a
again<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.909> large<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.750> able<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.080> take

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.180 
mystery can't source without have this
problem<00:02:18.360> because<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.810> would<00:02:18.989> just<00:02:19.190> maneuver

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
problem because it would just maneuver

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.600 
problem because it would just maneuver
around<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.300> vines<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> little<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:23.190> the

which<00:02:26.190> would<00:02:26.400> make<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.820> ideal<00:02:27.239> for<00:02:27.660> getting<00:02:28.200> to

which would make it ideal for getting to
them<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.640> metric<00:02:29.880> answers<00:02:30.540> was<00:02:31.260> in

them and if the metric answers was in

them and if the metric answers was in
fact<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:31.890> started<00:02:32.280> chasing<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.730> people

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
fact that I started chasing the people

fact that I started chasing the people
in<00:02:33.690> dresser<00:02:34.470> park<00:02:34.800> 3<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.280> probably<00:02:35.640> would<00:02:35.790> have

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
in dresser park 3 it probably would have

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.610 
in dresser park 3 it probably would have
thought<00:02:36.060> one<00:02:36.330> or<00:02:36.480> two<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.750> them<00:02:36.870> because<00:02:37.260> of

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
thought one or two of them because of

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.460 
thought one or two of them because of
its<00:02:38.040> size<00:02:38.340> now<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.060> know<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.330> lot<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:40.110> lot<00:02:40.380> of

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
its size now I know a lot a lot of

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.440 
its size now I know a lot a lot of
people<00:02:40.739> are<00:02:40.830> like<00:02:40.980> bigger<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.580> better<00:02:41.790> but<00:02:42.390> I

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
people are like bigger is better but I

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.400 
people are like bigger is better but I
don't<00:02:42.570> think<00:02:42.930> so

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
don't think so

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.050 
don't think so
for<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.830> dinosaur<00:02:44.459> when<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.760> comes<00:02:44.940> to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
for this dinosaur when it comes to

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.300 
for this dinosaur when it comes to
hunting<00:02:45.180> humans<00:02:45.750> if<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.620> think<00:02:46.830> about<00:02:47.100> it

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
hunting humans if you think about it

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.699 
hunting humans if you think about it
it's<00:02:47.910> not<00:02:48.060> too<00:02:48.360> big<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.660> where<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.380> going<00:02:49.560> to

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
it's not too big to where it's going to

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.030 
it's not too big to where it's going to
be<00:02:50.610> able<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.090> knock<00:02:51.810> into<00:02:52.200> things<00:02:52.440> again<00:02:52.620> with

be able to knock into things again with

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.430 
be able to knock into things again with
the<00:02:53.160> t-rex<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.910> first<00:02:54.180> movie<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:55.170> wasn't

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
the t-rex in the first movie it wasn't

get Tim because of course he was too big

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.229 
get Tim because of course he was too big
the<00:03:03.840> t-rex<00:03:04.110> his<00:03:04.350> head<00:03:04.530> was<00:03:04.739> too<00:03:04.950> big<00:03:05.160> but<00:03:06.030> or

Soros<00:03:08.610> would<00:03:08.760> not<00:03:08.880> have<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.299> problem<00:03:09.540> he's

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
Soros would not have that problem he's

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.949 
Soros would not have that problem he's
the<00:03:10.440> perfect<00:03:10.680> size<00:03:11.070> or<00:03:11.489> she<00:03:11.820> is<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.600> perfect

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
the perfect size or she is the perfect

the perfect size or she is the perfect
size<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.410> she<00:03:13.440> would<00:03:13.799> have<00:03:13.920> gone<00:03:14.549> down<00:03:14.850> been

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
size that she would have gone down been

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.600 
size that she would have gone down been
able<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.930> ripped<00:03:16.380> him<00:03:16.650> right<00:03:16.950> out<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.370> car

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
able to ripped him right out of that car

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.699 
able to ripped him right out of that car
and<00:03:17.790> eat<00:03:18.000> him<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.360> that's<00:03:18.840> why<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.500> dinosaurs

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
and eat him and that's why the dinosaurs

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.940 
and eat him and that's why the dinosaurs
of<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:20.310> size<00:03:20.519> is<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:21.530> probably<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.739> biggest

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
of this size is so probably the biggest

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.890 
of this size is so probably the biggest
threat<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.670> most<00:03:23.850> intimidating<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.780> me

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
threat and the most intimidating to me

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.750 
threat and the most intimidating to me
because<00:03:25.260> they're<00:03:25.799> just<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.130> perfect<00:03:26.340> size<00:03:26.730> to

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
because they're just the perfect size to

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.810 
because they're just the perfect size to
get<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.630> me<00:03:27.750> quickly<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.470> I'm<00:03:29.220> not<00:03:29.400> going<00:03:29.670> to

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
get to me quickly and I'm not going to

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.300 
get to me quickly and I'm not going to
be<00:03:29.970> able<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.269> go<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.480> places<00:03:30.660> where<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.530> can<00:03:32.100> hide

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
be able to go to places where I can hide

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.789 
be able to go to places where I can hide
for<00:03:32.579> them<00:03:32.730> now<00:03:33.450> we<00:03:33.510> did<00:03:33.900> see<00:03:34.140> that<00:03:34.170> Dennis

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
for them now we did see that Dennis

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.390 
for them now we did see that Dennis
Nedry<00:03:35.130> on<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:36.720> embryos<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.160> first

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
Nedry on the embryos that in the first

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.819 
Nedry on the embryos that in the first
film<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.360> metric<00:03:39.750> antha<00:03:40.079> source<00:03:40.290> was<00:03:40.590> one

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
film the the metric antha source was one

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.770 
film the the metric antha source was one
of<00:03:40.980> them<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:41.880> that's<00:03:42.150> really<00:03:42.450> really

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
of them so that's really really

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.500 
of them so that's really really
