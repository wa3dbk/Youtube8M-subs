00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
a shot with great depth of field so

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.840 
a shot with great depth of field so
everything<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.719> focus<00:01:00.899> or<00:01:01.350> by<00:01:02.219> opening<00:01:02.699> the

aperture to a smaller f-stop you can

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.730 
aperture to a smaller f-stop you can
