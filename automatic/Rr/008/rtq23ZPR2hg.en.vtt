all<00:00:00.870> right<00:00:01.050> Mike<00:00:01.350> here<00:00:01.589> on<00:00:01.709> guns<00:00:01.920> cars<00:00:02.190> and

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
all right Mike here on guns cars and

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.220 
all right Mike here on guns cars and
digits<00:00:02.760> let<00:00:03.360> me<00:00:03.449> show<00:00:03.629> you<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.840> difference

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
digits let me show you the difference

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.330 
digits let me show you the difference
between<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.650> small<00:00:05.040> block<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.580> big<00:00:05.790> block

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
between a small block and a big block

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.160 
between a small block and a big block
it's<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.670> distance<00:00:08.970> here<00:00:09.510> from<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.050> center

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
it's this distance here from the center

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.440 
it's this distance here from the center
of<00:00:10.469> one<00:00:10.559> board<00:00:10.980> or<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.190> other<00:00:11.370> that's<00:00:12.210> called

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
of one board or the other that's called

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.749 
of one board or the other that's called
the<00:00:12.599> bore<00:00:12.780> spacing<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> small-block<00:00:14.460> GM

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
the bore spacing and on a small-block GM

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.400 
the bore spacing and on a small-block GM
v8<00:00:15.599> it's<00:00:15.839> 4.4<00:00:16.830> inches<00:00:17.240> on<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.300> big-block<00:00:18.810> GM<00:00:19.380> v8

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
v8 it's 4.4 inches on a big-block GM v8

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.769 
v8 it's 4.4 inches on a big-block GM v8
it's<00:00:22.430> four<00:00:23.539> point<00:00:24.539> eight<00:00:24.840> four<00:00:25.380> inches<00:00:25.740> so

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
it's four point eight four inches so

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.019 
it's four point eight four inches so
what<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.930> means<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.590> even<00:00:28.890> though<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.640> metal

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
what that means is even though the metal

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.299 
what that means is even though the metal
piece<00:00:30.660> that's<00:00:31.019> between<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.590> cylinders<00:00:32.099> is

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
piece that's between the cylinders is

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.630 
piece that's between the cylinders is
about<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.820> same<00:00:33.059> thickness<00:00:34.040> this<00:00:35.040> engine

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
about the same thickness this engine

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.940 
about the same thickness this engine
will<00:00:35.820> be<00:00:35.850> physically<00:00:36.809> bigger<00:00:37.230> because<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
will be physically bigger because the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.819 
will be physically bigger because the
holes<00:00:38.160> are<00:00:38.309> drilled<00:00:38.370> further<00:00:38.969> apart<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.829> the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
holes are drilled further apart and the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.369 
holes are drilled further apart and the
reason<00:00:41.190> why<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.700> fit<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> bigger<00:00:42.239> bore<00:00:42.570> you

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
reason why is to fit a bigger bore you

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.270 
reason why is to fit a bigger bore you
can't<00:00:43.680> drill<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.430> four<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.300> half<00:00:45.329> inch<00:00:45.809> bar

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
can't drill a four and a half inch bar

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.650 
can't drill a four and a half inch bar
four<00:00:47.280> point<00:00:47.550> four<00:00:47.789> inches<00:00:48.120> apart<00:00:48.270> from

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
four point four inches apart from

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.410 
four point four inches apart from
another<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.170> you'd<00:00:49.379> end<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.039> case

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
another one you'd end up with this case

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.590 
another one you'd end up with this case
or<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.840> know<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.309> edge<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.670> covers<00:00:54.390> that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
or you know the edge of this covers that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.930 
or you know the edge of this covers that
so<00:00:55.170> that's<00:00:55.350> kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.739> having<00:00:56.340> this

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
so that's kind of like having this

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.510 
so that's kind of like having this
piston<00:00:57.480> protrude<00:00:58.170> into<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.710> side<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.280> can't

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
piston protrude into that side you can't

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.750 
piston protrude into that side you can't
drill<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> holes<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:01.070> well<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.609> know

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
drill the holes like that well you know

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.620 
drill the holes like that well you know
they<00:01:03.329> won't<00:01:03.480> seal<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:05.180> let's<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.390> say<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
they won't seal and let's just say you

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.359 
they won't seal and let's just say you
can't<00:01:06.990> make<00:01:07.200> metal<00:01:07.470> thinner<00:01:07.920> than<00:01:08.130> that

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
can't make metal thinner than that

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.550 
can't make metal thinner than that
because<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:08.820> crack<00:01:09.150> are<00:01:09.390> leaked<00:01:09.600> like

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
because it will crack are leaked like

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.469 
because it will crack are leaked like
you<00:01:11.130> know<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.729> were<00:01:11.850> boosting<00:01:12.330> this

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you know what if you were boosting this

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.420 
you know what if you were boosting this
engine<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.140> need<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.070> thick

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
engine and you need it to be this thick

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.880 
engine and you need it to be this thick
and<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:16.080> ran<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.680> such<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and then you you ran just such a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.499 
and then you you ran just such a
tremendous<00:01:17.189> amount<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.939> boost<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
tremendous amount of boost that you

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420 
tremendous amount of boost that you
couldn't<00:01:18.930> even<00:01:19.020> use<00:01:19.320> race<00:01:19.590> gas<00:01:19.860> you'd<00:01:20.159> knock

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
couldn't even use race gas you'd knock

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.780 
couldn't even use race gas you'd knock
even<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:20.939> race<00:01:21.420> gas<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.680> then<00:01:23.189> come<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
even on race gas you then come to the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.060 
even on race gas you then come to the
realization<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.259> fact<00:01:25.290> need<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
realization that you do in fact need a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.929 
realization that you do in fact need a
bigger<00:01:26.490> engine<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.619> that's<00:01:29.460> when<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:29.880> time

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
bigger engine so that's when it's time

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.069 
bigger engine so that's when it's time
to<00:01:30.119> film<00:01:30.570> yourself<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:31.049> big<00:01:31.229> block<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:33.079> here's

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
to film yourself a big block and here's

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.990 
to film yourself a big block and here's
the<00:01:34.229> principle<00:01:34.770> behind<00:01:35.070> small<00:01:35.430> blocks<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the principle behind small blocks and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.240 
the principle behind small blocks and
big<00:01:36.119> marks<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:37.490> let's<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.759> say<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:41.100> know

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
big marks as let's just say you know

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.179 
big marks as let's just say you know
some<00:01:41.610> folks<00:01:41.850> run<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> two<00:01:43.290> inch<00:01:43.500> stroke<00:01:43.920> with

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
some folks run a two inch stroke with

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.899 
some folks run a two inch stroke with
the<00:01:44.280> two<00:01:44.460> inch<00:01:44.670> bore<00:01:45.000> for<00:01:45.329> 6.3<00:01:46.140> cubic<00:01:46.560> inches

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
the two inch bore for 6.3 cubic inches

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.700 
the two inch bore for 6.3 cubic inches
let's<00:01:47.909> say<00:01:48.210> another<00:01:48.450> guy<00:01:48.780> runs<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.229> point<00:01:49.500> eight

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
let's say another guy runs a point eight

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.730 
let's say another guy runs a point eight
eight<00:01:49.740> inch<00:01:50.159> stroke<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.899> three<00:01:52.290> inch<00:01:52.439> bore

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
eight inch stroke and a three inch bore

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.030 
eight inch stroke and a three inch bore
for<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> same<00:01:53.399> 6.3<00:01:54.240> cubic<00:01:54.630> inches<00:01:55.040> this

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
for the same 6.3 cubic inches this

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.709 
for the same 6.3 cubic inches this
engine<00:01:56.430> will<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.579> longer<00:01:57.060> from<00:01:57.240> front<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.600> back

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
engine will be longer from front to back

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.810 
engine will be longer from front to back
than<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:58.619> will<00:01:59.420> okay<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.780> makes<00:02:00.990> sense

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
than this one will okay that makes sense

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.030 
than this one will okay that makes sense
now<00:02:02.820> what<00:02:03.180> if<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:04.079> wanted<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.560> make<00:02:04.740> two

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
now what if you wanted to make two

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.770 
now what if you wanted to make two
different<00:02:05.219> engines<00:02:05.790> for<00:02:06.030> your<00:02:06.299> trucks<00:02:06.630> and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
different engines for your trucks and

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.089 
different engines for your trucks and
your<00:02:06.960> cars<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:09.050> let's<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.319> make<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.800> one

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
your cars so let's just make this one

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.860 
your cars so let's just make this one
the<00:02:11.310> same<00:02:11.940> height

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.570 

so<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.930> know<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.500> top<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:17.069> engine<00:02:17.459> will

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
so you know the top of this engine will

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.600 
so you know the top of this engine will
come<00:02:17.790> up<00:02:17.970> here<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.950> there's<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.010> rule<00:02:20.280> it's

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
come up here and there's a rule it's

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.550 
come up here and there's a rule it's
safer<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.120> have<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> longer<00:02:21.720> connecting<00:02:22.350> rod

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
safer to have a longer connecting rod

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.180 
safer to have a longer connecting rod
than<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.950> shorter<00:02:23.310> one<00:02:23.490> because<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> angle

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
than a shorter one because the angle

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.070 
than a shorter one because the angle
causes<00:02:26.190> problems<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.850> lot<00:02:27.120> more<00:02:27.330> angle<00:02:27.750> here

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
causes problems a lot more angle here

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.840 
causes problems a lot more angle here
makes<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.040> break<00:02:29.280> quicker<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:32.250> let's<00:02:32.489> just<00:02:32.700> say

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
makes it break quicker so let's just say

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.500 
makes it break quicker so let's just say
you<00:02:32.910> did<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:34.700> now<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.760> would<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.239> this

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
you did that so now you would have this

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.780 
you did that so now you would have this
taller<00:02:36.930> engine<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:38.160> only<00:02:38.340> thing<00:02:38.640> that

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
taller engine and the only thing that

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.210 
taller engine and the only thing that
differentiates<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.870> from<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:40.170> small-block<00:02:40.620> is

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
differentiates it from a small-block is

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.220 
differentiates it from a small-block is
the<00:02:41.430> fact<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:42.030> bigger<00:02:42.300> when<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.840> stack

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the fact that it's bigger when you stack

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
the fact that it's bigger when you stack
it<00:02:43.260> up<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.770> on<00:02:43.950> end<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.930> now<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.890> can<00:02:47.040> have

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
it up and on end so now you can have

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.130 
it up and on end so now you can have
this<00:02:47.459> big<00:02:47.730> engine<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.300> we<00:02:48.420> call<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> big-block

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
this big engine that we call a big-block

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.870 
this big engine that we call a big-block
because<00:02:49.590> it's<00:02:49.739> physically<00:02:50.280> bigger<00:02:50.489> than<00:02:50.730> that

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
because it's physically bigger than that

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.990 
because it's physically bigger than that
one<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:52.890> can<00:02:53.070> put<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.580> point<00:02:53.820> eight

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
one and you can put in the point eight

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.440 
one and you can put in the point eight
eight<00:02:54.030> inch<00:02:54.330> stroke<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.989> have<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:56.180> six<00:02:57.180> point

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
eight inch stroke and have the six point

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.809 
eight inch stroke and have the six point
three<00:02:57.510> cubic<00:02:58.080> inches<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.620> then<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.459> can<00:02:59.640> also

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
three cubic inches and then you can also

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.449 
three cubic inches and then you can also
have<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.209> separate<00:03:00.780> two<00:03:01.530> inch<00:03:01.769> stroke<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.280> put

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
have a separate two inch stroke to put

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.120 
have a separate two inch stroke to put
in<00:03:02.610> here<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.569> like<00:03:03.870> 13<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.650> half<00:03:04.680> cubic

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
in here to have like 13 and a half cubic

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.600 
in here to have like 13 and a half cubic
inches<00:03:05.610> or<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:06.269> know<00:03:06.360> 14<00:03:06.840> cubic<00:03:06.989> inches<00:03:07.610> so

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
inches or you know 14 cubic inches so

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.000 
inches or you know 14 cubic inches so
you<00:03:09.239> don't<00:03:10.110> need<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.380> spend<00:03:10.650> all<00:03:10.860> the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
you don't need to spend all the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.830 
you don't need to spend all the
unnecessary<00:03:11.310> amount<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.030> money<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.450> build<00:03:12.600> two

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
unnecessary amount of money to build two

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.229 
unnecessary amount of money to build two
different<00:03:13.400> blocks<00:03:14.400> because<00:03:14.790> it's<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.209> know

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
different blocks because it's you know

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.569 
different blocks because it's you know
it<00:03:15.420> costs<00:03:15.840> money<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.170> cast<00:03:16.500> those<00:03:16.829> you<00:03:17.519> just

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
it costs money to cast those you just

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.310 
it costs money to cast those you just
cast<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.030> same<00:03:18.239> one<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.660> change<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.049> parts

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
cast the same one and change the parts

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:26.240 
cast the same one and change the parts
on<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> inside<00:03:21.350> um<00:03:24.260> why<00:03:25.260> am<00:03:25.290> i<00:03:25.620> ranting<00:03:26.130> about

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
on the inside um why am i ranting about

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.050 
on the inside um why am i ranting about
this<00:03:27.260> well<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:28.709> because<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.340> some

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
this well it's because of some

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.050 
this well it's because of some
automotive<00:03:30.840> journalists<00:03:31.650> they<00:03:32.430> said<00:03:32.760> that

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
automotive journalists they said that

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.750 
automotive journalists they said that
all<00:03:33.560> this<00:03:35.269> 6.3<00:03:36.269> litre<00:03:36.510> Mercedes<00:03:36.750> had<00:03:37.560> a

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
all this 6.3 litre Mercedes had a

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.870 
all this 6.3 litre Mercedes had a
big-block<00:03:38.760> v8<00:03:39.269> in<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.860> it<00:03:40.860> turns<00:03:41.220> out<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.700> it

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
big-block v8 in it it turns out that it

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.690 
big-block v8 in it it turns out that it
doesn't<00:03:42.329> I<00:03:42.480> know<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:43.019> little<00:03:43.260> bit<00:03:43.410> about<00:03:43.739> some

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
doesn't I know a little bit about some

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.640 
doesn't I know a little bit about some
of<00:03:44.730> those<00:03:44.940> engines<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:46.200> know<00:03:46.260> for<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> fact

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
of those engines and I know for a fact

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.270 
of those engines and I know for a fact
that<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.130> Mercedes<00:03:47.540> 6.3<00:03:48.540> have<00:03:49.290> for<00:03:49.829> pointing

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
that the Mercedes 6.3 have for pointing

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.720 
that the Mercedes 6.3 have for pointing
4-inch<00:03:50.820> bore<00:03:51.150> centers<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:52.680> run<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.160> weenie

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
4-inch bore centers to run the weenie

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.050 
4-inch bore centers to run the weenie
4-inch<00:03:54.720> bores<00:03:55.079> that<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.530> head<00:03:55.739> so<00:03:56.730> this<00:03:56.850> is

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
4-inch bores that the head so this is

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.849 
4-inch bores that the head so this is
actually<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.510> four<00:03:57.810> inch<00:03:57.959> bore<00:03:58.260> that's<00:03:58.500> in<00:03:58.739> that

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
actually a four inch bore that's in that

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.759 
actually a four inch bore that's in that
Mercedes<00:03:59.450> so<00:04:00.450> they<00:04:00.690> probably<00:04:00.930> have<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.410> four

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
Mercedes so they probably have a four

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.500 
Mercedes so they probably have a four
point<00:04:01.980> four<00:04:02.190> inch<00:04:02.370> bore<00:04:02.640> Center<00:04:03.030> or<00:04:03.209> maybe<00:04:03.420> a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
point four inch bore Center or maybe a

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.390 
point four inch bore Center or maybe a
little<00:04:03.720> bit<00:04:03.900> smaller<00:04:04.850> but<00:04:06.140> that's<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.440> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
little bit smaller but that's the the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.509 
little bit smaller but that's the the
thing<00:04:08.670> I'm<00:04:08.820> fighting<00:04:09.239> about<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:10.220> that<00:04:11.220> only

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
thing I'm fighting about is that only

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.840 
thing I'm fighting about is that only
only<00:04:12.209> GM<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.290> Ford<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.890> Dodge<00:04:13.980> made<00:04:14.549> big

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
only GM and Ford and Dodge made big

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.610 
only GM and Ford and Dodge made big
blocks<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:18.120> GM<00:04:18.539> big-block<00:04:19.109> was<00:04:19.440> the

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
blocks and the GM big-block was the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.800 
blocks and the GM big-block was the
famous<00:04:19.890> one

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.290 

at<00:04:25.440> any<00:04:25.650> rate<00:04:25.770> another<00:04:26.310> thing<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.760> bugged<00:04:27.180> me

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
at any rate another thing that bugged me

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
the boss that one has bigger bar centers

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.030 
the boss that one has bigger bar centers
than<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.090> small-block<00:04:51.570> it's<00:04:52.200> like<00:04:52.440> four<00:04:52.770> point

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
than a small-block it's like four point

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.350 
than a small-block it's like four point
five<00:04:53.700> something<00:04:54.540> cubic<00:04:55.250> inches<00:04:56.250> not<00:04:57.000> cubic

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
five something cubic inches not cubic

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.790 
five something cubic inches not cubic
inches<00:04:57.570> but<00:04:57.720> four<00:04:57.960> point<00:04:58.169> five<00:04:58.320> something

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
inches but four point five something

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.430 
inches but four point five something
inch<00:04:58.980> bore<00:04:59.610> centers<00:05:00.000> which<00:05:00.750> makes<00:05:00.990> it<00:05:01.169> bigger

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
inch bore centers which makes it bigger

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.800 
inch bore centers which makes it bigger
than<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:01.740> small-block<00:05:02.250> but<00:05:02.970> smaller<00:05:03.360> than<00:05:03.510> a

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
than a small-block but smaller than a

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.260 
than a small-block but smaller than a
traditional<00:05:04.020> what<00:05:04.919> we<00:05:05.130> have<00:05:05.370> known<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.880> be<00:05:06.030> a

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
traditional what we have known to be a

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.659 
traditional what we have known to be a
big-block<00:05:09.320> right<00:05:10.320> that<00:05:10.740> engines<00:05:11.100> really<00:05:11.400> tall

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
big-block right that engines really tall

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.640 
big-block right that engines really tall
-<00:05:11.970> I<00:05:12.000> think<00:05:12.330> it<00:05:12.450> has<00:05:12.600> a<00:05:12.630> ten<00:05:12.990> and<00:05:13.140> a<00:05:13.230> half<00:05:13.380> inch

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
- I think it has a ten and a half inch

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.750 
- I think it has a ten and a half inch
deck<00:05:13.950> height<00:05:14.220> so<00:05:16.220> when<00:05:17.220> you<00:05:17.310> look<00:05:17.520> at<00:05:17.640> the

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
deck height so when you look at the

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.440 
deck height so when you look at the
engines<00:05:19.010> you<00:05:20.010> have<00:05:20.190> this<00:05:20.490> distance<00:05:21.090> here<00:05:21.270> the

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
engines you have this distance here the

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.000 
engines you have this distance here the
Senate<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.960> distance<00:05:22.380> from<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.650> center<00:05:22.979> of

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
Senate the distance from the center of

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.850 
Senate the distance from the center of
the<00:05:23.310> crankshaft<00:05:24.180> to<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:25.050> top<00:05:25.410> of<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.740> engine

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
the crankshaft to the top of the engine

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.400 
the crankshaft to the top of the engine
or<00:05:26.250> like<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.610> very<00:05:27.270> top<00:05:27.780> of<00:05:27.990> where<00:05:28.139> the<00:05:28.229> piston

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
or like the very top of where the piston

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.730 
or like the very top of where the piston
goes<00:05:28.760> that<00:05:29.780> distance<00:05:30.780> is<00:05:31.020> called<00:05:31.320> the<00:05:31.530> deck

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
goes that distance is called the deck

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.250 
goes that distance is called the deck
height<00:05:32.010> and<00:05:32.280> that<00:05:33.060> has<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.270> big<00:05:33.419> effect<00:05:33.600> on<00:05:34.080> this

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
height and that has a big effect on this

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.010 
height and that has a big effect on this
angle<00:05:34.530> here<00:05:34.890> so<00:05:35.070> if<00:05:36.030> you<00:05:36.150> build<00:05:36.300> a<00:05:36.450> taller<00:05:36.720> deck

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
angle here so if you build a taller deck

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.070 
angle here so if you build a taller deck
height<00:05:37.290> you<00:05:37.530> just<00:05:37.970> maybe<00:05:38.970> just<00:05:39.150> might<00:05:39.690> be<00:05:39.870> able

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
height you just maybe just might be able

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.810 
height you just maybe just might be able
to<00:05:40.229> run<00:05:40.410> a<00:05:40.470> bigger<00:05:40.710> stroke<00:05:41.070> that's<00:05:41.400> usually

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
to run a bigger stroke that's usually

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.680 
to run a bigger stroke that's usually
the<00:05:41.850> case<00:05:43.070> but<00:05:44.070> if<00:05:45.060> you<00:05:45.270> want<00:05:45.479> more

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
the case but if you want more

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.390 
the case but if you want more
displacement<00:05:46.350> you<00:05:46.470> usually<00:05:46.680> want<00:05:47.160> a<00:05:47.190> bigger

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
displacement you usually want a bigger

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.590 
displacement you usually want a bigger
board<00:05:49.430> anywho<00:05:50.430> people<00:05:50.880> don't<00:05:51.390> seem<00:05:51.539> to

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
board anywho people don't seem to

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.480 
board anywho people don't seem to
understand<00:05:52.140> that<00:05:52.350> but<00:05:52.500> I<00:05:52.560> hope<00:05:52.800> you<00:05:52.979> all<00:05:53.160> learn

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
understand that but I hope you all learn

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.620 
understand that but I hope you all learn
from<00:05:53.520> this<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.300> now<00:05:55.080> understand<00:05:55.770> that<00:05:56.130> a<00:05:56.630> big

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
from this and now understand that a big

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.719 
from this and now understand that a big
block<00:05:57.930> does<00:05:58.289> not<00:05:58.500> necessarily<00:05:59.250> mean<00:05:59.700> that

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
block does not necessarily mean that

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.700 
block does not necessarily mean that
it's<00:06:00.150> going<00:06:00.270> to<00:06:00.330> be<00:06:00.539> a<00:06:00.570> bigger<00:06:01.320> displacement

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
it's going to be a bigger displacement

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.159 
it's going to be a bigger displacement
than<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.520> small<00:06:02.820> one<00:06:03.000> it<00:06:03.120> was<00:06:03.270> gold<00:06:03.510> that<00:06:03.750> you

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
than the small one it was gold that you

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.909 
than the small one it was gold that you
were<00:06:04.289> comparing<00:06:04.710> it<00:06:04.950> to<00:06:05.750> so<00:06:06.770> thanks<00:06:07.770> for
