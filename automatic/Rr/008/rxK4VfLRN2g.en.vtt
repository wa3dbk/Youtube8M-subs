00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 so the focus of the movie goes there then see 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.740
 Well, mouse is a very big object. 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.429
 pyramid shaped 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.469
 You will understand rock 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.949
 This is an excerpt from the movie Stargate and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.859
 object is already very large indeed 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.100
 Pyramid is just the beginning. 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.800
 sound details after the third lap in 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.599
 came around so god and spun with 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.230
 the plane from four to five laps in 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.029
 around him 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.650
 after the third turn the top part 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.989
 I do not know if you saw the photo 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.149
 ancient is that it was shown the dome was 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.640
 well rounded is not that like the rudder 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.739
 opened disappeared whatever it is is the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.780
 What happened there, inside, left? 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.030
 that famous world to see the famous 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.190
 flying saucer from within 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.710
 So you got to see that area there. 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.860
 left the object where it is not at 45 degrees and 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.480
 an amazing speed is thus in the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.340
 our technology today for what I 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.649
 know aerodynamic difficult because 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.890
 aviation teach that we do not have today 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.930
 physical condition today aeronautics does not 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.930
 can accelerate that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.939
 speed of about mack 10 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.890
 12 thousand km per hour is impossible 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.560
 the man would disintegrate anything 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.780
 if then the technology that these they have 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.750
 are they travelers or not the sound of the chime 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.659
 is higher than ours, you saw it clearly see 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.340
 arrived at one thing clear there I had I 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.220
 I had the opportunity that all the breath 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.360
 every day I lose I do not drink I am 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.710
 Atomic Aiea 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.470
 I do not drink I do not smoke and I've seen a player 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.770
 Mamadu no no no I do not drink do not drink 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.600
 huh 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.780
 I even the cell phone rang 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.659
 until then my boy from my father's foot 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.780
 I'm talking about this was on October 96 and 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.690
 November 96 now then not now not 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.119
 there are 90 and 96 to 2008 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.970
 two years ago including the cover of 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.930
 magazine this is where the harold was 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.270
 Spotlight 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.070
 q and interesting detail is that these 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.979
 flying saucers coming out of 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.770
 we call it mother ship it 's a station 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.619
 space that makes incursions into 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.690
 planetary systems and from within these 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.700
 seasons let's say so would leave 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.739
 smaller disks would be a port scheme 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.900
 saw the door gives a kiss they had drunk it 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.120
 What would I do with an airplane with the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.680
 technology 3 thousand years ago to bother 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.180
 says the same thing your culture leading to 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.769
 back from a plane port will not 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.959
 disrupt anything left there 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.880
 this is the book of the last article by 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.410
 one of the film's producers alien 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.840
 eighth passenger for you to have a 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.880
 idea of ​​the seriousness of the case he portrayed 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.130
 the case of the Brazilian businessman as 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.660
 more serious occurred worldwide 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.430
 world has heard of alien the eighth 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.150
 passenger in a case he deserved 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.010
 featured throughout the press 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.470
 not only coming back to that 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.820
 Cell phone issue touched my father boy 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.920
 where he is I could not speak and 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.049
 if the father is stuttering and then I hung up 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.790
 phone, his wife returned in the 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.650
 phone and what I'm doing. 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.450
 flying around a flying saucer 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.980
 The joke explains no one sees you as 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.840
 I'll explain something I 'm already 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.790
 having dinner with bill clinton is impossible 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.790
 I show looks frank singer showed fan 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.579
 was even prevented from singing at that time 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.640
 dictatorship because he saw something 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.410
 different and even prevented from 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.280
 sing a time he took to 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.519
 Brasilia or with her is truth is this or 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.230
 that fable singer jr ramalho is the 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.000
 I have seen something even jah 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.530
 after we did the matter that 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.329
 we talk about the junior fable 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.820
 amaury junior on the flash ran out 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.620
 wondering and Fabiano told the 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.170
 respect to the flying saucers he saw 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.510
 not only once and even music seems to me 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.090
 inspire you to meet in these situations the 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.530
 interrupted and saw the rating because I 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.530
 come to the forefront because I do not depend 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.060
 aviation is a hobby all 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.920
 pilots that comes what I've already started 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.110
 with hundreds of far they are forbidden 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.000
 Talk does not say anything can not 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.860
 because the company does not comment it will be 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.930
 given as crazy, it's going to fall soon 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.300
 the plane was crazy pilot allan davis 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.890
 ball flying saucer is pilot of 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.470
 The air force then does not speak and 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.010
 me and he left 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.920
 disco 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.720
 messi made the little one leaned to 45 thousand there 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.220
 the big one after the third pump and 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.180
 It's left that hole open up is 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.980
 that dome 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.020
 I'll give it a go, but I'm going 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.150
 get on a plane to take a look 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.920
 in with him began to generate more 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.669
 faster faster faster than me 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.769
 have detected that we know her 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.510
 shows the angle the disk has left 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.820
 When it does not arrive it accelerates but I wanted to 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.820
 look inside the disc was also because 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.640
 of nutrition the empty that is to take care of him 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.950
 There you get caught while chatting. 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.169
 It's not good when I got to church. 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.310
 When I started to want to train to 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.169
 take a look inside that I was going to 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.880
 make a passage almost in sweet in 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.520
 him and will prove he teaches it. 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.200
 you could put photo just so you can 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.690
 put the photo with the last photo to 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.280
 last photo is this when and from aa 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.860
 last time it started to spin more 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.240
 quickest and then I'll have it 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.640
 she's got a wrong thing, I walked away 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.500
 the fan are those tracks 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.220
 very reddish 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:01.130
 oscillating amazons he did for the city 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.289
 We do not have it. I pointed it out. 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.450
 we do not have technology for this has not 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:11.660
 would be a failure to hold would not have 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.729
 70 meters high by 100 meters 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.580
 diameter and not if it would not 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.070
 flying horse a horse was a piece 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.180
 great improvement used is real big 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.630
 really big 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.370
 now the negative detail at the same time 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.280
 several witnesses reported having 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.990
 seen strange flying objects there the 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.810
 interior of rio grande do sul several 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.050
 witnesses will not bring the guy who 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.000
 floppy disk 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.520
 Look at the tension, Brazil, I already had 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.530
 let attention Brazil stay connected 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.560
 in the mouse program because that week 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.750
 Come on, we're going to shake the country's structure. 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.450
 with which we will show that it is not 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.590
 joking will be the best series 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.360
 reports already 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.520
 made for Brazilian television that we 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.890
 we are still keeping confidential due to 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.700
 to a number of confidential and 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.960
 if not catch the night there is something global 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.730
 our band 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.730
 she warns so let's not go
