00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.010 
wife and she looked at it through her
right<00:02:16.550> eye<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.120> she<00:02:17.240> said<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.630> know<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.810> can't

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
right eye and she said you know I can't

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.280 
right eye and she said you know I can't
really<00:02:18.230> see<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.560> very<00:02:18.770> well<00:02:19.540> very<00:02:20.540> strange<00:02:20.870> so

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
really see it very well very strange so

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.690 
really see it very well very strange so
I<00:02:21.319> asked<00:02:21.590> her<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.740> look<00:02:22.100> at<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.370> through<00:02:22.550> her

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
I asked her to look at it through her

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.089 
I asked her to look at it through her
left<00:02:22.880> eye<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:24.230> when<00:02:24.470> she<00:02:24.560> looked<00:02:24.709> at<00:02:24.860> her

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
left eye and when she looked at her

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.429 
left eye and when she looked at her
looked<00:02:25.730> through<00:02:26.150> her<00:02:26.239> left<00:02:26.420> eye<00:02:26.629> she<00:02:27.290> could

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
looked through her left eye she could

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.440 
looked through her left eye she could
see<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.680> very<00:02:27.769> clearly

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
see it very clearly

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.210 
see it very clearly
and<00:02:29.840> then<00:02:29.990> she<00:02:30.110> reminded<00:02:30.440> me<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.620> she

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
and then she reminded me that she

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.800 
and then she reminded me that she
actually<00:02:31.370> has<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.760> differential<00:02:32.210> vision<00:02:32.630> she

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
actually has a differential vision she

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.590 
actually has a differential vision she
has<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.170> power<00:02:33.620> in<00:02:33.860> one<00:02:34.010> eye<00:02:34.180> but<00:02:35.180> not<00:02:35.360> in<00:02:35.510> the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
has a power in one eye but not in the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.920 
has a power in one eye but not in the
other

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
other

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.949 
other
so<00:02:36.050> aha<00:02:36.620> there<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.400> something<00:02:37.730> interesting

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
so aha there is something interesting

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.570 
so aha there is something interesting
bokors<00:02:38.959> can<00:02:39.650> be<00:02:39.800> actually<00:02:39.920> used<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.430> figure

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
bokors can be actually used to figure

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.240 
bokors can be actually used to figure
out<00:02:40.850> if<00:02:41.060> there<00:02:41.569> is<00:02:41.600> something<00:02:42.250> reflectively

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
out if there is something reflectively

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.390 
out if there is something reflectively
wrong<00:02:43.850> about<00:02:44.569> your<00:02:44.840> eyes<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.800> prototype

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
wrong about your eyes the prototype

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.090 
wrong about your eyes the prototype
system<00:02:46.910> Rascar<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.750> his<00:02:47.930> students<00:02:48.530> developed

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
system Rascar and his students developed

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.490 
system Rascar and his students developed
as<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.310> result<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:50.060> that<00:02:50.240> inside<00:02:50.630> has<00:02:50.990> an<00:02:51.230> array

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
as a result of that inside has an array

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.920 
as a result of that inside has an array
of<00:02:51.530> tiny<00:02:52.070> lenses<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.820> a<00:02:52.970> grid<00:02:53.270> of<00:02:53.300> pinholes

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
of tiny lenses and a grid of pinholes

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.930 
of tiny lenses and a grid of pinholes
that<00:02:54.290> combined<00:02:54.950> with<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.280> software<00:02:55.670> on<00:02:55.850> the

phone forces the user to focus at
