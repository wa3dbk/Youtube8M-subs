00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:14.184
 Minecraft is an independent phenomenon 

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:15.541
 who turned into a millionaire 

00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:18.764
 a swede with tacky taste for hats 

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:21.272
 the programmer Markus "Notch" Persson. 

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:23.732
 Created by Notch himself 

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.955
 until explode by success key the internet key, 

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:29.225
 Minecraft generates random worlds 

00:00:29.226 --> 00:00:31.253
 which can be freely exploited 

00:00:31.253 --> 00:00:33.397
 and today it has millions of players. 

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:35.708
 The game has really become popular 

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:37.668
 for its use as a "sandbox", 

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:40.689
 in which users built monumental works 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.701
 and spread their results through social networks, 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.843
 especially YouTube. 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.666
 Title is constantly changing 

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.182
 since it entered alpha 

00:01:04.183 --> 00:01:06.243
 and began to be played in 2009, 

00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:08.499
 and even after its recent "launch" 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.392
 it continues to be improved 

00:01:10.393 --> 00:01:12.128
 and receiving new content. 

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.219
 Minecraft gives no goal on what to do 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.802
 and even the timid "adventure" 

00:01:16.803 --> 00:01:19.248
 added in the latest updates 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:21.522
 did little to change this picture. 

00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:24.546
 But if this can bother some players, 

00:01:24.547 --> 00:01:27.933
 this is one of the biggest reasons for the success of the game: 

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.811
 let the user create their own goal. 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:35.802
 You do not get anything 

00:01:35.803 --> 00:01:37.948
 when raising a tower that crosses the clouds 

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:39.990
 beyond the satisfaction of having built it. 

00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:41.540
 More toy than game, 

00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:44.899
 Minecraft invites the player to create their own purpose 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.755
 and treat your world like a huge playground, 

00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:51.640
 giving you the tools to give your imagination wings. 

00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:54.453
 And it's amazing how the hours go 

00:01:54.454 --> 00:01:56.363
 with such a simple experience. 

00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:05.126
 The freedom found within the game 

00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:06.325
 to do what you want 

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.398
 extends up out of Minecraft, 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.875
 allowing you to tune the game the way you want. 

00:02:12.542 --> 00:02:15.735
 The number of modifications created by the community is absurd, 

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:18.219
 with thousands of mods available, 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.087
 and equally absurd is how much they can change the experience. 

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:25.162
 Graphics can become photorealistic, 

00:02:25.163 --> 00:02:27.542
 new creatures and items are created, 

00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:30.104
 and different types of generated worlds. 

00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:33.882
 The more patients who are willing to move under the hood 

00:02:33.883 --> 00:02:35.545
 can change everything 

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:38.100
 including bypassing many of the flaws 

00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:40.185
 or unfinished game features. 

00:02:47.947 --> 00:02:49.008
 With the right friends, 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.967
 the multiplayer experience in Minecraft is extremely fun. 

00:02:53.693 --> 00:02:56.097
 Keep a server with a few companions 

00:02:56.098 --> 00:02:59.870
 provides a surprising sense of "being at home" 

00:02:59.871 --> 00:03:01.788
 whenever you log in there, 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:04.081
 building gigantic structures 

00:03:04.082 --> 00:03:06.425
 or just exploring the world without destiny. 

00:03:06.426 --> 00:03:08.564
 The other half of the fun 

00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:11.522
 is to visit community-created servers, 

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:14.069
 exploring the worlds of other players, 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.390
 many of them bring down the chin by complexity. 

00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:20.975
 Minecraft took a leap into play the cultural phenomenon, 

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:24.367
 forming communities that are particularly active, 

00:03:24.368 --> 00:03:26.660
 filling wikis about the game, 

00:03:26.661 --> 00:03:28.966
 indispensable to understand it 

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:30.855
 given the nut documentation, 

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:34.042
 and talking in forums, blogs and social networks. 

00:03:34.695 --> 00:03:37.360
 Multiple adventure narrative videos on YouTube 

00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:39.210
 has millions of visitors. 

00:03:40.366 --> 00:03:41.490
 A controversial point. 

00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:45.467
 Although many fans consider Minecraft graphics 

00:03:45.468 --> 00:03:48.537
 result more of a nostalgic aesthetic choice 

00:03:48.538 --> 00:03:50.640
 than "tosquice" proper, 

00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:53.917
 Minecraft Blocks Minecraft Blocks 

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:56.617
 after detaching it from modern titles. 

00:03:56.618 --> 00:04:01.247
 A game with such a richness of options begs for tutorials 

00:03:57.707 --> 00:04:02.933
 or an internal encyclopedia. 

00:04:02.934 --> 00:04:05.615
 The stance of "follows the way boy" 

00:04:05.616 --> 00:04:09.182
 could be mitigated to lessen the frustration of the beginners. 

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:12.862
 Minecraft has hundreds of items that can be built, 

00:04:12.863 --> 00:04:15.453
 but good luck figuring out how to do 

00:04:15.454 --> 00:04:17.285
 one of them even inside the game, 

00:04:17.286 --> 00:04:19.949
 since it provides no hint 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.077
 or revenue. 

00:04:32.136 --> 00:04:33.350
 Justice be done, 

00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:36.721
 it is not difficult to find complete and up-to-date information 

00:04:36.722 --> 00:04:37.841
 in wikis online 

00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:39.606
 maintained by the community, 

00:04:39.607 --> 00:04:43.272
 but they could be better integrated into the game itself 

00:04:43.273 --> 00:04:46.033
 to avoid the constant festival of "alt + tabs". 

00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:47.438
 Yes, 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:50.268
 despite being in constant development for 2 years 

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:53.052
 and undergo several modifications until it is 'launched' 

00:04:53.053 --> 00:04:56.861
 Minecraft is still a game packed with great ideas implemented 

00:04:56.862 --> 00:04:58.069
 half. 

00:05:10.037 --> 00:05:12.573
 The advance with little experience influences the game, 

00:05:12.574 --> 00:05:16.299
 the characters of the villages do nothing but face the player 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.324
 with a silly face, 

00:05:17.325 --> 00:05:20.165
 the multiplayer implementation to create a server 

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:21.627
 is not integrated into the game, 

00:05:21.628 --> 00:05:24.053
 mods do not pussem native support, 

00:05:24.054 --> 00:05:26.260
 bugs are still relatively common 

00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:27.581
 and the list goes a long way. 

00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:31.165
 The game continues to be enhanced by Mohjang Studio 

00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:33.114
 and new content added, 

00:05:33.115 --> 00:05:36.051
 but the actual release of Minecraft as final product 

00:05:36.052 --> 00:05:37.453
 it is still far. 

00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:41.196
 It's a surprising testament to how much Minecraft is addictive 

00:05:41.197 --> 00:05:44.252
 the fact that the long list of problems is 

00:05:44.253 --> 00:05:46.417
 to mere details as you play. 

00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:55.209
 This analysis should be viewed with caveats. 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.821
 The Jurassic charts, 

00:05:56.822 --> 00:05:58.559
 the aimless gameplay, 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.728
 the stimulus of creating by creating; 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.178
 these Minecraft features do not appeal at all 

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:05.886
 the vast majority of gamers. 

00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:09.624
 players who, from one month to the next, scratch their heads in stupefaction 

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:13.799
 wondering what the hell others see in this grid game. 

00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:15.573
 And there's no problem with that. 

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:18.057
 Minecraft failures are not few. 

00:06:18.058 --> 00:06:19.185
 quite frankly, 

00:06:19.186 --> 00:06:21.220
 the game in its state of "launch" 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.015
 is practically as unfinished as 1 year ago. 

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.965
 but if the gameplay makes sense to you 

00:06:26.965 --> 00:06:28.935
 the flaws do not matter 

00:06:28.936 --> 00:06:31.135
 and it's no exaggeration to say that Minecraft 

00:06:31.136 --> 00:06:33.149
 offers a unique experience for players. 

00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:37.878
 You can get lost building pharaonic works with friends, 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:40.646
 exploring the random world of surprising variety, 

00:06:40.647 --> 00:06:42.529
 simply trying to survive, 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.550
 or contunizando the own game with the thousands of modifications created 

00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:48.498
 by the user community. 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:51.448
 It is a testamenro of the creative power 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:53.512
 and video game entertainment. 

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:56.426
 To the converted, there is no other game that 

00:06:56.427 --> 00:06:59.221
 convey the same sense of wonder 

00:06:59.222 --> 00:07:00.292
 and freedom. 

00:07:00.293 --> 00:07:02.542
 A game that can take you to dedicate, 

00:07:02.543 --> 00:07:03.539
 not hours, 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.338
 but months of his life 

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:07.432
 digging and stacking blocks. 

00:07:07.433 --> 00:07:09.250
 And worship every moment.
