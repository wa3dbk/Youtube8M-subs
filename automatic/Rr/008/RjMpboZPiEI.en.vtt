an A K because that's what they all do

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.289 
an A K because that's what they all do
but<00:03:14.989> when<00:03:15.949> I<00:03:15.979> took<00:03:16.099> this<00:03:16.340> lower<00:03:16.549> handguard<00:03:16.970> off

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
but when I took this lower handguard off

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.030 
but when I took this lower handguard off
in<00:03:17.449> the<00:03:17.540> front<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:17.989> mean<00:03:18.109> it's<00:03:18.260> it's<00:03:18.620> charred

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
in the front I mean it's it's charred

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.330 
in the front I mean it's it's charred
it's<00:03:20.030> like<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.269> came<00:03:20.449> out<00:03:20.599> of<00:03:20.629> the<00:03:21.099> off<00:03:22.099> the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
it's like it came out of the off the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.949 
it's like it came out of the off the
grill<00:03:22.609> so<00:03:23.590> but<00:03:24.590> other<00:03:24.769> than<00:03:24.889> that<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.959> safety

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
grill so but other than that the safety

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.920 
grill so but other than that the safety
here<00:03:27.169> was<00:03:27.319> extremely<00:03:27.919> sticky<00:03:28.629> so<00:03:29.629> you<00:03:29.659> just

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
here was extremely sticky so you just

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.509 
here was extremely sticky so you just
you<00:03:30.169> know<00:03:30.260> kept<00:03:30.530> uh<00:03:30.680> cover<00:03:30.919> up<00:03:31.069> in<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.340> belt

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
you know kept uh cover up in the belt

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.140 
you know kept uh cover up in the belt
and<00:03:32.329> then<00:03:32.449> if<00:03:32.629> you<00:03:32.750> put<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:34.190> bolt<00:03:34.430> back<00:03:34.519> it

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
and then if you put the bolt back it

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.500 
and then if you put the bolt back it
comes<00:03:35.479> out<00:03:35.720> very<00:03:36.650> very<00:03:37.129> very<00:03:37.400> easy<00:03:37.790> so<00:03:38.479> I

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
comes out very very very easy so I

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.939 
comes out very very very easy so I
wouldn't<00:03:38.810> rely<00:03:38.930> on<00:03:39.079> that<00:03:39.349> especially<00:03:39.590> if<00:03:39.859> your

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:39.949 
wouldn't rely on that especially if your

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.500 
wouldn't rely on that especially if your
fingers<00:03:40.250> inside<00:03:40.430> here<00:03:40.790> doing<00:03:41.060> something<00:03:41.269> I

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
fingers inside here doing something I

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.680 
fingers inside here doing something I
would<00:03:41.750> strip<00:03:42.199> the<00:03:42.319> gun<00:03:42.409> and<00:03:42.560> take<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.769> hotel

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
would strip the gun and take the hotel

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.589 
would strip the gun and take the hotel
but<00:03:44.690> other<00:03:44.989> than<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:47.090> gun<00:03:47.269> was<00:03:47.359> very

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
but other than that the gun was very

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:48.129 
but other than that the gun was very
accurate

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
accurate

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.500 
accurate
