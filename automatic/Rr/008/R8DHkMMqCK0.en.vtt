00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.260 

which<00:02:02.330> is<00:02:02.510> here<00:02:03.370> so<00:02:04.370> you<00:02:04.400> place<00:02:04.730> the<00:02:07.270> carriage

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
which is here so you place the carriage

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.090 
which is here so you place the carriage
and<00:02:09.250> place<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.520> passage<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.390> C<00:02:11.830> Class<00:02:12.830> 4

and place the passage of you C Class 4
to<00:02:13.280> 1<00:02:13.430> NB<00:02:13.700> s<00:02:13.790> PV<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.140> C<00:02:16.040> file<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.560> then<00:02:18.770> you

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
to 1 NB s PV is the C file and then you

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:31.450 
to 1 NB s PV is the C file and then you
add<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:21.970> DC<00:02:22.970> SL<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.120> should<00:02:29.300> work<00:02:30.460> let's

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
add the DC SL and it should work let's

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.590 
add the DC SL and it should work let's
just<00:02:31.670> hop<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.850> class<00:02:32.240> 380<00:02:32.660> as<00:02:32.870> well<00:02:34.600> just

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
just hop the class 380 as well just

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.760 
just hop the class 380 as well just
let's<00:02:35.780> see<00:02:35.930> if<00:02:35.990> that<00:02:36.140> works<00:02:36.320> as<00:02:36.500> well<00:02:36.530> and

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
let's see if that works as well and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.950 
let's see if that works as well and
again<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:38.480> go<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:39.370> first<00:02:40.370> Amelia<00:02:40.730> class<00:02:41.660> 380

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
again so go to first Amelia class 380

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:54.960 
again so go to first Amelia class 380
pack<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:44.860> find<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.010> class<00:02:46.250> 380<00:02:47.740> in<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:48.890> list

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:04.650 

right<00:02:55.570> here<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.820> place<00:02:57.820> down<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:59.670> store<00:03:03.660> just

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
right here and place down the store just

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.020 
right here and place down the store just
like<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:05.140> South<00:03:05.470> West<00:03:05.680> Trains<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:09.030> file
