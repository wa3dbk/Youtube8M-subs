that you could do with this I put these
guys<00:00:58.920> I'm<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.550> scale<00:00:59.820> obviously

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
guys I'm here for scale obviously

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.719 
guys I'm here for scale obviously
they're<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:00.629> included<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.789> lot<00:01:03.170> I<00:01:04.729> really

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
they're not included in the lot I really

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.230 
they're not included in the lot I really
have<00:01:06.210> done<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> lot<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.250> ruined<00:01:08.250> terrain<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
have done a lot of ruined terrain and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.539 
have done a lot of ruined terrain and
that's<00:01:10.020> because<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.860> gives<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> lot<00:01:11.490> of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that's because that gives you a lot of

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.850 
that's because that gives you a lot of
wiggle<00:01:12.090> room<00:01:12.270> with<00:01:12.659> mistakes<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.380> stuff<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
wiggle room with mistakes and stuff and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.240 
wiggle room with mistakes and stuff and
to<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.610> real<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.570> people<00:01:16.380> are<00:01:16.530> using<00:01:16.890> this

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
to do real like people are using this

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.730 
to do real like people are using this
it's<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.759> battle<00:01:18.060> zone<00:01:18.290> type<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.500> terrain

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
it's not a battle zone type of terrain

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.090 
it's not a battle zone type of terrain
takes<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.549> lot<00:01:20.790> more<00:01:21.060> materials<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.200> an<00:01:22.350> effort

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
takes a lot more materials and an effort

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.289 
takes a lot more materials and an effort
this<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.430> definitely<00:01:23.880> one<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> better

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
this is definitely one of the better

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.810 
this is definitely one of the better
terrain<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.900> these<00:01:25.590> are<00:01:25.770> modular<00:01:26.009> buildings

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
terrain so these are modular buildings

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.510 
terrain so these are modular buildings
you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.390> even<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.750> scenarios<00:01:28.380> where<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.400> know

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you can even do scenarios where you know

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.850 
you can even do scenarios where you know
there's<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.880> unit<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.360> hiding<00:01:30.869> under<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
there's a unit like hiding under it and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.679 
there's a unit like hiding under it and
you<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> beginning<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> game

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
you know at the beginning of the game

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.450 
you know at the beginning of the game
supposedly<00:01:34.290> they<00:01:34.530> come<00:01:34.740> out<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.250> do

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
supposedly they come out and like do

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.580 
supposedly they come out and like do
some<00:01:35.670> kind<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.909> ambush<00:01:36.210> that's<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.930> one<00:01:37.229> idea

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
some kind of ambush that's that one idea

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
some kind of ambush that's that one idea
that<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.890> had<00:01:38.750> also<00:01:39.750> these<00:01:39.960> stack<00:01:40.619> up<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.040> top<00:01:41.430> of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
that I had also these stack up on top of

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.310 
that I had also these stack up on top of
each<00:01:41.729> other<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.030> make<00:01:42.329> multiple<00:01:42.689> levels

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
each other to make multiple levels

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.740 
each other to make multiple levels
you'll<00:01:43.500> notice<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.070> has<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.390> like<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> ladder

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
you'll notice this has a like a ladder

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.319 
you'll notice this has a like a ladder
and<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.290> door<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:47.820> has<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> nice

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
sense of narrative these have each of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.399 
sense of narrative these have each of
each<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.869> these<00:01:51.990> has<00:01:52.049> two<00:01:52.790> doors<00:01:53.790> or<00:01:54.409> openings
