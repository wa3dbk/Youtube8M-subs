00:00:02.539 --> 00:00:09.559
 I also review Madame Meinkrauv today I 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.570
 decided to upgrade to version 152 it myself 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.150
 the newest version of minecraft which 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.760
 only there is a name with knead or 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.910
 we all go out incredibly and beautiful 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.690
 mods and today i wondered mod one for 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.450
 times up 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.420
 the name of this mod adds maincraft to the game 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.110
 dinosaurs and goes to the first view 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.430
 dinosaur a 1 video giraffe is very similar 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.650
 on the clitoris and the crocodile is it something between 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:41.000
 average between creeper and crocodile 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:44.360
 they hike it resembles a crocodile but by 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.800
 coloring and capacity it is similar to 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:52.180
 creeper as soon as a new knock on him 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.610
 will explode ie you built a house and 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.620
 there is such a passage to your little house 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.770
 in one block the fact that he can climb through 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.579
 calmly then alas your home will be gone 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.760
 or rather 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.540
 also you well and we go to the next 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.500
 I can and the next could look like a speaker yes 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.970
 it is on the cube raptor chicken who remembers 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.549
 from the Jurassic Park 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.240
 raptors are very intelligent creatures they are very 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.250
 run fast and also they are very 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.010
 aggressive as you can see they are very fast 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.610
 makes publishes such sounds as soon as 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.080
 watching it makes sounds like 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.960
 call their kinsmen 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.750
 that is, they can be held such as a bar and 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.380
 you just tear to pieces well and we turn 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.020
 to the next foot the next can it 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.680
 the inhabitants of the world this and only 4 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.920
 not for why added 4 total mob it 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:54.430
 spacing lane it looks like this 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:57.670
 like a spider enderman this is ore save 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.670
 This is a block of stone, but to the dollar, which give 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.990
 teleports this internet with ore a 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.479
 This speaker enderman and she Emperor 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.130
 he is very fast teleporting besides 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.620
 the fact that he himself is Orihime 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.180
 and so he also teleports to the merchant 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.610
 but we move on to the next mobs 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.540
 the next mod is a branded raptor yes 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.090
 he himself is the inhabitant of the world of hell they are like this 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.640
 look they dwell exclusively in hell 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.310
 but if they somehow get you 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.220
 through the portal to the house then alas your home 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.120
 will no longer be because they are late 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.190
 pierce cute you they are firstly the same 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.310
 aggressive like other types of raptors 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.270
 but they also set fire to 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.840
 myself leaving 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.780
 he is not a trace and a drop of them they are pretty 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.270
 stronger and better to flood them because 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.360
 that they just die from water as well 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.950
 you can beat them as cosmic words 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.019
 just wish and i say right away 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.100
 diamond armor will not help you 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:06.209
 and we go further but very similar to 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.150
 Ocelot more accurate two-meter ocelot 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.940
 make sounds like cats such a dog 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.239
 when he is not accustomed to his formidable apples 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.480
 green agar glasses black contacts and his 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.420
 before the bone he immediately went 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.200
 turns green and the eyeball 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:30.160
 must and apples are white but beyond that 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.380
 when you hit him his eyes 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.170
 apples will turn red he is very strong 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.299
 and aggressive but if you have any 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.900
 then he is calm 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.900
 kill your enemy well and we go on 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.360
 and then he is awesome Karen Park 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.280
 the jurassic period is a tyrannosaurus rex yes 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.430
 exactly tyrannosaurus rex 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.909
 but here the author will change a little 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.780
 took his cow milked yes and my cinnamon 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:11.480
 a dog is only a young child 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.730
 hatched here we have not learned but he 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.180
 still small and has not grown prefixes 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.600
 which dad or mom this baby has 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.240
 notice he makes sounds like these 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:28.010
 Tyrannosaurus Rex as well as cows 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.389
 if you drop 10 skin and meat from 10 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.699
 meat look 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:35.860
 I think the author of this mod 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:41.539
 exclusively all such main attention 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:43.630
 acquired to the sounds of sounds and all such 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.120
 small items 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.539
 all diffusers is a dinosaur 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.800
 powered by our sponsors as you can see there 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.470
 for weight and for meat 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.190
 but soon if he is pretty there for lunch 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:01.820
 will be like that and he will kill you even if 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:07.789
 you are you on the verge of where the March 2 attacks even 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:10.000
