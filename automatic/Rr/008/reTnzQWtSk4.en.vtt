00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.880
 it is true and he used photography a lot to remember holidays 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.190
 events for 100 and 2 served this is one of the important roles 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.610
 of photography to tax memory 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.020
 but it is not the only one the photograph also has other papers for example 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.749
 as for example being the expression of the photographer's personal sensitivity 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.009
 photography is not only a document but can also be a way of 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.550
 express hutu own vision of reality 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.610
 then it is an artistic way I know how painting for example not 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.710
 exactly like the painting or because you see the painter or sculptor actually reproduced 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.949
 a scene or do their cultures without necessarily having this connection 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.220
 direct with the reality that on the contrary is necessary for the 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.610
 photographer with photography always emerges from a scene actually happened 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.380
 in which the photographer was witnessing his moment 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.770
 in painting that often does not happen 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.220
 since the painter can paint a scene that took place or not that he has heard 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.220
 relate or also that he has imagined 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.090
 percent some streams of paint tried to reduce this distance 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.390
 this subject and his representations in the box 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.190
 as, for example, the impressionists made the 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.460
 interpretation by the artist is more important than the painting 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.350
 Photography 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.819
 because there is no such close forced connection with reality 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.390
 so 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.650
 if the connection between reality and photography is so close 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.980
 what is the margin of creativity that I can contribute as a photographer 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.510
 look, there is a connection with reality but photographer is the one who chooses 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.030
 how to represent this reality and I can do using the means that the 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.710
 photography provides you 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.820
 first choosing specific subjects instead of others 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.720
 already in this there is a subjective interpretation 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.080
 then choosing the type of frame or also using the means that the 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.070
 technique makes us available as long times flat planes approaches 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.900
 different 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.340
 or in levels approach even the same choice before the blusher in 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.119
 black and white is always a lesson suggestive of photographer 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.429
 today even the memory role that photography has is not totally objective 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.700
 yes but what do you mean 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.170
 because I think that reality can not be modified in fact the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.539
 photography can change the reality 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.369
 and it is in the retouched photo that already existed with the analogical photography is not 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:16.089
 practice only in digital photography 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.510
 is a bit what also happens with the video where with the cuts the 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:22.169
 mounts can convey a sensation 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:25.239
 besides the reality that is represented in a photograph also 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.380
 it can be partial 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.189
 not necessarily be all reality 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.069
 nobody will skywalk that that is what really happened 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.229
 think for example the discussions that still exist about the photo of the 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:36.919
 robert militiaman coat 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.889
 still do not know if it's a scene was something that really happened or if it was 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.609
 built with a model that lent itself to dinner 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.939
 then it is necessary to understand the reality is indeed that 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.939
 opposition was not about the presentation that the photo transmits 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:54.079
 often the caption can change the interpretation that we give an image 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.699
 exact so we're talking about the modification of the image or the 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:58.769
 reality itself 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.150
 we are talking about the modification of an image as well as the fact of 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.230
 that reality can be constructed artificially in order to transmit it 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.969
 in a photographic image then you are telling me that I should not have to be shaken 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.949
 not that maybe it's a bit exaggerated anyway as I said before 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.999
 photography have the memory a primary role 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:18.070
 surely not all that reality 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.300
 Even though your trip takes you home the pictures sure were a file 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.140
 interesting of your memories and of the emotions that you view is important 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.970
 try to photograph also to keep that file then what 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.820
 You say it's not bad 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.330
 for example, when traveling, photograph the famous monuments 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:40.509
 it's not that you should be careful in looking for your subjects you do not necessarily have to 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:43.759
 photograph what is most famous or what all photograph 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.809
 You must have an attentive eye and look for subjects that transmit emotions to you 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:50.049
 try to reproduce the entities photographs 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.549
 and try will also rotate around the subject because normally it should not 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.229
 reproduce the most common frames with the photos that you already saw, but 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:58.709
 you must have a vision of yours 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.229
 and then it does not matter, it's just a subject that interested you and you like to 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:03.889
 you 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.139
 the important thing 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.459
 is that it transmits emotions worthy of being represented in the photo 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.679
 yes but this whole thing makes me think that photography is really going 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:16.859
 very related to the past and looks little towards the future 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.180
 no photography is related to the past 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.789
 but you also hear about present and future 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.860
 piece in the big journalistic surveys that through a 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.069
 reportage can denounce the effects of human action or effects 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.210
 of a war 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.870
 and also think about fashion photography or some advertising campaigns 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.060
 they try with images to suggest a proposal of stylistic canons that 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.930
 maybe they would be followed by the community in the future
