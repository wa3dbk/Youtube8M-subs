currently in blue mode you can tell this

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.430 
currently in blue mode you can tell this
by<00:03:47.090> these<00:03:47.239> little<00:03:47.480> blue<00:03:47.629> dots<00:03:47.900> if<00:03:48.260> you

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
by these little blue dots if you

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.680 
by these little blue dots if you
right-click<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:49.040> changes<00:03:49.940> it<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.120> red<00:03:50.419> dots

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
right-click it changes it to red dots

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.379 
right-click it changes it to red dots
and<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.799> remember<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.250> said<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:53.150> worked

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
and you remember it said that it worked

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.439 
and you remember it said that it worked
off<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.959> strength<00:03:54.319> of<00:03:54.560> redstone<00:03:55.190> signals<00:03:55.819> now

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
off the strength of redstone signals now

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.629 
off the strength of redstone signals now
there<00:03:56.840> is<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:56.959> way<00:03:57.620> different<00:03:58.010> ways<00:03:58.250> of<00:03:58.340> doing

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
there is a way different ways of doing

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.640 
there is a way different ways of doing
this<00:03:59.260> you<00:04:00.260> could<00:04:00.530> say<00:04:00.919> for<00:04:01.099> example<00:04:02.590> doing<00:04:03.590> a

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
this you could say for example doing a

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.379 
this you could say for example doing a
bit<00:04:03.859> like<00:04:04.069> this<00:04:05.230> like<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:06.500> now<00:04:07.280> a<00:04:07.609> week<00:04:08.000> that

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
bit like this like that now a week that

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.000 
bit like this like that now a week that
would<00:04:08.510> be<00:04:08.690> weaker<00:04:09.079> obviously<00:04:09.650> so<00:04:09.799> it<00:04:09.889> would

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
would be weaker obviously so it would

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.309 
would be weaker obviously so it would
have<00:04:10.220> less<00:04:10.459> pull<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.870> this<00:04:12.019> one<00:04:12.199> would

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
have less pull and this one would

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.420 
have less pull and this one would
obviously<00:04:12.500> be<00:04:12.650> stronger<00:04:13.040> so<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.250> without

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
obviously be stronger so it without

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.339 
obviously be stronger so it without
Marple<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:14.750> why<00:04:14.840> don't<00:04:14.959> we<00:04:15.019> turn<00:04:15.169> this<00:04:15.290> thing

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
Marple so why don't we turn this thing

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.580 
Marple so why don't we turn this thing
on<00:04:15.590> oh<00:04:16.090> look<00:04:17.090> at<00:04:17.239> them<00:04:17.479> particle<00:04:18.229> effects

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
on oh look at them particle effects

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.009 
on oh look at them particle effects
you've<00:04:18.799> got<00:04:18.950> to<00:04:19.070> love<00:04:19.159> that<00:04:19.340> particle

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
you've got to love that particle

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.659 
you've got to love that particle
guys<00:04:20.349> and<00:04:20.859> this<00:04:21.009> would<00:04:21.069> be<00:04:21.160> very<00:04:21.370> very<00:04:21.459> useful

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
guys and this would be very very useful

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.279 
guys and this would be very very useful
to<00:04:22.150> stick<00:04:22.389> in<00:04:22.539> the<00:04:22.629> middle<00:04:22.780> I<00:04:23.020> don't<00:04:23.229> know

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
to stick in the middle I don't know

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.990 
to stick in the middle I don't know
maybe<00:04:23.470> of<00:04:23.680> a<00:04:23.740> mob<00:04:23.949> trap<00:04:24.190> or<00:04:24.400> something<00:04:24.550> like

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
maybe of a mob trap or something like

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.839 
maybe of a mob trap or something like
that<00:04:25.060> because<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.780> pulls<00:04:26.110> items<00:04:26.740> towards<00:04:27.699> you

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
that because it pulls items towards you

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:30.210 
that because it pulls items towards you
at<00:04:28.300> towards<00:04:28.750> then<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.319> there<00:04:29.530> goes<00:04:29.740> my<00:04:29.949> wooden

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
at towards then and there goes my wooden

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.700 
at towards then and there goes my wooden
golem<00:04:30.580> from<00:04:30.729> my<00:04:30.819> other<00:04:31.750> thing<00:04:32.349> that<00:04:32.379> one's

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
golem from my other thing that one's

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.559 
golem from my other thing that one's
show<00:04:32.919> you<00:04:32.979> in<00:04:33.129> a<00:04:33.190> second<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:34.000> what<00:04:34.330> you<00:04:34.419> cook

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
show you in a second and what you cook

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.260 
show you in a second and what you cook
off<00:04:34.750> so<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:35.319> can<00:04:35.500> change<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.669> way<00:04:36.819> that<00:04:37.090> this

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
off so you can change the way that this

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.830 
off so you can change the way that this
works<00:04:37.479> push<00:04:38.050> items<00:04:38.409> away<00:04:42.150> under<00:04:43.150> luckily<00:04:43.629> for

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
works push items away under luckily for

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.510 
works push items away under luckily for
me<00:04:43.990> I've<00:04:44.830> got<00:04:45.039> another<00:04:47.250> one<00:04:48.250> over<00:04:48.430> there

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
me I've got another one over there

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.379 
me I've got another one over there
that's<00:04:48.970> pulling<00:04:50.580> as<00:04:51.580> you<00:04:51.699> can<00:04:51.819> see<00:04:51.970> it's

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
that's pulling as you can see it's

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:53.760 
that's pulling as you can see it's
flying<00:04:52.659> them<00:04:52.840> away<00:04:53.050> there<00:04:53.259> and<00:04:53.440> it's<00:04:53.560> quite<00:04:53.740> a

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
flying them away there and it's quite a

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.230 
flying them away there and it's quite a
distance<00:04:54.039> sighs<00:04:54.430> it's<00:04:54.819> quite<00:04:55.000> a<00:04:55.030> distance

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
distance sighs it's quite a distance

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.089 
distance sighs it's quite a distance
that's<00:04:55.599> using<00:04:55.930> that<00:04:56.080> one<00:04:56.289> what<00:04:56.889> about<00:04:56.979> a

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
that's using that one what about a

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.890 
that's using that one what about a
weaker<00:04:57.490> signal<00:05:00.150> it<00:05:01.150> still<00:05:01.419> looks<00:05:01.599> to<00:05:01.750> be<00:05:01.870> a

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
weaker signal it still looks to be a

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.649 
weaker signal it still looks to be a
pretty<00:05:01.960> sizable<00:05:02.919> distance<00:05:03.310> which<00:05:03.460> is<00:05:03.490> good<00:05:03.849> so

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
pretty sizable distance which is good so

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.450 
pretty sizable distance which is good so
that's<00:05:04.870> what<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.740> thumb<00:05:06.009> static

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
that's what the the thumb static

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.460 
that's what the the thumb static
magnetizer<00:05:07.210> does<00:05:07.479> is<00:05:07.900> very<00:05:08.139> very<00:05:08.319> useful

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
magnetizer does is very very useful

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.260 
magnetizer does is very very useful
except<00:05:09.009> just<00:05:09.220> got<00:05:09.310> a<00:05:09.340> chest<00:05:09.639> over<00:05:09.909> here<00:05:10.090> now

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
except just got a chest over here now

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.790 
except just got a chest over here now
you<00:05:10.330> could<00:05:10.539> put<00:05:10.690> a<00:05:10.720> hungry<00:05:11.080> chest<00:05:11.319> next<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.650> it

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
you could put a hungry chest next to it

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.770 
you could put a hungry chest next to it
but<00:05:12.190> I<00:05:12.250> tried<00:05:12.490> a<00:05:12.520> hungry<00:05:12.880> chest<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:15.780> it

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
but I tried a hungry chest and it it

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.450 
but I tried a hungry chest and it it
doesn't<00:05:17.110> recognize<00:05:17.590> like<00:05:17.770> items<00:05:18.190> that<00:05:18.340> come

doesn't recognize like items that come
around<00:05:18.580> this<00:05:18.819> side<00:05:18.879> so<00:05:19.259> really<00:05:20.259> a<00:05:20.409> little

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
around this side so really a little

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.459 
around this side so really a little

wooden golem stick a gesture and this

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.770 
wooden golem stick a gesture and this
thing<00:05:23.650> I'm<00:05:23.800> going<00:05:24.030> well<00:05:25.030> I<00:05:25.210> don't<00:05:25.599> know<00:05:25.719> if

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
this works on entities that would be

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.300 
this works on entities that would be
very<00:05:28.090> nice<00:05:28.360> few<00:05:28.690> words<00:05:28.900> mb's<00:05:29.650> I've<00:05:29.949> never

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.020 
said he's changing Thaumcraft when it

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:26.350 
said he's changing Thaumcraft when it
goes<00:07:21.200> into<00:07:21.410> 1.6<00:07:22.280> and<00:07:22.729> the<00:07:23.470> the<00:07:24.470> update<00:07:25.039> 3<00:07:25.430> 3.1
