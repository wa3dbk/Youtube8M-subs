apply it to a rock chip or scratch then

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.890 
apply it to a rock chip or scratch then

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and it's going to look a little bit

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.160 
and it's going to look a little bit
messy<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:45.359> then<00:00:45.510> you're<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> apply<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
messy but then you're going to apply the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.200 
messy but then you're going to apply the
seal<00:00:46.680> ax<00:00:46.890> solution<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.640> that's<00:00:47.850> going<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
seal ax solution and that's going to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.240 
seal ax solution and that's going to
remove<00:00:48.480> all<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> excess<00:00:49.260> touch-up<00:00:49.829> paint<00:00:50.070> and

two inches from the car and it's really
hard<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:42.500> touch-ups<00:01:43.500> unless<00:01:43.799> you're

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
hard to see the touch-ups unless you're

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.950 
hard to see the touch-ups unless you're
really<00:01:44.189> up<00:01:44.490> close<00:01:47.329> now<00:01:48.329> I'm<00:01:48.450> going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> zoom
