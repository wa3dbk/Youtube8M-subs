upgrade on the opposite side 69 for
artosis<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.610> really<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.030> kind<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.240> an

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
artosis and really this is kind of an

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.950 
artosis and really this is kind of an
artifact<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:35.220> resources<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.909> 82<00:01:36.299> out<00:01:36.810> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
artifact of the resources in 82 out of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.370

101<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.640> rain<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.990> again<00:01:40.200> yeah

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
101 on for in rain and just again yeah

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.870 
101 on for in rain and just again yeah
the<00:01:40.530> longer<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.770> goes<00:01:40.920> looks<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.310> artosis

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the longer this goes looks like artosis

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.789 
the longer this goes looks like artosis
in<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> meantime<00:01:42.659> has<00:01:42.899> expanded<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
should say SCV's the bottom left-hand

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.749 
should say SCV's the bottom left-hand
corner<00:01:52.619> looks<00:01:52.979> like<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> dark<00:01:53.340> templar<00:01:53.670> is

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
corner looks like a dark templar is

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.800 
corner looks like a dark templar is

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
there which he morphed going to go up

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.920 
there which he morphed going to go up
and<00:02:01.710> do<00:02:01.799> what<00:02:01.829> he<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.570> looks<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.719> ya<00:02:03.899> know

in the meantime though and yeah only it
looks<00:02:14.070> like<00:02:14.220> what<00:02:14.430> two<00:02:14.610> turrets<00:02:14.790> defend

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
looks like what two turrets defend

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.180

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
be enough artosis realizes it cancels

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.410 
be enough artosis realizes it cancels
that<00:02:18.900> command<00:02:19.230> center<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.370> let's<00:02:21.030> see<00:02:21.150> fee<00:02:21.300> it

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
that command center and let's see fee it

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.250 
that command center and let's see fee it
doesn't<00:02:21.660> look<00:02:21.720> like<00:02:21.810> he's<00:02:21.960> going<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.140> be<00:02:22.200> able

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
doesn't look like he's going to be able

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
meals cleaning up the attack there and

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.640 
meals cleaning up the attack there and
it<00:02:38.880> looks<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:39.060> they're<00:02:39.270> pushing<00:02:39.570> over<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.960> lot

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650

want to lose that in the bottom right
corner<00:02:43.550> again<00:02:44.550> thought<00:02:44.760> can't<00:02:45.540> doing<00:02:45.780> what<00:02:45.930> he

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
corner again thought can't doing what he

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.510 
corner again thought can't doing what he
can<00:02:46.020> as<00:02:46.320> far<00:02:46.470> as<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.709> resources<00:02:47.160> go<00:02:47.310> looks

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
can as far as the resources go looks

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.500 
can as far as the resources go looks
like<00:02:47.550> we're<00:02:47.700> going<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.910> see<00:02:48.030> an<00:02:48.150> overlord

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
like we're going to see an overlord
