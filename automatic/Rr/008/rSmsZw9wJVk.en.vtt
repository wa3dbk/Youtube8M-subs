think it is going to be to be button

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.310 
think it is going to be to be button
because<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.039> usually<00:00:56.250> reloading<00:00:57.120> um<00:00:57.320> be

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
because that is usually reloading um be

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.010 
because that is usually reloading um be
on<00:00:58.590> xbox<00:00:58.890> controllers<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.600> think<00:01:00.899> it's

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
on xbox controllers and it think it's

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.410 
on xbox controllers and it think it's
the<00:01:01.140> circle<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> pc<00:01:02.100> playstation<00:01:02.550> 3<00:01:03.180> it's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the circle on the pc playstation 3 it's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.090 
the circle on the pc playstation 3 it's
this<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.409> nothing<00:01:04.860> really

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
this is this is nothing really

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.190 
this is this is nothing really
spectacular<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.720> kind<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> nice<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
spectacular but it's kind of nice to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.620 
spectacular but it's kind of nice to
know<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.619> makes<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.979> game<00:01:08.220> more<00:01:08.610> realistic<00:01:09.510> in

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
know it makes the game more realistic in

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.600 
know it makes the game more realistic in
my<00:01:09.720> opinion<00:01:09.990> because<00:01:10.229> probably<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.280> will<00:01:11.400> also

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
my opinion because probably it will also

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.080 
my opinion because probably it will also
have<00:01:12.000> his<00:01:12.210> own<00:01:12.360> animation<00:01:13.369> to<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.670> character

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
have his own animation to the character

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.510 
have his own animation to the character
picking<00:01:15.570> up<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.409> hand<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.159> don't<00:01:17.460> know

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
picking up with this hand I don't know

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.340 
picking up with this hand I don't know
the<00:01:17.670> ammo<00:01:17.850> from<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> gun<00:01:18.509> that's<00:01:18.750> laying<00:01:18.990> down

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the ammo from the gun that's laying down

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.410 
the ammo from the gun that's laying down
on<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> ground<00:01:19.970> that<00:01:20.970> would<00:01:21.090> be<00:01:21.210> more

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
on the ground that would be more

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.660 
on the ground that would be more
realistic<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.740> having<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.040> would<00:01:23.580> be

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
realistic just just having that would be

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.910 
realistic just just having that would be
nice<00:01:23.820> ok<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> next<00:01:24.840> thing<00:01:25.229> released<00:01:25.680> was

you know this is something that makes

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.050 
you know this is something that makes
this<00:02:23.900> game<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.140> lot<00:02:24.500> more<00:02:24.739> realistic<00:02:25.160> than<00:02:25.459> gta4

in<00:03:38.239> Grand<00:03:38.420> Theft<00:03:38.540> Auto<00:03:38.720> especially<00:03:39.349> from<00:03:39.530> you

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
in Grand Theft Auto especially from you

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.339 
in Grand Theft Auto especially from you
know<00:03:39.739> people<00:03:40.130> who<00:03:40.220> work<00:03:40.549> in<00:03:40.730> this<00:03:40.880> business<00:03:41.349> so

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
know people who work in this business so

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.960 
know people who work in this business so
yeah<00:03:42.560> that's<00:03:42.799> something<00:03:43.099> nice<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.579> know<00:03:43.700> in<00:03:43.849> my

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
yeah that's something nice to know in my

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.180 
yeah that's something nice to know in my
opinion<00:03:44.239> ok<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:44.810> moving<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.769> is<00:03:45.859> impossible

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
opinion ok so moving on it is impossible

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.509 
opinion ok so moving on it is impossible
to<00:03:46.549> shoe<00:03:47.180> trends<00:03:47.660> so<00:03:48.079> you<00:03:48.139> probably<00:03:48.680> cannot

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
to shoe trends so you probably cannot

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.190 
to shoe trends so you probably cannot
kill<00:03:49.760> trevor<00:03:50.120> when<00:03:50.660> you're<00:03:50.780> playing<00:03:51.049> with

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
kill trevor when you're playing with

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.159 
kill trevor when you're playing with
Franklin<00:03:51.799> or<00:03:51.950> some<00:03:52.910> other<00:03:53.000> friends<00:03:53.329> and<00:03:53.780> I

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
Franklin or some other friends and I

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.599 
Franklin or some other friends and I
don't<00:03:54.349> really<00:03:54.470> give<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.680> shit<00:03:54.859> about<00:03:54.919> this<00:03:55.340> it's

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
don't really give a shit about this it's

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.400 
don't really give a shit about this it's
uh<00:03:55.730> something<00:03:56.599> that<00:03:56.750> makes<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.079> game<00:03:57.230> more

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
uh something that makes the game more

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.729 
uh something that makes the game more
realistic<00:03:57.859> and<00:03:58.310> it<00:03:58.730> doesn't<00:03:59.180> because<00:03:59.780> if<00:04:00.019> we

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
realistic and it doesn't because if we

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.580 
realistic and it doesn't because if we
were<00:04:00.950> able<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.430> shoot<00:04:01.790> friends<00:04:02.329> and<00:04:03.109> we<00:04:03.440> need

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
were able to shoot friends and we need

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.800 
were able to shoot friends and we need
to<00:04:03.620> do<00:04:03.859> a<00:04:03.889> mission<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.910> know<00:04:05.030> they're<00:04:05.630> back

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
to do a mission you know they're back

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.610 
to do a mission you know they're back
alive<00:04:06.200> so<00:04:06.829> that's<00:04:07.519> pointless<00:04:08.120> so<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:08.989> can<00:04:09.470> see

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
alive so that's pointless so you can see

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.770 
alive so that's pointless so you can see
from<00:04:09.859> two<00:04:10.130> sides<00:04:10.370> but<00:04:10.880> you<00:04:11.180> know<00:04:11.269> I<00:04:11.480> don't

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
from two sides but you know I don't

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.690 
from two sides but you know I don't
really<00:04:11.959> care<00:04:12.200> about<00:04:12.260> this<00:04:12.620> ok<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.040> moving<00:04:13.370> on

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
really care about this ok so moving on

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.940 
really care about this ok so moving on
the<00:04:13.970> line<00:04:14.269> of<00:04:14.450> sight<00:04:14.750> system<00:04:15.319> works<00:04:15.709> as

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
the line of sight system works as

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.490 
the line of sight system works as
perfectly<00:04:16.489> as<00:04:16.760> a<00:04:16.849> stealth<00:04:17.630> game<00:04:17.750> again<00:04:18.320> this

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
perfectly as a stealth game again this

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.399 
perfectly as a stealth game again this
is<00:04:18.560> something<00:04:18.829> that<00:04:19.130> um<00:04:20.079> doesn't<00:04:21.079> add

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.409 
is something that um doesn't add

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.589 
is something that um doesn't add
something<00:04:21.979> nice<00:04:22.490> to<00:04:22.760> it<00:04:22.909> you<00:04:23.060> know<00:04:23.150> it's<00:04:23.360> it's

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
something that you don't recognize

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.870 
something that you don't recognize
because
