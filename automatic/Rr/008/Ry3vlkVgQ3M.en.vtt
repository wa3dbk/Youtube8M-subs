think that really is what sets them

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.570 
think that really is what sets them
apart<00:00:50.630> what<00:00:51.500> I<00:00:51.530> value<00:00:52.010> quite<00:00:52.280> a<00:00:52.310> bit

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
apart what I value quite a bit

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.550 
apart what I value quite a bit

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
especially after graduation coming to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.350 
especially after graduation coming to
grad<00:00:54.800> school<00:00:55.160> you're<00:00:55.490> very<00:00:55.610> focused<00:00:56.120> on<00:00:56.240> your

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
grad school you're very focused on your

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.450 
grad school you're very focused on your
studies<00:00:56.480> but<00:00:57.020> a<00:00:57.290> lot<00:00:57.710> of<00:00:57.740> times<00:00:58.040> maybe<00:00:58.280> you

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
studies but a lot of times maybe you

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.340 
studies but a lot of times maybe you
don't<00:00:58.640> get<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.180> community<00:00:59.390> atmosphere<00:00:59.810> and

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
don't get the community atmosphere and

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.050 
don't get the community atmosphere and
overall<00:01:00.740> the<00:01:00.830> university<00:01:01.340> atmosphere<00:01:01.850> that

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 
overall the university atmosphere that

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.400 
overall the university atmosphere that
you<00:01:02.180> would<00:01:02.330> get<00:01:02.450> just<00:01:02.750> being<00:01:02.930> an<00:01:03.020> undergrad

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
you would get just being an undergrad

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.200 
you would get just being an undergrad
because<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:03.860> are<00:01:03.980> so<00:01:04.250> focused<00:01:04.549> on<00:01:04.939> what

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
because you are so focused on what

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.060 
because you are so focused on what
you're<00:01:05.390> there<00:01:05.600> for<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:06.439> I<00:01:06.500> think<00:01:06.530> Ambrose
