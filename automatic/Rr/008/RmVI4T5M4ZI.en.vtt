 first of all in circles 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.649
 concentric if you see here 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.649

 what beauty here the only bad thing is that 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.120
 Suddenly the color of the beets is passed to 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.250
 potatoes should be treated with 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.830
 it's like to serve it later then because 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.730
 if they are not going to stain the potato of 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.229
 Beetle and then that does not want 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:14.989
 and we are going to put another leg 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:20.560
 and well not in a circle is then at 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.560
 center let's put some arugula 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.850
 then a little bit of arugula to the 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.370
 center 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:35.569
 on this compass we are going to put 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.810
 a little bit of him 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.790
 without bed 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:45.710
 one as a ball of jícama we are going to do 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.140
 If a ball pretty jicama 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.720
 and then we will put some 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.660
 carrot 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.850

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.970
 Beet if they want 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.540
 to do the color contrast 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.100
 here he goes to another one and here he goes to another one 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.310
 nice pimp pretty good how fast I give 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.220
 very nice and now let's make a 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.440
 very simple vinaigrette nothing complicated 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.260
 because the beets already have a lot of flavor 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.670
 it has a lot of aroma the potato neutralized 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.920
 a little bit but we do not want to be robbed 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.450
 the taste of the bull is also very 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.430
 aromatic then let's make a 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.580
 very simple vinaigrette let's put 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.690
 lemon let's season with a little salt 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.930
 and pepper we are going to mix to incorporate 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.170
 the salt we are going to add olive oil 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.140
 to the thread 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.140
 I am successful not to the thread 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.300
 well in others until alleviating our 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.900
 vinaigrette 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.200
 already with that is good 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.760
 and we are going to put 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.760
 a little vinaigrette 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.730
 Where is 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:11.269
 to the installed let's see 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.920
 vinaigrette to the lettuce this is for 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.920
 serve at the moment because if not really 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.820
 you can pass all the colors of the 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.250
 beet the beet is an excellent 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.660
 food has a lot of fiber very much 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.490
 water vitamins all this minerals 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.250
 has protein the potato is an excellent 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.660
 carbohydrate source is starch 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.490
 this this helps the glucose in the 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.460
 body gradually loosens 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.620
 other than the insulin guamazo and the 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.050
 glucose arm and then you come the 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.510
 sugar lows and then feel more 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.340
 headaches tired then

 Serve it well, cool, well, and it's going 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.770
 to be delicious is the can
