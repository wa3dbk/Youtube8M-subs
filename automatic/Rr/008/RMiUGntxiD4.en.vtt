00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.729 
forward so let's review the goblet squat
how<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.539> fix<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:48.960> these<00:00:49.079> problems<00:00:49.500> place<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
how to fix all these problems place a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.830 
how to fix all these problems place a
dumbbell<00:00:50.250> against<00:00:50.520> your<00:00:50.700> chest<00:00:50.910> you're<00:00:51.600> going

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
dumbbell against your chest you're going

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.479 
dumbbell against your chest you're going
to<00:00:51.960> descend<00:00:52.320> straight<00:00:52.620> down<00:00:52.829> keeping<00:00:53.039> your

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
to descend straight down keeping your

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.910 
to descend straight down keeping your
hips<00:00:53.640> open<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.329> you're<00:00:54.750> bracing<00:00:55.410> your<00:00:55.530> core

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
hips open and you're bracing your core

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.040 
hips open and you're bracing your core
to<00:00:56.370> remain<00:00:56.760> vertical<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.600> other<00:00:57.780> words

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
to remain vertical in other words

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.290 
to remain vertical in other words
because<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.010> weight<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.760> front<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.210> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
because the weight is in front of you

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.660 
because the weight is in front of you
it's<00:01:00.510> forcing<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.469> core<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.980> remain<00:01:02.280> tight

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it's forcing your core to remain tight

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.640 
it's forcing your core to remain tight
and<00:01:02.910> by<00:01:03.149> having<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.539> tight<00:01:03.840> core<00:01:04.260> it'll<00:01:04.589> be

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
and by having a tight core it'll be

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.649 
and by having a tight core it'll be
easier<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> rise<00:01:05.519> out<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> hole<00:01:06.270> that's<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
easier to rise out of the hole that's a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.450 
easier to rise out of the hole that's a
big<00:01:06.869> tip<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.229> give<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.040> let's<00:01:08.250> take

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
descend a parallel my knees are going

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.330

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
because there's an anterior load it's

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.030 
because there's an anterior load it's
loaded<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.600> front<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.140> forces<00:01:28.740> two

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
weight up these two subtle tips will fix

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.080 
weight up these two subtle tips will fix
most<00:01:40.619> problems<00:01:41.159> when<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.430> comes<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.790> squat

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
most problems when it comes to the squat

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.030 
most problems when it comes to the squat
if<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.869> goblet<00:01:43.200> squat<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.649> regular

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
if you do the goblet squat on a regular

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.679 
if you do the goblet squat on a regular
basis<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.610> lot<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.060> these<00:01:45.149> problems<00:01:45.479> should<00:01:45.509> go

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
basis a lot of these problems should go

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.990 
basis a lot of these problems should go
away<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> left<00:01:46.670> incorrect<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
away so on the left incorrect on the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.600 
away so on the left incorrect on the
right<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.360> correct<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.740> big<00:01:50.009> difference<00:01:50.460> is

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
right is correct the big difference is

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.969 
right is correct the big difference is
that<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> goblet<00:01:51.869> squat<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.590> provide

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that I have the goblet squat to provide

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.490 
that I have the goblet squat to provide
that<00:01:53.159> resistance<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:54.090> cue<00:01:54.509> my<00:01:54.689> body<00:01:54.960> correctly

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that resistance to cue my body correctly

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.830 
that resistance to cue my body correctly
to<00:01:56.130> cue<00:01:56.340> my<00:01:56.430> body<00:01:56.670> want<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> brace<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.630> core

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
to cue my body want to brace the core

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.350 
to cue my body want to brace the core
and<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> keep<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.710> chest<00:01:59.070> up<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.520> well<00:02:00.180> I

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
and to to keep the chest up as well I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.840 
and to to keep the chest up as well I
make<00:02:00.869> sure<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.110> remain<00:02:01.649> or<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.310> keep<00:02:02.520> my<00:02:02.700> hips

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
make sure to remain or to keep my hips

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.880 
make sure to remain or to keep my hips
open<00:02:03.180> for<00:02:03.420> them<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.689> remain<00:02:04.049> open<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.680> this

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
open for them to remain open and this

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.770 
open for them to remain open and this
makes<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.250> big<00:02:05.399> difference<00:02:05.820> another<00:02:06.210> big<00:02:06.509> tip<00:02:06.659> I

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
