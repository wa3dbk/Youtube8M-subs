00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
decided to take that off because it just

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.760 
decided to take that off because it just
didn't<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.210> flare<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.110> wanted<00:00:34.559> and

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
it's just I don't know I think that's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.149 
it's just I don't know I think that's
really<00:01:16.080> gorgeous<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.299> then<00:01:18.650> on<00:01:19.650> top<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.979> that

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
really gorgeous and then on top of that

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.920 
really gorgeous and then on top of that
it's<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.909> deadly<00:01:21.689> sharp<00:01:23.360> just<00:01:24.360> sails<00:01:24.659> right

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
it's just deadly sharp just sails right

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.660 
it's just deadly sharp just sails right
through<00:01:25.799> paper<00:01:26.600> um<00:01:30.680> aside<00:01:31.680> from<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.430> also

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
through paper um aside from that I also

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.670 
through paper um aside from that I also
have<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:33.930> has<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> very

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
have this one and this one has a very

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.399 
have this one and this one has a very
similar<00:01:35.189> rat<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.030> except<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.659> blue<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
similar rat to it except it's blue and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.130 
similar rat to it except it's blue and
black<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:40.610> as<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.869> blade

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
black and as you can see the the blade

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.450 
black and as you can see the the blade
design<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.829> quite<00:01:44.070> odd<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:46.619> happened<00:01:47.130> more<00:01:47.280> on

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
design is quite odd it happened more on

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.590 
design is quite odd it happened more on
accident<00:01:48.060> than<00:01:48.240> anything<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:50.009> has<00:01:50.310> a

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
accident than anything but it has a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.719 
accident than anything but it has a
sharpened<00:01:51.600> choil<00:01:51.930> there<00:01:52.320> that's<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.399> reason

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
sharpened choil there that's the reason

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.510 
sharpened choil there that's the reason
for<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.740> used<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:56.189> cutting

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
for that is it's to be used for cutting

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.179 
for that is it's to be used for cutting
paracord<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:57.930> loop<00:01:58.290> paracord<00:01:58.950> in

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
paracord so I can just loop paracord in

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.289 
paracord so I can just loop paracord in
here<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.759> pull<00:02:00.240> into<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.960> cut<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:02.119> then<00:02:03.119> of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
here and pull into the cut and then of

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.569 
here and pull into the cut and then of
course<00:02:03.329> chisel<00:02:04.290> ground<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.310> all

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
course chisel ground this is all

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.580 
course chisel ground this is all
sharpened<00:02:06.210> area<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:07.110> those<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.530> there

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
sharpened area and for those out there

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.499 
sharpened area and for those out there
you<00:02:08.039> don't<00:02:08.069> think<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:08.940> get<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> chisel

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
you don't think you can get a chisel

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.010 
you don't think you can get a chisel
ground<00:02:09.720> knife<00:02:09.989> sharp

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
ground knife sharp

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.150 
ground knife sharp
let<00:02:11.980> me<00:02:12.070> show<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.280> this<00:02:12.610> this<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.160> primary

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
let me show you this this is the primary

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.110 
let me show you this this is the primary
blade<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:17.860> sails<00:02:18.370> right<00:02:18.640> through

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
blade that just sails right through

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.280 
blade that just sails right through
there<00:02:19.780> with<00:02:20.020> very<00:02:20.620> little<00:02:21.070> effort<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.810> this

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
there with very little effort and this

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:31.820 
there with very little effort and this
is<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.680> choice<00:02:28.710> so<00:02:29.710> I<00:02:30.100> mean<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.120> thing<00:02:31.480> is

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
is the choice so I mean this thing is

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.010 
is the choice so I mean this thing is
amazingly<00:02:32.830> sharp<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.550> while<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.840> an

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
amazingly sharp and while it is an

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.500 
amazingly sharp and while it is an
interesting<00:02:35.440> blade<00:02:36.100> design<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.360> is

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
interesting blade design and it is

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.490
