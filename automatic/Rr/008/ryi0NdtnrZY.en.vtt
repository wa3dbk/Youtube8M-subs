00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
think Arsenal day the market is very

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.039 
think Arsenal day the market is very
very<00:02:41.200> dead<00:02:41.379> and<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:42.849> equivoca<00:02:43.329> by<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.510> he's

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
very dead and the equivoca by a he's

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.780 
very dead and the equivoca by a he's
proven<00:02:44.470> in<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.590> Premier<00:02:44.920> League<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.670> he's

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
proven in the Premier League but he's

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.059 
proven in the Premier League but he's
not<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.480> know<00:02:46.510> anywhere<00:02:47.349> near<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.590> world<00:02:47.829> class

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.430 
not you know anywhere near a world class
in<00:02:48.340> my<00:02:48.459> opinion<00:02:48.760> he's<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.030> good<00:02:49.239> player<00:02:49.440> quality

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440

PSG<00:05:32.380> could<00:05:32.740> be<00:05:32.830> on<00:05:32.919> its<00:05:33.010> way<00:05:33.070> to<00:05:33.300> AC<00:05:34.300> Milan

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
PSG could be on its way to AC Milan

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.330 
PSG could be on its way to AC Milan
which<00:05:35.320> I'm<00:05:35.440> really<00:05:35.590> happy<00:05:35.830> for<00:05:35.950> because<00:05:36.220> my

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
which I'm really happy for because my

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.610 
which I'm really happy for because my
land<00:05:36.490> does<00:05:36.700> have<00:05:36.940> a<00:05:36.970> very<00:05:37.270> weak<00:05:37.479> defense<00:05:38.380> I

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
land does have a very weak defense I

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.500 
land does have a very weak defense I
think<00:05:39.100> that<00:05:39.250> they<00:05:39.669> need<00:05:39.910> to<00:05:39.940> get<00:05:40.240> something

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
think that they need to get something

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.330 
think that they need to get something
like<00:05:40.750> that<00:05:40.900> like<00:05:41.020> a<00:05:41.410> general<00:05:41.740> of<00:05:41.919> the<00:05:42.010> back<00:05:42.190> of

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
like that like a general of the back of

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.940 
like that like a general of the back of
the<00:05:42.430> keys<00:05:42.610> are<00:05:42.910> proven<00:05:43.300> at<00:05:43.390> PSG<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:44.110> I<00:05:44.140> think

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
the keys are proven at PSG and I think

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.409 
the keys are proven at PSG and I think
it'd<00:05:45.040> be<00:05:45.070> really<00:05:45.190> good<00:05:45.550> for<00:05:45.700> them<00:05:45.850> so<00:05:46.240> that's

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
it'd be really good for them so that's

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.060 
it'd be really good for them so that's
