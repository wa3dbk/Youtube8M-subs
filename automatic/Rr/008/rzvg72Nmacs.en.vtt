00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.910 
advanced but if you want to change
equipment<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> light<00:00:57.329> open<00:00:58.079> up<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> item

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
equipment in the light open up the item

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.790 
equipment in the light open up the item
box<00:00:59.190> you<00:01:00.149> would<00:01:00.270> store<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.989> those<00:01:01.199> items<00:01:01.469> in

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.290 
box you would store all those items in
here<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> think<00:01:02.340> that's<00:01:02.460> about<00:01:02.609> an<00:01:02.879> infinite

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
here I think that's about an infinite

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.030 
here I think that's about an infinite
amount<00:01:03.739> check<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> item<00:01:05.189> box<00:01:06.740> pick<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:07.920> you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
amount check the item box pick what you

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.770 
amount check the item box pick what you
want<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.310> store<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.030> see<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.390> our<00:01:09.570> item

want to store as you can see in our item

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.410 
want to store as you can see in our item
pack<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.290> only<00:01:10.530> hold<00:01:10.740> about<00:01:11.070> 20<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.180> so

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
pack so you only hold about 20 or so

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.810 
pack so you only hold about 20 or so
items<00:01:12.710> say<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.860> want<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> put<00:01:14.250> some<00:01:14.400> raw<00:01:14.580> meat

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
items say we want to put some raw meat

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.510 
items say we want to put some raw meat
in<00:01:14.880> there<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.689> then<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.170> got<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.619> hundreds

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
in there and then you got like hundreds

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.780 
in there and then you got like hundreds
of<00:01:17.670> spots<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:19.470> item<00:01:19.830> box<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:22.790> I'm

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
of spots here in your item box so I'm

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.450 
of spots here in your item box so I'm
still<00:01:24.090> figuring<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.509> lot<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.840> myself<00:01:25.130> but<00:01:26.130> it

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
still figuring a lot on myself but it

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.530 
still figuring a lot on myself but it
seems<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.630> stack<00:01:28.369> regardless<00:01:29.369> either<00:01:29.610> way<00:01:30.060> so

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
seems to stack regardless either way so

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.020 
seems to stack regardless either way so
like<00:01:31.110> if<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.770> want<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> store<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.369> raw<00:01:32.549> meat<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
like if I want to store the raw meat I

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.690 
like if I want to store the raw meat I
could<00:01:33.689> organize<00:01:33.960> them<00:01:34.500> later<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.009> think

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
could organize them later I think

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.170 
could organize them later I think
but<00:01:36.090> let's<00:01:36.619> store<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.579> it'll<00:01:39.000> go

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
but let's store it and it'll go

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.399 
but let's store it and it'll go
immediately<00:01:39.420> into<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> next<00:01:40.110> patch<00:01:40.229> for

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
immediately into the next patch for

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.560 
immediately into the next patch for
example<00:01:40.829> see<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> fish<00:01:41.700> farm<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.119> right<00:01:42.270> next

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
example see the fish farm is right next

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.100

to<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> raw<00:01:42.899> meat<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.750> that's<00:01:45.750> how<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:45.990> do

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
to the raw meat so that's how you do

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.090 
to the raw meat so that's how you do
that<00:01:46.290> now<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:47.189> take<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> items<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.950> don't

that now to take the items out you don't

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.039 
that now to take the items out you don't
want<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.399> remove<00:01:50.670> items<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:51.750> back<00:01:51.899> to
