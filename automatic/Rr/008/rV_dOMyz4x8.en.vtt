take this put it in take the two top
corners<00:01:09.630> fold<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.890> now<00:01:13.700> then<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.270> take

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
corners fold it in now then you take

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.880 
corners fold it in now then you take
this<00:01:15.720> part<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.070> same<00:01:17.310> thing<00:01:18.800> kind<00:01:19.800> of

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
this part do it same thing kind of

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.890 
this part do it same thing kind of
squish<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.580> squish<00:01:23.090> already<00:01:25.250> there<00:01:26.660> then<00:01:27.660> you

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
squish it squish already there then you

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.640 
squish it squish already there then you
take<00:01:28.790> take<00:01:29.790> one<00:01:30.000> side<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.750> then<00:01:30.930> let's<00:01:31.320> try<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
take take one side and then let's try to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.680 
take take one side and then let's try to
make<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.830> little<00:01:32.130> arrow<00:01:32.310> pointing<00:01:34.790> one<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:36.510> not

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
make a little arrow pointing one was not

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:46.219 
make a little arrow pointing one was not
this<00:01:38.870> flip<00:01:39.870> it<00:01:40.050> over<00:01:42.560> try<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.619> plan<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:45.229> yeah

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
this flip it over try to plan it yeah

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.280 
this flip it over try to plan it yeah
and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:48.260> try<00:01:49.260> to<00:01:49.290> lift<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.310> up<00:01:51.290> and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and then you try to lift this up and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.650 
and then you try to lift this up and
there<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.010> have<00:01:53.400> a<00:01:53.670> little<00:01:54.270> book<00:01:55.040> kind<00:01:56.040> small

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
there you have a little book kind small

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.630 
there you have a little book kind small
but<00:01:57.660> still<00:01:57.900> a<00:01:58.170> boat

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.570 

let's<00:02:01.640> get<00:02:01.939> start<00:02:02.270> sailing
