00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 and then personal youtube today the vote of 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.660
 depths after some time without 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.570
 publish anything here on the youtube channel and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.330
 I 'll talk a little about something. 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.770
 which intrigued me greatly during my 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.390
 routine while reading the news 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.880
 mainly of some subjects that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.480
 I am more interested in what 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.050
 automotive technologies that in the case 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.170
 this news is about more 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.489
 chapter of the war novel about the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.920
 apple patents against samsung 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.829
 not everyone is because I think most 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.680
 knows about that old story about 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.620
 apple has started is to have created this 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.930
 branch practically right of smartphones 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.930
 pretty much so there I took advantage 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.420
 patented of his diverse ideas and 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.399
 now started until the many problems 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.219
 because samsung took advantage 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.860
 it's just smartphones and also that 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.790
 deploy products to compete 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.049
 against apple 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.320
 only in the same way as its products with 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.860
 those of apple gave a problem and now it is 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.790
 for many years there are not four 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.540
 least five years or maybe it treat 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.049
 of their judicial problems against 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.759
 these patents and this news says that the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.200
 samsung ended up being legally 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.299
 condemned and now it's going to have to 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.720
 equivalent to 1 billion 5 8 million and 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.479
 treating you dollars is a real problem 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.820
 I was intrigued it was not the judge was not 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.560
 incompetence of his to whom it was not 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.829
 another thing was simply people 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.100
 who read this and have been commenting 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.219
 in this below session here is the problem 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.619
 is what left quite disappointed with 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.509
 the clues were the so-called fan boy 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.649
 Let's specify what to take and ask for. 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.990
 in unip ya is what would be a boy is a 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.479
 person who is not just a failure is 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.220
 very obsessed with her and 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.160
 strongly supports his 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.830
 respect the subject by ignoring 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.840
 always the opinion of others is 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.290
 often open to new ideas so 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.590
 is concluding fanboy is a person who is not 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.110
 case of apple and ufam boy of the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.970
 carob 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.540
 sorry is the apple fanboys would be a 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.120
 person who defends apple a lot 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.010
 and does not simply hate all 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.680
 other brands 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.650
 samsung that as far as I know the second 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.770
 largest company in the industry, so what 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.450
 happened as there is good news for 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.210
 This samba boys 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.000
 they are just the agent of gatton 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.650
 scrub on the face of the other famous 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.050
 samsung that they are winning in this 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.240
 This is how they screwed me now. 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.610
 are happy of life these famous is 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.680
 This is nothing but a great 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.650
 maturity ps 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.250
 this guy here put famous action 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.270
 and now you know it's a very stupid thing 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.370
 I do not even know why there are people who enjoy 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.800
 simply a useless thing that I 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.530
 I do not want to talk about samsung or apple 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.290
 they are good I do not want to have one that has a 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.420
 specialty but even so it is and 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.230
 I think this is a fanboy a good thing 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.260
 if you were too fanatical about something not 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.770
 good and in case here is more what 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.340
 It's not good and we can see it cross 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.230
 paul speaks the cult with the other here people 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.900
 saw it was an apple ox we already see 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.830
 others from samsung will stay in this 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.500
 squabble and one in which it is protected 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.100
 too much a company is the problem 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.720
 ends up being that in the end it is 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.160
 for example you do not have is the law of 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.239
 supply and demand, the company is very 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.209
 concentrated in power 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.570
 then it ends up in one is to invest in 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.360
 research and the sector produces smartphones 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.370
 it does not grow it has put a higher price 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.950
 there are also many problems and 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.989
 end up feeling that finished what finishes 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.880
 always being in the end are the 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.690
 consumers and the peddlers themselves 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.530
 unhappy with fans 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.830
 ias and dj just teaches me are 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.630
 I do not have why you stay only protected. 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.990
 a company to be if it does not earn anything with 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.810
 This I do not know knows something immature and 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.880
 too childish for my opinion on this 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.930
 your tire be great news of these 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.960
 people know unfortunately it is also in the 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.560
 my opinion this tech world website here 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.890
 much knows that it is a summation if it is is the 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.130
 site that download that for me is also 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.590
 your other site that is one is part of the 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.410
 clear media that is great but 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.140
 it is unfortunately also the apple fan boy is 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.780
 to realize for example that many times 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.670
 When did I have it here when apple 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.650
 well give something a news 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.010
 Apple chooses a little one 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.860
 a little more highlighted with different 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.760
 from samsung that is a little less 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.770
 to be here talked to that middle 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.410
 sinthon happiness ribbon signed 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.180
 also fanboys is a horrible thing and 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.480
 as we began the population of 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.540
 population of people below 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.090
 start there bring more people so 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.280
 boys of the season and it 's not difficult to 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.820
 different happens with the media is also a 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:48.540
 manipulator with the globe that takes many 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.480
 people to vote for such a politician 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.460
 Such a thing interests us and ends 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.570
 happening various things and the world 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:00.450
 wheel and it just happens in the world 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.640
 It gets good sucks and 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.640
 unfortunately this is how apparently 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.740
 things are going so that's what 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.169
