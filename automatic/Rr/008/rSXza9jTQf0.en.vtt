00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.970
 could see the description of the video 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.950
 It is a video to play your games 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.120
 of game boy advance your device 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.120
 Android we started 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.580
 the application is called my boy the then in 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.990
 one totally and absolutely 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.520
 free in google play in the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.460
 description you have the link for 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.410
 download it from this wonderful place 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.610
 I love the truth to navigate and 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.580
 find applications but good we go 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.500
 to measure the situation that I deviate here 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.989
 you see that I already have a game in this case 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.760
 is pokÃ©mon green leaf edition I'm not going 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.230
 to say from where you can download it 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.350
 but come on it is clear that you put in 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.180
 google download the game I do not know what and what 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.920
 you're going to see they're called rom you have to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.739
 put in rom then me that that pokemon 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.690
 yellow or inazuma elevate any of 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.699
 these things if you download the options 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.030
 that you can see here video audio input 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.370
 layout mix advanced so about let's 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.019
 maybe start by the video here not 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.339
 You have to play absolutely nothing 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.290
 I say you do not have to touch 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.020
 practically nothing of the configuration 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.260
 initial except for occasional things 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.840
 worth screen size that we can do here 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.310
 here what we can do is modify 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.930
 the size you see 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.510
 to see if he leaves me 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.940
 let's leave you can modify the size 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.590
 of the screen or if we want it to be 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.830
 higher or lower in my case I 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.180
 like to see it there is in fact worth it since 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.510
 I have this terminal yet I have not played 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.740
 to no game with gameboy 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.710
 but I'll start to pick it up again 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.930
 then the orientation of the screen in 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.660
 this case we have it in broken car for 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.580
 so that if we rotate the screen it 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.369
 see in landscape mode highly recommended 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.520
 we also do not touch it on that one 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.860
 we leave the frames and the filter 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.830
 and in the open gl this is worth codex and 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.810
 others do not touch audio forgiveness 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.610
 audio that we do not play 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.020
 absolutely nothing except that if we want 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.280
 that the volume is higher or lower 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.479
 let's leave here the song frequency ni 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.910
 we even put in because we leave it to 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.330
 those hertz is worth the 44,100 perfect 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.830
 after input this input is for 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.880
 map the keys is worth on screen 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.470
 unless you are very very given to the subject of 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.840
 gaming on computers and maybe at best 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.770
 you do not understand it maybe it will be better 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.570
 better that we get 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.850
 because I really use at least 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.730
 I personally do not find it useful 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.710
 and then four little things layouts 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.030
 ok in law outs is practically the same 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.800
 to what I have taught you before but 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.100
 we can also modify the size of 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.750
 these keys for example is worth seeing 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.700
 if we want this like this or this key 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.860
 make it bigger more I do not know what bad 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.810
 I do not usually touch it, I'll leave it, I'll tell you 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.010
 as such and the other options that 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.090
 we have is the mix vale that is all 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.790
 these things so that they are saved 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.200
 automatically the game but if 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.390
 we want you to ask us for confirmation 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.660
 close or not the game every time you 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.780
 We give to exit we leave it to which after 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.870
 in advance 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.310
 it was double the bio simulation and no idea 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.290
 what is this I know that they are something to 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.910
 very low level of programming not 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.950
 I'm going to put those calls in my shirt 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.360
 things we leave for workers davide 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.260
 you can subscribe to your channel if you 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.879
 you want to take publicity 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.230
 and a little bit more the truth is that I 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.390
 I really do not recommend touching 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.980
 practically nothing except beyond things 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.530
 aesthetics that may be more or 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.819
 less useful and in about we are not going to 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.730
 put in because we all know it's for 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.769
 leave me a comment to portarme of the 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.599
 mistakes let's go to the heart of the matter 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.819
 when you download a game yo 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.200
 I recommend that you put them 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.019
 with some application that I have already 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.450
 taught as cabinet vale or is explorer 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.459
 they put it in a visible place in 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.780
 your memory card or in the 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.599
 phone if you want to leave it in the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.109
 internal memory once you have done it 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.459
 you give here to refresh, let's go 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.379
 now the game in this case was already 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.510
 but well let's go to the game and how 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:05.129
 you see the game is already produced 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.129
 we will automatically lower the volume 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.890
 and it works just like a gameboy 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.420
 really has no problem 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.519
 there is probably no game 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.709
 saved I think I'm not sure we're going to 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.750
 press is effectively the game 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.889
 It works without any lage without 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.479
 no problem and it works in 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.699
 practically any android even 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.650
 low-end because it requires very 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.080
 few resources we realize that a 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.970
 game boy had some resources that did not 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.250
 it reaches not even 1% of many telephones 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.830
 high end nowadays so nothing good 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.669
 I leave this option here if you want 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.199
 play games in boy advance you have this 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.610
 option in the description as I said 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:43.410
 left the link for what download is 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.510
 the same since google play has us 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.020
 liked the video do not forget to give the 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.100
 and just like to have seen Pikachu 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.900
 Picasso has not gone out to his vulva 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.490
 Dr. Auc you have to give to the 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.770
 like to subscribe and you still have not 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.150
 I see you in the next video because 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.970
 I'm giving 5 for one 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.840
 I am 15 glasses and I promise to do it and 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.840
 catch them all
