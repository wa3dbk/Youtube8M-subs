nearly a hundred yards it was really a

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.370 
nearly a hundred yards it was really a
strong<00:01:09.420> rushing<00:01:09.720> effort<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.140> would<00:01:10.290> have

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
strong rushing effort that I would have

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.440

liked<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> seen<00:01:10.830> them<00:01:11.010> build<00:01:11.250> upon<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:12.210> for

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
liked to seen them build upon but for

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.670 
liked to seen them build upon but for
whatever<00:01:12.600> reason<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.350> didn't<00:01:13.650> happen

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
whatever reason that just didn't happen

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.920 
whatever reason that just didn't happen
and<00:01:14.640> looking<00:01:15.180> forward<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.570> think<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:15.869> are

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and looking forward I think there are

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.660 
and looking forward I think there are
three<00:01:16.140> outstanding<00:01:16.409> issues<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.250> first<00:01:17.490> of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
three outstanding issues the first of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.370 
three outstanding issues the first of
which<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.060> offensive<00:01:18.390> identity<00:01:19.049> I'm<00:01:19.200> not

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
which is that offensive identity I'm not

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
which is that offensive identity I'm not
sure<00:01:19.650> without<00:01:19.860> Danny<00:01:20.280> Amendola<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> field

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
sure without Danny Amendola on the field

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.120 
sure without Danny Amendola on the field
if<00:01:21.720> there<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.140> go-to<00:01:22.439> guy<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.950> would<00:01:23.100> think

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
if there is a go-to guy you would think

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.039 
if there is a go-to guy you would think
maybe<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.850> these<00:01:24.060> Steven<00:01:24.390> Jackson<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.900> his

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
maybe of these Steven Jackson with his

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.080 
maybe of these Steven Jackson with his
experience<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.369> fact<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.670> he's<00:01:26.850> so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
experience and the fact that he's so

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.429 
experience and the fact that he's so
when<00:01:27.240> he<00:01:27.330> gets<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:27.720> emotional<00:01:28.290> he's<00:01:28.409> so

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
when he gets really emotional he's so

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.319 
when he gets really emotional he's so
hard<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.829> bring<00:01:29.009> down<00:01:29.250> scored<00:01:30.030> his<00:01:30.119> first

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
hard to bring down scored his first

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.910 
hard to bring down scored his first
touchdown<00:01:30.600> today<00:01:31.049> he<00:01:31.290> would<00:01:31.409> be<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> obvious

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
touchdown today he would be the obvious

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.950 
touchdown today he would be the obvious
candidate<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:33.180> that's<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:33.750> really

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
candidate but that's not really

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.719 
candidate but that's not really
happening<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.590> now<00:01:34.650> you've<00:01:34.979> got<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> mix<00:01:35.520> of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
happening right now you've got a mix of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.609 
happening right now you've got a mix of
Chris<00:01:36.000> Gibbons<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.659> Brandon<00:01:37.049> Gibson<00:01:37.259> and

2012 st. Louis Rams on offense because I
don't<00:02:03.069> know<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.159> answer<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.610> that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
don't know the answer to that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.179 
don't know the answer to that
defensively<00:02:04.810> on<00:02:05.049> the<00:02:05.079> other<00:02:05.319> hand<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:06.039> was<00:02:06.159> a

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
defensively on the other hand it was a

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.859 
defensively on the other hand it was a
different<00:02:06.399> philosophy<00:02:06.640> something<00:02:07.390> similar

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
different philosophy something similar

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.210 
different philosophy something similar
to<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.110> detroit<00:02:08.470> game<00:02:08.500> where<00:02:08.860> his<00:02:08.979> kind<00:02:09.129> of

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
to the detroit game where his kind of

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.529 
to the detroit game where his kind of
bento<00:02:09.489> break<00:02:09.700> but<00:02:09.879> you<00:02:09.970> leave<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:10.360> much

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
bento break but you leave so much

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.030 
bento break but you leave so much
underneath<00:02:11.049> and<00:02:11.349> when<00:02:11.739> you<00:02:11.830> face

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
underneath and when you face

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.680 
underneath and when you face
quarterbacks<00:02:12.549> like<00:02:12.700> Matthew<00:02:13.060> Stafford<00:02:13.540> who

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
quarterbacks like Matthew Stafford who

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.150 
quarterbacks like Matthew Stafford who
while<00:02:13.959> he<00:02:14.080> made<00:02:14.260> mistakes<00:02:14.650> in<00:02:14.769> week<00:02:14.950> one

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
while he made mistakes in week one

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.339 
while he made mistakes in week one
leading<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.670> three<00:02:15.910> interceptions<00:02:16.269> he<00:02:17.200> can

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
leading the three interceptions he can

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.870 
leading the three interceptions he can
still<00:02:17.620> take<00:02:17.829> advantage<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.700> Rams

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
still take advantage of that the Rams

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.100 
still take advantage of that the Rams
weren't<00:02:19.090> able<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.269> win<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.630> one<00:02:19.780> ending

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
weren't able to win that one ending

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.690 
weren't able to win that one ending
today<00:02:20.319> against<00:02:20.680> Aaron<00:02:20.950> Rodgers<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.400> really

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
today against Aaron Rodgers it really

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.280 
today against Aaron Rodgers it really
wasn't<00:02:22.000> as<00:02:22.060> close<00:02:22.239> as<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.540> score<00:02:22.569> indicated

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
wasn't as close as the score indicated

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.430 
wasn't as close as the score indicated
he<00:02:23.620> was<00:02:23.739> so<00:02:23.950> methodical<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.880> 30th<00:02:25.599> 37<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.290> mean

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
he was so methodical and 30th 37 I mean

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.750 
he was so methodical and 30th 37 I mean
the<00:02:26.530> completion<00:02:26.950> percentage<00:02:27.130> including<00:02:27.700> a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the completion percentage including a

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.699 
the completion percentage including a
spike<00:02:28.000> speaks<00:02:28.299> for<00:02:28.450> himself<00:02:28.569> he<00:02:29.200> really<00:02:29.530> had<00:02:29.680> a

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
spike speaks for himself he really had a

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.130 
spike speaks for himself he really had a
easy<00:02:29.980> day<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:30.579> picking<00:02:30.849> guys<00:02:30.970> underneath<00:02:31.360> so

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
easy day just picking guys underneath so

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.050 
easy day just picking guys underneath so
defensively<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.920> was<00:02:33.010> an<00:02:33.489> interesting<00:02:33.730> look

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
defensively it was an interesting look

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.970 
defensively it was an interesting look
I'm<00:02:34.470> concerned<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.590> moving<00:02:35.829> forward

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
I'm concerned that moving forward

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.979 
I'm concerned that moving forward
against<00:02:36.880> bigger<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.480> better<00:02:37.569> teams

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
against bigger and better teams

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.569 
against bigger and better teams
especially<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.829> passing<00:02:39.220> game<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.489> the

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
especially in the passing game that the

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:40.920 
especially in the passing game that the
Rams<00:02:39.760> are<00:02:39.849> going<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.090> kind<00:02:40.239> of<00:02:40.299> let<00:02:40.450> off<00:02:40.660> when

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
Rams are going to kind of let off when

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.600 
Rams are going to kind of let off when
it<00:02:41.110> feels<00:02:41.560> like<00:02:41.799> maybe<00:02:41.950> they<00:02:42.160> need<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.400> press

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
it feels like maybe they need to press

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.670 
it feels like maybe they need to press
on<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.849> gas<00:02:43.049> perhaps<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.290> reason<00:02:44.440> they're

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
on the gas perhaps the reason they're

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.289 
on the gas perhaps the reason they're
not<00:02:44.829> doing<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.519> performance<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.090> saw

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
not doing it is the performance you saw

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.330 
not doing it is the performance you saw
from<00:02:46.450> Janoris<00:02:46.900> Jenkins<00:02:46.930> day<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.950> really<00:02:48.160> just

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
from Janoris Jenkins day it really just

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.400 
from Janoris Jenkins day it really just
isn't<00:02:48.639> that<00:02:48.670> good<00:02:48.850> too<00:02:49.060> many<00:02:49.239> mistakes<00:02:49.450> biting

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
isn't that good too many mistakes biting

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.620 
isn't that good too many mistakes biting

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
so if there's a silver lining I guess

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.360 
so if there's a silver lining I guess
that<00:03:59.600> it<00:03:59.720> that's<00:03:59.930> it<00:04:00.140> but<00:04:00.410> for<00:04:00.920> this<00:04:01.040> Rams
