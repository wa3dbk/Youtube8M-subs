00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.590
 in nineteen 83 the rhythm of murdered west was put into use 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.360
 This portion of members counts seven hand is 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.039
 shank 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:10.429
 prinsenlaan 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:11.649
 eastern flank 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:13.409
 Alexander 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.059
 grass herb why my slipper 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.059
 and within no 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:22.849
 this is a metro a seat yellow 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.210
 also just after station capelsebrug osn 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.479
 the steam tram spent in many products on such a stupid decline 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:32.479
 so that passengers can continue their journey without any hitch 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.900
 and with steam from bol.com 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.880
 Tom from below is no longer needed 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.170
 I am getting fast 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.750
 the name says it all, it must be able to get through quickly and therefore times as much 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.750
 possible free job 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.720
 but the demolition also has to deal with ground-level crossings 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.720
 and provisions must of course be made for this 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.490
 when approaching an intersection by a fast train 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.080
 because of the occupations this I through all between the rails automatically all 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 traffic lights 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.590
 the city authorities and can drive on 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.590
 because in the light tour other traffic has turned red 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.450
 traffic must adapt to the quick hit and not the other way around 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.410
 and the pedestrians are also clearly warned 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.340
 for the passing slow train 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.430
 the ground around here is particularly striking 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.430
 We are in one of the lowest-lying areas of the Netherlands 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.050
 The reason why should be well supported and therefore kept calm 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.100
 concrete piles 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.149
 on that planet a concrete structure is laid the rails and fixed 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.910
 you are there is always a scan of complaining 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.350
 maintenance on sagging jobs costs so much money and moreover so that later 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.350
 have to happen 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.590
 and that is not so nice for those who live in the area 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.030
 all these problems have been overcome in this way 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.870
 let's drive fast over a viaduct 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.870
 a viaduct with its belly, as it were 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.830
 akzo posed and ewald alexander this the eponymous intercity station of the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.290
 railways many travelers no longer have to drive to cs when they take the train 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.109
 want to grab 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.749
 yet another advantage that public transport has to offer in this section 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.829
 Rotterdam to live with around 75,000 people 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:27.569
 at the place where the new Danish striker NATO has been nice the heptathlon 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.569
 the union was already an important push for cyclists and pedestrians 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:37.529
 because traffic did not give the impression it was all too happy to line a tunnel 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.529
 to lay 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.450
 the car forms a shoe in its entirety with the neighborhood building 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.009
 we fit amg the facilities in the new district 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.169
 and why people reach out with the endpoint of the new line in killing 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:57.169
 west 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.349
 who went in or was obvious 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.500
 given the presence of the modern shopping center inland 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.389
 but also the branches to heptathlon are nearing completion 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:24.689
 you didn't have to get lost in most of the job because 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.329
 heptathlon is laid on a cowardly applied earlier than this 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.959
 no this is only needed for the four stops and the only road intersections 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.239
 And this is also how building goes hand in hand 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.260
 while the heptathlon residential area is still being completed, who has one here 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.410
 intimidating 80 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.869
 the fast pace 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:46.549
 but neither are we yet 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.139
 anp also to the west on the other side of our city for the new line 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.459
 extended 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.119
 under the schiedamseweg 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:56.359
 some 19 86 have reached the Marconiplein 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.189
 and then the new line 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.189
 So far the job is done 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:05.949
 we will see each other again
