00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.840
 a day is a match born below 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.299
 bad wishes 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:21.850
 instead it is filed with a very large one 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:23.619
 victory to be dedicated to david 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.750
 moss that was overnight 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:30.170
 struck by a very serious loss 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.180
 His presence was uncertain there has 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.690
 reached tonight at that desire of 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:40.239
 be in the field and therefore I think it is 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.550
 feeling of all that of ideally 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.070
 embrace it and appreciate the effort 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.650
 product even if it may seem not 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.500
 to have been the protagonist of this of 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.960
 this race it was definitely the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.269
 moral point of view 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.489
 for the rest as said the auspices do not 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.270
 they were the best and that to the injury of 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.339
 church has been added and 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.540
 knowing that you have to manage this absolute 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:11.330
 emergency we could find 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.780
 resources because despite the context 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.570
 that was being created in the field not 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.229
 I totally lost the thread of the game 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.440
 unfortunately the plan started sometimes 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.970
 have been complicit in falling into 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.880
 trap of trivial mistakes they have 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.220
 certainly fueled the trust of 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.080
 our adversaries who have found 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.360
 plays of extraordinary spectacle 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.730
 on a very special evening 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.950
 we imagined they would produce it all 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.350
 possible and imaginable effort to 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.440
 achieving such an important success e 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.770
 so prestigious that it would have returned 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:57.200
 impetus to their championship and in certain 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.460
 we had the feeling that 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.040
 they managed to get back in their hands 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.950
 inertia instead 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.110
 we have continuously sought to 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.960
 produce up front in an evening in the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.590
 which also defensively accompanies the 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:18.440
 not being able to spend too many fouls 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:22.290
 men counted in the attack that it was 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.120
 current continuous exploiting surely 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.050
 the extraordinary evening of marshall 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.480
 bruce 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.240
 but beside him also the appreciable 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.920
 provision of nicolÃ² melli on both 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.060
 the half fields also considered the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.540
 customer he had in front of ee trento 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.570
 fuse that was crucial because 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.110
 when the defense of varese to health of 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.220
 laps the team 1 would lose 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.709
 completely his own son indeed 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.709
 taking on important responsibilities
