00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.980 

I<00:01:55.860> combed<00:01:56.580> it<00:01:56.760> I<00:01:56.880> finger<00:01:57.180> comb<00:01:57.420> did<00:01:57.690> I<00:01:57.720> use

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
I combed it I finger comb did I use

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.980 
I combed it I finger comb did I use
water<00:01:58.350> some<00:01:59.340> conditioner<00:01:59.820> sometimes<00:02:00.270> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
water some conditioner sometimes and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.450 
water some conditioner sometimes and
I've<00:02:01.380> had<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.590> hair<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:01.860> almost<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.310> month

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
I've had this hair for almost a month

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.580 
I've had this hair for almost a month
but<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.060> haven't<00:02:03.360> combed<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.530> do

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
but I haven't combed it and I do

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.830 
but I haven't combed it and I do
experience<00:02:05.250> shedding<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:05.970> I<00:02:06.060> think<00:02:06.659> that

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
experience shedding but I think that

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.359 
experience shedding but I think that
that's<00:02:06.990> kind<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.229> evident<00:02:07.710> when<00:02:07.830> it<00:02:07.950> comes<00:02:08.160> to

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
that's kind of evident when it comes to

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.190 
that's kind of evident when it comes to
this<00:02:08.520> kind<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.850> hair<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.569> obviously<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
this kind of hair and obviously the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.530 
this kind of hair and obviously the
hairs<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:11.100> probably<00:02:11.550> not<00:02:11.640> obvious<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
hairs it's probably not obvious but the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.670 
hairs it's probably not obvious but the
hairs<00:02:12.750> process<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.440> be<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:14.420> texture<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.680> I

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
hairs process to be this texture and I

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.220 
hairs process to be this texture and I
mean<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.250> clumps<00:02:17.580> together<00:02:17.700> at<00:02:18.120> point<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:18.810> I

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
mean it clumps together at point so I

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.380 
mean it clumps together at point so I
would<00:02:19.950> think<00:02:20.220> tingling<00:02:20.880> would<00:02:21.060> be<00:02:21.180> something

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
would think tingling would be something

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.059 
would think tingling would be something
that<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.750> would<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.140> kind<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.530> get<00:02:22.680> used<00:02:22.890> to

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
that you would just kind of get used to

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.520 
that you would just kind of get used to
I<00:02:23.459> mean<00:02:23.670> I've<00:02:24.239> never<00:02:24.480> tried<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.050> really<00:02:25.230> run<00:02:25.410> my

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
I mean I've never tried to really run my

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.550 
I mean I've never tried to really run my
hands<00:02:25.800> through<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.250> close<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.550> now<00:02:27.560> but

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
hands through it and close this now but

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.050 
hands through it and close this now but
this<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.830> not<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.190> kind<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.519> hair<00:02:29.790> and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
this is not that kind of hair and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.030 
this is not that kind of hair and
shedding<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.810> don't<00:02:30.989> find<00:02:31.260> here<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.709> floor

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
shedding I don't find here on the floor

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.280 
shedding I don't find here on the floor
but<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.489> was<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.150> go<00:02:33.300> ahead<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.720> like<00:02:33.870> you

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.040 
know pull at it
yeah<00:02:35.700> hair<00:02:36.060> would<00:02:36.239> have<00:02:36.269> come<00:02:36.450> out<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.900> does

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
yeah hair would have come out so it does

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.360 
yeah hair would have come out so it does

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
about a half of a bundle of so I may

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.130 
about a half of a bundle of so I may
straighten<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.180> give<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.450> guys<00:02:48.660> update

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.160 
just let you know if it straightens all
the<00:02:50.640> way<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.150> revert<00:02:51.540> back<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
the way and if we revert back to the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.740 
the way and if we revert back to the
curl<00:02:52.440> um<00:02:53.280> considering<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.269> this<00:02:54.450> hair<00:02:54.660> is

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
curl um considering that this hair is

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.930 
curl um considering that this hair is
processed<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.620> be<00:02:55.650> curl<00:02:56.040> like<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.519> doubt

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
processed to be curl like this I doubt

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.400 
processed to be curl like this I doubt
that<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.239> will<00:02:57.330> return<00:02:57.660> back<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:58.140> its<00:02:58.290> original

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
that it will return back to its original

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.310 
that it will return back to its original
curl<00:02:59.120> but<00:03:00.120> maybe<00:03:00.360> I'll<00:03:00.600> try<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:01.019> if<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.140> guys

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
curl but maybe I'll try that if you guys

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.990 
curl but maybe I'll try that if you guys
are<00:03:01.500> interested<00:03:01.650> in<00:03:02.100> comment<00:03:02.489> below<00:03:02.610> and

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
are interested in comment below and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.360 
are interested in comment below and
maybe<00:03:03.690> I'll<00:03:03.780> do<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:03.989> video<00:03:04.170> on<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.500> things<00:03:05.010> are

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
maybe I'll do a video on that things are

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.420 
maybe I'll do a video on that things are
pretty<00:03:05.910> bad<00:03:06.269> but<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.320> my<00:03:07.500> opinion<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:07.950> makes

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
pretty bad but in my opinion that makes

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
pretty bad but in my opinion that makes
it<00:03:08.810> look<00:03:09.810> more<00:03:10.019> realistic<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:12.150> looks<00:03:12.299> like

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
it look more realistic so it looks like

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.600 
it look more realistic so it looks like
I<00:03:12.570> have<00:03:12.720> damaged<00:03:13.230> natural<00:03:13.650> ends<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.310> is

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
I have damaged natural ends and that is

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.350 
I have damaged natural ends and that is
okay<00:03:14.880> with<00:03:15.000> me

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
okay with me

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.970 
okay with me
may<00:03:15.540> not<00:03:15.630> be<00:03:15.810> okay<00:03:15.900> with<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.650> would<00:03:16.829> just

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
may not be okay with you I would just

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.190 
may not be okay with you I would just
trim<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.250> off<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.640> didn't<00:03:18.570> measure<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.810> hair<00:03:19.079> it

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
trim it off I didn't measure the hair it

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.319 
trim it off I didn't measure the hair it
came<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> little<00:03:19.620> bit<00:03:19.860> longer<00:03:20.100> than<00:03:20.459> what<00:03:20.850> they

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
came a little bit longer than what they

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.330 
came a little bit longer than what they
described<00:03:21.840> so<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.290> could<00:03:22.680> twenty<00:03:23.040> was<00:03:23.220> like<00:03:23.310> a

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
described so I could twenty was like a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.440 
described so I could twenty was like a
twenty-one<00:03:23.910> twenty-two

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
twenty-one twenty-two

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.949 
twenty-one twenty-two
so<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.890> mean<00:03:26.280> cutting<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:27.209> ends<00:03:27.510> will<00:03:27.600> probably

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
so I mean cutting the ends will probably

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.600 
so I mean cutting the ends will probably
be<00:03:28.290> beneficial<00:03:28.860> that's<00:03:29.130> what<00:03:29.250> you're<00:03:29.400> looking

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
be beneficial that's what you're looking

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.060 
be beneficial that's what you're looking
for<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.940> think<00:03:30.269> that's<00:03:30.480> pretty<00:03:30.750> much<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.560> the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
for I think that's pretty much it the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.979 
for I think that's pretty much it the
hair<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.519> pretty<00:03:32.910> long<00:03:33.030> once<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.630> stretch<00:03:34.140> it

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
hair is pretty long once you stretch it

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.979 
hair is pretty long once you stretch it
but<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.410> like<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.130> in<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.430> big<00:03:38.760> afro<00:03:39.450> state<00:03:40.310> so

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
but I like it in this big afro state so

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.380 
but I like it in this big afro state so
see<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.290> think<00:03:43.560> that's<00:03:43.829> pretty<00:03:44.130> much<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:45.000> know

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
see I think that's pretty much it I know

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.699 
see I think that's pretty much it I know
I<00:03:45.420> ran<00:03:45.660> through<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.900> really<00:03:46.140> really<00:03:46.350> fast<00:03:46.590> but

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
I ran through it really really fast but

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.140 
I ran through it really really fast but
I<00:03:46.769> want<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:47.100> get<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.310> video<00:03:47.549> up<00:03:47.700> because<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:47.970> had

I want to get the video up because I had

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.670 
I want to get the video up because I had
a<00:03:48.180> call<00:03:48.390> people<00:03:48.660> asking<00:03:49.019> me<00:03:49.049> about<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.500> and

I<00:04:09.330> would<00:04:09.630> imagine<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:10.140> would<00:04:10.230> break<00:04:10.500> your

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
I would imagine that would break your

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.350 
I would imagine that would break your
natural<00:04:11.010> hair<00:04:11.160> so<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.370> would<00:04:11.640> not<00:04:11.790> suggest<00:04:11.970> that

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
natural hair so I would not suggest that

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.240 
natural hair so I would not suggest that
I<00:04:12.630> would<00:04:12.930> suggested<00:04:13.500> installing<00:04:13.890> it<00:04:14.040> was<00:04:14.130> some

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
I would suggested installing it was some

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.580 
I would suggested installing it was some
type<00:04:14.430> of<00:04:14.460> wave<00:04:14.790> form<00:04:15.120> or<00:04:15.540> using<00:04:16.350> them<00:04:16.440> as

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
type of wave form or using them as

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.310 
type of wave form or using them as
clip-ins<00:04:17.070> or<00:04:17.280> whatever<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:18.330> I<00:04:18.750> think<00:04:18.810> that

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
clip-ins or whatever and I think that

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.870
