 because I half broke my balls and e 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.680
 in short, then comment part nico 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.570
 precisely that on my page he writes that 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.449
 want a clean up via the media players 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.420
 so even those who made history 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.059
 maurizio is pretty pissed off like 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.679

 them also federico ventimiglia of 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:50.589
 that one must speak team without ideas 

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:53.530

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:57.010

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.109
 third place roberto poni who writes 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.299
 too much importance to certain means 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.609
 players from Sunday the shirts from one 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.619
 to the eleven without the printed name this 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:10.030
 good trip must understand the importance 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:12.130
 of the umberto shirt asr corrado writes 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.930
 they no longer have a recognizable game 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.340
 we have had occasion not 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.659
 best exploited 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.880
 simone ciolini writes I have seen the 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.960
 the last ten minutes have been enough for me 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.969
 crying and finally still roberto toni that 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.119
 writes from now we will see garcia of that 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:36.250
 pasta is made now that it has broken 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:38.789
 giuliano colagrossi toy 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.020
 coach and sports director 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.030
 overvalued responsible for one 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.039
 bankruptcy season season 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.939
 bankruptcy is still early to say 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.640
 we are still seconds 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.810
 we see a moment maybe we'll talk between 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.579
 one month two jacopo mallozzi garcia 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.259
 get out of the beep 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:01.390
 we need a change of mentality mario 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.979
 noschese writes to me andrea from gifts I do not have 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.109
 seen or heard a game if you have 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.630
 want and time tell me how it went 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:11.590
 thank you romanista brother and I write it 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.120
 that went shitty 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.560
 oh well let's go to closing while I have 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.879
 read some comments is not that the 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.409
 your reached otherwise we are up 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.500
 See you tomorrow 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.840
 I say briefly my reality that 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.159
 I saw it even better to respect 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.989
 I have seen previous releases too 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.969
 better than in Cagliari where anyway 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.980
 we won I saw her better 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.340
 certainly compared to Parma we wanted 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.950
 little 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.359
 and yet clearly if it lacks in 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.920
 precision that the garden in the first 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.230
 time both goals have been scored but i 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.950
 magnati 3 to a dialogue in front of the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:47.150
 Lecce goalkeeper dropped the brothers with 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:50.780
 gervinho and clear that if you then devour yourself 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.349
 goal you are already we do not create 18 occasions 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.519
 per game 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:57.919
 we create 45 if in those 4 5 it marks them 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.480
 only one then is normal to the first 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.459
 opportunities that they had then 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.079
 now I have not seen well 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.239
 some say he was also out of the game 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.299
 I was not comfortable with the comment in 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.239
 Bulgarian, what the fuck did I understand as i 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.790
 frames but then nothing 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.400
 guys and what to say below with the next one 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.269
 so much game now it is until I do 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.810
 there is a spark that causes that 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.540
 fire 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.370
 no, we go on like this costs 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.689
 we are still seconds 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.030
 we have not yet been eliminated 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:33.799
 from the europa league we see return that 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:37.479
 a greeting happens and maybe I was always e 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.479
 anyway, it's that balls
