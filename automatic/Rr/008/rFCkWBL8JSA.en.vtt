gifts right here you kind of see it kind

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.560 
gifts right here you kind of see it kind
of<00:04:18.830> offsets<00:04:19.549> and<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:22.190> bristles<00:04:22.820> on<00:04:23.030> this<00:04:23.300> side

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
of offsets and the bristles on this side

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.920 
of offsets and the bristles on this side
will<00:04:24.320> come<00:04:24.680> towards<00:04:25.580> this<00:04:26.060> angle<00:04:26.600> if<00:04:26.780> you

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
will come towards this angle if you

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.890 
will come towards this angle if you
brush<00:04:27.350> that<00:04:28.130> way<00:04:28.370> there<00:04:28.880> kind<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.180> come<00:04:29.510> toward

brush that way there kind of come toward
that<00:04:30.080> angle<00:04:30.440> so<00:04:30.530> that's<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.860> difference

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
that angle so that's the difference

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.010 
that angle so that's the difference
between<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:32.090> CQ<00:04:32.840> CQ<00:04:33.530> p<00:04:33.920> brush<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.390> Dianne<00:04:35.810> you
