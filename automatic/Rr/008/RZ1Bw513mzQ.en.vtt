UI we have as I will explain in a minute

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.310 
UI we have as I will explain in a minute
a<00:00:29.930> very<00:00:30.140> rigorous<00:00:30.579> selection<00:00:31.579> procedure<00:00:32.320> but

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
a very rigorous selection procedure but

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.440 
a very rigorous selection procedure but
if<00:00:34.220> you<00:00:34.940> are<00:00:35.180> if<00:00:36.110> an<00:00:36.290> applicant<00:00:36.800> is<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:38.210> right

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450

than<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:42.140> UI<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.910> first<00:00:44.180> thing<00:00:44.360> of<00:00:44.450> course<00:00:44.510> is

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
than the UI the first thing of course is

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.040 
than the UI the first thing of course is
academic<00:00:45.650> quality<00:00:46.070> of<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:47.050> Supervisory

staff<00:00:48.730> are<00:00:49.730> we<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.060> best<00:00:50.270> in<00:00:50.450> the<00:00:50.570> world<00:00:50.690> that

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
staff are we the best in the world that

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.440 
staff are we the best in the world that
would<00:00:51.560> be<00:00:51.680> stupid<00:00:52.600> we<00:00:53.600> have<00:00:53.750> a<00:00:53.780> wonderful<00:00:55.450> set

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
would be stupid we have a wonderful set

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.790 
would be stupid we have a wonderful set
of<00:00:56.480> professors<00:00:58.150> we<00:00:59.150> attract<00:00:59.630> for<00:00:59.960> every<00:01:00.440> chair

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
of professors we attract for every chair

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.469 
of professors we attract for every chair
that<00:01:01.010> opens<00:01:03.430> impressive<00:01:04.430> set<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.729> applicants

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
that opens impressive set of applicants

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.190 
that opens impressive set of applicants
from<00:01:05.869> Europe<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:07.430> rest<00:01:07.460> of<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.939> world

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
from Europe and the rest of the world

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.740 
from Europe and the rest of the world
but<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:09.470> can<00:01:10.220> comfortably<00:01:10.729> say<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.329> in<00:01:11.509> terms

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
but I can comfortably say that in terms

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.569 
but I can comfortably say that in terms
of<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.020> quality<00:01:12.530> of<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.799> professor's<00:01:13.340> we<00:01:13.490> are

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
of the quality of the professor's we are

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.660 
of the quality of the professor's we are
second<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.000> none<00:01:14.740> maybe<00:01:15.740> not<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.100> best<00:01:16.130> but

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
second to none maybe not the best but

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.599 
second to none maybe not the best but
second<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:17.149> none<00:01:17.409> but<00:01:18.409> what<00:01:18.590> makes<00:01:18.920> us<00:01:19.219> special

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
second to none but what makes us special

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:21.940 
second to none but what makes us special
and<00:01:20.060> that's<00:01:20.270> why<00:01:20.569> I<00:01:20.600> think<00:01:20.950> prospective

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
and that's why I think prospective

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.919 
and that's why I think prospective
doctoral<00:01:22.310> students<00:01:22.819> should<00:01:22.999> consider<00:01:23.479> us<00:01:23.719> is

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929

sure<00:03:23.070> that<00:03:23.190> students<00:03:23.580> get<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.880> right<00:03:24.270> kind<00:03:24.570> of

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
sure that students get the right kind of

sure that students get the right kind of
supervisor<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.470> what<00:03:25.590> kind<00:03:25.830> of<00:03:25.920> support<00:03:26.580> and

supervisor and what kind of support and

supervisor and what kind of support and
advice<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.300> they<00:03:27.420> expect<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.750> get<00:03:28.459> well<00:03:29.459> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
advice can they expect to get well the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.960 
advice can they expect to get well the
first<00:03:30.060> thing<00:03:30.300> is<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.830> we<00:03:31.830> won't<00:03:32.130> take<00:03:32.610> a

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
first thing is that we won't take a

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.770 
first thing is that we won't take a
doctoral<00:03:33.600> student<00:03:34.580> if<00:03:35.580> we<00:03:35.850> don't<00:03:36.120> think<00:03:36.450> there

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
doctoral student if we don't think there

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.810 
doctoral student if we don't think there
is<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.110> right<00:03:37.290> kind<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.680> supervisor<00:03:38.190> and

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
is the right kind of supervisor and

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.820 
is the right kind of supervisor and
usually<00:03:39.660> there<00:03:39.810> might<00:03:39.990> even<00:03:40.020> be<00:03:40.350> one<00:03:40.650> or<00:03:40.800> two

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
usually there might even be one or two

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.980 
usually there might even be one or two
who<00:03:41.040> could<00:03:41.459> be<00:03:41.610> potential<00:03:41.970> supervisors<00:03:42.840> and

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
who could be potential supervisors and

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.920 
who could be potential supervisors and
when<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:44.040> researchers<00:03:44.700> arrive<00:03:45.120> once<00:03:45.690> they

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
when the researchers arrive once they

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.160 
when the researchers arrive once they
admitted<00:03:46.970> they<00:03:47.970> can<00:03:48.180> still<00:03:48.450> look<00:03:48.630> around<00:03:48.990> a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
admitted they can still look around a

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.710 
admitted they can still look around a
bit<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.680> there's<00:03:50.100> a<00:03:50.160> certain<00:03:50.400> choice<00:03:51.270> that

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
bit and there's a certain choice that

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.300 
bit and there's a certain choice that
can<00:03:52.200> eventually<00:03:52.680> be<00:03:53.190> made<00:03:54.560> what<00:03:55.560> we<00:03:55.770> look<00:03:56.010> at

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
can eventually be made what we look at

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.560 
can eventually be made what we look at
is<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:58.620> type<00:03:58.830> of<00:03:59.040> research<00:03:59.640> that<00:03:59.700> the<00:04:00.150> student

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
is the type of research that the student

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.650 
is the type of research that the student
wants<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:00.959> do<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:02.040> methodological

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
wants to do the methodological

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.690 
wants to do the methodological
preparedness<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.990> student<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.650> then<00:04:05.430> we

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
preparedness of the student and then we

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.540 
preparedness of the student and then we
try<00:04:06.240> and<00:04:06.450> really<00:04:06.780> match<00:04:07.080> that<00:04:07.500> student<00:04:08.100> with

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
try and really match that student with

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.740 
try and really match that student with
the<00:04:08.970> right<00:04:09.180> kind<00:04:09.600> of<00:04:10.640> supervisor<00:04:11.750> somebody

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
the right kind of supervisor somebody
