little plastic things are kind of flimsy

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.090 
little plastic things are kind of flimsy
I<00:00:24.060> notice<00:00:24.690> it<00:00:24.810> flies<00:00:25.050> better<00:00:25.380> without<00:00:25.770> it<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
I notice it flies better without it at a

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.830 
I notice it flies better without it at a
problem<00:00:26.520> with<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.820> propeller<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.300> actually

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
problem with the propeller is actually

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.580 
problem with the propeller is actually
hitting<00:00:28.770> these<00:00:29.039> little<00:00:29.340> bars<00:00:29.610> that<00:00:30.440> kind<00:00:31.440> of

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
hitting these little bars that kind of

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.420 
hitting these little bars that kind of
hold<00:00:31.860> it<00:00:32.009> up<00:00:32.189> when<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.579> connected<00:00:33.620> yeah<00:00:34.620> so

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
hold it up when it's connected yeah so

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.279 
hold it up when it's connected yeah so
this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.820> new<00:00:36.030> remote<00:00:36.270> kind<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.930> looks<00:00:37.170> like

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
this is a new remote kind of looks like

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:40.040 
this is a new remote kind of looks like
an<00:00:37.769> xbox<00:00:38.309> remote<00:00:38.609> it's<00:00:39.059> all<00:00:39.210> right<00:00:39.449> definitely

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
an xbox remote it's all right definitely

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.200 
an xbox remote it's all right definitely
not<00:00:40.199> my<00:00:40.409> favorite<00:00:40.440> The<00:00:41.339> Binding<00:00:41.519> procedure<00:00:41.969> is

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
not my favorite The Binding procedure is

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.029 
not my favorite The Binding procedure is
basically<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.079> same<00:00:43.319> the<00:00:43.620> only<00:00:43.649> difference

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
basically the same the only difference

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.459 
basically the same the only difference
though<00:00:44.819> is<00:00:44.850> when<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.420> plug<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.019> it's<00:00:46.319> on<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
though is when you plug it in it's on a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.950 
though is when you plug it in it's on a
flat<00:00:46.739> surface<00:00:46.769> you<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.999> power<00:00:48.269> on<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
flat surface you have to power on and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.779 
flat surface you have to power on and
then<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.530> toggle<00:00:49.769> it<00:00:50.190> up<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.670> then

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
then you have to toggle it up and then

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.329 
then you have to toggle it up and then
toggle<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.389> back<00:00:51.600> down<00:00:51.929> and<00:00:52.260> able<00:00:52.409> for<00:00:52.979> it<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
toggle it back down and able for it to

00:00:53.339 --> 00:02:13.280 
toggle it back down and able for it to
bind

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.020 

as<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.710> can<00:02:14.860> see<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.130> basically<00:02:15.520> fits<00:02:15.820> in<00:02:15.940> the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
as you can see it basically fits in the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.970 
as you can see it basically fits in the
palm<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.240> my<00:02:16.450> hand<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.780> little<00:02:16.900> bit<00:02:17.050> bigger<00:02:17.320> the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
palm of my hand a little bit bigger the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.790 
palm of my hand a little bit bigger the
pillars<00:02:18.490> are<00:02:18.700> really<00:02:19.570> small<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.500> think

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
pillars are really small and I think

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.710 
pillars are really small and I think
that's<00:02:21.010> what's<00:02:21.310> lacking<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.940> feel<00:02:22.180> if<00:02:22.420> they<00:02:22.570> had

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
that's what's lacking I feel if they had

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.990 
that's what's lacking I feel if they had
bigger<00:02:22.960> propellers<00:02:23.320> would<00:02:23.770> have<00:02:24.640> just<00:02:24.910> a

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
bigger propellers would have just a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.380 
bigger propellers would have just a
little<00:02:25.030> bit<00:02:25.450> more<00:02:25.660> speed<00:02:26.110> unfortunately<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
little bit more speed unfortunately the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.320 
little bit more speed unfortunately the
top<00:02:28.390> here<00:02:28.780> gets<00:02:29.050> in<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.320> way<00:02:29.470> if<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.800> try<00:02:30.070> to

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
top here gets in the way if you try to

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.020 
top here gets in the way if you try to
put<00:02:31.330> like<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.600> seam<00:02:31.900> x1<00:02:32.440> propellers<00:02:33.010> on<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.520> so

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
put like the seam x1 propellers on it so

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.940 
put like the seam x1 propellers on it so
the<00:02:34.180> one<00:02:34.330> thing<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.660> am<00:02:34.780> disappointed<00:02:34.960> about<00:02:35.560> is

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
the one thing I am disappointed about is

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.280 
the one thing I am disappointed about is
after<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> couple<00:02:36.910> crashes<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.630> noticed<00:02:38.050> that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
after a couple crashes I noticed that

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.530 
after a couple crashes I noticed that
the<00:02:38.590> little<00:02:39.340> motor<00:02:39.520> mount<00:02:39.790> there<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.210> starting

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
the little motor mount there is starting

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.240 
the little motor mount there is starting
to<00:02:40.750> crack<00:02:41.050> already<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.710> sooner<00:02:42.040> or<00:02:42.070> later

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
to crack already and sooner or later

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.030 
to crack already and sooner or later
that's<00:02:42.520> just<00:02:42.760> going<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.030> snap<00:02:43.270> right<00:02:43.570> off

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
that's just going to snap right off

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.780 
that's just going to snap right off
unfortunately<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.070> wouldn't<00:02:45.460> really<00:02:45.520> make

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
unfortunately that wouldn't really make

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.790 
unfortunately that wouldn't really make
an<00:02:45.970> easy<00:02:46.150> way<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.450> fix<00:02:46.900> this<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.470> kinda<00:02:47.710> have

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
an easy way to fix this you kinda have

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.250 
an easy way to fix this you kinda have
to<00:02:47.860> unsolder<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:49.120> wires<00:02:49.360> you'd<00:02:49.900> have<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.140> buy

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
to unsolder the wires you'd have to buy

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.290 
to unsolder the wires you'd have to buy
the<00:02:50.320> new<00:02:50.560> piece<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.190> then<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.880> have<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.030> guide

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
the new piece and then you have to guide

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.150 
the new piece and then you have to guide
the<00:02:52.540> wires<00:02:52.750> through<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.350> piece<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:53.710> plastic

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
the wires through the piece of plastic

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.460 
the wires through the piece of plastic
and<00:02:54.310> then<00:02:54.460> resolder<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.540> able<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.020> put<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
and then resolder and able to put the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.950 
and then resolder and able to put the
piece<00:02:56.680> put<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.280> motor<00:02:57.460> metal<00:02:57.820> back<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.270> which

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
piece put the motor metal back on which

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.470 
piece put the motor metal back on which
on<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.230> x1<00:02:59.710> it<00:02:59.950> was<00:03:00.070> a<00:03:00.220> lot<00:03:00.490> simpler<00:03:01.030> than<00:03:01.420> that

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
on the x1 it was a lot simpler than that

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.400 
on the x1 it was a lot simpler than that
so<00:03:02.470> my<00:03:02.650> overall<00:03:02.800> first<00:03:03.460> impressions<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:05.260> is

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
so my overall first impressions this is

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.560 
so my overall first impressions this is
great<00:03:05.620> for<00:03:05.740> indoor<00:03:06.340> flight<00:03:06.700> definitely<00:03:07.300> very

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
great for indoor flight definitely very

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.040 
great for indoor flight definitely very
easy<00:03:07.960> to<00:03:08.320> control<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:10.480> just<00:03:10.600> you'll<00:03:10.810> see

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
easy to control and I just you'll see
