00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.819
 woerth then we are on the site of lisieux 

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:41.440
 and we are moore located at the gates of the day before 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.690
 so a shape want little port to holy natural pea so 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.970
 we are three friends and the teams at his time on these on his 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.280
 sides on these sites 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.180
 hunt at stops the material we 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.470
 or that one takes most often on the site of places are often decisive 75 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.180
 so from that country 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.740
 % and tahitian flash 75 atrous that's what's gotten almost better 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.520
 know it's not bad especially at the level for the west side where we can not find 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.070
 bad to find fault rifle 75 so a note carries she wants 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.750
 any type of 75 are really well suited so we for the team 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.600
 says a lot 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.640
 the million blood but the port and relaxes a little bit so we see that the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.110
 thomas had done a small installation with a friend a small rays 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.870
 end of film and union with followers so it's better you shoot 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.940
 you are at the same time I put your arrow is the ideal in 75 very suzy 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.810
 very well for hunting and weapons we have this second 75 elsewhere this mail 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.120
 not so insisted that I will read with that with the film that leaves immediately 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.969
 that the wasp trigger a dish 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.200
 as soon as the trigger is engaged 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.100
 we see that the film and cleared 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.570
 and in the meantime the second and then 75 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.540
 and then we always lead to 90 so on bottom of the same source two to 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.900
 three rifles in boat 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.120
 ncis people did the haka if we made bungee-breaking a 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.490
 trigger we bring rubbed or a lost arrow we can take another 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.270
 Swiss 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.760
 so that's a 90 fuse very well too so europe more for the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.610
 large areas of far-firing where the dirty waters so always soar 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.010
 tahitian it is common that one hunts tahitian arrow took place 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:24.889
 and for 100 m and therefore a fuse 90 centimeters not bad either always 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.509
 equipped high-level 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:31.539
 be always a small installation medina thomas a small change the wind 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.109
 Millions who do not get involved with Kiska Sport is solid 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.619
 and that's not bad either as a crossbow 90 centimeters 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.389
 black color it goes everywhere 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.650
 for the handle handles colored it was very very good when the water is 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:46.379
 dirty or that we are in the big south laminaria for a reason or for 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.439
 another one is forced to leave his son in the bottom either a fish or the 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.469
 arrow anything 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.900
 a light-colored handle ray richert has always found his physical 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.230
 and that's it it's something innate to what if we go hunting 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.230
 for lost material it's not the purpose of the maneuver 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.459
 then in combination for 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.510
 the draw to the geographical team of the place 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.890
 clear areas but very cool it is advisable to take a 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.529
 combination of 7 millimeters 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.309
 yet in this season carlos is not very hot and the surrounding areas 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:15.599
 of 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.129
 come 13 14 degrees 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.799
 we dive all year round from January 1st to December 31st when 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.689
 conditions allow it so that minimath it's true that's what we 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.729
 do better 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:29.629
 but at the spring time we can keep abbott 7 millimeters taking 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.110
 bar 500 to less than five minutes and then mid-season 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.990
 big summer season where we are a little warmer we can take no less 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.989
 of five millimeters pitt 45 millimeters but good after 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.429
