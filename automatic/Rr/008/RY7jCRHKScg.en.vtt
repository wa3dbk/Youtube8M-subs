00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
of course but you can imagine just how

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.470 
of course but you can imagine just how
useful<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.170> particular<00:03:09.000> devices<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:12.480> I've

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
useful that particular devices and I've

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.479 
useful that particular devices and I've
actually<00:03:13.800> engaged<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:15.340> capture<00:03:15.760> software

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
actually engaged the capture software

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.740 
actually engaged the capture software
prior<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.700> this<00:03:18.790> filming<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:19.510> we're<00:03:19.630> actually

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
prior to this filming so we're actually

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.320 
prior to this filming so we're actually
now<00:03:20.170> recording<00:03:21.040> in<00:03:21.160> real<00:03:21.400> time<00:03:21.760> as<00:03:22.030> you're

examining<00:04:56.680> intake<00:04:57.010> systems<00:04:57.520> we<00:04:58.000> had<00:04:58.150> an<00:04:58.240> issue

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
examining intake systems we had an issue

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.310 
examining intake systems we had an issue
with<00:04:58.540> a<00:04:58.750> diesel<00:04:59.080> where<00:05:00.070> we'd<00:05:01.060> done<00:05:01.930> some<00:05:02.140> work

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
with a diesel where we'd done some work

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.380 
with a diesel where we'd done some work
on<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.590> injector<00:05:03.040> seats<00:05:03.280> we'd<00:05:03.730> actually<00:05:03.880> cut

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
on the injector seats we'd actually cut

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.890 
on the injector seats we'd actually cut
the<00:05:04.420> seats<00:05:04.720> back<00:05:05.190> we'd<00:05:06.190> scavenged<00:05:07.090> and<00:05:07.330> we

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
the seats back we'd scavenged and we

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.110 
the seats back we'd scavenged and we
thought<00:05:08.140> cleared<00:05:08.980> out<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.160> cylinder<00:05:09.700> prior

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
thought cleared out the cylinder prior

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.000 
thought cleared out the cylinder prior
to<00:05:10.150> hitting<00:05:10.420> new<00:05:10.630> injector<00:05:11.050> we<00:05:11.500> wanted<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:11.860> be

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
to hitting new injector we wanted to be

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.040 
to hitting new injector we wanted to be
absolutely<00:05:12.100> sure<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:13.060> we<00:05:13.570> use<00:05:13.690> this<00:05:13.840> device

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
absolutely sure and we use this device

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.530 
absolutely sure and we use this device
to<00:05:14.230> examine<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.070> piston<00:05:15.430> crown<00:05:15.640> to<00:05:16.240> make<00:05:16.390> sure

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
to examine the piston crown to make sure

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.240 
to examine the piston crown to make sure
everything<00:05:16.900> was<00:05:16.990> okay<00:05:17.350> in<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.530> cylinder<00:05:17.890> and

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
everything was okay in the cylinder and

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.010 
everything was okay in the cylinder and
indeed<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:18.880> was<00:05:19.090> so<00:05:19.300> had<00:05:19.420> the<00:05:19.510> confidence<00:05:19.750> and

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
indeed it was so had the confidence and

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.990 
indeed it was so had the confidence and
to<00:05:20.170> fit<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.440> injector<00:05:20.890> without<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.700> worry<00:05:21.910> of

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
to fit the injector without the worry of

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.480 
to fit the injector without the worry of
contamination<00:05:22.630> or<00:05:22.930> potential<00:05:23.500> damage<00:05:23.800> to<00:05:24.370> the

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
contamination or potential damage to the

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.980 
contamination or potential damage to the
new<00:05:24.580> injector<00:05:25.030> or<00:05:25.150> indeed<00:05:25.480> to<00:05:25.510> the<00:05:25.690> piston

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
new injector or indeed to the piston

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.550 
new injector or indeed to the piston
crown<00:05:26.200> so<00:05:26.950> very<00:05:27.370> very<00:05:27.460> useful<00:05:27.910> tool<00:05:28.470> thank<00:05:29.470> you

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
crown so very very useful tool thank you

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:38.640 
crown so very very useful tool thank you
for<00:05:29.680> joining

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650
