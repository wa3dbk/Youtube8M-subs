00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello youtube friends the story that 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.890
 will listen next is real in the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.139
 description of the video I will leave the link 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.009
 of the short film of which I will comment 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.619
 then I leave you with 'jorge for 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.220
 tell the story comment and point 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.529
 well I heard that there is a 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.660
 caricature that was never distributed 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.840
 not even for the fans anymore 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.179
 passionate mickey mouse according to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.360
 most of the sources are 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.010
 caricature has nothing special 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.559
 it's just a new continuum of 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.230
 mickey walking through six 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.660
 buildings for about two or three minutes 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.600
 before dark and finish with the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.989
 animation more or less as in the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.780
 Flintstones unlike the music 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.890
 cheerful of always the song of this 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.390
 caricature was not a song at all 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.789
 it was just as if they hit the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.180
 piano per minute and a half before it 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.409
 become white noise for the rest 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.929
 of the film 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.539
 and this was not the happy and the old 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:12.950
 mickey that we love neither mickey no 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:15.780
 I was dancing, not even smiling 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.840
 just walking with an expression 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.569
 very normal facial but for some reason 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.140
 his face was turned to the left 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:28.049
 as having a somber look up 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.209
 One or two years ago everyone believed that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.329
 after the scene got dark 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:36.240
 the cartoon ended but when 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.369
 Leonard Martin was checking it for 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.739
 put it as a bonus in the divided 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.170
 Leonard decided that this was simply 

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:46.079
 trash like to put it in the live and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.179
 however I wanted to have a copy 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.060
 digital for the simple fact of being a 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.520
 Walt Disney's work when digital made 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.159
 the caricature on his computer was 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.759
 account of something the cartoon lasted for 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.250
 done nine minutes and four seconds 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.560
 this is what the source said 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.750
 personal assistant of the Lord himself 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.390
 Martin 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.710
 after vanishing in black it 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.960
 it stays like this until the 6th minute after 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.310
 come back to mickey walking the sound was 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.620
 different this time it was like a murmur 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.590
 it was not a language but rather as a 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.420
 guttural scream while the noise is made 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.820
 more indistinguishable and strong in the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.850
 next minute the image starts to 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.830
 break down the sidewalk starts going in 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.980
 directions that seem impossible 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.590
 based on the walk of mickey the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.890
 gloomy face mouse slowly 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.650
 turns into a grim smile in the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.920
 minute 7 the murmurs become 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.500
 a chilling screams of those that you 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.410
 they hurt only when you hear them and the image 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.860
 It gets darker with colors that do not 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.760
 were possible at that time the face of 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.590
 mickey then began to collapse 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.350
 his eyes rolled to the bottom of his 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.020
 chin like two marbles and his strange 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.930
 smile pointed up to the side 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.890
 left of his face the buildings are 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.710
 they turned in 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.230
 floating in the air and the sidewalk was still 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.770
 impossible directions navigating in 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.350
 strange directions Mr. Martin 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.810
 was disturbed with this and left the 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.790
 room sending an employee to 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.980
 to finish watching the video and take 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.890
 notes of everything that happened to the 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.700
 last second and then save the 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.590
 caricature disk in the safe 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.970
 it turns out that at the end of the video after 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.459
 of a guttural scream 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.860
 the film ends abruptly with 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.230
 the face of mickey in the credits with what 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.170
 that sounded like a broken musical box 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.290
 touching in the background this goes through more or 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.989
 less about 30 seconds and whatever it is 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.930
 that happens in that time nobody has a 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.600
 little information a guard 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.280
 security that worked in the building 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.610
 He commented that he was doing his 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.739
 rounds that night outside the room 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.350
 he said he saw the employee came out shaking 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.200
 of the room saying the real suffering 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.200
 it has not been known he repeated it seven times 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.650
 then he removed the guard weapon 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.660
 suicide the only thing that is known by leonard 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.260
 martÃ­n was a phrase of the last 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.240
 pictures a sentence in Russian that said the 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.050
 views of hell brings his audience 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.240
 back to where I know no one else the 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.430
 has seen but there have been dozens of 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.860
 attempts to put the file in rapid 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.770
 char by the studio employees the 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.050
 which have been dismissed for that reason what 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.390
 The only thing I know is that the video is in 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.450
 youtube without the latest pictures of the 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.610
 film thank you as I said 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.620
 beginning of the video in the description 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.260
 of the video I leave the link of the 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.260
