can stretch those out very simply by

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.310 
can stretch those out very simply by
doing<00:00:54.190> this<00:00:54.970> type<00:00:55.239> of<00:00:55.270> motion<00:00:55.630> here<00:00:56.050> so<00:00:56.230> I'm

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
doing this type of motion here so I'm

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.170 
doing this type of motion here so I'm
stretching<00:00:56.650> out<00:00:56.890> it's<00:00:57.190> it's<00:00:57.610> I'm<00:00:57.880> actually

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
gluteal muscles as well the other

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.420 
gluteal muscles as well the other
muscles<00:01:26.409> involved<00:01:26.770> in<00:01:26.860> touching<00:01:27.100> your<00:01:27.220> toes

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
or what's called the quadratus lumborum

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.920 
or what's called the quadratus lumborum
basically<00:01:30.040> your<00:01:30.220> low<00:01:30.369> back<00:01:30.549> muscles<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.240> so

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.320 
gently even side to side a little bit
too<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:40.630> course<00:01:41.229> your<00:01:41.890> hips<00:01:42.280> are<00:01:42.610> involved
