00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello guys welcome back with this new one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.400
 video i have this is forgotten how 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.420
 comments were made and then 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.800
 sorry, however , this video is not 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.309
 makes a lot of sense as I'm here 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.960
 just to let you know that as it is 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.720
 finished school i just came back from 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.070
 from turin for the concept of vasco 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.359
 now I should be freer then 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.400
 we also spend more time in now 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.750
 this period of making videos just that 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.150
 problem lies in the fact that I don't know 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.759
 just what video to make that series that ser 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.340
 will start doing as it was climbing 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.620
 we have now ended I don't feel like doing 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.930
 always gompa so I purely don't have the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.730
 minimal idea as gameplay below 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.559
 you will see some matches of the seasons 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.670
 since now I'm playing a little with the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.469
 mode since I 'm started doing 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.300
 a few games every so often about virgin 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.010
 gaming or you are where you start where 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.219
 you bet real money to make for 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.899
 to play in a row games 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.020
 so since we don't play on the team there 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.940
 and nostalgic team who up about the game 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.810
 true subjective real by all put me 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.420
 it's not life at all it's playing a little 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.010
 on this in this mode 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.060
 honestly I recommend you to play it 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.979
 meanwhile on seasons or even on 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.590
 or just not playing on the team 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.020
 the teams don't do as I'm doing 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.250
 before that when I cognitive ceiling 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.740
 I played on the mind of everyone you put into 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.390
 this is because the matches on seasons a 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.520
 my opinion is much more fun 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.890
 since that's where you really see who 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.450
 knows how to play 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.130
 apart from that I do not know what else stars in 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.290
 this video doesn't even monetize it 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.479
 because it makes no sense I 'm here only 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.950
 to ask you what video you want to start 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.619
 because I am open to any 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.450
 any advice any mutu with 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.220
 samuel what you want to write write me 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.659
 he really has no idea 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.530
 I had already thought at this time of a 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.170
 some serious but 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.930
 but they were all half of one 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.970
 series that must be studied well and is 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.590
 a little for now already late to start 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.680
 given that in a while it should come out micro 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.330
 14 not too much, however, in the summer 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.960
 boh doesn't make sense especially since i am 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.250
 on xbox start many other series that 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.680
 I have in mind they have a prerequisite 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.330
 start from scratch last team and on xbox 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.230
 you can't because you have to pay a 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.810
 another subscription xbox live then 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.420
 I really am in a blind alley I don't know 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.550
 what to do but I'm sent by 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.620
 desire to make vines ie I can do 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.670
 everything 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.800
 however first a parenthesis for a 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.260
 second look at this technique that i am 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.370
 experiencing beautiful sailing advice and yes 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.140
 call how to concede a goal 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.489
 when you punish and pass 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.760
 adversary 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.489
 these will be found in 22 or even three 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.920
 against one therefore it will be almost almost certain 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.709
 who suffer goals 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.660
 having said this let's get back to the topic 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.120
 today's main video if we can 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.180
 call it an argument since it is not 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.519
 so I tell you for the last time about 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.950
 advise me ninÃ¬ comments a series 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.680
 even if it's not really right for me 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.320
 the same but enough that I just do it 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.730
 something well said this I greet you and you 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.500
 I give the next video appointment 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.090
 hoping that there is one given that how 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.549
 they are in fact now I don't know 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.860
 what to do then 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.870
 sorry for this period too, a little 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.940
 fluctuating are practically charging a 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.890
 video every two weeks 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.260
 I hope to shred clouds October apology 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.670
 since it is not right to do it I am 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.350
 telling the facts just like me 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.109
 want to make videos but I don't know what 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.480
 do also because they are in a sense 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.700
 in my channel I'm a little stuck 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.370
 since my writings are only 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.959
 written for fifa so I can't 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.940
 not even invent a new game for me 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.940
 start a new series then do me 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.680
 know what you want 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.520
 and no help appointment to the next 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.520
 nice video
