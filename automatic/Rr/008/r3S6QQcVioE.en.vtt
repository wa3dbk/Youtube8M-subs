let's<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.630> fear<00:01:57.930> see<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.259> acceleration<00:01:58.829> i

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
let's just fear see is acceleration i

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.819 
let's just fear see is acceleration i
think<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.340> 70<00:01:59.850> that's<00:02:00.270> not<00:02:00.479> exactly

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
think was 70 that's not exactly

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.740 
think was 70 that's not exactly
fantastic<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.549> yay<00:02:02.939> does<00:02:03.299> get<00:02:03.509> caught

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
fantastic and there yay does get caught

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.030 
fantastic and there yay does get caught
out<00:02:03.899> from<00:02:04.170> time<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.500> time<00:02:04.530> with<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
out from time to time with the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.429 
out from time to time with the
acceleration<00:02:06.030> not<00:02:06.509> leading<00:02:06.750> up<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.079> his<00:02:07.170> top

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
acceleration not leading up to his top

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.219 
acceleration not leading up to his top
speed<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.920> acceleration<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> conv<00:02:09.720> position

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
speed so acceleration is a conv position

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.910 
speed so acceleration is a conv position
and<00:02:10.349> wise<00:02:10.500> its<00:02:10.920> key<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.849> really<00:02:12.120> really<00:02:12.330> is

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
and wise its key it really really is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.670 
and wise its key it really really is
