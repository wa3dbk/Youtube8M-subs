00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.600 
holding the knife it gives you a secure
feel<00:02:32.540> there<00:02:33.540> are<00:02:33.570> many<00:02:33.959> videos<00:02:34.440> online<00:02:34.920> that

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
feel there are many videos online that

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.180 
feel there are many videos online that
show<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.120> how<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:38.600> put<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.720> cord<00:02:39.989> on<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
show you how to put the cord on the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.210 
show you how to put the cord on the
notes<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.300> all<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.410> don't<00:02:43.590> need<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.040> go

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
notes and all that so I don't need to go

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.940 
notes and all that so I don't need to go
over<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:45.060> just<00:02:45.390> say<00:02:45.569> safety<00:02:45.930> first<00:02:46.140> it's<00:02:46.739> a

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
over that I just say safety first it's a

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.790 
over that I just say safety first it's a
pretty<00:02:47.760> short<00:02:48.060> plate<00:02:48.390> out<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.170> box<00:02:49.410> so

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
pretty short plate out of the box so

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.520 
pretty short plate out of the box so
what<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.130> do<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.940> put<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.300> bit<00:02:51.540> rag<00:02:51.930> around<00:02:52.170> it

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
what I do is I put a bit rag around it

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.790 
what I do is I put a bit rag around it
and<00:02:52.709> then<00:02:52.890> clamp<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.550> tight<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.600> vise<00:02:54.800> the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
and then clamp it tight in a vise the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.520 
and then clamp it tight in a vise the
plate<00:02:56.310> itself<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.090> part<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.900> covered<00:02:58.170> and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
plate itself so that part is covered and

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.270 
plate itself so that part is covered and
then<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.890> can<00:02:59.130> really<00:02:59.640> strong<00:03:00.620> put<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:02.010> cord

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
then I can really strong put the cord

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.960 
then I can really strong put the cord
around<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.790> grip<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.200> needed<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:04.970> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
around the grip that is needed that the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.740 
around the grip that is needed that the
cord<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.420> really<00:03:07.160> not<00:03:08.160> moving<00:03:08.670> or<00:03:09.360> moving

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
cord is really not moving or moving

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.430 
cord is really not moving or moving
Atlee<00:03:10.500> at<00:03:10.769> least<00:03:11.100> it's<00:03:11.370> possible<00:03:11.670> around<00:03:12.440> that

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
Atlee at least it's possible around that

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.479 
Atlee at least it's possible around that
the<00:03:13.620> grip<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:15.500> tight<00:03:16.500> as<00:03:16.709> possible<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.459> you

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
the grip is a tight as possible so you

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.380 
the grip is a tight as possible so you
really<00:03:18.000> need<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:19.140> pull<00:03:19.799> on<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.430> that

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
really need to to pull on it and that

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.039 
really need to to pull on it and that
goes<00:03:21.600> best<00:03:21.959> as<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.709> blade<00:03:22.950> is<00:03:23.340> hold<00:03:24.180> shot

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
goes best as the the blade is hold shot

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.759 
goes best as the the blade is hold shot
in<00:03:25.410> place<00:03:26.100> there<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:26.780> that<00:03:27.780> much<00:03:28.079> about<00:03:28.500> that

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
in place there so that much about that

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.870 
in place there so that much about that
and<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:30.170> video<00:03:31.170> number<00:03:31.260> three<00:03:31.709> we<00:03:31.980> gonna<00:03:32.160> have

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
and in video number three we gonna have

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.280 
and in video number three we gonna have
a<00:03:32.910> local<00:03:33.360> bit<00:03:33.510> at<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:34.079> kite<00:03:34.500> action<00:03:34.980> then
