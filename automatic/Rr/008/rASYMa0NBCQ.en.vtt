00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
game so if they get tired he can

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.860

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.900 
probably see some minutes early on the
field<00:03:38.079> which<00:03:38.859> I<00:03:39.069> wish<00:03:39.519> they<00:03:39.669> would<00:03:39.819> have

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
field which I wish they would have

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.220 
field which I wish they would have
brought<00:03:40.030> that<00:03:40.150> back<00:03:40.540> where<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.900> can<00:03:41.049> mention
