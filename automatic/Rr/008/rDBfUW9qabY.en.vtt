00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 to know 

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.310
 I 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.290
 no 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.850
 the collections now they 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:47.280
 would not always ensure the ice 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.280
 then to fight on the list of alain 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.190
 such sentimental right now I the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.510
 sense of injustice the private and 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.199
 that she loves when one is innocent one does not 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.199
 can not a job 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.230
 with thierry gidon that you go 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.250
 to arrive with a mask on the face 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.540
 the association of jockeys is worried about 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.400
 recent decisions this time sir 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.070
 commissioners of france galop 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.240
 accidental contamination is proven 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.730
 as such by the Medical Committee 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.470
 independent and she is still punished 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.750
 by the Commissioners' Corps under 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.270
 the lack of foresight of the jockey who 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.980
 have been seen guarding themselves from this 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.130
 contamination 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.000
 we feel that this is impossible to 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.180
 less to live in an environment 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.610
 totally sanitized where the masks 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.010
 surgical or no longer live or 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.390
 all so we wanted to express 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.670
 our disapproval of this 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.020
 decision that we consider unfair by 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.030
 an act of silent demonstrations 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.820
 percent in May hampered courses 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.870
 the treatment course and the meeting well 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.160
 sure the stÃ©phane pasquier sphere 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.930
 speed things up because his record 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.020
 very publicized but it's not 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.830
 only his case who can position 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.270
 the association of jockeys wants a 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.340
 revision of the balls on which are taken 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.290
 these decisions if a jockey proves his 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.300
 innocence and that he is doomed when 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.680
 even then surrender that calls into question 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.879
 any integrity of any system 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.079
 to protect and that's to help 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.620
 jokers general of the association of 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.959
 jockeys 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.159
 exactly it happened to steinbach and 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.260
 it can happen to all the jockeys and 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.430
 unfortunately it was a trace so a 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
 contamination it can happen to all 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.159
 world so we are happy to be punished 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.200
 when you're just a contamination 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.889
 since the shock proved that he was not 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.280
 not political 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:41.969
 so she is punished for not being British 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.969
 and it's too hard
