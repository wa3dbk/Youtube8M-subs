00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.270 
entertained I think it is very cheeky
because<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.030> simply<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.780> retread<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.920> cars

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
because it is simply a retread of cars

in the most outrageous way I mean it is

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.700 
in the most outrageous way I mean it is
it's<00:00:58.530> not<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> secret<00:00:59.370> cars<00:00:59.820> too<00:01:00.210> however<00:01:01.079> kind

it's not a secret cars too however kind

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.560 
it's not a secret cars too however kind
of<00:01:01.770> annoying<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.430> did<00:01:02.760> try<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> be<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
of annoying that was did try to be a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.530

sort<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> progression<00:01:07.409> now<00:01:07.710> course<00:01:08.070> planes<00:01:08.760> is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
sort of progression now course planes is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.580 
sort of progression now course planes is
at<00:01:09.150> least<00:01:09.299> notionally<00:01:09.750> about<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> completely

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
at least notionally about a completely

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.170 
at least notionally about a completely
different<00:01:11.070> set<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.430> characters<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.090> it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
different set of characters so it

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.609 
different set of characters so it
doesn't<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.689> progression<00:01:12.869> but

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
doesn't have to be a progression but

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.440 
doesn't have to be a progression but

sort<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.030> flow<00:02:00.420> along<00:02:00.780> its<00:02:01.110> its<00:02:01.740> kind<00:02:02.130> of

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
sort of flow along its its kind of

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.219 
sort of flow along its its kind of
eerily<00:02:02.850> smooth<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:03.479> actually<00:02:03.869> from<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
eerily smooth it's not actually from the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.230 
eerily smooth it's not actually from the
pics<00:02:04.469> are<00:02:04.680> statements<00:02:05.369> from<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> new<00:02:05.850> as<00:02:06.090> i

understand it Disney Tunes stable and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.510 
understand it Disney Tunes stable and
maybe<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.869> doesn't<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.410> much<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.310> grip

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
maybe it doesn't have much of the grip

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.820 
maybe it doesn't have much of the grip
that<00:02:11.760> Pixar<00:02:12.209> really<00:02:13.140> might<00:02:13.379> have<00:02:13.560> bra

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
his way I see fit there is something

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.210 
his way I see fit there is something
looks<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.350> mean<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.620> feels<00:02:49.710> like<00:02:49.920> every

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
looks like I mean it feels like every

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.310 
looks like I mean it feels like every
time<00:02:50.370> we<00:02:50.580> watch<00:02:50.700> an<00:02:50.880> animation<00:02:51.210> now<00:02:51.600> maybe

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
time we watch an animation now maybe

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.840 
time we watch an animation now maybe
just<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.800> Disney<00:02:53.040> Animation<00:02:53.490> we're<00:02:53.640> always

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
just a Disney Animation we're always

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.640 
just a Disney Animation we're always
saying<00:02:54.120> well<00:02:54.600> it's<00:02:54.750> not<00:02:54.900> quite<00:02:55.170> as<00:02:55.350> good<00:02:55.500> as

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
saying well it's not quite as good as

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.740 
saying well it's not quite as good as
the<00:02:55.800> Pixar<00:02:56.190> films<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.880> know<00:02:57.090> ten<00:02:57.420> years<00:02:57.630> ago

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the Pixar films and I know ten years ago

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.750 
the Pixar films and I know ten years ago
whatever<00:02:58.500> yo<00:02:58.709> really<00:02:59.040> isn't<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.400> maybe<00:02:59.520> that

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
whatever yo really isn't and maybe that

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.490 
whatever yo really isn't and maybe that
is<00:02:59.880> the<00:02:59.910> disadvantage<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.780> setting<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.230> bar

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
is the disadvantage of setting that bar

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.770 
is the disadvantage of setting that bar
so<00:03:01.770> high<00:03:01.800> now<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.459> kind<00:03:03.240> of<00:03:03.330> bog<00:03:03.600> standard

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
so high now that kind of bog standard

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
film mmm yeah I mean we've only just

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.740

realized<00:03:20.400> we've<00:03:20.640> emerged<00:03:20.910> from<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.300> golden

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
realized we've emerged from this golden

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.750 
realized we've emerged from this golden
age<00:03:21.900> maybe<00:03:22.320> we<00:03:22.500> didn't<00:03:22.769> appreciate<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.400> enough

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
age maybe we didn't appreciate it enough

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.240 
age maybe we didn't appreciate it enough
for<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.030> time<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.209> did<00:03:25.019> well<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.680> didn't<00:03:26.190> think

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
for the time I did well I didn't think

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.530 
for the time I did well I didn't think
we<00:03:26.400> thought<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.730> as<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.880> golden<00:03:27.180> age<00:03:27.269> I

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
we thought of it as a golden age I

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.360 
we thought of it as a golden age I
thought<00:03:27.989> each<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.620> every<00:03:28.890> film<00:03:29.130> was<00:03:29.340> a

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
thought each and every film was a

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.990 
thought each and every film was a
stunning<00:03:29.790> individual<00:03:30.570> news<00:03:30.900> of<00:03:31.320> joy<00:03:31.650> but<00:03:32.580> only
