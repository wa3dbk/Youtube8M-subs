00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy and today

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.190 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy and today
I<00:00:02.639> got<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.879> real<00:00:03.090> quick<00:00:03.270> mechanical<00:00:03.840> tip<00:00:03.990> that

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
I got a real quick mechanical tip that

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.420 
I got a real quick mechanical tip that
should<00:00:04.319> help<00:00:04.440> you<00:00:04.620> hit<00:00:04.740> your<00:00:04.890> skill<00:00:05.069> shots<00:00:05.310> a

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
should help you hit your skill shots a

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.150 
should help you hit your skill shots a
bit<00:00:05.580> more<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:06.569> slow<00:00:07.200> rolling<00:00:07.470> let's

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
bit more and that is slow rolling let's

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.669 
bit more and that is slow rolling let's
get<00:00:08.340> started<00:00:08.900> when<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:09.929> comes<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.260> skill<00:00:10.500> shots

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
get started when it comes to skill shots

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.499 
get started when it comes to skill shots
in<00:00:10.830> league<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.250> can<00:00:11.429> be<00:00:11.580> hard<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.940> dodge<00:00:12.210> them

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
in league it can be hard to dodge them

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.480 
in league it can be hard to dodge them
based<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.840> reaction<00:00:13.290> time<00:00:13.469> alone<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.009> what

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
based on reaction time alone so what

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.550 
based on reaction time alone so what
most<00:00:14.700> players<00:00:14.849> do<00:00:15.210> myself<00:00:15.660> included<00:00:16.170> is

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
most players do myself included is

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.859 
most players do myself included is
instead<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.130> relying<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.609> reaction<00:00:18.119> time<00:00:18.330> you

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
instead of relying on reaction time you

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.720 
instead of relying on reaction time you
simply<00:00:19.260> anticipate<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.100> skill<00:00:20.369> shot<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.640> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
simply anticipate the skill shot in the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.759 
simply anticipate the skill shot in the
first<00:00:20.970> place<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.109> start<00:00:22.350> dodging

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
first place and so you start dodging

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.590 
first place and so you start dodging
before<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.130> even<00:00:23.250> thrown<00:00:23.550> out<00:00:23.730> leading<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.570> a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
before it's even thrown out leading to a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.890 
before it's even thrown out leading to a
very<00:00:24.990> easy<00:00:25.320> Juke<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.330> slow<00:00:27.330> rolling<00:00:27.630> is

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
very easy Juke and slow rolling is

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.509 
very easy Juke and slow rolling is
basically<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.560> counter<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.070> strategy

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
basically the counter to that strategy

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.339 
basically the counter to that strategy
and<00:00:29.910> takes<00:00:30.150> advantage<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:30.990> order<00:00:31.230> to

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
and takes advantage of it in order to

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.490 
and takes advantage of it in order to
actually<00:00:31.529> land<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.399> respective<00:00:32.940> skill<00:00:33.180> shot

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
actually land the respective skill shot

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.810 
actually land the respective skill shot
so<00:00:34.500> what's<00:00:34.680> slow<00:00:34.920> rolling<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.579> when<00:00:35.730> you

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
so what's slow rolling is is when you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.520 
so what's slow rolling is is when you
basically<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:36.450> hold<00:00:36.660> onto<00:00:36.840> your<00:00:37.050> ace<00:00:37.200> move

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
basically just hold onto your ace move

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.260 
basically just hold onto your ace move
for<00:00:37.770> quite<00:00:37.950> some<00:00:38.129> time<00:00:38.340> often<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:38.879> as<00:00:39.000> long<00:00:39.210> as

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
for quite some time often for as long as

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270 
for quite some time often for as long as
possible<00:00:39.540> kind<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> game<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.070> chicken

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
possible kind of like a game of chicken

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.889 
possible kind of like a game of chicken
and<00:00:41.610> after<00:00:41.879> your<00:00:42.000> opponent<00:00:42.270> tries<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.540> Juke<00:00:42.780> or

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
and after your opponent tries to Juke or

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.020 
and after your opponent tries to Juke or
to<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.200> then<00:00:43.559> throughout<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.040> skill<00:00:44.250> shot<00:00:44.489> so

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
to you then throughout the skill shot so

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.220 
to you then throughout the skill shot so
you<00:00:45.120> try<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.329> throw<00:00:45.510> out<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> skill<00:00:45.930> shot<00:00:46.110> as

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
you try to throw out the skill shot as

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.040 
you try to throw out the skill shot as
late<00:00:46.649> as<00:00:46.800> possible<00:00:47.210> that<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.780> walk

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
late as possible that or you just walk

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.319 
late as possible that or you just walk
up<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.379> them<00:00:49.530> use<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.100> short-range<00:00:50.640> ability<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
up to them use a short-range ability and

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.970 
up to them use a short-range ability and
then<00:00:51.719> as<00:00:51.870> they<00:00:51.960> try<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.199> run<00:00:52.379> away<00:00:52.440> from<00:00:52.680> you

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
then as they try to run away from you

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.490 
then as they try to run away from you
you<00:00:53.340> use<00:00:53.550> your<00:00:53.699> skill<00:00:53.969> shot<00:00:54.149> then<00:00:54.449> skill<00:00:55.289> shots

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you use your skill shot then skill shots

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.080 
you use your skill shot then skill shots
are<00:00:55.649> much<00:00:56.010> easier<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.370> hit<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.699> targets

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
are much easier to hit on targets

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.360 
are much easier to hit on targets
running<00:00:57.329> away<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:57.719> well<00:00:58.289> as<00:00:58.350> trying<00:00:59.219> to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
running away as well as trying to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.150 
running away as well as trying to
outplay<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.210> concept<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.070> anticipating<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
outplay this concept of anticipating the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
outplay this concept of anticipating the
skill<00:01:02.399> shot<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.719> set<00:01:03.960> up

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
skill shot and so it's going to set up

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.200 
skill shot and so it's going to set up
your<00:01:04.110> abilities<00:01:04.530> quite<00:01:04.799> well<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:05.670> example<00:01:05.760> on

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
your abilities quite well for example on

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.700 
your abilities quite well for example on
someone<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.540> thresh<00:01:06.930> walking<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.590> them

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
someone like thresh walking up to them

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.310 
someone like thresh walking up to them
using<00:01:08.310> flay<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.030> after<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.810> they<00:01:10.020> try<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
using flay and then after as they try to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.190 
using flay and then after as they try to
run<00:01:10.560> away<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:11.430> use<00:01:11.640> your<00:01:11.820> hook<00:01:12.030> using<00:01:12.840> skill

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
run away you use your hook using skill

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.810 
run away you use your hook using skill
shots<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> lot<00:01:14.310> better<00:01:14.520> than

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
shots like this is a lot better than

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.700 
shots like this is a lot better than
just<00:01:14.850> doing<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.299> blind<00:01:15.570> or<00:01:16.020> as<00:01:16.140> an<00:01:16.259> initiation

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
just doing a blind or as an initiation

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.109 
just doing a blind or as an initiation
unless<00:01:17.189> you're<00:01:17.340> trying<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> poke<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.909> course

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
unless you're trying to poke of course

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.910 
unless you're trying to poke of course
because<00:01:18.750> people<00:01:19.080> will<00:01:19.170> actively<00:01:19.590> try<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
because people will actively try to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.890 
because people will actively try to
dodge<00:01:20.220> your<00:01:20.400> abilities<00:01:20.820> whereas<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.600> slow

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
dodge your abilities whereas if you slow

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.660 
dodge your abilities whereas if you slow
roll<00:01:22.049> them<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.770> set<00:01:22.950> up<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.159> situations

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
roll them you can set up for situations

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.399 
roll them you can set up for situations
where<00:01:23.820> they<00:01:23.939> cannot<00:01:24.299> dodge<00:01:24.570> or<00:01:25.140> at<00:01:25.229> least

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
where they cannot dodge or at least

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.320 
where they cannot dodge or at least
what's<00:01:25.619> much<00:01:25.799> more<00:01:25.830> difficult<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.880> when

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
what's much more difficult to and when

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.880 
what's much more difficult to and when
your<00:01:27.479> skill<00:01:27.689> shots<00:01:27.930> are<00:01:28.049> something<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.590> key

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
your skill shots are something so key

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.069 
your skill shots are something so key
like<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> threshold<00:01:32.210> presence<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.720> really

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
like a threshold presence it's really

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.660 
like a threshold presence it's really
something<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.500> need<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.770> use<00:01:35.100> slow

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
something that you need to use slow

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
something that you need to use slow
rolling<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.150> land<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:37.020> not<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
rolling to land and it's not that

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.630 
rolling to land and it's not that
complicated<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.009> I'm<00:01:38.100> not<00:01:38.189> going<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.460> that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
complicated so I'm not going to go that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.399 
complicated so I'm not going to go that
much<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.060> depth<00:01:39.270> into<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.229> really

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
much in depth into it but it's really

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.260 
much in depth into it but it's really
just<00:01:40.530> all<00:01:40.829> about<00:01:41.159> holding<00:01:41.490> your<00:01:41.850> abilities

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
just all about holding your abilities

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.700 
just all about holding your abilities
and<00:01:42.479> then<00:01:42.659> using<00:01:43.020> them<00:01:43.079> when<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.350> opponents

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and then using them when your opponents

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.249 
and then using them when your opponents
don't<00:01:43.920> expect<00:01:44.250> them<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.570> main<00:01:45.750> downside

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
don't expect them but the main downside

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
don't expect them but the main downside
of<00:01:46.380> slow<00:01:46.590> rolling<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.579> will<00:01:47.700> only

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
of slow rolling is that you will only

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.910 
of slow rolling is that you will only
likely<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.600> able<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.869> use<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.140> ability<00:01:49.560> once

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
likely be able to use that ability once

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.190 
likely be able to use that ability once
as<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.579> will<00:01:50.939> use<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.329> really<00:01:51.600> late<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
as you will use it really late in the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.260 
as you will use it really late in the
fight<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.100> likely<00:01:53.340> not<00:01:53.640> going<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.060> come

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
fight so it's likely not going to come

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.209 
fight so it's likely not going to come
back<00:01:54.299> off<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.869> cooldown<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.649> slow<00:01:55.979> rolling

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
back off of cooldown and so slow rolling

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.929 
back off of cooldown and so slow rolling
and<00:01:56.369> teamfights

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
and teamfights

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.240 
and teamfights
doesn't<00:01:57.509> really<00:01:57.840> work<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.710> great<00:01:59.040> for

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
doesn't really work but it's great for

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.280 
doesn't really work but it's great for
chasing<00:01:59.579> assisting<00:02:00.420> ganks<00:02:00.750> or<00:02:00.869> trying<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
chasing assisting ganks or trying to

chasing assisting ganks or trying to
