so<00:00:00.719> beryllium<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:02.280> fourth<00:00:02.700> element<00:00:03.210> of

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
so beryllium is the fourth element of

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.970 
so beryllium is the fourth element of
the<00:00:03.840> periodic<00:00:04.259> table<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:05.420> it<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.290> second

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
the periodic table and it is the second

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.299 
the periodic table and it is the second
lightest<00:00:08.700> metal<00:00:10.969> it<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.030> very<00:00:12.540> expensive<00:00:13.309> very

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
lightest metal it is very expensive very

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.900 
lightest metal it is very expensive very
toxic<00:00:15.920> very<00:00:16.920> strong<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.850> very<00:00:18.439> light<00:00:19.910> these

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
toxic very strong and very light these

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.710 
toxic very strong and very light these
four<00:00:21.180> factors<00:00:22.220> mean<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.699> its<00:00:23.880> primary<00:00:24.269> use

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
four factors mean that its primary use

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.570 
four factors mean that its primary use
is<00:00:25.340> in<00:00:26.340> where<00:00:27.050> toxicity<00:00:28.189> you<00:00:29.189> don't<00:00:29.369> care

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
is in where toxicity you don't care

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.330 
is in where toxicity you don't care
about<00:00:29.699> price<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:31.050> don't<00:00:31.199> care<00:00:31.439> about<00:00:31.590> you

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
about price you don't care about you

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.580 
about price you don't care about you
want<00:00:32.550> something<00:00:32.969> very<00:00:33.239> very<00:00:33.510> very<00:00:33.690> strong<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
want something very very very strong and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.220 
want something very very very strong and
very<00:00:34.649> very<00:00:35.250> very<00:00:35.730> light<00:00:37.910> one<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.030> these

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
very very very light one of these

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.740 
very very very light one of these
applications<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.469> missile<00:00:41.100> parts<00:00:41.750> so

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
applications is missile parts so

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.049 
applications is missile parts so
beryllium<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.920> used<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.340> make<00:00:44.460> many<00:00:44.700> missile

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
beryllium is used to make many missile

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.319 
beryllium is used to make many missile
parts<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.840> hard<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.559> steel<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.329> much

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
parts it is as hard as steel and much

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.240 
parts it is as hard as steel and much
lighter<00:00:48.660> than<00:00:48.840> aluminum<00:00:48.930> what<00:00:49.800> more<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.129> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
lighter than aluminum what more can you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.810 
lighter than aluminum what more can you
ask<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.989> it<00:00:51.989> also<00:00:52.140> happens<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.710> be

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
ask for it also happens to be

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.569 
ask for it also happens to be
transparent<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.879> x-rays<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:55.860> used<00:00:56.250> as

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
transparent to x-rays so it's used as

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.959 
transparent to x-rays so it's used as
windows<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.719> x-ray<00:00:58.050> tubes<00:00:58.289> which<00:00:58.730> need<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.850> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
windows for x-ray tubes which need it to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.990 
windows for x-ray tubes which need it to
be<00:01:00.059> strong<00:01:00.420> because<00:01:00.980> it<00:01:01.980> needs<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.699> hold<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
be strong because it needs to hold a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.179 
be strong because it needs to hold a
vacuum<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.409> also<00:01:04.530> seems<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.100> be

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
vacuum and it also seems to be

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
vacuum and it also seems to be
transparent<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:05.970> x-rays<00:01:06.030> which<00:01:06.689> beryllium

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
transparent to x-rays which beryllium

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.740 
transparent to x-rays which beryllium
happens<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.880> those<00:01:09.060> are<00:01:09.240> its<00:01:09.360> two<00:01:09.570> main

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
happens to be so those are its two main

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.109 
happens to be so those are its two main
applications<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.610> may<00:01:11.700> think<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:11.970> I'm

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
applications and you may think that I'm

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.609 
applications and you may think that I'm
just<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.420> talk<00:01:12.689> about<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.439> so

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
just going to talk about it and it's so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.679 
just going to talk about it and it's so
toxic<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.460> expensive<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.090> can't<00:01:15.390> that

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
toxic and so expensive that I can't that

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.380 
toxic and so expensive that I can't that
I<00:01:15.720> don't<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.140> any<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.400> did<00:01:17.850> manage<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
I don't have any but I did manage to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:28.609 
I don't have any but I did manage to
acquire<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.610> little<00:01:21.979> 1.8<00:01:22.979> gram<00:01:23.369> sample<00:01:27.530> here<00:01:28.530> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
acquire a little 1.8 gram sample here it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.510 
acquire a little 1.8 gram sample here it
is

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
is

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
is
I'm<00:01:31.520> gonna<00:01:31.610> bring<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:31.970> close<00:01:32.120> to<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.330> camera

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
I'm gonna bring it close to the camera

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.380 
I'm gonna bring it close to the camera
so<00:01:32.660> you<00:01:32.780> can<00:01:32.870> see<00:01:33.230> it<00:01:33.430> so<00:01:34.430> that's<00:01:34.670> pure

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
so you can see it so that's pure

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.630 
so you can see it so that's pure
beryllium<00:01:35.780> metal<00:01:36.320> right<00:01:36.500> there<00:01:36.560> very<00:01:37.340> toxic

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
beryllium metal right there very toxic

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.080 
beryllium metal right there very toxic
super<00:01:38.600> hard<00:01:38.840> pretty<00:01:39.440> expensive<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:40.900> it<00:01:41.900> is

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
super hard pretty expensive and it is

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.340 
super hard pretty expensive and it is
one<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.120> my<00:01:44.360> favorite<00:01:44.660> elements<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.990> another

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
one of my favorite elements so another

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.520 
one of my favorite elements so another
another<00:01:49.040> place<00:01:49.400> beryllium<00:01:49.940> is<00:01:50.210> found<00:01:50.540> that's

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
another place beryllium is found that's

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.740 
another place beryllium is found that's
not<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.010> exotic<00:01:52.370> as<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.910> windows<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.390> x-ray

again<00:02:37.850> they<00:02:38.120> get<00:02:38.330> more<00:02:38.480> reactive<00:02:38.959> as<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.200> go

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
again they get more reactive as you go

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.440 
again they get more reactive as you go
down<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:40.040> beryllium<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.790> least<00:02:41.000> reactive

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
down so beryllium is the least reactive

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.150 
down so beryllium is the least reactive
of<00:02:42.050> them<00:02:43.060> however<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.590> do<00:02:45.590> have<00:02:45.980> some

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
of them however I do have some

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.220 
of them however I do have some
hydrochloric<00:02:46.459> acid<00:02:47.120> which<00:02:47.360> will<00:02:47.600> react<00:02:47.989> with

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
hydrochloric acid which will react with

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.770 
hydrochloric acid which will react with
many<00:02:48.920> different<00:02:49.280> things<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:50.030> I'm<00:02:50.300> gonna<00:02:50.540> make

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
many different things and I'm gonna make

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.380 
many different things and I'm gonna make
few<00:02:51.350> milligrams<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:53.290> beryllium<00:02:54.290> chloride<00:02:55.390> so

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
few milligrams a beryllium chloride so

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.020 
few milligrams a beryllium chloride so
in<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:56.690> little<00:02:58.630> crucible<00:02:59.630> I've<00:02:59.930> got<00:03:00.320> to

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
in this little crucible I've got to

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.850 
in this little crucible I've got to
about<00:03:02.030> 40<00:03:02.720> milliliters<00:03:02.959> of<00:03:03.230> hydrochloric

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
about 40 milliliters of hydrochloric

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.600 
about 40 milliliters of hydrochloric
acid<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.780> I'm<00:03:05.780> gonna<00:03:05.959> put<00:03:06.320> this<00:03:06.860> in<00:03:07.190> here<00:03:07.370> for

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
acid and I'm gonna put this in here for

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.759 
acid and I'm gonna put this in here for
just<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:08.000> few<00:03:08.150> seconds<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.810> just<00:03:09.380> want<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.560> little

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
just a few seconds I just want a little

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.070 
just a few seconds I just want a little
bit<00:03:09.920> of<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.430> react<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:11.060> still<00:03:11.720> want<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:11.959> have

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
bit of it to react I still want to have

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.199 
bit of it to react I still want to have
it<00:03:12.200> for<00:03:12.350> my<00:03:12.440> element<00:03:12.860> collection<00:03:13.630> here<00:03:14.630> we<00:03:14.750> go

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:25.610 

it's<00:03:18.689> reacting

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.730 

okay

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
okay

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:36.370 
okay
so<00:03:28.780> now<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.810> can<00:03:30.170> say<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:32.060> in<00:03:32.240> here<00:03:34.270> are<00:03:35.270> a<00:03:36.230> few

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
so now I can say that in here are a few

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.560 
so now I can say that in here are a few
milligrams<00:03:37.390> of<00:03:38.390> beryllium<00:03:39.020> chloride<00:03:40.390> as<00:03:41.390> I

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
milligrams of beryllium chloride as I

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.930 
milligrams of beryllium chloride as I
said<00:03:41.780> before<00:03:41.930> beryllium<00:03:42.560> is<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.610> second

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
said before beryllium is the second

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.600 
said before beryllium is the second
lightest<00:03:44.180> metal<00:03:44.540> but<00:03:45.230> it's<00:03:45.380> still<00:03:45.620> more<00:03:46.460> than

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
lightest metal but it's still more than

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.390 
lightest metal but it's still more than
one<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:46.910> a<00:03:46.940> half<00:03:47.120> times<00:03:47.510> as<00:03:47.930> heavy<00:03:48.230> as<00:03:49.070> lithium

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
one and a half times as heavy as lithium

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.080 
one and a half times as heavy as lithium
so<00:03:50.330> it<00:03:50.480> doesn't<00:03:50.840> float<00:03:51.050> in<00:03:51.170> water<00:03:51.760> but<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:52.850> does

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
so it doesn't float in water but it does

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.990 
so it doesn't float in water but it does
react<00:03:53.480> super<00:03:54.230> super<00:03:54.650> super<00:03:55.100> slowly<00:03:55.460> with

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
react super super super slowly with

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.570 
react super super super slowly with
water<00:03:56.500> very<00:03:57.500> very<00:03:57.800> slowly<00:03:58.100> you<00:03:58.340> can't

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
water very very slowly you can't

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.180 
water very very slowly you can't
probably<00:03:58.910> you<00:03:59.300> can't<00:03:59.540> see<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.020> at<00:04:00.140> all<00:04:00.260> in<00:04:00.920> real

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
probably you can't see it at all in real

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.790 
probably you can't see it at all in real
terms<00:04:01.660> with<00:04:02.660> water<00:04:03.820> to<00:04:04.820> make<00:04:05.030> beryllium

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
terms with water to make beryllium

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.230 
terms with water to make beryllium
hydroxide<00:04:06.800> and<00:04:07.040> hydrogen<00:04:07.340> gas<00:04:09.730> magnesium<00:04:10.730> the

element<00:04:11.630> right<00:04:11.810> below<00:04:12.140> beryllium<00:04:12.730> does<00:04:13.730> this

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
element right below beryllium does this

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.750 
element right below beryllium does this
to<00:04:14.270> only<00:04:15.050> slightly<00:04:15.560> faster<00:04:16.040> because<00:04:16.550> it's

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
to only slightly faster because it's

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
to only slightly faster because it's
slightly<00:04:17.030> more<00:04:17.239> reactive<00:04:19.540> that's<00:04:20.540> all<00:04:20.690> I've

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
slightly more reactive that's all I've

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.260 
slightly more reactive that's all I've
got<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.960> say<00:04:21.080> about<00:04:21.410> Brillion<00:04:21.910> see<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:23.000> pour

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
got to say about Brillion see you pour

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.420 
got to say about Brillion see you pour
