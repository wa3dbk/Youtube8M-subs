00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
to turn to when I had a breakdown so I

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.440 
to turn to when I had a breakdown so I
thought<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.799> will<00:01:17.280> purchase<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.850> whole<00:01:18.150> kind

thought I will purchase the whole kind

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.270 
thought I will purchase the whole kind
of<00:01:18.570> set<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.229> products<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.130> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
of set of products to go with that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.830 
of set of products to go with that
because<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.700> know<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.119> great<00:01:21.360> results<00:01:21.780> with

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
because I know if I great results with

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.020 
because I know if I great results with
it<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.290> reason<00:01:23.159> why<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.310> alone<00:01:23.790> wasn't

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
it and the reason why this alone wasn't

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.580 
it and the reason why this alone wasn't
enough<00:01:24.150> was<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.930> wasn't<00:01:25.080> having<00:01:25.259> just

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
enough was because I wasn't having just

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.710 
enough was because I wasn't having just
a<00:01:25.680> thought<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.460> was<00:01:26.610> kind<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.850> everywhere<00:01:27.450> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
old little spot on my chin area but i

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.270 
old little spot on my chin area but i
think<00:02:29.900> that's<00:02:30.230> hormonal<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:30.920> nothing<00:02:31.250> that

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
think that's hormonal and nothing that

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.010 
think that's hormonal and nothing that
you<00:02:31.459> put<00:02:31.730> on<00:02:31.760> top<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.180> your<00:02:32.300> skin<00:02:32.570> can<00:02:32.780> really

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
you put on top of your skin can really

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.449 
you put on top of your skin can really
make<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.200> difference<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.740> that<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:33.980> think<00:02:34.070> it's

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
make a difference to that I think it's

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.270 
make a difference to that I think it's
more<00:02:34.550> just<00:02:34.700> ative<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:36.380> environment<00:02:37.100> and

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
more just ative the environment and

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.100 
more just ative the environment and
stress<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.030> hormones<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.810> kind<00:02:39.050> of

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
stress and hormones and that kind of

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.320 
stress and hormones and that kind of
thing<00:02:39.489> so<00:02:40.489> um<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.800> thought<00:02:42.800> that<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.970> mean<00:02:44.270> you

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
thing so um I thought that I mean you

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.910 
thing so um I thought that I mean you
did<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.540> toner<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.290> was<00:02:45.380> using<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.709> very

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.710 
did a toner and I was using a very
gentle<00:02:46.280> rosewater<00:02:46.760> Turner<00:02:47.150> but<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:47.450> thought

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
gentle rosewater Turner but I thought

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.880 
gentle rosewater Turner but I thought
I'd<00:02:47.810> better<00:02:47.959> switch<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.380> something<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.770> little

don't<00:04:35.340> what<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.090> moisturize<00:04:36.390> but<00:04:36.750> I<00:04:36.780> just<00:04:36.990> put

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
using the spot control moisturizer which

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.380 
using the spot control moisturizer which
is<00:04:42.690> nice<00:04:42.960> but<00:04:43.350> I<00:04:43.410> think<00:04:43.760> that's<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.910> whole<00:04:45.150> kit

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.390 
is nice but I think that's the whole kit
this<00:04:45.540> is<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.870> country's<00:04:46.380> my<00:04:46.830> least<00:04:47.010> favorite

this is the country's my least favorite
products<00:04:47.760> it's<00:04:48.270> just<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.870> kind<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.140> noise

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
products it's just a kind of noise

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.040 
products it's just a kind of noise
moisturizer<00:04:50.100> it<00:04:50.640> does<00:04:51.030> help<00:04:51.240> kind<00:04:51.630> of<00:04:51.720> spots

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
moisturizer it does help kind of spots

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.720 
moisturizer it does help kind of spots
it<00:04:52.230> doesn't<00:04:52.440> leave<00:04:52.590> you<00:04:52.710> oily<00:04:53.190> but<00:04:53.400> it's<00:04:53.520> just

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
it doesn't leave you oily but it's just

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.080 
it doesn't leave you oily but it's just
not<00:04:53.760> my<00:04:54.000> favorite<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:55.130> then<00:04:56.130> at<00:04:56.430> night<00:04:56.670> again

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
not my favorite and then at night again

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.140 
not my favorite and then at night again
I've<00:04:57.330> been<00:04:57.690> using<00:04:58.230> the<00:04:58.770> spot<00:04:59.340> treatment<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.090> I

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
I've been using the spot treatment and I

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.240 
I've been using the spot treatment and I
think<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.480> best<00:05:00.660> tip<00:05:00.990> for<00:05:01.020> this<00:05:01.350> is<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:01.950> use<00:05:02.100> it

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
think the best tip for this is to use it

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.930 
think the best tip for this is to use it
with<00:05:02.370> a<00:05:02.400> q-tip<00:05:02.700> to<00:05:03.060> just<00:05:03.690> kind<00:05:03.900> of<00:05:03.930> open<00:05:04.350> it<00:05:04.410> up

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
with a q-tip to just kind of open it up

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.160 
with a q-tip to just kind of open it up
then<00:05:05.940> it's<00:05:06.150> got<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.330> little<00:05:06.450> nozzle<00:05:06.810> and

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
then it's got a little nozzle and

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.380 
then it's got a little nozzle and
squeeze<00:05:08.070> a<00:05:08.100> little<00:05:08.280> bit<00:05:08.490> out<00:05:08.610> and<00:05:08.880> be<00:05:09.150> careful

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
squeeze a little bit out and be careful

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.820 
squeeze a little bit out and be careful
because<00:05:09.630> a<00:05:09.720> lot<00:05:09.930> comes<00:05:10.140> out<00:05:10.290> when<00:05:10.440> you<00:05:10.530> get<00:05:10.650> to

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
because a lot comes out when you get to

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.640 
because a lot comes out when you get to
do<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.070> tap<00:05:11.550> them<00:05:11.940> on<00:05:11.970> to<00:05:12.510> q-tip<00:05:13.050> and<00:05:13.500> just

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
do it tap them on to q-tip and just

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.440 
do it tap them on to q-tip and just
apply<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:14.010> kind<00:05:14.340> of<00:05:14.430> where<00:05:14.970> you<00:05:15.210> need<00:05:15.420> it

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
apply it kind of where you need it

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.030 
apply it kind of where you need it
because<00:05:15.840> you<00:05:16.170> don't<00:05:16.320> want<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.560> kind<00:05:16.740> of<00:05:16.770> put<00:05:16.950> it

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
because you don't want to kind of put it

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.290 
because you don't want to kind of put it
everywhere<00:05:17.160> because<00:05:17.460> it<00:05:17.640> is<00:05:17.730> quite<00:05:17.970> strong

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
everywhere because it is quite strong

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.390 
everywhere because it is quite strong
