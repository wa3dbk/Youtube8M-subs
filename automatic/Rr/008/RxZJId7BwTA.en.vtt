00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:03.869
 Hello 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.980
 Hi guys, how are you since ms and 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.530
 we get one of the most graphic 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.939
 powerful and advanced market the 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.779
 simply brutal ms geforce gtx 780 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.240
 lines inc 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.130
 combining the power of the gpu gk 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.919
 making 10 of nvidia and the system 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.259
 cooling trip forster offers us 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.810
 an ability to overclocking 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:38.560
 exceptional keeping the sonority to 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.620
 stripe and with a sensational design watching 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.810
 a little above your specifications 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.500
 just say they are brutal 3 gb of 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.930
 gddr5 memory a memory speed 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.660
 of 6 thousand 8 megahertz and a bus of 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.240
 384-bit memory 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.250
 clear that with so much power in stool 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.440
 we need good nutrition because 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.500
 You will need two connections 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.839
 8 pin feed that more stuff 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.970
 we must take into account based on the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.070
 aspect of this graphic card we are going 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.380
 by parts first we have to say that 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.950
 it's very big when I say very big is 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.020
 which is very large has a length of 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.520
 29 centimeters 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.280
 of 13 centimeters and a thickness of 5 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.399
 centimeters something that is very exaggerated 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.000
 Of course it has a tree for 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:34.360
 be that it only occupies 2 slots and that's why 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.759
 will accommodate three fans one of 9 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.280
 centimeters and another 8 centimeters and 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.130
 another 9 centimeters and the truth is that 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 thanks to this ventilation the dissipation 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.920
 The heat is very good and we have some 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.810
 very low temperatures the maximum 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.720
 temperature that we could obtain with 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.170
 this graph is 67 degrees and the minimum 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.750
 of 31 degrees is to say that those 3 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.020
 2 9 cm fans and one of 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.539
 8 and its whitford heatsink to be makes 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.479
 really the temperature keep it 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.759
 at bay with a brutal power but 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.709
 going a little bit more to the point this for 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.569
 what is so much power that serves 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.519
 well could we use to edit 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.890
 videos much faster and so on 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.470
 but people commonly use it to 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.140
 play and this is what it serves to 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.420
 play 500 euros worth the graphics card 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.870
 the games moves with great ease 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.640
 so here we have done some tests 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.430
 first let's see the crisis 3 after 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.430
 of butterfield 4 and my favorite girl 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.520
 lara croft in tomb raider first let's go 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.390
 to see the performance of this ms geforce 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.480
 gtx 780 lightning in the game of bat 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.860
 efe the 4 as always everything in ultra in 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.350
 hd in 1920 x 1080p 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.530
 as you always know the most 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:02.030
 high is the best thing to say more fps in 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.459
 screen better more fluency in the game and 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.420
 how can we see the graphics card that 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.209
 we are analyzing is the queen with 92 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.860
 fps and going to another game tomo ryder 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.560
 we have also tried this game with the 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.950
 graphic card and as we can see is 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:23.090
 in third position with 75 fps and a 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.430
 little above that of 9 290 x which is 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.090
 quite cheaper than the one we 're 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.290
 analyzing and we get about 33 frames per 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.590
 second 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.099
 that the last analyzed version 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.200
 we have tried crisis 3 all at the top this 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.959
 it really is the game that sucks the most 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.870
 less optimized is and yet 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:48.109
 maximum we have what we have thrown with 33 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.060
 fps is something just the truth about everything 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:53.390
 for the price that has a graphics card 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.349
 but good we move it with ease and it 's 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.700
 with a wonderful game experience 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:02.480
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:07.280
 this unboxing and are the view more or less 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.319
 of the graphic card ms 47 x 1080 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.780
 and nothing you already know that you can subscribe 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.819
 give the like and comment anything 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.090
 down here we are in the next 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.090
 video
