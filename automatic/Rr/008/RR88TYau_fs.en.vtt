00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
things you know because I didn't want to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.839 
things you know because I didn't want to
be<00:00:27.840> negative<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:29.279> getting<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
be negative but it's getting to the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.370 
be negative but it's getting to the
point<00:00:30.060> where<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.630> got<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.869> start<00:00:31.170> telling

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
point where I got to start telling

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.630 
point where I got to start telling
people<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.830> negative<00:00:32.219> side<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.489> things

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
people the negative side of things

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.299 
people the negative side of things
because<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:34.230> might<00:00:34.410> save<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> few<00:00:34.860> people<00:00:35.190> from

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
because it might save a few people from

because it might save a few people from
moving<00:00:35.610> out<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:37.340> don't<00:00:38.340> know<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.670> would

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
moving out here I don't know if it would

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
in mind that probably wouldn't have

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.119 
in mind that probably wouldn't have
