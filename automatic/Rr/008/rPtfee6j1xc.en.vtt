won't stay in my ears either I'm
beginning<00:01:49.539> to<00:01:49.569> think<00:01:49.720> that<00:01:50.020> there<00:01:50.259> might<00:01:50.380> be

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
beginning to think that there might be

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.109 
beginning to think that there might be
something<00:01:50.740> wrong<00:01:50.950> with<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.490> shape<00:01:51.729> of<00:01:51.940> my

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
something wrong with the shape of my

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.859 
something wrong with the shape of my
ears<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:54.220> don't<00:01:54.490> like<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.940> term<00:01:55.119> earbuds

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
ears and I don't like the term earbuds

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.660 
ears and I don't like the term earbuds
and<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.319> know<00:01:56.379> that<00:01:56.590> that's<00:01:56.739> probably<00:01:57.069> the

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
and I know that that's probably the

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.580 
and I know that that's probably the
correct<00:01:58.060> terminology<00:01:58.330> for<00:01:58.989> but<00:01:59.229> I<00:01:59.289> don't<00:01:59.440> like

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
correct terminology for but I don't like

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.260 
correct terminology for but I don't like
it<00:01:59.709> because<00:01:59.830> it<00:02:00.250> sounds<00:02:00.700> like<00:02:00.819> something<00:02:01.179> is

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
it because it sounds like something is
