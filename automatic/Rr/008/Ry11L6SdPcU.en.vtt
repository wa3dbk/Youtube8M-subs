00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
map i decided to use is doughnut with

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.940 
map i decided to use is doughnut with
standard<00:02:29.880> center<00:02:30.330> region<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.410> also<00:02:31.590> use

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
standard center region you can also use

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.240 
standard center region you can also use
mountains<00:02:32.310> ocean<00:02:33.060> desert<00:02:33.680> random<00:02:34.680> or<00:02:34.950> heels

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
mountains ocean desert random or heels

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.400 
mountains ocean desert random or heels
but<00:02:35.519> i<00:02:35.580> decided<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.180> use<00:02:36.209> standard<00:02:36.810> this

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
but i decided to use standard this

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.130 
but i decided to use standard this
should<00:02:37.650> lead<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:39.000> very<00:02:39.090> well-balanced<00:02:39.930> map

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
should lead to a very well-balanced map

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.699 
should lead to a very well-balanced map
but<00:02:40.739> obviously<00:02:41.160> all<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.549> train<00:02:41.849> is<00:02:42.060> random<00:02:42.709> so

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
but obviously all the train is random so

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.800 
but obviously all the train is random so
let's<00:02:44.160> get<00:02:44.280> started<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.879> see<00:02:45.150> what<00:02:45.360> leader<00:02:45.599> we

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
let's get started and see what leader we

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.960 
let's get started and see what leader we
get<00:02:48.739> all<00:02:49.739> right<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.190> looks<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.640> we<00:02:50.819> got

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
get all right it looks like we got

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.970 
get all right it looks like we got
nepali<00:02:51.390> on<00:02:51.540> again<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.079> previous<00:02:52.440> paul<00:02:52.680> also

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
nepali on again the previous paul also

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.520 
nepali on again the previous paul also
had<00:02:53.160> france<00:02:53.640> as<00:02:53.970> one<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.390> options<00:02:54.540> so

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
had france as one of the options so

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.319 
had france as one of the options so
their<00:02:55.769> unique<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.190> need<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.760> musketeer

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
their unique you need is the musketeer

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.319 
their unique you need is the musketeer
which<00:02:57.599> replaces<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:59.220> mask<00:02:59.430> admin<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.090> has

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
which replaces the mask admin and has

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.350 
which replaces the mask admin and has
higher<00:03:00.900> come<00:03:01.230> back<00:03:01.410> straight<00:03:01.730> 28<00:03:02.730> instead<00:03:03.269> of

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
higher come back straight 28 instead of

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.110 
higher come back straight 28 instead of
24<00:03:03.840> i<00:03:03.900> believe<00:03:04.290> they<00:03:04.890> also<00:03:05.069> get<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.579> unique<00:03:05.849> tile

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.690 
24 i believe they also get a unique tile
improvement<00:03:06.720> which<00:03:07.079> can<00:03:07.319> be<00:03:07.440> built<00:03:07.680> next<00:03:08.519> to

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
improvement which can be built next to

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.479 
improvement which can be built next to
luxuries<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:10.290> basically<00:03:10.739> gives<00:03:11.099> you<00:03:11.250> some
