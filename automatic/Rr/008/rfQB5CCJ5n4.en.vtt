you see how different it looks to the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.700 
you see how different it looks to the
weight<00:00:14.549> looked<00:00:14.849> even<00:00:15.420> just<00:00:15.690> six<00:00:16.289> seven<00:00:16.590> months

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
very very greasy because I had

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.529 
very very greasy because I had
moisturized<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.699> before<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:23.970> went<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> gym

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:50.990 

where<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:42.059> hairs<00:00:42.270> got<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:45.860> okay<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:49.579> on<00:00:50.579> it

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
where the hairs got to okay so on it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.110 
where the hairs got to okay so on it
goes<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.409> said<00:00:58.879> because<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.000> just

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
goes and as I said because it's just

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.509 
goes and as I said because it's just
been<00:01:00.269> moisturize<00:01:00.809> its<00:01:01.079> hanging<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:02.159> it<00:01:02.309> hasn't

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
been moisturize its hanging if it hasn't

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.410 
been moisturize its hanging if it hasn't
just<00:01:02.850> been<00:01:02.909> voiced<00:01:03.180> arises<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.750> more<00:01:03.960> puffy

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
just been voiced arises it be more puffy

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
it's quite it's quite as wet the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.410 
it's quite it's quite as wet the
equivalent<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.960> wet<00:01:25.640> right<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.820> these<00:01:26.970> ends

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
equivalent of wet right so these ends

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.840 
equivalent of wet right so these ends
are<00:01:28.009> just<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> ends<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.610> my<00:01:30.649> perm<00:01:31.649> as<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.759> can

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
are just the ends of my perm as you can

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.440 
are just the ends of my perm as you can
see<00:01:32.970> without<00:01:33.420> doubt<00:01:34.130> majority<00:01:36.020> majority

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
see without doubt majority majority

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.870 
see without doubt majority majority
natural<00:01:39.679> and<00:01:42.380> just<00:01:43.380> okay<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.190> I<00:01:44.399> was<00:01:44.640> to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
natural and just okay so if I was to

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.290 
natural and just okay so if I was to
take<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.119> bit<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.420> hair<00:01:45.979> say<00:01:46.979> up<00:01:47.130> here<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.610> then

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
take a bit of hair say up here and then

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.729 
take a bit of hair say up here and then
you<00:01:48.330> can<00:01:48.569> see<00:01:48.720> how<00:01:48.810> much<00:01:48.959> perm<00:01:49.229> that's<00:01:49.470> left<00:01:49.619> on

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:49.739 
you can see how much perm that's left on

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:52.400 
you can see how much perm that's left on
this<00:01:49.860> particular<00:01:50.190> bit<00:01:50.840> this<00:01:51.840> particular<00:01:52.110> bits

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
this particular bit this particular bits

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.479 
this particular bit this particular bits
look<00:01:52.560> quite<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:52.830> lot<00:01:53.069> so<00:01:53.489> perm<00:01:54.030> comes<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.660> there

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:55.489 
look quite a lot so perm comes to there

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:59.419 
look quite a lot so perm comes to there
is<00:01:56.489> there<00:01:56.789> all<00:01:57.209> this<00:01:57.390> bit<00:01:57.569> up<00:01:57.660> here<00:01:58.280> it<00:01:59.280> is

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
is there all this bit up here it is

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:05.389 
is there all this bit up here it is
natural<00:02:00.050> fiber<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.229> measure<00:02:01.410> it<00:02:02.869> on<00:02:04.399> this

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
natural fiber to measure it on this

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.190 
natural fiber to measure it on this
chain<00:02:05.700> which<00:02:05.910> I<00:02:06.000> put<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.209> specifically<00:02:06.989> for

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
chain which I put on specifically for

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.490 
chain which I put on specifically for
measuring<00:02:07.500> purposes<00:02:08.629> it<00:02:09.629> comes<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.110> about

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
measuring purposes it comes to about

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.500 
measuring purposes it comes to about
here<00:02:12.800> so<00:02:13.800> next<00:02:14.129> time<00:02:14.340> I'm<00:02:14.489> measuring<00:02:14.730> I've<00:02:15.360> got

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
here so next time I'm measuring I've got

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.580 
here so next time I'm measuring I've got
something<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.780> measure<00:02:15.959> against<00:02:16.319> roughly<00:02:16.890> and

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
something to measure against roughly and

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.080 
something to measure against roughly and
if<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.770> was<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.010> try<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.250> take<00:02:20.610> some<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
if I was to try and take some of the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.479 
if I was to try and take some of the
inner<00:02:21.500> he<00:02:22.500> says<00:02:23.360> some<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.450> them<00:02:24.540> have<00:02:24.660> got

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
inner he says some of them have got

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:33.949 
inner he says some of them have got
permed<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.730> some<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.209> them<00:02:27.739> haven't<00:02:29.959> so<00:02:32.959> let's

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
permed in some of them haven't so let's

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.970 
permed in some of them haven't so let's
find<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.410> piece<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.840> right<00:02:37.170> at<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.319> bottom

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.610 

how<00:02:40.980> much<00:02:41.129> per<00:02:41.430> missus<00:02:41.760> got<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.239> from<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.440> can

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
how much per missus got on it from I can

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.120 
how much per missus got on it from I can
see<00:02:45.379> absolutely<00:02:46.379> nothing<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.630> measure

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
see absolutely nothing so to measure

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.030 
see absolutely nothing so to measure
against<00:02:50.130> my<00:02:50.310> chain

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.819 

straightened<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.950> hair<00:02:56.129> would<00:02:56.340> come<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.849> here

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
straightened the hair would come to here

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.869 
straightened the hair would come to here
that's<00:02:58.829> pretty<00:02:59.069> good<00:02:59.220> length<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.670> in<00:03:00.510> fact

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
that's pretty good length and in fact

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.229 
that's pretty good length and in fact
that<00:03:02.879> is<00:03:03.150> probably<00:03:03.980> where<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.010> was<00:03:05.400> when<00:03:06.209> my

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
that is probably where I was when my

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.800 
that is probably where I was when my
hair<00:03:06.510> was<00:03:06.540> fully<00:03:06.900> firmed<00:03:07.829> so<00:03:08.610> in<00:03:08.970> sense<00:03:09.450> maybe

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
hair was fully firmed so in sense maybe

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.319 
hair was fully firmed so in sense maybe
I<00:03:10.170> think<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.159> seems<00:03:11.370> as<00:03:11.489> though<00:03:11.610> I've<00:03:11.730> reached

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
I think it seems as though I've reached

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.750 
I think it seems as though I've reached
my<00:03:12.540> target<00:03:12.599> length<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.680> as<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.890> can<00:03:13.980> see<00:03:14.040> that

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
my target length so as you can see that

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
my target length so as you can see that
much<00:03:14.909> perm<00:03:15.209> left

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
much perm left

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.569 
much perm left
I'd<00:03:16.110> like<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.440> curly<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.860> get<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.129> this<00:03:17.220> length

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
I'd like the curly to get to this length

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.059

that could be about a year's growth I'm
assuming<00:03:23.069> by<00:03:23.220> next<00:03:23.670> summer<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.780> would<00:03:25.200> have

assuming by next summer I would have
wrists<00:03:25.769> small<00:03:26.040> rather<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.489> time<00:03:26.700> next<00:03:26.819> year
