00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:15.589
 Hello everyone 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.739
 last year the members of the phone hamas and the few weeks 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.389
 to warn me that I am totally successful met by the harmonicas 

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.140
 signature cbc charrier 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.369
 he had received 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.539
 then to the calls of people who wanted 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.539
 a harmonica with my signature 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.350
 so I still remember that sÃ©bastien 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.730
 will he get fucked 1% that you can play 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.470
 with a chromatic game about a man who is unique 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.110
 and that's the time they spend 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.860
 I salute his patience 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.560
 what job i'm worried about done work 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.100
 paris - less we have 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.030
 she thought and what I could bring the seller a simple 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.880
 signature on a disability 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.830
 and for me it's obvious they do not fit any more points 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.870
 what I like what I appreciate 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.040
 and even the year she does not leave far 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.080
 so I have the pleasure to introduce you 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.080
 today father michael broadhurst signature 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.160
 while they are the features 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.430
 of this instrument 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.430
 Well, it's an instrument as could be seen in the lines 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.860
 ennahda does mozambique entirely 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.960
 they liked us she is well known luthiers 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 under the name of Monday 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.510
 at the birth ccct which is used for wind instruments one 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.850
 retain 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.649
 such a unit constituted 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.560
 exceptional m 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.620
 especially this density 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.180
 it is used for example for seniors 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.180
 high-end clarinet also saves money 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.110
 very stable 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.670
 bubbly 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.630
 so very high resistance humidity 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.280
 and so inevitably how mi6 saline resistances 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.490
 so save their players we want the best that I forgive 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.829
 morin 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.699
 moreover dominant month 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.189
 the appointment of m 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:13.329
 instruments 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.369
 during very very elegant 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.339
 we could have years 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.599
 indeed they did not really use his school 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.089
 the maximum of luxury 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:27.649
 but he applied images that we saw and I last summer when we 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:29.789
 came back 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:33.119
 paris the girl and that fits what I like 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:36.779
 on the techniques otherwise an almighty game traditional danger and 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:40.019
 to his ends in the east when I commit tic 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.439
 and the verdict 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.999
 who makes their reputation 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.599
 but in units sold 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.759
 it ensures always allows 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.769
 this healthy living comparable 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.389
 their exceptional instrument 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.249
 exceptional decision 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.039
 it's a handicap will only 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:58.069
 with Eric 100 copies 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.929
 numbered 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.339
 when they are now available and now 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:05.739
 the time that the authorities of course 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:06.759
 m yes 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:10.149
 within three weeks which is relatively 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:12.929
 concerning a manufactured instrument 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.929
 they left I really did not have for the moment at least 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.569
 then interested demented naturally stands to the provisions 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.569
 Thursday night the week on the video 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:29.429
 in the traditional 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.479
 Why 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.499
 to contribution 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:44.879
 very calm 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.919
 and that is wooden 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.919
 dramatic 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.249
 a very fine meeting setting 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:08.969
 which corresponds to what I like 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.609
 we will find the penumbra 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:11.919
 and the harmonicas 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.919
