00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
when you're trying to be a you know

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.880 
when you're trying to be a you know
video<00:00:44.850> game<00:00:45.210> host<00:00:45.540> and<00:00:45.900> a<00:00:46.140> machinima<00:00:46.500> director

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
video game host and a machinima director

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.440 
video game host and a machinima director
to<00:00:47.070> actually<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.670> able<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> report<00:00:48.060> gameplay

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
to actually be able to report gameplay

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.950 
to actually be able to report gameplay
so<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.550> then<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:51.060> do<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.330> I<00:00:51.390> figured<00:00:51.840> I'd

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
so so then I can do that I figured I'd

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.980 
so so then I can do that I figured I'd
kick<00:00:52.440> things<00:00:52.620> off<00:00:52.860> with<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.130> little<00:00:53.250> montage

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
kick things off with a little montage

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.510 
kick things off with a little montage
and<00:00:54.990> continue<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.560> sniper<00:00:55.830> worse<00:00:56.070> series

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
and continue the sniper worse series

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.750 
and continue the sniper worse series
this<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.540> a<00:00:57.570> really<00:00:58.170> good<00:00:58.320> series<00:00:58.650> I<00:00:58.740> think<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
this is a really good series I think and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.810 
this is a really good series I think and
I'd<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.570> continue<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.110> on<00:01:01.730> into<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
I'd like to continue it on into the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.150 
I'd like to continue it on into the
future<00:01:02.970> especially<00:01:03.900> with<00:01:04.290> all<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:04.470> awesome

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
future especially with all the awesome

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.220 
future especially with all the awesome
games<00:01:05.370> coming<00:01:05.640> out<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.940> holiday<00:01:06.330> season<00:01:06.360> I

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
games coming out this holiday season I

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.170 
games coming out this holiday season I
know<00:01:07.620> that<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:08.010> would<00:01:08.190> probably<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.880> some

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
know that this would probably be to some

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.210 
know that this would probably be to some
rockin<00:01:09.540> beats<00:01:09.750> or<00:01:10.170> something<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:11.100> because

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
rockin beats or something just because

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.840 
rockin beats or something just because
montages<00:01:12.000> are<00:01:12.150> always<00:01:12.960> better<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.290> music<00:01:13.850> but

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
montages are always better to music but

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.240 
montages are always better to music but
unfortunately<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.500> didn't<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.770> time<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
unfortunately I just didn't have time to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
unfortunately I just didn't have time to
edit<00:01:17.730> that<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.210> music<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.690> get<00:01:19.050> to<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
edit that to music I get to be a

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.530 
edit that to music I get to be a
perfectionist<00:01:19.920> when<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.490> when<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.300> start

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
perfectionist when I when I start

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.760 
perfectionist when I when I start
throwing<00:01:21.810> music<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.290> there<00:01:22.440> and<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> try<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
throwing music in there and I try to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.230 
throwing music in there and I try to
time<00:01:23.040> everything<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.730> just<00:01:23.970> takes<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
time everything and that just takes a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.690 
time everything and that just takes a
while<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.690> I'd<00:01:25.320> rather<00:01:25.470> do<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.710> right<00:01:25.980> and<00:01:26.190> I'll

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
while so I'd rather do it right and I'll

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.010 
while so I'd rather do it right and I'll
probably<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.150> for<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.390> episode<00:01:27.659> three

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
probably do that for like episode three

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.510 
probably do that for like episode three
or<00:01:28.140> four<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.010> just<00:01:29.220> wanted<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> get

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
or four but I just wanted to get

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.950 
or four but I just wanted to get
something<00:01:29.760> up<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.300> check<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.659> with<00:01:30.690> you<00:01:30.900> guys

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
something up and check in with you guys

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.570 
something up and check in with you guys
so<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.820> anyway<00:01:32.820> back<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> back<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.170> montage

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
so so anyway back to back to the montage

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.250 
so so anyway back to back to the montage
you'll<00:01:35.580> notice<00:01:35.790> here<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.479> times<00:01:36.840> as<00:01:37.050> well<00:01:37.080> I

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
you'll notice here at times as well I

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.740 
you'll notice here at times as well I
also<00:01:37.590> throw<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:37.979> kind<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.790> longer<00:01:39.060> segments<00:01:39.690> of

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
also throw in kind of longer segments of

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.210 
also throw in kind of longer segments of
gameplay<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.470> not<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.010> quick

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
gameplay and not just like quick

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.940 
gameplay and not just like quick
montages<00:01:42.229> just<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.590> feel<00:01:43.920> like

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
montages just because I feel like

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.920 
montages just because I feel like
montages<00:01:44.610> are<00:01:44.729> kind<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.030> cheap<00:01:45.240> way<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.720> be

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
montages are kind of a cheap way to be

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.530 
montages are kind of a cheap way to be
like<00:01:46.110> hey<00:01:46.350> look<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.860> good<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.370> am<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:47.549> sniping<00:01:47.940> in
