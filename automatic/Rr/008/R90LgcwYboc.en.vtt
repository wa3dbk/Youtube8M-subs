00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
so right now we're going to go test it

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.390 
so right now we're going to go test it
out<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> shooting<00:01:07.380> range<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.130> how<00:01:08.220> it

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
I just mounted that rail and how I did

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.580 
I just mounted that rail and how I did
it<00:02:17.099> was<00:02:17.970> there<00:02:18.360> was<00:02:18.599> this<00:02:18.840> little<00:02:19.200> notch<00:02:19.560> there

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
and the notch is just perfect enough to

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.910 
and the notch is just perfect enough to
get<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.849> real<00:02:24.120> squeeze<00:02:24.569> down<00:02:24.780> there<00:02:25.049> that

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
little glue and that thing will not come

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.619 
little glue and that thing will not come
off<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.470> can<00:02:28.620> mount<00:02:28.910> red<00:02:29.910> dot<00:02:30.120> sight<00:02:30.450> or

as<00:04:00.630> a<00:04:01.050> right<00:04:01.500> now<00:04:01.710> I<00:04:01.740> don't<00:04:01.950> know<00:04:02.310> where<00:04:02.490> the

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
as a right now I don't know where the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.480 
as a right now I don't know where the
camera<00:04:02.760> stand<00:04:03.240> is<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:03.870> I'm<00:04:04.440> just<00:04:04.530> using<00:04:05.190> a

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
camera stand is so I'm just using a

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.930 
camera stand is so I'm just using a
table<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.120> hold<00:04:06.270> up<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.630> camera<00:04:07.080> so<00:04:07.340> Alice<00:04:08.340> now

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
table to hold up the camera so Alice now

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.920 
table to hold up the camera so Alice now
we'll<00:04:09.150> see<00:04:09.330> how<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.930> new<00:04:10.110> Duralast<00:04:10.590> batteries

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
we'll see how the new Duralast batteries

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.630 
we'll see how the new Duralast batteries
equips<00:04:12.930> into<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.470> fire<00:04:13.710> rate<00:04:14.010> in<00:04:14.220> this<00:04:14.340> manner

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
equips into the fire rate in this manner

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:25.790 
equips into the fire rate in this manner
a<00:04:22.070> lot<00:04:23.070> faster<00:04:23.730> so<00:04:24.600> now<00:04:25.140> we're<00:04:25.350> going<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.590> go<00:04:25.740> to

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
a lot faster so now we're going to go to

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.610 
a lot faster so now we're going to go to
the<00:04:26.160> energizer<00:04:26.700> batteries<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.720> CFL<00:04:28.230> Oh<00:04:28.260> make

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
the energizer batteries the CFL Oh make

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.430 
the energizer batteries the CFL Oh make
a<00:04:28.650> difference<00:04:29.250> alright<00:04:30.030> so<00:04:30.660> now<00:04:30.810> we<00:04:30.870> got<00:04:31.170> the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
a difference alright so now we got the

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.180 
a difference alright so now we got the
Energizer<00:04:32.130> battery<00:04:32.730> center<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:34.190> okay

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
Energizer battery center and okay

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.090 
Energizer battery center and okay
thinking<00:04:35.640> these<00:04:35.820> are<00:04:36.000> going<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.270> win<00:04:37.100> four

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
thinking these are going to win four

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.060 
thinking these are going to win four
because<00:04:38.790> there<00:04:39.030> were<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.330> lot<00:04:39.660> more<00:04:39.870> expensive

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
because there were a lot more expensive

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.010 
because there were a lot more expensive
I'll<00:04:41.370> be<00:04:41.550> pretty<00:04:41.850> disappointed<00:04:42.660> if<00:04:42.780> these

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
I'll be pretty disappointed if these

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.130 
I'll be pretty disappointed if these
don't<00:04:43.260> increase<00:04:44.010> fire<00:04:44.460> rated<00:04:44.850> at<00:04:45.180> all<00:04:45.420> I<00:04:45.900> don't

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
don't increase fire rated at all I don't

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.409 
don't increase fire rated at all I don't
have<00:04:46.350> any<00:04:46.590> bb's<00:04:46.980> in<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.280> mag<00:04:47.460> right<00:04:47.700> now<00:04:47.910> and<00:04:48.180> I

shoot faster though so now that we know

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.750 
shoot faster though so now that we know
of<00:05:28.710> to<00:05:29.640> put<00:05:30.290> energizer<00:05:31.290> batteries<00:05:31.620> in<00:05:32.070> it<00:05:32.100> lot

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.600 
of to put energizer batteries in it lot
faster<00:05:33.479> shooting<00:05:33.930> than<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.190> deer<00:05:35.400> last

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610
