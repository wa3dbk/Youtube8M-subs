fisheries<00:00:05.210> specialist<00:00:05.870> I'm<00:00:06.470> the<00:00:06.740> one<00:00:06.920> that

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
fisheries specialist I'm the one that

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.459 
fisheries specialist I'm the one that
primarily<00:00:07.520> operates<00:00:08.059> the<00:00:08.270> hatchery<00:00:08.690> over<00:00:09.350> the

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
primarily operates the hatchery over the

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.890 
primarily operates the hatchery over the
years<00:00:09.740> we've<00:00:10.549> lost<00:00:10.790> a<00:00:11.090> lot<00:00:11.270> of<00:00:11.299> our<00:00:11.510> natural

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
years we've lost a lot of our natural

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.160 
years we've lost a lot of our natural
spawning<00:00:12.170> habitat<00:00:12.770> so<00:00:13.299> we've<00:00:14.299> found<00:00:14.539> that<00:00:14.780> one

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
spawning habitat so we've found that one

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.779 
spawning habitat so we've found that one
thing<00:00:15.410> that<00:00:15.440> we<00:00:15.650> can<00:00:15.830> do<00:00:15.980> is<00:00:16.190> we<00:00:16.369> can<00:00:16.520> take

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
thing that we can do is we can take

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.779 
thing that we can do is we can take
northern<00:00:17.510> pike<00:00:17.720> eggs<00:00:17.990> from<00:00:18.440> a<00:00:18.560> few<00:00:18.770> few<00:00:19.340> adults

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
northern pike eggs from a few few adults

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.560 
northern pike eggs from a few few adults
and<00:00:20.679> harvest<00:00:21.679> the<00:00:21.800> eggs<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.279> hatch<00:00:23.210> those

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
and harvest the eggs and hatch those

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.829 
and harvest the eggs and hatch those
eggs<00:00:23.810> inside<00:00:24.349> and<00:00:24.830> stock<00:00:25.550> those<00:00:25.820> fry<00:00:26.210> into

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:26.839 
eggs inside and stock those fry into

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.720 
eggs inside and stock those fry into
wetlands<00:00:27.349> in<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:27.740> area<00:00:28.130> and<00:00:28.339> we've<00:00:28.519> been

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
wetlands in the area and we've been

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.340 
wetlands in the area and we've been
having<00:00:28.939> pretty<00:00:29.330> good<00:00:29.539> success<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:33.110> first

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
having pretty good success the first

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.720 
having pretty good success the first
thing<00:00:33.590> of<00:00:33.620> course<00:00:33.740> we<00:00:34.040> do<00:00:34.190> is<00:00:34.310> we<00:00:34.430> go<00:00:34.579> and

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
thing of course we do is we go and

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.369 
thing of course we do is we go and
collect<00:00:34.910> brood<00:00:35.270> stock<00:00:37.750> should<00:00:38.750> be<00:00:39.140> good

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
collect brood stock should be good

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.580 
collect brood stock should be good
female<00:00:40.180> we<00:00:41.180> do<00:00:41.809> a<00:00:41.840> couple<00:00:42.230> different<00:00:42.559> ways

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
female we do a couple different ways

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.770 
female we do a couple different ways
we've<00:00:43.100> got<00:00:43.370> traps<00:00:44.030> that<00:00:44.329> we<00:00:44.449> set<00:00:44.719> in<00:00:44.750> ditches

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
we've got traps that we set in ditches

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.240 
we've got traps that we set in ditches
another<00:00:47.780> way<00:00:47.989> is<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.260> go<00:00:48.530> into<00:00:48.949> the<00:00:49.039> lakes

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
another way is to go into the lakes

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.889 
another way is to go into the lakes
after<00:00:49.519> the<00:00:49.760> ice<00:00:49.910> goes<00:00:50.210> off<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:50.780> set<00:00:51.590> trap<00:00:51.890> nets

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.099 

and<00:00:56.899> collect<00:00:57.859> the<00:00:58.010> dia<00:00:58.309> buck<00:00:58.550> Dahl<00:00:58.809> Pike<00:00:59.809> that

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
and collect the dia buck Dahl Pike that

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.960 
and collect the dia buck Dahl Pike that
way<00:01:01.359> once<00:01:02.359> we<00:01:02.600> have<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.989> pike<00:01:03.640> harvest<00:01:04.640> it<00:01:04.820> out

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
way once we have the pike harvest it out

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.610 
way once we have the pike harvest it out
of<00:01:05.089> those<00:01:05.239> bodies<00:01:05.660> of<00:01:05.780> water<00:01:05.960> we<00:01:06.200> bring<00:01:06.470> them

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
of those bodies of water we bring them

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.800 
of those bodies of water we bring them
back<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.130> hatchery<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.760> we<00:01:08.240> take<00:01:08.510> the

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
back to the hatchery and we take the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.530 
back to the hatchery and we take the
milk<00:01:09.050> from<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:09.560> males<00:01:09.800> and<00:01:10.160> we<00:01:10.790> aspirate<00:01:11.180> then

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
milk from the males and we aspirate then

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.510 
milk from the males and we aspirate then
we<00:01:11.870> want<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.110> keep<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.470> water<00:01:12.650> as<00:01:13.010> much<00:01:13.250> out<00:01:13.490> as

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
we want to keep the water as much out as

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.630 
we want to keep the water as much out as
possible<00:01:13.930> keep<00:01:14.930> everything<00:01:15.290> dry<00:01:15.650> so<00:01:16.220> that<00:01:16.250> the

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
possible keep everything dry so that the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.050 
possible keep everything dry so that the
semen<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.380> eggs<00:01:18.560> don't<00:01:19.040> get<00:01:19.340> water<00:01:19.550> until

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
semen and the eggs don't get water until

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.670 
semen and the eggs don't get water until
we<00:01:20.300> want<00:01:20.510> that<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:21.110> happen

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
we want that to happen

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.100 
we want that to happen
collect<00:01:22.190> about<00:01:22.490> three<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:22.970> four<00:01:23.150> cc's<00:01:23.720> into<00:01:24.080> a

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
collect about three to four cc's into a

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.440 
collect about three to four cc's into a
vial<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:24.740> then<00:01:25.070> take<00:01:25.370> the<00:01:25.610> eggs<00:01:25.790> from<00:01:26.270> the

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
vial and then take the eggs from the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.650 
vial and then take the eggs from the
females<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.580> then<00:01:28.580> we<00:01:28.730> use<00:01:28.940> a<00:01:28.970> solution<00:01:29.390> of

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
females and then we use a solution of

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.290 
females and then we use a solution of
sodium<00:01:29.960> bicarbonate<00:01:30.830> by<00:01:31.250> doing<00:01:31.730> that<00:01:31.940> when

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
sodium bicarbonate by doing that when

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.810 
sodium bicarbonate by doing that when
you<00:01:32.420> add<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.810> semen<00:01:33.230> to<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.560> pan<00:01:33.830> you<00:01:34.430> can<00:01:34.670> get

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
you add the semen to the pan you can get

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.180 
you add the semen to the pan you can get
those<00:01:34.970> sprin<00:01:35.330> cells<00:01:35.740> spread<00:01:36.740> throughout<00:01:37.070> the

that sperm cell is able to come in
contact<00:01:43.970> with<00:01:44.540> one<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.780> those<00:01:44.960> eggs<00:01:45.290> once<00:01:45.890> you

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
contact with one of those eggs once you

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.790 
contact with one of those eggs once you
activate<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:46.640> semen<00:01:47.450> they<00:01:47.780> will<00:01:48.260> only<00:01:48.470> live

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
activate that semen they will only live

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.950 
activate that semen they will only live
for<00:01:49.010> about<00:01:49.160> thirty<00:01:49.760> Seconds<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:50.570> minute<00:01:50.660> and
