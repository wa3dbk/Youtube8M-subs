00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.510
 That day 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:15.210
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:17.210
 What I am also looking forward to the unification of you will be cheats 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.210

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.250
 I would like to send Chitose to new middle-class people 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.840
 Delicious 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.420

 Here from now on eh Shua 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.440
 Employees this 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.560
 None First 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.560
 2 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.530
 Hmm 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.880
 And I said more than that was also successfully completed the west 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.180
 Signing ceremony 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.850
 Not to support 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.850
 I think, but if you have any questions, I would like 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.250
 Not completed 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.659
 It is a pattern of getting over 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.080
 fish 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.960
 I wait in the last Tomamachi fiscal year 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.479
 I do not know what Korea is convinced 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.479
 I heard it with you 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.740
 I probably everyone balance 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.770
 I think it fits 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.770
 Oh 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.050
 Day say but related to the order 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:00.650
 Well that's the last part that I noticed 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:06.360
 8 Though Cana I was including when the empirically short that has been said to me 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:09.230
 As I heard the word and looked back on the Kana capture manual again 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.230
 I think there is no problem 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.780
 Lose 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.840
 Well yes there is a governor absolutely 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.230
 I think that players have experience once 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.160
 At the end it was not stand 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.790

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.790
 Yodogawa seat 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.790

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.569
 The burden of being assigned the main 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.569
 Yes you though 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.019
 But despite that I will defend this belt and have a match again in the US in March 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.019
 so 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.450
 Over and you got to buy while it absolutely win in game content also monkey 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.450
 I think I want to protect the United States 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.470
 I went to America once 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.890
