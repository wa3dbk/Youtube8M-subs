 in durable but lightweight aluminum body 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.940
 this will protect the pedals from damage when 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.970
 transport regular use

 part of the sound mode switch like 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.470
 the rule is classic peyser pedals have 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.810
 one or two settings 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.910

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:54.440
 consider pedal settings more

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.530
 It is also worth noting the tempo function. 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.110
 which will make use of the phaser 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.750
 extremely convenient for concerts feature type

 footswitch or expression pedals we also 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.940
 we can control the speed of work 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.940
