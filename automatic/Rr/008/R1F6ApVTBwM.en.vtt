00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.320
 hello again 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:23.310
 could not resist writing them 5 this 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:31.050
 video means 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:35.030
 I unpacked as much as a pin but I will tell you honestly 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.120
 saying was surprised surprised very pleasantly 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:43.980
 under this laptop which got for 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:49.920
 people and the first thing is just eyes to know and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.800
 here is the design you want it so oladiki 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.719
 catching here with us this goes 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.690
 Aluminum metal case is quite 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.030
 perhaps talami not very nice then 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.130
 have well understood that a strong 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:14.520
 heated up if we open the opening that we 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:17.700
 we can take to see something herself 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.789
 the surface is all made like this too 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.060
 aluminum metal and buttons 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:27.630
 clearly cut out the detail for me 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.829
 You are inserted and it turns out that garbage here 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.429
 no longer fall that is it is very me 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.459
 certainly pleased to take this one 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:42.689
 designer designer she dreams hp and but me 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:46.280
 really liked to the same now as if 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.530
 show it so here I will turn 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.060
 there is a separate power button 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.670
 Wi fi and the Internet access is with 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.610
 right side and the left side button 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.650
 switching on means further on 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:10.140
 CPU and third reasons for the third 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.580
 generations made this all model and for 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.860
 budget class 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:23.970
 we here here see hd 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:27.810
 webcam which yields 720 pixels i 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.980
 I think that it is very very good for 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:37.050
 budget class from the butt we see with us 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:44.310
 go 2 unnecessarily to the optical practical 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:48.510
 with a button on this side of this 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.209
 hand we see the power grid 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.440
 cooling 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:59.970
 video output means city ear 2 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:04.049
 unnecessarily to and hd so another plus 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:08.910
 one more plus way see here here 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:12.900
 this panel is someone's panel on it 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.220
 removed all what is the advantage in 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.870
 than this plus it is clear that you will need 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.110
 posters could see this hidden 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.430
 here these cogs to make it 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.680
 unscrew the plus is that you are free 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:34.530
 have access to the cooling system then 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:39.260
 there is when in a year but you have the strength 23 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.260
 get through these channels through here 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.980
 the keyboard addition for comes in and 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.230
 the lattice gets clogged then you freely have 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.470
 access you stick remove this cover and all 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.120
 his everything has access to it is very, very 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.239
 big plus because 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.750
 there is a model especially asus models it 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.980
 need to scatter the whole computer to 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:11.209
 get to that cooling system 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:15.440
 and on this pleasure too 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:17.180
 here's the outlet see what it costs 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.710
 mean it 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:26.160
 hp probook 4540 with waste paper protection 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:30.180
 plus there is a gift bag worth just 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:34.020
 only up to 4000 381 mane 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.320
 Ie such parameters which in him 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.729
 but with us for such a son you will not take well 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:46.860
 plus a license for Windows 64 bits Semerochka 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:49.770
 almost 700 hryvnia means yourself 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.870
 represents as I said mean 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:59.700
 now try to show 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:04.349
 it means we have that dual core processor 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:10.410
 and 3 3 nomenclature generations from 3110 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:15.690
 m with a frequency of 24 and obverse operatives 4 gdr with 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:20.039
 a frequency of 1333 d 3 chipset 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.919
 your 76 500 screw is separately discrete 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.979
 graphics card im mad at the money and in 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:30.419
 Basically the rest is the whole full set 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:32.010
 linux operating system and well in 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.500
 Basically, in principle, it means me 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:39.230
 simply 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:42.480
 sucked that first look at me 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:46.790
 impressed when i will most likely 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:49.590
 update your laptop yes that is 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:54.540
 maybe I'll be looking at the side glasses 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:58.160
 because honestly very 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:03.060
 liked the design and so very nice 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:07.310
 but now it remains to turn it on to watch 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.310
 try and set up operating rooms
