00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
here and then using that as the base do

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.140 
here and then using that as the base do
two<00:02:46.620> three<00:02:47.040> four<00:02:47.400> five<00:02:49.130> two<00:02:50.130> three<00:02:50.519> four<00:02:50.819> five

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
two three four five two three four five

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.949 
two three four five two three four five
and<00:02:51.510> then<00:02:52.700> just<00:02:53.700> like<00:02:53.880> that<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.569> language

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
would know or wait till there which I'm

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.259 
would know or wait till there which I'm
gonna<00:02:57.060> way<00:02:57.209> into<00:02:57.390> layer<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:58.319> then<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.970> build

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
gonna way into layer and then you build

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.830 
gonna way into layer and then you build
up<00:03:00.600> using<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.440> as<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.640> base<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.269> up<00:03:03.660> to

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
up using that as the base and up to

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.949 
up using that as the base and up to
fourteen<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.680> two<00:03:05.459> three<00:03:05.820> four<00:03:06.239> five<00:03:06.570> six
