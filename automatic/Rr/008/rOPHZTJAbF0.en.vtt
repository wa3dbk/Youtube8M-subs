 of course, all the tools 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.690
 For safety reasons you should go before we 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.540
 start the display off because 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.670
 turn off the phone long up 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.379
 press and then once over vision and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.879
 now we start with the panel on 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.280
 Screw on the bottom of the device 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.570
 here and here 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.129
 we have one for the screws 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.200
 magnetic screws card where you all 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.850
 Room could always be solved exactly 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.360
 Know where they belong and want them 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.360
 do not go away either 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.380
 with the song you just put on the 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.130
 bottom of the device to near the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.049
 home buttons about there and pull 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.049
 Carefully peel off the display 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.060
 next you solve these four 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.659
 screw the metal cover here 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.659
 hold 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.770
 Do not be surprised the screw is up here 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.500
 not magnetic that's why it does not come 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.580
 But as easily as the other out 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.480
 you can do it with the metal cover 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.260
 Carefully get out together as 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.390
 next you have these three 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.230
 Connectors connect the display with the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.230
 connect logic board 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.200
 that was it for the old one 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.509
 display grab the new one now 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.000
 Replacement display from the Niger and tricks 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.640
 to repair and build is the same 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.800
 one as the other has expanded so 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.300
 first he will turn on the three connectors 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.300
 these are here on the logport 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.710
 from now on it does not pay attention to the display 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.300
 more too far behind 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.490
 otherwise the connectors you have 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.450
 just hard laboring hard again 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.910
 pretty easy to solve 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.890
 next you build the metal plate 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.640
 retake the cover and secure it 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.640
 with her four screws 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.190
 remember that this screw is up 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:10.240
 on the right the congregation she is not very 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:13.900
 Magnetic is now you have to 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.620
 Just close the display and put it in the 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.050

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.030

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.510
 and work your way slowly home 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.510
 button in front 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.520
 pay attention that the display 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.830
 flush with the frame and closes 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.600
 No lips form last 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.040
 you attach the display in the frame with 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.040
 screw these two antelope 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.430
