00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
paying for I mean you have to teach them

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.060 
paying for I mean you have to teach them
this<00:01:10.740> part<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.159> which<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.110> carried

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.280 

I<00:01:19.159> understand<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.180> some<00:01:20.390> of<00:01:20.480> the<00:01:20.570> owls<00:01:20.810> pick

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
I understand that some of the owls pick

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.050 
I understand that some of the owls pick
it<00:01:21.440> up<00:01:21.530> quicker<00:01:21.740> than<00:01:21.950> others<00:01:22.040> yeah<00:01:22.850> we've

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
it up quicker than others yeah we've

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.910 
it up quicker than others yeah we've
gone<00:01:23.240> through<00:01:23.510> training<00:01:24.020> processes<00:01:24.560> that's<00:01:24.800> a

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
gone through training processes that's a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.080 
gone through training processes that's a
little<00:01:25.100> guy<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.340> pick<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.670> up<00:01:25.760> better<00:01:25.880> than<00:01:26.030> the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
little guy to pick it up better than the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.730 
little guy to pick it up better than the
big<00:01:26.270> guys<00:01:26.300> do<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:27.170> big<00:01:27.320> guys<00:01:27.470> are<00:01:27.620> more

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
big guys do the big guys are more

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.410 
big guys do the big guys are more
greedier<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:28.460> when<00:01:28.610> they<00:01:28.729> grab<00:01:29.000> something

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
greedier so when they grab something

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.270 
greedier so when they grab something
they<00:01:29.540> really<00:01:29.810> want<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:30.170> hold<00:01:30.290> on<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.800> and<00:01:30.920> a

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
they really want to hold on to it and a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.500 
they really want to hold on to it and a
lot<00:01:31.430> of<00:01:31.460> times<00:01:31.670> we<00:01:31.850> could<00:01:31.970> be<00:01:32.060> training<00:01:32.300> and

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
lot of times we could be training and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.700 
lot of times we could be training and
