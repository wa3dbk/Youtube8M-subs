00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.160
 well we're all here Kim Jong 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:09.940
 craig and we're going to bring something that the truth 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.090
 that he had no plans to go up and that 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:17.220
 I had fixed this bug 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.470
 in the event that I had not planned to upload 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.630
 the new options interface because 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.060
 nothing was good enough 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.580
 important to change the interface 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.560
 options where you want to want a pin 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.710
 but I have changed one 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.309
 a way to put the brand and I think 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.050
 that was much easier and more accessible 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.850
 more than anything because you do so percent 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.000
 that gave beginning I have four say 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.420
 this with that of the escape and 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.420
 jump in the face the keys say vale 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.930
 and you do not have to come here to put 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.739
 the skills that I already had before 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.309
 you had this here and picked up if you were going to 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.680
 the quit cast and you put it here but now 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.060
 not now you just have to come 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.560
 here and say well I want you to be quick 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.840
 I want to have brands go or I do not want 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.280
 have the brand or I want to bring it in 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.240
 Some sites , however , that to me 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.140
 like to have it like that I like to have the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.650
 mark put and then I like to have the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.650
 spells 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.400
 without smart cast 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.150
 no marks giving the chip is worth it 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.320
 I have to throw some killshot 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.020
 with patience and with caution then what 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.300
 I can do by pressing the button that is not 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.580
 if not, then we simply press the cv and 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.909
 we do it because of the case that now 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.679
 put here 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.450
 you do not have to go into any shit 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.240
 of this good only if you want to put what 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.090
 what have I told you about being able to do 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.770
 spells without in brand if you want with the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.450
 chip or good with control or what 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.939
 you want or as if shielding in another 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.470
 site I do not think that it can be 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.470
 can you see if you put this here 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.510
 the zeta 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.920
 and in which will have the white as in the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.830
 brand 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.290
 in the case is that good for people 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.480
 I did not know how to put the score to another 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.640
 It is much easier and good because you have 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.250
 here the surrender has changed all of the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.120
 site and entertained a lot in this I what 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.459
 he 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.020
 then we have here an extract video 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.330
 in the middle it 's true that I gave him to repair 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.660
 because it was the thing is dodgy 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.930
 Well, here you have the options 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.370
 around here the interface sound like 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.290
 beauty too 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.299
 show the procedures as 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.480
 how will you lose control because the truth 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.480
 not 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.280
 flash already when 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.920
 this the truth is that should this 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.769
 activated when I have you when they do 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.780
 damage that your screen gets the 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.220
 red edges and such 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.410
 the truth is that it has to be 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.120
 the battle text and then with the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.060
 movement of the camera and this the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.300
 I really do not know 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.700
 what they were the soft camera 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.709
 they take softened according 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.090
 so as you can see there are the interfaces 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:43.019
 quite changed the interface of 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.090
 of options like this already took the output of the 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.950
 game is here I think all this 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.890
 It should be as it is in it 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.840
 in the normal is to say that you get a 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.260
 menu and from that menu you access the 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.660
 options I just think that they should 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.030
 have attached everything and decides to give it 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.430
 you go to the escape and that I put you back to 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.140
 game options end game and 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.060
 give up 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.810
 and he does not do this but hey 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.120
 they will see another very good thing is that 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.430
 if you give him here to restore 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.290
 default are not restored to you 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.780
 example the video or slow options 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:26.610
 sound interface what you want is worth 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.560
 the options of each zone are reset 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.010
 before anyone who wants to download 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.400
 Restart to restart to default 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.250
 all options were reset 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.840
 colo when it was not understood but now 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.550
 they are better not 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.210
 well nothing gentlemen good percent 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.340
 also team 300 melÃ©ndez 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.630
 but come on, I am that there is 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.630
 favorite and such help a lot 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.250
 anything you already know to robock 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.670
 imation greim a look here you have for 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.040
 true the intelligent marking that 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.350
 we would call it basically that yes 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.910
 you keep pulse to which the post appears 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.000
 indicator and if they all over all 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.030
 they have the truth the smart boarding 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.740
 I look for a little bit when they give me 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.230
 many skills like for example with 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.060
 rise because in tend to 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.840
 block a bit and such is a lot 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.660
 better the normal marks is to say no 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.690
 see the range of the problem skill 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.430
 because you have to adapt to that 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.680
 example the traction cv should 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.289
 get more or less here and up 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.479
 where it arrives and then it arrives more 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.309
 because I do not have that rank taken then 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.409
 because basically I do not play much against 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:43.180
 it 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.520
 remember 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.530
 Well, gentlemen, what do we see? 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.530
 soon now
