00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.360 
multiplayer which is exactly the
opposite<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.390> what<00:02:12.050> that<00:02:12.230> Bungie<00:02:12.709> did<00:02:12.890> to

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
opposite of what that Bungie did to

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.250 
opposite of what that Bungie did to
reach<00:02:13.580> where<00:02:14.000> every<00:02:14.300> single<00:02:14.629> one<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.050> maps

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
reach where every single one of the maps

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.830 
reach where every single one of the maps
except<00:02:15.920> for<00:02:15.950> forge<00:02:16.280> world<00:02:16.550> was<00:02:17.270> included<00:02:17.750> in

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
except for forge world was included in

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.809 
except for forge world was included in
the<00:02:17.959> campaign<00:02:18.379> and<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:19.069> think<00:02:19.400> that's<00:02:19.549> a<00:02:19.640> nice

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
the campaign and I think that's a nice

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.789 
the campaign and I think that's a nice
change<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:20.719> mean<00:02:21.109> you<00:02:21.140> guys<00:02:21.409> can<00:02:21.680> decide

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
change but I mean you guys can decide

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.509 
change but I mean you guys can decide
for<00:02:22.099> yourselves

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
for yourselves

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.979 
for yourselves
so<00:02:24.519> far<00:02:24.760> only<00:02:24.939> two<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:25.359> the<00:02:25.450> maps<00:02:25.689> have<00:02:25.870> been

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
so far only two of the maps have been

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.959 
so far only two of the maps have been
confirmed<00:02:26.439> and<00:02:26.799> those<00:02:26.920> are<00:02:26.950> wrap<00:02:27.310> around<00:02:27.670> and

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
confirmed and those are wrap around and

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.330 
confirmed and those are wrap around and
war<00:02:28.299> house<00:02:28.540> both<00:02:29.469> of<00:02:29.620> them<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:29.859> think<00:02:29.889> look

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
war house both of them I think look

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.399 
war house both of them I think look
awesome<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:30.969> should<00:02:31.269> be<00:02:31.359> very<00:02:31.599> promising<00:02:32.230> for

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
awesome and should be very promising for

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.580 
awesome and should be very promising for
some<00:02:32.560> epic<00:02:32.829> Halo<00:02:33.129> games<00:02:33.989> lastly<00:02:34.989> it<00:02:35.230> seems

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
some epic Halo games lastly it seems

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.410 
some epic Halo games lastly it seems
that<00:02:35.739> sprint<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.159> back<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.579> game<00:02:36.730> now<00:02:37.060> that

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
leaves room for speculation will there

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.539 
leaves room for speculation will there
be<00:02:39.489> armor<00:02:39.909> abilities<00:02:40.299> we're<00:02:41.200> not<00:02:41.319> sure<00:02:41.560> 343<00:02:42.459> is

game<00:02:54.569> now<00:02:55.569> I've<00:02:55.750> heard<00:02:56.109> few<00:02:56.530> things<00:02:56.799> that<00:02:57.310> not

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
game now I've heard few things that not

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.220 
game now I've heard few things that not
only<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.969> battle<00:02:58.269> rifle<00:02:58.599> will<00:02:58.750> be<00:02:58.840> returning

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
only the battle rifle will be returning

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.319 
only the battle rifle will be returning
but<00:02:59.469> also<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.919> DMR<00:03:00.400> or<00:03:00.669> the<00:03:00.819> designated

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
but also the DMR or the designated

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.649 
but also the DMR or the designated
marksman<00:03:01.870> rifle<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.459> means<00:03:04.269> there<00:03:04.569> will

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
marksman rifle so that means there will

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.869 
marksman rifle so that means there will
be<00:03:04.810> two<00:03:05.109> mid-to-long<00:03:05.829> range<00:03:05.859> human<00:03:06.489> rifles

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
be two mid-to-long range human rifles

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.330 
be two mid-to-long range human rifles
I'm<00:03:07.299> not<00:03:07.930> quite<00:03:08.260> sure<00:03:08.290> how<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.650> feel<00:03:08.919> about<00:03:08.980> that

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
I'm not quite sure how I feel about that

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.539 
I'm not quite sure how I feel about that
honestly<00:03:10.150> I<00:03:10.269> hated<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.989> DMR<00:03:11.469> so<00:03:12.129> I<00:03:12.159> wouldn't

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
honestly I hated the DMR so I wouldn't

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.490 
honestly I hated the DMR so I wouldn't
be<00:03:12.579> too<00:03:12.819> fond<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.329> idea<00:03:13.359> plus<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.139> think<00:03:14.199> we

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
be too fond of the idea plus I think we

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.770 
be too fond of the idea plus I think we
only<00:03:14.620> need<00:03:14.889> one<00:03:15.219> mid<00:03:15.909> to<00:03:15.939> long<00:03:16.209> range<00:03:16.480> rifle

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
only need one mid to long range rifle

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.709 
only need one mid to long range rifle
and<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.349> VOR<00:03:18.310> seemed<00:03:18.879> to<00:03:19.000> suffice<00:03:19.299> for<00:03:19.359> the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:19.719 
and the VOR seemed to suffice for the

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.750 
and the VOR seemed to suffice for the
last<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.260> know<00:03:20.290> halo<00:03:20.769> two<00:03:20.919> and<00:03:21.129> halo<00:03:21.310> three

last you know halo two and halo three

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.390 
last you know halo two and halo three

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
and it did just find so I really don't

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.240 
and it did just find so I really don't
see<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.609> need<00:03:24.819> to<00:03:25.150> have<00:03:25.439> both<00:03:26.439> of<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.799> guns<00:03:27.040> in

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.159 
see the need to have both of the guns in
there<00:03:27.400> but<00:03:27.729> we'll<00:03:28.389> see<00:03:28.540> how<00:03:28.569> that<00:03:28.689> works<00:03:28.840> out

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
there but we'll see how that works out

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:33.749 
there but we'll see how that works out
if<00:03:29.439> it's<00:03:29.620> true<00:03:30.720> now<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:32.439> the<00:03:33.189> first<00:03:33.519> look

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:33.759

using<00:03:36.189> a<00:03:36.280> sort<00:03:36.519> of<00:03:36.609> jet<00:03:36.909> pack<00:03:37.150> but<00:03:38.049> I've<00:03:38.349> heard

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
using a sort of jet pack but I've heard

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.289 
using a sort of jet pack but I've heard
many<00:03:38.829> other<00:03:39.069> people<00:03:39.370> saying<00:03:39.579> that<00:03:39.729> is<00:03:39.909> just

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
many other people saying that is just

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.240 
many other people saying that is just
something<00:03:40.509> called<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.900> thruster<00:03:41.349> not<00:03:41.949> a<00:03:41.979> jet

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
something called a thruster not a jet

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.249 
something called a thruster not a jet
pack<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.819> is<00:03:42.970> not<00:03:43.120> an<00:03:43.269> actual<00:03:43.509> armor<00:03:43.900> ability

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:44.259 
pack and is not an actual armor ability

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:46.110 
pack and is not an actual armor ability
so<00:03:44.829> this<00:03:44.979> brings<00:03:45.129> back<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.669> topic<00:03:46.000> of

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
so this brings back the topic of

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.909 
so this brings back the topic of
equipment<00:03:46.540> again<00:03:46.720> will<00:03:47.319> there<00:03:47.470> be<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.620> jet

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
equipment again will there be a jet

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.059 
equipment again will there be a jet
