swimming and we can't get to them and as

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.370 
swimming and we can't get to them and as
I<00:01:30.750> said<00:01:31.250> under<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.840> sand<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
I said under all of this the sand is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.310 
I said under all of this the sand is
still<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.920> I'm<00:01:35.790> sure<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.509> would<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.689> used<00:01:37.079> by

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
still there I'm sure it would be used by

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.850 
still there I'm sure it would be used by
the<00:01:37.380> local<00:01:37.770> community<00:01:39.140> even<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.650> more

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the local community even just have more

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.660 
the local community even just have more
beaches<00:01:41.420> downstream<00:01:42.420> would<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.670> wonderful

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
beaches downstream would be a wonderful

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.270 
beaches downstream would be a wonderful
thing<00:01:45.149> for<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.420> community<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.430> do<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.579> have

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
thing for the community and do not have

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.980 
thing for the community and do not have
every<00:01:50.280> part<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.939> community<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:51.810> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
every part of this community have to

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
look at the river over a dike

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.630 
look at the river over a dike
a<00:01:54.000> dike<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:54.990> someday<00:01:55.649> might<00:01:55.860> be<00:01:56.040> 12<00:01:56.399> feet

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
a dike that someday might be 12 feet

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.290 
a dike that someday might be 12 feet
taller<00:01:57.000> if<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.390> can<00:01:57.600> imagine<00:01:57.840> that
