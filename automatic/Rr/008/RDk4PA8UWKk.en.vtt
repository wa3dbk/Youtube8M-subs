when<00:00:20.770> you're<00:00:20.920> learning<00:00:21.310> the<00:00:21.700> lifts<00:00:22.150> or<00:00:22.540> when

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
when you're learning the lifts or when

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.710 
when you're learning the lifts or when
you're<00:00:22.930> teaching<00:00:23.140> someone<00:00:23.680> else<00:00:23.860> to<00:00:24.040> lift

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
you're teaching someone else to lift

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.859 
you're teaching someone else to lift
there<00:00:25.720> is<00:00:25.990> a<00:00:26.820> step-by-step<00:00:27.820> process<00:00:28.420> and<00:00:28.810> if

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
there is a step-by-step process and if

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.810 
there is a step-by-step process and if
you<00:00:28.990> get<00:00:29.109> ahead<00:00:29.410> of<00:00:29.470> yourself<00:00:29.980> you'll<00:00:30.640> just

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
you get ahead of yourself you'll just

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.060 
you get ahead of yourself you'll just
make<00:00:30.970> it<00:00:31.029> harder<00:00:31.539> more<00:00:32.199> difficult<00:00:32.260> in<00:00:32.890> the

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
make it harder more difficult in the

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.320 
make it harder more difficult in the
long<00:00:33.250> run<00:00:33.519> because<00:00:33.699> you'll<00:00:33.910> have<00:00:34.030> way<00:00:34.300> more

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
long run because you'll have way more

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.080 
long run because you'll have way more
errors<00:00:34.809> to<00:00:34.930> correct<00:00:35.260> as<00:00:35.470> you<00:00:36.460> guys<00:00:36.640> probably

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
errors to correct as you guys probably

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.630 
errors to correct as you guys probably
noticed<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:38.680> very<00:00:39.129> very<00:00:39.840> heavily<00:00:40.840> emphasized

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
noticed we very very heavily emphasized

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.229 
noticed we very very heavily emphasized
position<00:00:42.640> okay<00:00:43.480> in<00:00:43.800> fact<00:00:44.800> I<00:00:45.219> made<00:00:45.940> everybody

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
position okay in fact I made everybody

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.520 
position okay in fact I made everybody
pretty<00:00:46.660> much<00:00:46.800> hold<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:48.160> position<00:00:49.020> at<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.079> hip

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
pretty much hold the position at the hip

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.440 
pretty much hold the position at the hip
the<00:00:51.010> power<00:00:51.250> position<00:00:51.430> hold<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.030> position

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
the power position hold the position

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.260 
the power position hold the position
below<00:00:53.020> the<00:00:53.290> knee<00:00:53.469> and<00:00:53.739> Pacific<00:00:54.430> off<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:55.030> floor

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
below the knee and Pacific off the floor

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.360 
below the knee and Pacific off the floor
when<00:00:55.420> we<00:00:55.539> got<00:00:55.719> to<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:55.960> but<00:00:56.469> every<00:00:56.890> time<00:00:57.129> we

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
when we got to it but every time we

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.920 
when we got to it but every time we
picked<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:57.760> bar<00:00:57.910> up<00:00:58.030> we<00:00:58.239> did<00:00:58.390> though<00:00:58.510> we<00:00:58.780> held

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
picked the bar up we did though we held

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.720 
picked the bar up we did though we held
those<00:00:59.050> positions<00:00:59.350> on<00:00:59.649> the<00:00:59.739> way<00:00:59.860> down<00:01:00.070> then<00:01:00.640> we

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
those positions on the way down then we

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.220 
those positions on the way down then we
held<00:01:00.910> them<00:01:01.030> again<00:01:01.210> on<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:01.329> way<00:01:01.539> up<00:01:01.719> so<00:01:01.960> that

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
held them again on the way up so that

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.350 
held them again on the way up so that
you<00:01:02.440> guys<00:01:02.620> have<00:01:02.890> stopped<00:01:03.280> in<00:01:03.640> this<00:01:03.879> position

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
you guys have stopped in this position

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.820 
you guys have stopped in this position
about<00:01:04.600> eight<00:01:04.720> million<00:01:04.930> times<00:01:05.289> so<00:01:05.500> far<00:01:05.680> today

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
about eight million times so far today

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.580 
about eight million times so far today
okay<00:01:06.520> it's<00:01:07.270> very<00:01:07.300> important<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.080> do<00:01:08.200> that<00:01:08.380> when

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
okay it's very important to do that when

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.740 
okay it's very important to do that when
you're<00:01:08.740> learning<00:01:09.390> because<00:01:10.390> you<00:01:10.509> want<00:01:10.720> to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
you're learning because you want to

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.570 
you're learning because you want to
really<00:01:10.960> pound<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.649> position<00:01:12.130> into<00:01:12.430> your

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
really pound that position into your

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.910 
really pound that position into your
head<00:01:12.820> so<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:13.570> know<00:01:13.899> exactly<00:01:14.380> what<00:01:14.770> that

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
head so that you know exactly what that

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.980 
head so that you know exactly what that
position<00:01:15.100> feels<00:01:15.580> like<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.450> know<00:01:16.570> exactly

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
position feels like and you know exactly

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.480 
position feels like and you know exactly
what<00:01:17.200> it<00:01:17.290> feels<00:01:17.500> like<00:01:17.619> and<00:01:17.860> what<00:01:17.979> it<00:01:18.070> takes<00:01:18.280> to

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
what it feels like and what it takes to

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.300 
what it feels like and what it takes to
get<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.729> that<00:01:18.880> position<00:01:19.180> okay<00:01:20.140> position<00:01:20.680> is

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
get to that position okay position is

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.969 
get to that position okay position is
the<00:01:21.820> top<00:01:22.090> priority<00:01:22.810> when<00:01:23.229> you<00:01:23.380> start<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:23.830> learn

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
the top priority when you start to learn

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.770 
the top priority when you start to learn
a<00:01:24.220> lift<00:01:24.689> don't<00:01:25.689> move<00:01:25.960> on<00:01:26.259> to<00:01:26.979> anything<00:01:27.250> else

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
a lift don't move on to anything else

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.460 
a lift don't move on to anything else
until<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:30.250> get<00:01:30.430> positioned<00:01:30.939> right<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:32.229> some

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
until you get positioned right and some

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.870 
until you get positioned right and some
of<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:32.680> all<00:01:32.830> that<00:01:32.860> we're<00:01:33.130> watching<00:01:33.520> that<00:01:33.549> you

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
of you all that we're watching that you

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.450 
of you all that we're watching that you
saw<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.360> that's<00:01:34.830> 225<00:01:35.830> and<00:01:36.040> that<00:01:36.159> looks<00:01:36.340> about

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
saw that that's 225 and that looks about

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.800 
saw that that's 225 and that looks about
the<00:01:36.759> same<00:01:36.970> as<00:01:37.030> you<00:01:37.390> know<00:01:37.439> 155<00:01:38.439> or<00:01:38.470> whatever<00:01:38.920> did

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the same as you know 155 or whatever did

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.780 
the same as you know 155 or whatever did
after<00:01:40.810> you<00:01:40.930> have<00:01:41.140> position<00:01:41.740> right<00:01:41.979> then<00:01:42.640> you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
after you have position right then you

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.249 
after you have position right then you
want<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.090> start<00:01:43.329> thinking<00:01:43.540> about<00:01:43.810> tempo<00:01:44.470> okay

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
want to start thinking about tempo okay

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.149 
want to start thinking about tempo okay
we're<00:01:47.259> not<00:01:47.409> obviously<00:01:47.770> I'm<00:01:47.890> going<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.070> have

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
we're not obviously I'm going to have

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.149 
we're not obviously I'm going to have
time<00:01:48.460> today<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.790> go<00:01:49.119> into<00:01:49.590> every<00:01:50.590> single

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
time today to go into every single

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.280 
time today to go into every single
aspect<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.700> learning<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:52.000> lifts<00:01:52.329> but<00:01:53.020> once

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
aspect of learning the lifts but once

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.219 
aspect of learning the lifts but once
you<00:01:53.470> have<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.740> positions<00:01:54.189> right<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:56.079> want<00:01:56.200> to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
you have the positions right you want to

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.300 
you have the positions right you want to
think<00:01:56.380> about<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.619> tempo<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:56.950> lift<00:01:57.189> that's

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
think about the tempo the lift that's

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.240 
think about the tempo the lift that's
not<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.610> speed<00:01:58.380> necessarily<00:01:59.380> but<00:01:59.950> it's<00:02:00.130> the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
not the speed necessarily but it's the

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.560 
not the speed necessarily but it's the
speed<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.670> each<00:02:00.759> portion<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.390> lift

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
speed of each portion of the lift

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.440 
speed of each portion of the lift
relative<00:02:02.439> to<00:02:02.619> each<00:02:02.770> other<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.549> once<00:02:04.149> you<00:02:04.329> have

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
relative to each other so once you have

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.179 
relative to each other so once you have
all<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.720> positions<00:02:05.140> learned<00:02:05.350> in<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.560> snatch

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
all the positions learned in the snatch

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.840 
all the positions learned in the snatch
we<00:02:06.549> want<00:02:06.759> to<00:02:06.820> work<00:02:06.939> on<00:02:07.119> slower<00:02:07.810> off<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.380> ground

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
we want to work on slower off the ground

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.940 
we want to work on slower off the ground
speed<00:02:09.850> start<00:02:10.329> to<00:02:10.509> speed<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.989> bar<00:02:11.170> up<00:02:11.380> speed<00:02:11.829> it

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
speed start to speed the bar up speed it

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.380 
speed start to speed the bar up speed it
up<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.100> little<00:02:12.130> more<00:02:12.489> as<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.970> come<00:02:13.150> up<00:02:13.180> the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
up a little more as you come up the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.170 
up a little more as you come up the
thigh<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:13.900> then<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.650> jumping<00:02:15.400> or<00:02:15.910> the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
thigh and then the jumping or the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.819 
thigh and then the jumping or the
extension<00:02:16.630> some<00:02:17.140> people<00:02:17.350> have<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.500> problem

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
extension some people have a problem

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.650 
extension some people have a problem
with<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> word<00:02:18.190> jump<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:18.940> think<00:02:19.420> we're<00:02:19.540> all

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
with the word jump and I think we're all

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.970 
with the word jump and I think we're all
saying<00:02:20.050> different<00:02:20.349> words<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.590> explain<00:02:20.890> the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
saying different words to explain the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.309 
saying different words to explain the
same<00:02:21.129> thing<00:02:21.520> but<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:22.239> extension<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.140> they're

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
same thing but the extension and they're

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.640 
same thing but the extension and they're
going

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
going

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.020 
going
under<00:02:23.829> our<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.099> fastest<00:02:24.549> part<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.819> lift

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
under our the fastest part of the lift

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.030 
under our the fastest part of the lift
so<00:02:25.659> slow<00:02:26.610> faster<00:02:27.610> fastest<00:02:28.540> okay<00:02:29.260> we<00:02:29.769> want<00:02:29.950> to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
so slow faster fastest okay we want to

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.399 
so slow faster fastest okay we want to
get<00:02:30.129> that<00:02:30.310> tempo<00:02:30.790> correct<00:02:31.209> we<00:02:31.930> don't<00:02:32.140> want<00:02:32.319> to

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
get that tempo correct we don't want to

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.420 
get that tempo correct we don't want to
go<00:02:32.530> fast<00:02:33.010> slow<00:02:33.879> down<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.569> then<00:02:34.750> fast<00:02:35.019> again

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
go fast slow down and then fast again

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.850 
go fast slow down and then fast again
slow<00:02:36.430> faster<00:02:37.420> fastest<00:02:38.140> from<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:38.439> bottom<00:02:38.709> to

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
slow faster fastest from the bottom to

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.289 
slow faster fastest from the bottom to
the<00:02:38.950> top<00:02:39.390> once<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.540> have<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.870> tempo<00:02:41.319> right

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
the top once you have the tempo right

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.580 
the top once you have the tempo right
you<00:02:43.299> want<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.510> work<00:02:43.689> on<00:02:43.840> speeding<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.439> whole

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
you want to work on speeding the whole

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.300 
you want to work on speeding the whole
thing<00:02:44.829> up

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
thing up

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.759 
thing up
to<00:02:45.879> approximately<00:02:46.599> put<00:02:47.379> a<00:02:48.359> semi<00:02:49.359> maximal<00:02:49.989> lift

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
to approximately put a semi maximal lift

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.849 
to approximately put a semi maximal lift
with<00:02:51.220> with<00:02:51.549> a<00:02:52.000> heavy<00:02:52.629> weight<00:02:52.870> would<00:02:53.500> look<00:02:53.680> like

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
with with a heavy weight would look like

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.949 
with with a heavy weight would look like
so<00:02:54.489> you<00:02:54.519> may<00:02:54.700> be<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:55.180> may<00:02:55.329> have<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.599> tempo

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
so you may be you may have the tempo

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.330 
so you may be you may have the tempo
right<00:02:56.200> but<00:02:56.409> you're<00:02:56.500> still<00:02:56.709> moving<00:02:56.920> very

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
right but you're still moving very

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.970 
right but you're still moving very
slowly<00:02:57.690> sure<00:02:58.690> from<00:02:59.049> the<00:02:59.170> knee<00:02:59.319> of<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.590> hip<00:02:59.769> is

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
slowly sure from the knee of the hip is

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.500 
slowly sure from the knee of the hip is
faster<00:03:00.459> than<00:03:00.639> from<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.909> floor<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.269> knee

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
faster than from the floor to the knee

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.259 
faster than from the floor to the knee
and<00:03:01.720> from<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.590> from<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.040> hip<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.909> jump<00:03:04.150> and

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
and from the from the hip to jump and

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.729 
and from the from the hip to jump and
catch<00:03:04.480> is<00:03:04.780> faster<00:03:05.170> than<00:03:05.290> from<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.560> need<00:03:05.709> of

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
catch is faster than from the need of

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.530 
catch is faster than from the need of
the<00:03:05.920> hip<00:03:06.099> but<00:03:06.489> it's<00:03:06.609> still<00:03:06.760> not<00:03:06.970> moving<00:03:07.150> as

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
the hip but it's still not moving as

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.390 
the hip but it's still not moving as
fast<00:03:07.720> as<00:03:07.959> a<00:03:07.989> real<00:03:08.230> lift<00:03:08.409> would<00:03:08.500> move<00:03:08.709> okay

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
fast as a real lift would move okay

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.740 
fast as a real lift would move okay
so<00:03:09.700> we've<00:03:09.790> got<00:03:09.909> the<00:03:10.000> tempo<00:03:10.329> right<00:03:10.569> the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
so we've got the tempo right the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.569 
so we've got the tempo right the
relationships<00:03:11.439> as<00:03:11.650> part<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.069> the<00:03:12.159> lift<00:03:12.310> right

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
relationships as part of the lift right

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.640 
relationships as part of the lift right
but<00:03:13.299> not<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:13.629> not<00:03:13.840> at<00:03:13.959> full<00:03:14.109> speed<00:03:14.349> we<00:03:14.500> want

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
but not that not at full speed we want

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.929 
but not that not at full speed we want
to<00:03:14.709> then<00:03:14.799> go<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:14.980> full<00:03:15.189> speed<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.519> only<00:03:15.700> after

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939 
to then go to full speed and only after

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.940 
to then go to full speed and only after
you<00:03:16.060> can<00:03:16.209> do<00:03:16.359> your<00:03:17.049> empty<00:03:17.349> bar<00:03:17.530> or<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.739> very

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
you can do your empty bar or a very

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.500 
you can do your empty bar or a very
lightweight<00:03:18.220> at<00:03:18.609> full<00:03:18.939> speed<00:03:19.239> with<00:03:19.420> the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
lightweight at full speed with the

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.000

correct position in a correct tempo do

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.970 
correct position in a correct tempo do
we<00:03:21.129> want<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.340> think<00:03:21.489> about<00:03:21.629> adding<00:03:22.629> weight<00:03:22.980> and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
we want to think about adding weight and

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.619 
we want to think about adding weight and
you<00:03:24.069> know<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.280> see<00:03:24.730> very<00:03:25.030> often<00:03:25.299> especially

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
you know you see very often especially

people at our self coached or whatnot

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.449 
people at our self coached or whatnot
will<00:03:28.510> start<00:03:28.840> adding<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.650> lot<00:03:29.889> of<00:03:29.919> weight<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.370> the

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
will start adding a lot of weight to the

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.619 
will start adding a lot of weight to the
bar<00:03:30.609> when<00:03:31.000> they<00:03:31.060> don't<00:03:31.150> even<00:03:31.299> have<00:03:31.480> the

bar when they don't even have the

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.970 
bar when they don't even have the
positions<00:03:32.049> correct<00:03:32.349> okay<00:03:32.949> and<00:03:33.220> then<00:03:33.609> it<00:03:33.760> is<00:03:33.940> is

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
positions correct okay and then it is is

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.430 
positions correct okay and then it is is
