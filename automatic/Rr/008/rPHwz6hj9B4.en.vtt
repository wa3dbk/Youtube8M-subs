00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
flam if you guys have used that for the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.660 
flam if you guys have used that for the
sniper<00:00:49.170> class<00:00:49.440> which<00:00:50.010> allows<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> target

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
sniper class which allows you to target

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.990 
sniper class which allows you to target
things<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:52.350> you're<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.579> protection

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
things but it's you're in the protection

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.970 
things but it's you're in the protection
of<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> tank<00:00:54.570> while<00:00:54.809> you're<00:00:54.989> using<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.559> it

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
of the tank while you're using it and it

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.590 
of the tank while you're using it and it
has<00:00:56.100> two<00:00:56.340> modes<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> first<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> normal

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
has two modes the first is a normal

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.790 
has two modes the first is a normal
vision<00:00:57.780> which<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.440> you're<00:00:58.530> seeing<00:00:58.710> here

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
vision which is what you're seeing here

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.490 
vision which is what you're seeing here
no<00:00:59.160> zoom<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.760> everything's<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.719> color<00:01:01.230> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
no zoom and everything's in color and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.429 
no zoom and everything's in color and
then<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.800> zooms<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.120> slight<00:01:03.989> zoom<00:01:04.229> I

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
then it zooms in like this slight zoom I

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.469 
then it zooms in like this slight zoom I
don't<00:01:04.619> think<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:04.949> 1.5<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.299> gives

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
don't think it's like 1.5 but it gives

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.060 
don't think it's like 1.5 but it gives
you<00:01:06.540> thermal<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.920> two<00:01:08.040> different

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
you thermal so you have two different

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.700 
you thermal so you have two different
options<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.729> target<00:01:09.150> things<00:01:09.299> now<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.439> does

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
options to target things now it does

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.770 
options to target things now it does
have<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> limited<00:01:11.189> range<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.420> know<00:01:12.510> it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
have a limited range so you know it

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.660 
have a limited range so you know it
takes<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.080> second<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> lock<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:14.040> but

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
takes a second for you to lock on but

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.090 
takes a second for you to lock on but
once<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.360> what<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.200> want<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.860> have

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
once you do what you want to do is have

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.200 
once you do what you want to do is have
your<00:01:17.700> your<00:01:18.350> driver<00:01:19.350> use<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.430> guided<00:01:20.820> missiles

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
your your driver use the guided missiles

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.030 
your your driver use the guided missiles
and<00:01:21.390> watch<00:01:21.659> how<00:01:21.840> quickly<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> just

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
and watch how quickly that it just

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.719 
and watch how quickly that it just
destroys<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:24.000> helicopter<00:01:25.189> you<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.340> see<00:01:26.490> we

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
done right the only way they can stop it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.370 
done right the only way they can stop it
is<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.820> they<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.810> don't<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.229> what

it's called the EPROM thing that or ECM

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.850

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
actual explosion but trust me that guy

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.469 
actual explosion but trust me that guy
went<00:01:52.020> down<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.640> this<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.790> all<00:01:54.000> from<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.240> same

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
went down and this is all from the same

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.120 
went down and this is all from the same
game<00:01:54.659> by<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.960> way<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.259> does<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:55.799> take

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
game by the way this does not take

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.069 
game by the way this does not take
forever<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.030> capture<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> know<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.840> did<00:01:57.990> this

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
forever to capture you know we did this

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.219 
forever to capture you know we did this
all<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.469> one<00:01:58.649> game<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.630> just<00:02:00.630> multiple

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
all in one game and just multiple

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.170 
all in one game and just multiple
choppers<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.159> works<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:02.520> good<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.850> levels

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
choppers it works really good on levels

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.200 
choppers it works really good on levels
like<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
like the

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
like the canals whether they're spawning

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.980 
like the canals whether they're spawning
those<00:02:06.910> little<00:02:07.180> birds<00:02:07.330> over<00:02:07.660> and<00:02:07.750> over<00:02:07.900> again

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990
