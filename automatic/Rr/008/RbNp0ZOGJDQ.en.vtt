probably seen these kind of wheels

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.690 
probably seen these kind of wheels
around<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:40.040> wanted<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.280> something<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> little

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that from the hardware store focus for

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.609 
that from the hardware store focus for
that<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:02.480> you<00:01:03.480> know<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:04.049> kind<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.350> cool

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that and you know what it's kind of cool

these<00:01:04.860> are<00:01:05.010> three<00:01:05.369> bolt<00:01:05.670> wheels<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:08.869> this<00:01:09.869> is

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
these are three bolt wheels and this is

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.340 
these are three bolt wheels and this is
a<00:01:10.170> three<00:01:10.740> bar<00:01:11.100> spinner<00:01:11.909> chrome<00:01:12.750> spinner<00:01:13.049> I

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
a three bar spinner chrome spinner I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.160 
a three bar spinner chrome spinner I
thought<00:01:14.130> wouldn't<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.490> cool<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.990> put<00:01:16.020> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
thought wouldn't it be cool to put a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.499 
thought wouldn't it be cool to put a
spinner<00:01:16.820> on<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.119> wheel

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
spinner on that wheel

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.690 
spinner on that wheel
I<00:01:18.570> might<00:01:19.049> dress<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.530> little<00:01:19.560> bit<00:01:19.890> once

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
I might dress it up a little bit once

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.850 
I might dress it up a little bit once
it's<00:01:20.880> painted<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.420> curved<00:01:22.320> area<00:01:22.680> looks

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
it's painted this curved area looks

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.820 
it's painted this curved area looks
pretty<00:01:23.159> nice<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.810> three<00:01:25.140> lugs<00:01:25.439> are

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
pretty nice and the three lugs are

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.760 
pretty nice and the three lugs are
worthy<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.820> being<00:01:26.970> shown<00:01:27.240> off<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> made

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
worthy of being shown off so I made

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.270 
worthy of being shown off so I made
these<00:01:28.920> adapters<00:01:29.509> basically<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> took<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:31.280> twelve

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
these adapters basically I took a twelve

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.789 
these adapters basically I took a twelve
by<00:01:32.460> one<00:01:32.729> bolt<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> hardware

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
by one bolt like that in the hardware

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.440 
by one bolt like that in the hardware
store<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.299> then<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> 5/16<00:01:37.640> course<00:01:38.640> thread<00:01:39.000> half

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
store and then a 5/16 course thread half

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.260 
store and then a 5/16 course thread half
bolt<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.820> welded<00:01:42.060> them

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
bolt like that and I welded them

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.660 
bolt like that and I welded them
together<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:43.470> make<00:01:43.500> an<00:01:43.740> adapter<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.220> basically

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
together to make an adapter to basically

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.810 
together to make an adapter to basically
go<00:01:44.790> from<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.119> wheel<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> inside<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
go from the wheel to the inside of the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.780 
go from the wheel to the inside of the
spinner<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:49.189> then<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.220> put<00:01:50.460> them<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.670> my

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
spinner and then I put them in my

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.410 
spinner and then I put them in my
special<00:01:51.030> little<00:01:51.299> jig<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:54.149> I

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
special little jig like this and I

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.929 
special little jig like this and I
welded<00:01:54.720> them<00:01:54.930> together<00:01:55.490> this<00:01:56.490> one's<00:01:56.759> got<00:01:56.909> some

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
welded them together this one's got some

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.990 
welded them together this one's got some
slag<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.250> thread<00:01:59.250> there<00:01:59.490> are<00:01:59.549> my<00:01:59.640> three<00:01:59.880> do

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
slag on the thread there are my three do

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.200 
slag on the thread there are my three do
that<00:02:00.409> so<00:02:01.409> when<00:02:01.560> you're<00:02:01.649> done<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.850> ends<00:02:03.149> up

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
that so when you're done it ends up

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.610 
that so when you're done it ends up
looking<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.570> this

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.910 

and<00:02:07.620> you<00:02:07.740> can<00:02:07.860> put<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.190> into<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> wheel<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
and you can put that into the wheel and

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.320 
and you can put that into the wheel and
then<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.100> can<00:02:11.280> just<00:02:11.460> spin<00:02:11.790> here<00:02:12.030> little

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
then you can just spin here little

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:24.910 
then you can just spin here little
spinner<00:02:21.740> what<00:02:22.740> do<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.860> think<00:02:22.980> about<00:02:23.040> that

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
spinner what do you think about that

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.670 
spinner what do you think about that
there<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.340> our<00:02:26.370> three<00:02:26.640> bolt<00:02:27.630> wheel<00:02:27.959> with

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
there we have our three bolt wheel with

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.310 
there we have our three bolt wheel with
a<00:02:28.709> three<00:02:29.070> bar<00:02:29.220> spinner<00:02:29.780> let's<00:02:30.780> go<00:02:30.930> put<00:02:31.140> them<00:02:31.230> on

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
a three bar spinner let's go put them on

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.300 
a three bar spinner let's go put them on
the<00:02:31.410> car<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.890> see<00:02:32.640> what<00:02:32.730> they<00:02:32.790> look<00:02:32.940> like<00:02:34.310> okay

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the car and see what they look like okay

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.840
