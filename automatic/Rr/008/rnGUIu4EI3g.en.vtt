00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.480
 Carlos Arturo Bacca landed the summer 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.490
 past in Seville and its impact on 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.340
 Liga BBVA was immediate 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.560
 with 14 goals in his first season 21 if 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.480
 We count all competitions on 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.759
 Colombian striker did not need a period 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.170
 of adaptation to Spanish football 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.270
 earning the love of the sanchez pizjuán 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.379
 with its delivery and ease for 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.379
 find the rival goal 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.300
 kanouté luis fabiano negredo magnificent 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.100

 seville in recent times and have 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.190
 left a very high bar 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.730
 the hispalense fans demand many goals 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.620
 and the wig has responded with note 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.300
 so he has had to make many 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.520
 sacrifices to fulfill his dream of 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.290
 play in the best league in the world a 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.620
 hard road that now begins to give you 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.620
 its fruits 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.020
 one always dreams of playing in europe my 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.790
 mentality when I was in Colombia was 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.960
 always play in european football 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.970
 first I wanted to be a footballer 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.370
 professional after playing in europe be 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.740
 part of the selection was difficult in addition 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.430
 that leaving my family to people 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.740
 my habits everything will come to Europe not 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.170
 It was easy for me to fight many years 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.780
 to be able to get to a club like it was 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.480
 the witches that gave me the opportunity 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.420
 where he changed my life a lot because 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.460
 I had to get used to what was 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.000
 belgium what was witch besides the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.000
 language 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.369
 the customs to the food to all but 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.990
 good thanks to god when you want 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.280
 do things right when you think about 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.409
 great when you want to succeed and 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.290
 get success I think that that is 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.330
 one side 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.950
 belgium was a springboard in the 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.770
 cow's journey from his native Colombia 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.240
 until Spain but the two seasons that 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.710
 disputed in witches' they helped him 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.890
 Become a more footballer 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.890
 full 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.950
 so list out there when I get from 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.660
 June- overran 9 plus definer in 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.680
 belgium I played to play for the bands 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.680
 from right to left 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.960
 behind the tip of the second tip by 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.610
 there a lot more sacrifice because it was a 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.630
 football harder stronger more 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.100
 dynamic 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.900
 I learned that a lot and it has 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.760
 facilitated things to get to the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.760
 selection and to get here sevilla 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.640
 the Colombian changed the witches' cold 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.799
 by the heat of Seville in summer 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.689
 2013 and from the first moment it has 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.170
 very comfortable in the capital 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.170
 Andalusian 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.300
 a very nice city very cozy very 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.400
 open to very friendly people very 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.900
 sincere people know a lot about football 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.659
 but it can not fool us 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.790
 I think he has won me the affection of the 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.829
 people inside the field but 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.189
 outside living the day to day I feel 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:05.349
 very happy because I enjoy my family 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.540
 he is very happy here my boy enjoys 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.700
 much in school at school in the 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.560
 places where we go and for me that's 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.950
 a lot of happiness and I feel very happy 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.950
 to be here 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.819
 The celebration of Carlos Bacca 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.530
 knees and pointing to the sky has been 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.959
 a very repeated image in the sanchez 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.700
 pizjuán in recent times a 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.700
 celebration that has its explanation 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.630
 goodbye first of all, thanks 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.510
 to god that gives me the opportunity of this 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.180
 gift of this talent and first I think about 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.640
 him because when I tell you there I went 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.830
 very difficult moments I started to believe in 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.840
 God to seek from God and has shown us 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.510
 the way of thanks to God and the 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.930
 trust and all the love and to the faith 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.490
 that I have in my god I am where I am and 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.490
 I know I can go much further 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.810
 the last course the Colombian got 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.910
 goals of all colors for a 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.830
 forward every so often is special but 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.120
 there are some targets that stand out 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.290
 on top of the others 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.959
 for me all the goals are important 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.199
 because whenever they go up for the team 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.410
 they are important but I can remember two 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.850
 or three is to mark the espanyol that was 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.850
 a nice goal besides not opening 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.160
 the confidence to strengthen us as a group 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.660
 because we do not come very well and that's where it started 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.910
 to grow educate people directly and 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.010
 provide the one that marks the vertex of 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.860
 left my first derby to the two 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.330
 minutes that is a nice goal and the goals 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.860
 that marks him real madrid that always 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.320
 dreamed of playing against teams 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.240
 great against the best players and 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.410
 to be able to score at the stadium and win 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.979
 I think that is for me it has left me 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.979
 marked 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.750
 the first season of the Colombian in 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.940
 Seville was a great success both in what 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.530
 personal as in the collective 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.630
 the Andalusians finished the league in 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.880
 fifth position and they won the Europe 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.300
 league this year the goal is to give a 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.300
 little step more 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.860
 go little by little to catch up with the level 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.469
 we finished that the team finished 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.909
 we have a very beautiful illusion that 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:15.889
 is to get to champions is not going to be easy 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.139
 let's work for that is an illusion 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.150
 let's hope to make it concrete 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.159
 impregnated by the determination of 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.710
 seville wig has signed a start 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.509
 exciting season the goal in 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.150
 the sanchez pizjuán is to enjoy again 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.349
 of the maximum continental competition 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.020
 For this, a large part of the aspirations 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.379
 go through the goals of Carlos Arturo 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.379
 bacca
