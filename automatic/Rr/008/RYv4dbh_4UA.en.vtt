00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:22.489
 one of the greatest technological achievements in agricultural activities is the 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.489
 agricultural-livestock integration 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:29.019
 in this system 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.839
 the producer intensifies its production in both segments and ends up finding 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:37.620
 a much more favorable situation in relation to pasture 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.680
 which become more stringent than protein 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.920
 in this integration theme that has entered folders 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.780
 in a land of farmers was well given bari corrected 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.260
 we have today profitability in the re-fattening bigger than the grain 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.620
 it is possible today in the pastures 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.570
 after grain harvesting produced in 25 until then the apothecary leaving a 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.790
 this margin from 800 up to 900 reais 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.790
 depending on last year's price 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.729
 this occurs 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.799
 due to nutrient residues left by agricultural activity 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.190
 allowing the producer to increase the animal load 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.390
 besides improving the conditions of use 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.420
 with the increase of organic matter as explained by the agronomist and doctor 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.460
 in soil mechanization 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.710
 Luis the people 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.590
 in terms of soil conservation teacher what the producer will have 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.740
 still less in relation to the use of brachiaria 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.690
 with the brachiaras they constitute one of the best for here more time 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.690
 to do no-till in the Midwest 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.000
 that she has a non-high relationship so it takes more power to compose 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.700
 comparing with other points for us it remains frederico covering the soil 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.400
 the longer it covers our can 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.460
 it is irritated erosion by the expert year very high temperatures in the soil she is 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.590
 conserving moisture in the soil and it has 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.630
 a very good ability to have a uniform straw right you do in the senate 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.630
 of braquÃ¡ria you get the straw of the uniform 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.589
 many techniques are used in the crop-livestock integration system 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:25.829
 one of them is the rotation of crops or a particular type of crop is 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.529
 cultivated for an average period of two years after that time 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.909
 grazing so that all available soil nutrients are 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:42.519
 advantage of this process avoids the degradation of the area in addition to 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.519
 existing natural resources 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:52.999
 Another very common technique is the consortium with corn known as 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:58.579
 santa fe system its efficiency has been proven in practically all 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.999
 In addition, the crops implanted in this area are to obtain a more 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.569
 in regions where rainfall is prolonged 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:13.419
 from the consortium of annual crops with fodder the holy system 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.399
 The objective of this study is the production of straw for the no-tillage system 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.909
 or the production of fodder for the off-season 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:31.939
 the holy faith system presents positive results with the use of brachiaria 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.870
 sciences and also with other cultivars as explained by the 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:40.040
 agronomist and researcher of the chapadao agnaldo loyal foundation 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.919
 against the risk 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:47.569
 which is the Brachiaria holy marsh, as we have the world still 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.879
 also scores the chevete compared to the half thing is going 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.209
 proves that soybean productivity stays well 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.389
 remain the same palm or the miner's 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.480
 and requires the seed that will make a difference in your property 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:11.949
 after all it is on earth that everything begins and the seed is the beginning of everything
