00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.570
 at a press conference from the venue 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.400
 Jorge Sampaoli referred to the duel that 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.800
 will hold in front of you tomorrow Saturday 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.950
 from 20:15 in the stadium of 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.950
 collao 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.170
 for the technical director of the selection 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.630
 Chilean the most important job behind 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.790
 senegal and haiti even on the 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.410
 results will find pieces that 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.880
 can strengthen the payroll for 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.030
 Duels against Peru and Uruguay 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.040
 classifications but beyond the 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.809
 results that you in these two 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.199
 The important thing is to have a group 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.489
 of players with which one can draw 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.140
 different types of conclusions for 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.140
 know the future can be 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.520
 potential calls for 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.510
 decisive match and eliminatory 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.220
 before the Central Americans 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.829
 sampaoli hopes to correct errors 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.930
 committed against Senegalese and adjust the 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.210
 gear your team to get 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.400
 an upward yield curve of 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.560
 same way will try to improve the part 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.310
 collective and the effectiveness in the arc 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.390
 rival 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.390
 we look around in this match 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.119
 correct any mistakes we made in the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.790
 first try to keep feeling in the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.450
 collective operation we know very 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.700
 well that you get to a team that was 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.360
 hard because because the match was played 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.149
 because he stood well back when 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.159
 got a Haitian advantage the relationship 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.350
 of Senegalese out there is a system I insist 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.080
 and I'll live with some players who are 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.890
 playing states in the USA that is going to be a 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.319
 match for me difference that to which 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.850
 we play with Senegalese 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.880
 characteristics of the furniture that we're going 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.980
 to face and ideas the idea is 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.980
 try to move 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.420
 greater offensive aggressiveness or greater 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.340
 Goal situations believe that those that 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.780
 we had in the previous game that what 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.450
 that we had stipulated in this circle 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.790
 He also had words for the moment of 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.830
 arturo vidal and jorge valdivia in addition to 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.430
 the bad run of alexis sanchez in the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.230
 barcelona the dimension of life brand 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.670
 morning injury the suspension that has 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.070
 because all the matches analyzed from 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.590
 wasteful in sorry because it takes away 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.140
 continuity after being able to see them 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.540
 play and try to analyze if possible 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.460
 in its call and it's worth it and what I 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.600
 said they are time the poor live 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.600
 moments which 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.720
 are good or need many better or 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.640
 of times they are not also on the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.220
 Argentine visit to see in the field 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.290
 the sub-20 of mario sampaoli rooms no 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.000
 I discard rescue names to integrate 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.400
 to the adult team in the next 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.770
 payroll and he is sure that his presence 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.550
 do not deconcentrate the juveniles 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.630
 the purpose of the visit not a visit 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.630
 a job we 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.560
 as many players as possible 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:11.590
 or drinking for that match with Peru 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.170
 will now be in this instance the police 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.870
 of fort is prudent has to do with 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.640
 future calls, that is, you have to 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.319
 see more with the work of the other one not 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.269
 think about what it is 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.740
 my presence that I do not know how it was done 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.050
 public 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.630
 already so transcendent I just do it 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.150
 only for work 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.100
 beyond being able to watch it on television 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.200
 I like to take it personally because 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.550
 a gore that we have been following and that 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.640
 surely the best are drinkable 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.920
 calls for matches from 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.560
 April or later 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.150
 Finally, the Argentinean analyzed the 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.250
 arrival of eduardo vargas to guilds 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.860
 where you expect him to regain continuity 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.170
 to contribute to the 'red' us 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.000
 we have to make the biggest 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.760
 number of players who are playing 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.370
 outside compete the idea that eduardo 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.989
 go to guild you will do will give him 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.310
 the possibility hopefully give you the 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.739
 opportunity that I may be able to 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.160
 compete so that one can analyze it 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:13.459
 through that analysis generates a 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.000
 call in culture then good 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.130
 what 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.760
 your participation not of the chance of 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.730
 can evaluate it for that step to 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.470
 guild I see it as a positive 4 for 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.470
 he stops so he can play
