I<00:02:12.790> guess<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.360> downside<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.140> if<00:02:14.410> I'm<00:02:14.680> trying<00:02:15.010> to

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
I guess the downside is if I'm trying to

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.700 
I guess the downside is if I'm trying to
get<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.550> macro<00:02:16.090> shot<00:02:16.120> or<00:02:16.720> there's<00:02:16.960> a<00:02:17.020> bug<00:02:17.230> here<00:02:17.530> I

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
get a macro shot or there's a bug here I

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.260 
get a macro shot or there's a bug here I
don't<00:02:17.890> know<00:02:18.070> if<00:02:18.130> that's<00:02:18.310> gross<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.910> put<00:02:19.120> that

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
don't know if that's gross to put that

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.920 
don't know if that's gross to put that
on<00:02:19.420> here<00:02:19.600> or<00:02:19.720> not<00:02:19.840> but<00:02:20.110> that's<00:02:20.340> real<00:02:21.340> life<00:02:21.930> I

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
on here or not but that's real life I

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.810 
on here or not but that's real life I
don't<00:02:23.320> know<00:02:23.530> how<00:02:23.650> well<00:02:23.860> they<00:02:24.010> will<00:02:24.190> do<00:02:24.370> macro

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
don't know how well they will do macro

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.930 
don't know how well they will do macro
but<00:02:25.240> I'm<00:02:26.340> pretty<00:02:27.340> impressed<00:02:27.730> with<00:02:27.790> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
but I'm pretty impressed with the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.790 
but I'm pretty impressed with the
picture<00:02:28.240> quality<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:28.750> far<00:02:31.560> alright<00:02:32.560> next

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
picture quality so far alright next

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.260 
picture quality so far alright next
you're<00:02:33.010> gonna<00:02:33.130> see<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> video<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.790> what<00:02:34.120> the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
you're gonna see a video of what the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.990 
you're gonna see a video of what the
camera<00:02:35.050> looks<00:02:35.350> like<00:02:35.530> underwater<00:02:36.130> indicates

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
camera looks like underwater indicates

Interpol with me swimming this camera

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.540 
Interpol with me swimming this camera
has<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.209> lot<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.830> exact<00:03:05.830> same<00:03:06.070> features

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
has a lot of the exact same features

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.550 
has a lot of the exact same features
that<00:03:06.580> you'd<00:03:06.880> find<00:03:07.090> on<00:03:07.300> any<00:03:07.480> other<00:03:07.630> digital

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
that you'd find on any other digital

that you'd find on any other digital
camera<00:03:09.060> I'm<00:03:10.060> not<00:03:10.120> gonna<00:03:10.450> get<00:03:10.690> into<00:03:10.840> all<00:03:11.110> of

them<00:03:11.440> but<00:03:12.190> two<00:03:12.550> that<00:03:12.790> I'm<00:03:12.940> kind<00:03:13.209> of<00:03:13.330> impressed

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
them but two that I'm kind of impressed

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.660 
them but two that I'm kind of impressed
with<00:03:14.980> is<00:03:15.190> this<00:03:15.700> one<00:03:15.760> rotate<00:03:16.540> what<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:16.989> is<00:03:17.170> is

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
with is this one rotate what that is is

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.580 
with is this one rotate what that is is
the<00:03:18.670> camera<00:03:19.060> mounts<00:03:19.510> on<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.870> bottom<00:03:20.200> like<00:03:20.380> any

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
the camera mounts on the bottom like any

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.920 
the camera mounts on the bottom like any
other<00:03:20.769> camera<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.940> tripod<00:03:22.120> or<00:03:22.690> whatever

other camera to the tripod or whatever
mount<00:03:23.200> you're<00:03:23.440> using<00:03:23.680> what's<00:03:24.550> good<00:03:24.760> about<00:03:24.850> the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
mount you're using what's good about the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.030 
mount you're using what's good about the
rotate<00:03:25.570> screen<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:26.050> sometimes<00:03:26.470> you<00:03:26.709> want<00:03:26.920> to

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
rotate screen is sometimes you want to

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.070 
rotate screen is sometimes you want to
hold<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.340> camera<00:03:27.519> upside<00:03:28.090> down<00:03:28.360> you<00:03:28.810> want<00:03:28.989> to

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
hold the camera upside down you want to

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.250 
hold the camera upside down you want to
hold<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:30.400> tripod<00:03:30.970> or<00:03:31.330> whatever<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:31.900> and

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
hold the tripod or whatever it is and

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.910 
hold the tripod or whatever it is and
and<00:03:33.220> let<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.209> camera<00:03:34.390> hang<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.739> good

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
and let the camera hang and the good

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.920 
and let the camera hang and the good
thing<00:03:36.100> about<00:03:36.190> rotating<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.209> when<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:37.720> do

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
thing about rotating it is when you do

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.660 
thing about rotating it is when you do
that<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.709> picture<00:03:39.010> won't<00:03:39.130> be<00:03:39.310> upside<00:03:39.640> down

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
that the picture won't be upside down

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.330 
that the picture won't be upside down
it'll<00:03:40.150> still<00:03:40.330> be<00:03:40.480> right<00:03:40.690> side<00:03:40.930> up<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.350> I<00:03:41.920> did<00:03:42.310> a

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
it'll still be right side up and I did a

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.320 
it'll still be right side up and I did a
few<00:03:42.580> tests<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.440> with<00:03:44.440> my<00:03:44.620> pool<00:03:44.830> shots<00:03:45.330> the

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
few tests of that with my pool shots the

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.259 
few tests of that with my pool shots the
other<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:47.320> other<00:03:47.410> choice<00:03:47.709> I<00:03:47.920> like<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:49.239> I

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
other the other choice I like that I

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.600 
other the other choice I like that I
don't<00:03:49.480> fully<00:03:49.720> understand<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.610> instruction

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
don't fully understand the instruction

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.039 
don't fully understand the instruction
manual<00:03:52.000> didn't<00:03:52.239> get<00:03:52.360> into<00:03:52.510> it<00:03:52.780> but<00:03:52.900> it's

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
manual didn't get into it but it's

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.160 
manual didn't get into it but it's
called<00:03:53.260> motion<00:03:53.739> detection<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:55.049> when<00:03:56.049> you

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
called motion detection and when you

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.440 
called motion detection and when you
turn<00:03:56.380> it<00:03:56.530> on<00:03:56.620> once<00:03:57.280> something<00:03:57.730> moves<00:03:57.970> in<00:03:58.209> front

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
turn it on once something moves in front

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.390 
turn it on once something moves in front
of<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.630> camera<00:03:59.019> it<00:03:59.440> begins<00:03:59.860> to<00:04:00.010> record

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
of the camera it begins to record

the<00:04:02.350> tricky<00:04:02.769> thing<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:03.130> found<00:04:03.340> out<00:04:03.519> about<00:04:03.670> that

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
the tricky thing I found out about that

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.979 
the tricky thing I found out about that
is<00:04:04.090> when<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.390> leaves<00:04:04.660> blow<00:04:05.170> or<00:04:05.470> car<00:04:06.310> drives<00:04:06.700> by

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
is when the leaves blow or car drives by

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.500 
is when the leaves blow or car drives by
it<00:04:07.989> also<00:04:08.170> starts<00:04:08.829> so<00:04:09.190> I've<00:04:09.820> got<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.090> figure<00:04:10.359> out

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
it also starts so I've got to figure out

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.010 
it also starts so I've got to figure out
how<00:04:10.690> to

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
how to

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
how to
that<00:04:11.260> work<00:04:11.880> in<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:13.090> way<00:04:13.210> you<00:04:13.270> need<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:13.630> to

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
that work in the way you need it to

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.440 
that work in the way you need it to
there<00:04:15.040> is<00:04:15.190> something<00:04:15.220> about<00:04:15.760> this<00:04:15.940> camera<00:04:16.360> I

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
there is something about this camera I

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.780 
there is something about this camera I
don't<00:04:16.870> like<00:04:17.140> there's<00:04:18.130> two<00:04:18.310> things<00:04:18.550> actually

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
don't like there's two things actually

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.870 
don't like there's two things actually
but<00:04:19.270> the<00:04:20.080> most<00:04:20.620> important<00:04:21.280> one<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:21.400> think<00:04:21.520> is

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
but the most important one I think is

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.070 
but the most important one I think is
for<00:04:22.120> example<00:04:22.600> when<00:04:23.500> you're<00:04:23.650> playing<00:04:23.920> a<00:04:24.040> video

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
for example when you're playing a video

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.020 
for example when you're playing a video
right<00:04:26.080> now<00:04:28.170> there's<00:04:29.170> no<00:04:29.380> way<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:29.950> stop<00:04:30.820> the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
right now there's no way to stop the

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.830 
right now there's no way to stop the
video<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.570> go<00:04:32.440> back<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.250> menu<00:04:33.810> when<00:04:34.810> I

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
video and go back to the menu when I

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.740 
video and go back to the menu when I
press<00:04:35.140> the<00:04:35.320> mode<00:04:35.530> button<00:04:38.070> nothing<00:04:39.070> happens

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
press the mode button nothing happens

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
next thing if I could change anything I

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.100 
next thing if I could change anything I
would<00:05:24.640> probably<00:05:24.850> say<00:05:25.180> if<00:05:25.450> you<00:05:25.660> could<00:05:25.840> put<00:05:25.990> an

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
would probably say if you could put an

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.770 
would probably say if you could put an
another<00:05:26.800> lens<00:05:27.130> over<00:05:27.730> this<00:05:27.910> one<00:05:28.180> to<00:05:28.420> make<00:05:28.600> it

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
another lens over this one to make it

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.080 
another lens over this one to make it
not<00:05:29.020> wide-angle<00:05:29.740> but<00:05:29.920> a<00:05:30.100> regular<00:05:30.700> 50

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
not wide-angle but a regular 50

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.260 
not wide-angle but a regular 50
millimeter<00:05:31.570> but<00:05:32.110> sometimes<00:05:32.620> your<00:05:33.270> you're

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
millimeter but sometimes your you're

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.880 
millimeter but sometimes your you're
using<00:05:34.540> video<00:05:34.780> you<00:05:35.020> may<00:05:35.260> not<00:05:35.410> want<00:05:35.680> that

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
using video you may not want that

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.550 
using video you may not want that
wide-angle<00:05:36.340> look<00:05:36.940> or<00:05:37.180> feel<00:05:37.840> that<00:05:38.080> fisheye

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
wide-angle look or feel that fisheye

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.160 
wide-angle look or feel that fisheye
look<00:05:39.180> but<00:05:40.180> it's<00:05:40.390> an<00:05:40.540> action<00:05:40.840> camera<00:05:41.110> so<00:05:43.170> that's

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
look but it's an action camera so that's

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.720 
look but it's an action camera so that's
that's<00:05:44.470> really<00:05:44.770> the<00:05:44.980> way<00:05:45.130> it<00:05:45.250> is<00:05:45.370> it<00:05:45.580> the

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
that's really the way it is it the

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.190 
that's really the way it is it the
otherwise<00:05:46.150> you'd<00:05:46.420> probably<00:05:46.630> have<00:05:46.870> to<00:05:46.930> do

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
otherwise you'd probably have to do

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.580 
otherwise you'd probably have to do
focusing<00:05:47.830> which<00:05:48.700> would<00:05:48.970> be<00:05:49.320> distracting<00:05:50.320> so

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
focusing which would be distracting so

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.330 
focusing which would be distracting so
those<00:05:51.490> are<00:05:51.610> the<00:05:51.700> two<00:05:51.880> things<00:05:52.090> I<00:05:52.300> would<00:05:52.360> change

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
those are the two things I would change

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.540 
those are the two things I would change
