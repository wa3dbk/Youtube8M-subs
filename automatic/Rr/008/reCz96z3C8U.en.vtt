hello and welcome back to educator calm
and<00:00:01.860> welcome<00:00:02.100> back<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.250> biochemistry<00:00:02.909> so<00:00:03.780> we

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
and welcome back to biochemistry so we

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.559 
and welcome back to biochemistry so we
just<00:00:04.380> finished<00:00:04.770> discussing<00:00:05.569> glycolysis

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
just finished discussing glycolysis

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.509 
just finished discussing glycolysis
gluconeogenesis<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.099> pentose

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
gluconeogenesis and the pentose

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.339 
gluconeogenesis and the pentose
phosphate<00:00:08.820> pathway<00:00:09.210> through<00:00:10.050> now<00:00:10.170> we're

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
phosphate pathway through now we're

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.209 
phosphate pathway through now we're
going<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.620> continue<00:00:11.010> on<00:00:11.960> with<00:00:12.960> our<00:00:13.219> metabolic

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
going to continue on with our metabolic

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.829 
going to continue on with our metabolic
pathways<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.150> we're<00:00:15.330> going<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.599> start

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
pathways and we're going to start

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.160 
pathways and we're going to start
discussing<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.440> citric<00:00:16.890> acid<00:00:16.920> cycle<00:00:18.170> let's

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
discussing the citric acid cycle let's

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.380 
discussing the citric acid cycle let's
just<00:00:19.289> jump<00:00:20.130> right<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:22.160> okay<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.910> I'm<00:00:24.240> going

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
just jump right on in okay so I'm going

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.000 
just jump right on in okay so I'm going
to<00:00:24.420> go<00:00:24.510> ahead<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.750> do<00:00:24.930> just<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.230> quick<00:00:25.260> overview

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
to go ahead and do just a quick overview

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.980 
to go ahead and do just a quick overview
again<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> stages<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.539> cellular

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
again of the stages of cellular

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.570 
again of the stages of cellular
respiration<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.039> have<00:00:29.189> an<00:00:29.279> idea<00:00:29.519> of

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
respiration so that we have an idea of

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.040 
respiration so that we have an idea of
where<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.420> are<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> big

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
where it is that we are in the big

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.900 
where it is that we are in the big
picture<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.590> then<00:00:32.070> we'll<00:00:32.250> actually<00:00:32.430> start<00:00:32.880> to

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
picture and then we'll actually start to

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.610 
picture and then we'll actually start to
get<00:00:33.120> into<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> citric<00:00:33.719> acid<00:00:33.840> cycle<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
get into the citric acid cycle and the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.830 
get into the citric acid cycle and the
conversion<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.579> pyruvate<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.660> was

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
conversion of the pyruvate that was

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.799 
conversion of the pyruvate that was
formed<00:00:37.230> during<00:00:37.590> glycolysis<00:00:38.210> into<00:00:39.210> acetyl<00:00:39.629> co

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
formed during glycolysis into acetyl co

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.510 
formed during glycolysis into acetyl co
a<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.260> then<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.739> course<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.129> next<00:00:41.370> lesson

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
a and then of course in the next lesson

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.040 
a and then of course in the next lesson
we'll<00:00:41.820> go<00:00:41.940> ahead<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.270> start<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> citric<00:00:42.930> acid

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
we'll go ahead and start the citric acid

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.819 
we'll go ahead and start the citric acid
cycle<00:00:44.000> ok<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.930> stages<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.469> cellular

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
cycle ok so the stages of cellular

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.220 
cycle ok so the stages of cellular
respiration<00:00:47.719> so<00:00:48.719> let's<00:00:49.200> see<00:00:49.850> stages<00:00:51.230> of

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
respiration so let's see stages of

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.830 
respiration so let's see stages of
cellular<00:00:55.550> respiration<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.629> mean<00:00:57.809> by

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
cellular respiration and what we mean by

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.260 
cellular respiration and what we mean by
that<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.250> conversion<00:01:00.210> of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
that is just the conversion of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.290 
that is just the conversion of
glycolysis<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:01.890> pyruvate<00:01:02.430> ultimately<00:01:03.120> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
glycolysis to pyruvate ultimately to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.990 
glycolysis to pyruvate ultimately to
acetyl-coa<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.170> citric<00:01:04.470> acid<00:01:04.589> cycle<00:01:04.830> all<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
acetyl-coa the citric acid cycle all the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.859 
acetyl-coa the citric acid cycle all the
way<00:01:06.119> down<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.140> produce<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.950> co2<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.869> we

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
way down and we produce the co2 and we

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.640 
way down and we produce the co2 and we
reduce<00:01:11.180> oxygen<00:01:12.180> via<00:01:12.750> all<00:01:12.960> those<00:01:13.110> electrons

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
reduce oxygen via all those electrons

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.980 
reduce oxygen via all those electrons
that<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:13.979> took<00:01:14.130> away<00:01:14.369> from<00:01:14.700> all<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.030> these<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that we took away from all of these you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.240 
that we took away from all of these you
know<00:01:16.140> oxidative<00:01:17.070> steps<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.720> let's<00:01:19.560> see<00:01:19.860> here

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
know oxidative steps so let's see here

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.609 
know oxidative steps so let's see here
so<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.549> started<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.119> glucose<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.200> was<00:01:22.470> our

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
so we started with glucose that was our

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.030 
so we started with glucose that was our
first<00:01:22.979> step<00:01:23.570> from<00:01:24.570> glucose<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.409> glycolysis

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
first step from glucose the glycolysis

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.830 
first step from glucose the glycolysis
we<00:01:26.610> went<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.090> pyruvate<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.850> we've<00:01:30.659> already

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
we went to pyruvate so we've already

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.719 
we went to pyruvate so we've already
taken<00:01:31.049> care<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.650> first<00:01:31.950> step<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.579> was

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
taken care of this first step that was

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.219 
taken care of this first step that was
the<00:01:32.880> glycolysis<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.710> pyruvate<00:01:37.970> acetyl

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
the glycolysis so the pyruvate acetyl

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.560 
the glycolysis so the pyruvate acetyl
coenzyme<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:41.299> now<00:01:42.299> from<00:01:42.810> here<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> acetyl<00:01:43.920> co<00:01:44.130> a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
coenzyme a now from here the acetyl co a

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:53.560 
coenzyme a now from here the acetyl co a
actually<00:01:45.570> enters<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:50.820> citric<00:01:51.210> acid<00:01:51.600> cycle

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
actually enters the citric acid cycle

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.399 
actually enters the citric acid cycle
okay<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.979> over<00:01:55.979> here<00:01:56.780> later<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.869> when<00:01:58.290> we

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
okay and over here later on when we

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.590 
okay and over here later on when we
actually<00:01:58.590> discuss<00:01:59.250> fatty<00:01:59.610> acid<00:02:00.060> catabolism

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
actually discuss fatty acid catabolism

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.730 
actually discuss fatty acid catabolism
and<00:02:00.930> amino<00:02:01.409> acid<00:02:01.799> catabolism<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:04.259> breakdown

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and amino acid catabolism the breakdown

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.630 
and amino acid catabolism the breakdown
of<00:02:04.770> those<00:02:05.100> things<00:02:06.799> they<00:02:07.799> also<00:02:08.039> end<00:02:08.489> up

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
of those things they also end up

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.420 
of those things they also end up
funneling<00:02:09.569> into<00:02:09.780> acetyl<00:02:10.289> co<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.890> entering

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
funneling into acetyl co a and entering

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.460 
funneling into acetyl co a and entering
the<00:02:11.520> citric<00:02:11.879> acid<00:02:12.239> cycle<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:13.080> I'll<00:02:13.200> just<00:02:13.230> go

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the citric acid cycle so I'll just go

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.940 
the citric acid cycle so I'll just go
ahead<00:02:13.590> and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
ahead and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.020 
ahead and
that<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.550> way<00:02:15.709> okay<00:02:17.780> something<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:19.290> that

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
that this way okay something like that

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.940 
that this way okay something like that
okay<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.360> now<00:02:21.599> let<00:02:21.959> me<00:02:21.989> go<00:02:22.110> ahead<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.379> put<00:02:22.709> over

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
okay so now let me go ahead and put over

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.770 
okay so now let me go ahead and put over
here<00:02:25.610> nadh<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:28.430> fadh2<00:02:29.430> i'll<00:02:30.330> go<00:02:30.510> ahead<00:02:30.540> and

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
here nadh and fadh2 i'll go ahead and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.110 
here nadh and fadh2 i'll go ahead and
put<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> little<00:02:31.170> rectangle<00:02:32.160> around<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.819> and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
put a little rectangle around that and

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
what we talked about earlier when we

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.650 
what we talked about earlier when we

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
talked about glycolysis it was remember

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.300 
talked about glycolysis it was remember
we<00:03:24.780> talked<00:03:24.989> about<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.290> formation<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.769> ATP

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
we talked about the formation of ATP

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.240 
we talked about the formation of ATP
that<00:03:26.940> was<00:03:27.150> substrate<00:03:27.600> level<00:03:27.720> phosphorylation

that was substrate level phosphorylation
this<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.519> where<00:03:29.880> most<00:03:30.329> of<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.660> ATP<00:03:31.560> that's

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
this is where most of the ATP that's

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.680 
this is where most of the ATP that's
produced<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.220> body<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.549> produced<00:03:32.970> it's

one of the major products all of this is
designed<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.680> produce<00:03:43.859> ATP<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.209> ATP<00:03:45.750> can

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
designed to produce ATP so the ATP can

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.559 
designed to produce ATP so the ATP can
run<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.799> body<00:03:47.040> because<00:03:47.489> ATP<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.090> energy

run the body because ATP is the energy

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.599 
run the body because ATP is the energy
currency<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.440> other<00:03:49.620> thing<00:03:49.889> that<00:03:49.920> happens<00:03:50.400> is

currency the other thing that happens is

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:57.349 
currency the other thing that happens is
that<00:03:51.510> oxygen<00:03:52.440> gas<00:03:52.739> is<00:03:53.840> actually<00:03:55.849> reduced<00:03:56.849> to

they<00:04:12.000> end<00:04:12.209> up<00:04:12.419> coming<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:12.959> reducing<00:04:13.500> oxygen

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
they end up coming and reducing oxygen

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.559 
they end up coming and reducing oxygen
that's<00:04:14.190> what<00:04:14.340> they<00:04:14.459> do<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.880> in<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.359> process

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
that's what they do and in the process

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.800 
that's what they do and in the process
of<00:04:16.019> course<00:04:16.229> during<00:04:16.530> these<00:04:17.039> processes<00:04:17.789> co2<00:04:18.389> is

of course during these processes co2 is
also<00:04:19.440> released<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:20.220> now<00:04:20.340> let's<00:04:20.489> go<00:04:20.609> ahead<00:04:20.820> and

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
also released so now let's go ahead and

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.360 
also released so now let's go ahead and

just follow the electron path here I'm

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.510 
just follow the electron path here I'm
going<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.580> do<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.729> electron<00:04:24.210> path<00:04:24.479> in<00:04:24.720> red<00:04:25.530> so

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
going to do the electron path in red so

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.620 
going to do the electron path in red so

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.990 
fadh2 is produced all of things come
here<00:04:49.170> and<00:04:49.290> they<00:04:49.680> actually<00:04:49.890> release<00:04:50.670> their

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
here and they actually release their

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.330 
here and they actually release their
electrons<00:04:51.660> once<00:04:52.380> they<00:04:52.560> collect<00:04:52.950> all<00:04:53.160> the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
electrons once they collect all the

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.920 
electrons once they collect all the
electrons<00:04:53.910> from<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.120> oxidations<00:04:54.780> that

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
electrons from the oxidations that

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.110 
electrons from the oxidations that
they've<00:04:55.110> done<00:04:55.380> they<00:04:56.250> take<00:04:56.490> their<00:04:56.670> electrons

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
they've done they take their electrons

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.090 
they've done they take their electrons
and<00:04:57.300> they<00:04:57.660> give<00:04:57.930> them<00:04:58.110> over<00:04:58.320> to<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.710> electron

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
and they give them over to the electron

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.040 
and they give them over to the electron
transport<00:04:59.130> chain<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.150> that's<00:05:00.690> what<00:05:00.990> takes

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
transport chain and that's what takes

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.200 
transport chain and that's what takes
care<00:05:01.500> of<00:05:01.530> this<00:05:01.800> so<00:05:02.490> let's<00:05:02.670> just<00:05:02.820> follow<00:05:02.970> the

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
care of this so let's just follow the

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.890 
care of this so let's just follow the
flow<00:05:03.510> of<00:05:03.540> electrons<00:05:04.110> remember<00:05:04.620> we<00:05:05.160> had<00:05:05.400> some

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
flow of electrons remember we had some

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.860 
flow of electrons remember we had some
NADH<00:05:06.900> formed<00:05:07.500> here<00:05:07.980> so<00:05:08.220> some<00:05:08.400> electrons<00:05:09.030> come

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
NADH formed here so some electrons come

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.630 
NADH formed here so some electrons come
here<00:05:10.350> and<00:05:10.500> then<00:05:10.830> from<00:05:10.980> here<00:05:11.010> there<00:05:11.490> are<00:05:11.550> going

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
here and then from here there are going

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.840 
here and then from here there are going
to<00:05:11.700> be<00:05:11.790> some<00:05:12.030> electrons<00:05:12.540> that<00:05:12.780> come<00:05:12.990> over<00:05:13.320> here

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
to be some electrons that come over here

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.010 
to be some electrons that come over here
from<00:05:14.850> here<00:05:15.300> there<00:05:15.510> are<00:05:15.570> going<00:05:15.690> to<00:05:15.750> be<00:05:15.840> some

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
from here there are going to be some

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.960 
from here there are going to be some
electrons<00:05:16.560> that<00:05:16.740> come<00:05:16.980> here<00:05:17.250> from<00:05:17.430> here<00:05:17.820> there

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
electrons that come here from here there

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.550 
electrons that come here from here there
are<00:05:18.030> going<00:05:18.150> to<00:05:18.210> be<00:05:18.270> electrons<00:05:18.840> that<00:05:19.020> come<00:05:19.260> here

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
are going to be electrons that come here

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.560 
are going to be electrons that come here
so<00:05:19.890> that's<00:05:20.070> what<00:05:20.250> these<00:05:20.370> nad<00:05:20.850> +<00:05:21.210> F<00:05:21.330> ad

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
so that's what these nad + F ad

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.260 
so that's what these nad + F ad
coenzymes<00:05:22.410> do<00:05:22.680> their<00:05:23.190> electron<00:05:23.760> carriers

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
coenzymes do their electron carriers

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.910 
coenzymes do their electron carriers
they<00:05:24.450> hold<00:05:24.750> all<00:05:24.990> of<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.200> electrons<00:05:25.710> by

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
they hold all of the electrons by

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.920 
they hold all of the electrons by
oxidizing<00:05:26.430> all<00:05:26.760> of<00:05:26.880> these<00:05:27.000> things<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.510> then

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
oxidizing all of these things and then

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.690 
oxidizing all of these things and then
they<00:05:28.020> dump<00:05:28.320> their<00:05:28.380> electrons<00:05:28.980> onto<00:05:29.250> the

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
they dump their electrons onto the

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.730 
they dump their electrons onto the
electron<00:05:30.090> transport<00:05:30.120> chain<00:05:30.930> so<00:05:31.470> that<00:05:31.650> those

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
electron transport chain so that those

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.280 
electron transport chain so that those
high<00:05:31.950> energy<00:05:32.310> electrons<00:05:32.820> can<00:05:33.120> do<00:05:33.330> work<00:05:33.630> the

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
high energy electrons can do work the

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.050 
high energy electrons can do work the
work<00:05:34.500> that<00:05:34.710> they<00:05:34.860> do<00:05:34.920> is<00:05:35.280> they<00:05:35.700> actually

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
work that they do is they actually

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.290 
work that they do is they actually
produce<00:05:36.240> ATP<00:05:36.720> and<00:05:37.410> they<00:05:37.770> reduce<00:05:38.130> oxygen<00:05:38.580> to

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
produce ATP and they reduce oxygen to

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.040 
produce ATP and they reduce oxygen to
water<00:05:39.600> that's<00:05:40.260> what<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.590> body<00:05:40.830> does<00:05:41.660> okay<00:05:42.660> so

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
water that's what the body does okay so

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.080 
water that's what the body does okay so
this<00:05:43.200> is<00:05:43.350> the<00:05:43.500> general<00:05:43.710> scheme<00:05:44.310> of<00:05:44.700> what<00:05:44.940> we're

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.100 
then later when we get to oxidative
phosphorylation<00:06:35.430> after<00:06:36.300> that<00:06:36.510> we'll<00:06:36.960> discuss

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
phosphorylation after that we'll discuss

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.770 
phosphorylation after that we'll discuss
this<00:06:37.680> part<00:06:38.040> right<00:06:38.130> here<00:06:38.310> the<00:06:39.090> transfer<00:06:39.630> of<00:06:39.750> the

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
this part right here the transfer of the

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.150 
this part right here the transfer of the
electrons<00:06:40.350> onto<00:06:40.650> the

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
electrons onto the

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.040 
electrons onto the
electron<00:06:41.460> transport<00:06:42.030> chain<00:06:42.300> and<00:06:42.480> then<00:06:42.900> we

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
electron transport chain and then we

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.430 
electron transport chain and then we
will<00:06:43.170> have<00:06:43.260> completed<00:06:43.770> our<00:06:43.980> basic<00:06:44.670> catabolic

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
will have completed our basic catabolic

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.310 
will have completed our basic catabolic
movement<00:06:46.670> so<00:06:47.670> again<00:06:48.210> we<00:06:48.570> did<00:06:48.720> the<00:06:48.840> glucose<00:06:49.200> to

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
movement so again we did the glucose to

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.510 
movement so again we did the glucose to
pyruvate<00:06:49.470> today<00:06:50.100> we're<00:06:50.250> going<00:06:50.340> to<00:06:50.430> do

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
pyruvate today we're going to do

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.610 
pyruvate today we're going to do
pyruvate<00:06:51.060> to<00:06:51.090> acetyl<00:06:51.240> co<00:06:51.750> a<00:06:51.780> so<00:06:52.320> let's<00:06:52.500> get

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
pyruvate to acetyl co a so let's get

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.740 
pyruvate to acetyl co a so let's get
started
