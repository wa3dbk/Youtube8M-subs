I got to the front started taking my
measurements<00:00:03.389> I<00:00:03.449> realize<00:00:03.720> I<00:00:03.750> forgot<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:04.140> tell

got<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.309> make<00:00:08.429> sure<00:00:08.639> your<00:00:08.760> steering<00:00:09.120> wheel

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
got to make sure your steering wheel

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.580 
got to make sure your steering wheel
ascends<00:00:09.929> now<00:00:10.769> if<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:12.750> set<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.139> tone<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
ascends now if you set the tone and the

how to make any changes today we're just
checking<00:00:21.060> our<00:00:21.300> setup<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.109> what<00:00:22.260> we're<00:00:22.380> going

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
checking our setup so what we're going

checking our setup so what we're going
to<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:23.250> go<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> car<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.119> make<00:00:24.240> sure<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
to do is go in the car and make sure the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.839 
to do is go in the car and make sure the
wheels<00:00:24.830> perfectly<00:00:25.830> centered<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.640> want<00:00:26.789> to

wheels perfectly centered you want to

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.279 
wheels perfectly centered you want to
take<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> back<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.510> forth<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.869> know<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.050> little

these tiles you can tell it even though
I've<00:00:45.329> got<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.660> car<00:00:45.899> off<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.469> power<00:00:46.800> series

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
I've got the car off of the power series

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.400 
I've got the car off of the power series
the<00:00:47.879> wheels<00:00:48.719> turn<00:00:49.020> brown

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.779 

okay<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.680> see<00:00:55.770> I've<00:00:56.280> went<00:00:56.489> around<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
okay as you can see I've went around the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.720 
okay as you can see I've went around the
car<00:00:57.000> made<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.690> our<00:00:57.899> measurements<00:00:58.520> they<00:00:59.520> use

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
car made all our measurements they use

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.590 
car made all our measurements they use
it<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.090> Oh<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.899> then<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.789> pretend<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
it as Oh and then I pretend all the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.770 
it as Oh and then I pretend all the
camera<00:01:03.930> measurements<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.439> put<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> CD<00:01:04.920> after<00:01:05.780> now

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
camera measurements I put a CD after now

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.899 
camera measurements I put a CD after now
to<00:01:06.840> convert<00:01:07.229> our<00:01:07.650> camera<00:01:08.220> measurements<00:01:08.790> which

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
to convert our camera measurements which

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.160 
to convert our camera measurements which
we<00:01:09.090> measure<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.930> distance<00:01:10.439> earlier<00:01:12.170> two

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
we measure in the distance earlier two

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.260 
we measure in the distance earlier two
degrees<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:14.130> your<00:01:14.280> scientific<00:01:14.640> calculator

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
degrees get your scientific calculator

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.990 
degrees get your scientific calculator
out<00:01:15.530> measure<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:17.070> straight<00:01:17.369> edge<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.580> we

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
out measure the straight edge that we

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.630 
out measure the straight edge that we
used<00:01:18.299> or<00:01:19.049> your<00:01:19.470> rim<00:01:19.680> diameter<00:01:20.220> if<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.430> didn't

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
used or your rim diameter if you didn't

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.370 
used or your rim diameter if you didn't
use<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.939> straight<00:01:21.210> edge<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.630> use<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
use the straight edge and use the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.770 
use the straight edge and use the
formula<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.759> show<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
formula that I like but show on the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.590 
formula that I like but show on the
video<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.909> you<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.060> either<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.479> it

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
video right now you can either do it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.179 
video right now you can either do it
that<00:01:27.780> way<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.560> make<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.829> little<00:01:28.979> bit

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that way or I can make it a little bit

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.670 
that way or I can make it a little bit
easier<00:01:29.549> I've<00:01:29.790> made<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> table<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.380> put<00:01:31.560> on

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
easier I've made the table and put on

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.800 
easier I've made the table and put on
racetrack<00:01:32.189> database<00:01:32.729> where<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.630> go

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
racetrack database where you just go

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.380 
racetrack database where you just go
look<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.409> I'll<00:01:35.100> probably<00:01:35.340> even<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.180> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
look it up I'll probably even do this a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420 
look it up I'll probably even do this a
little<00:01:36.689> spreadsheet<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.280> can

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
little spreadsheet for you and you can

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.700 
little spreadsheet for you and you can
change<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.200> dimension<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.409> straight

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
change the dimension of your straight

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.010 
change the dimension of your straight
edge<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.159> get<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.670> right<00:01:41.820> calculation<00:01:42.570> well<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
edge and get it right calculation well a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.770 
edge and get it right calculation well a
little<00:01:43.200> bit<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.500> trig<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:45.090> long<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.630> got

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
little bit of trig but as long as we got

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.649 
little bit of trig but as long as we got
