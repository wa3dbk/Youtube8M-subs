beautiful<00:00:04.170> lab<00:00:04.560> net<00:00:05.069> I've<00:00:05.790> gotten<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.150> lot<00:00:06.299> of

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
beautiful lab net I've gotten a lot of

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.450 
beautiful lab net I've gotten a lot of
emails<00:00:06.600> recently<00:00:07.049> talking<00:00:07.859> about<00:00:07.980> missing

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
emails recently talking about missing

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.400 
emails recently talking about missing
textures<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.210> if<00:00:09.480> there's<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.780> fast<00:00:10.170> way<00:00:10.380> to

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
textures and if there's a fast way to

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.320 
textures and if there's a fast way to
replace<00:00:10.769> them<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.639> one<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.150> downfalls

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
replace them so one of the downfalls

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.749 
replace them so one of the downfalls
with<00:00:12.840> cinema<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.440> when<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.860> take<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.099> model<00:00:14.549> and

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
with cinema is when you take a model and

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.000 
with cinema is when you take a model and
put<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.120> into<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> new<00:00:15.719> scene<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.770> have<00:00:16.859> this

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
put it into a new scene so I have this

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.189 
put it into a new scene so I have this
parking<00:00:17.670> garage<00:00:17.730> that's<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> industrial

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
parking garage that's in the industrial

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.929 
parking garage that's in the industrial
pack<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.949> we'll<00:00:20.039> go<00:00:20.100> ahead<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.310> copy<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.730> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
pack and we'll go ahead and copy it and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.939 
pack and we'll go ahead and copy it and
let's<00:00:21.689> go<00:00:21.779> ahead<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:21.990> make<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> new<00:00:22.380> scene<00:00:22.710> and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
let's go ahead and make a new scene and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.179 
let's go ahead and make a new scene and
then<00:00:23.160> paste<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.760> here<00:00:24.140> so<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.010> not

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
then paste it in here so this is not

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.740 
then paste it in here so this is not
just<00:00:26.430> with<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> industrial<00:00:27.150> pack<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.570> is

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
just with the industrial pack this is

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.779 
just with the industrial pack this is
with<00:00:27.930> any<00:00:28.199> model<00:00:28.800> if<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.070> paste<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.490> into<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
with any model if you paste it into a

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.759 
with any model if you paste it into a
new<00:00:30.029> scene<00:00:30.330> let's<00:00:30.990> go<00:00:31.080> ahead<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.320> hit<00:00:31.500> render

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
new scene let's go ahead and hit render

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.860 
new scene let's go ahead and hit render
and<00:00:32.189> you'll<00:00:32.730> notice<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.120> we're<00:00:33.390> missing<00:00:33.570> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and you'll notice that we're missing a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.930 
and you'll notice that we're missing a
bunch<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.260> textures<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:35.040> not<00:00:35.250> super<00:00:35.640> smart

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
bunch of textures it's not super smart

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.459 
bunch of textures it's not super smart
with<00:00:36.059> real<00:00:36.360> inking<00:00:36.750> things<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.170> lot<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
with real inking things a lot of the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.430 
with real inking things a lot of the
time<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> past<00:00:39.300> what<00:00:39.660> I've<00:00:39.780> had<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.110> do

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
time so in the past what I've had to do

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440 
time so in the past what I've had to do
is<00:00:40.680> go<00:00:40.920> into<00:00:41.219> each<00:00:41.489> material<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.239> kind<00:00:42.329> of

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
is go into each material and kind of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.750 
is go into each material and kind of
open<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.930> up<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.800> like<00:00:43.829> okay<00:00:44.399> we're<00:00:44.610> missing

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
open it up be like okay we're missing

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.600 
open it up be like okay we're missing
something<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.750> go<00:00:46.260> ahead<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.620> find<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.280> load

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
something here go ahead and find it load

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.389 
something here go ahead and find it load
it<00:00:47.640> up<00:00:47.879> here<00:00:48.360> now<00:00:48.899> let's<00:00:49.260> check<00:00:49.500> our<00:00:49.710> alpha<00:00:50.160> see

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
it up here now let's check our alpha see

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.650 
it up here now let's check our alpha see
if<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:50.610> missing<00:00:50.820> there<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.570> do

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
if it's missing there and have to do

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.990 
if it's missing there and have to do
that<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:51.989> every<00:00:52.350> single<00:00:52.379> texture<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.489> if

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
that with every single texture and if

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.549 
that with every single texture and if
you're<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.270> good<00:00:54.480> at<00:00:54.510> renaming<00:00:54.960> textures

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
you're not good at renaming textures

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.350 
you're not good at renaming textures
sometimes<00:00:56.039> they're<00:00:56.250> matte<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.730> matte<00:00:57.030> five

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
sometimes they're matte one matte five

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.479 
sometimes they're matte one matte five
matte<00:00:58.199> three<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.920> you're<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.219> kind<00:00:59.399> of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
matte three and you're just kind of

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.340 
matte three and you're just kind of
searching<00:00:59.879> through<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> long<00:01:00.809> time

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
searching through here for a long time

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.670 
searching through here for a long time
kind<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.949> waste<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.340> time<00:01:02.489> right<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.960> there<00:01:04.530> is

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
kind of waste of time right so there is

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.469 
kind of waste of time right so there is
one<00:01:05.070> way<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:05.760> do<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> lot

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
one way that you can do this a lot

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.990 
one way that you can do this a lot
quicker<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> little<00:01:08.040> bit<00:01:08.189> buried

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
quicker and it is a little bit buried

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.399 
quicker and it is a little bit buried
and<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.390> lot<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.659> people<00:01:09.840> don't<00:01:09.930> know<00:01:10.080> about<00:01:10.200> it

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
and a lot of people don't know about it

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.359 
and a lot of people don't know about it
so<00:01:10.560> let's<00:01:10.740> check<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:10.979> out

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
so let's check it out

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.250 
so let's check it out
over<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:11.970> attributes<00:01:12.450> menu<00:01:12.750> there<00:01:13.020> are<00:01:13.049> a

these ones all have an error there's

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.319 
these ones all have an error there's
nothing<00:01:34.590> down<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.549> like<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> little

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
nothing down here like a little

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.670 
nothing down here like a little
thumbnail<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.020> says<00:01:37.170> error<00:01:37.409> loading

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
thumbnail and it says error loading

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.399 
thumbnail and it says error loading
texture<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.850> what<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.110> click

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
texture so what we can do is just click

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.219 
texture so what we can do is just click
on<00:01:40.590> one<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.860> these<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.570> copy<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.720> paste<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.620 
on one of these and copy and paste the
title<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.770> then<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.700> piss<00:01:45.090> into<00:01:45.299> your

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
title and then just piss into your

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.380 
title and then just piss into your
search<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.500> then<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:47.399> open<00:01:47.759> these<00:01:47.880> guys<00:01:48.149> up

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
search and then just open these guys up

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.969 
search and then just open these guys up
and<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:48.630> it'll<00:01:49.380> say<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:49.920> to

and then it'll say do you want to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.530 
and then it'll say do you want to
replace<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.430> texture<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.090> whole<00:01:51.240> scene

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
replace this texture on the whole scene

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.770 
replace this texture on the whole scene
absolutely<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.159> multiple<00:01:53.310> places

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
absolutely so if it's in multiple places

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.760 
absolutely so if it's in multiple places
replace<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.899> everywhere<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.439> then<00:01:55.530> there's<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
replace it everywhere and then there's a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.499 
replace it everywhere and then there's a
little<00:01:56.009> thumbnail<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.360> work

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
little thumbnail and you can just work

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.749 
little thumbnail and you can just work
your<00:01:57.659> way<00:01:57.840> down<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.290> list<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.399> nice<00:01:59.549> thing

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
your way down the list so the nice thing

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.149 
your way down the list so the nice thing
about<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.899> were<00:02:01.140> dot<00:02:01.409> PNG<00:02:01.710> was

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
about this is if this were dot PNG was

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.340 
about this is if this were dot PNG was
in<00:02:02.399> say<00:02:02.909> four<00:02:03.270> or<00:02:03.420> five<00:02:03.600> different<00:02:03.780> textures

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
in say four or five different textures

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.560 
in say four or five different textures
it'll<00:02:04.680> really<00:02:04.890> link<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.280> everywhere<00:02:05.790> which<00:02:06.390> is

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
it'll really link it everywhere which is

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.229 
it'll really link it everywhere which is
a<00:02:06.600> huge<00:02:07.110> time-saver<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.340> that's<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.849> best<00:02:09.000> way

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
a huge time-saver so that's the best way

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.360 
a huge time-saver so that's the best way
when<00:02:09.450> you're<00:02:09.569> bringing<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:10.080> models<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.830> relink

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
