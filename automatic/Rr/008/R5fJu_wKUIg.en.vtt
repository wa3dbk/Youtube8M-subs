00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.240 
then glue them onto the back of the
signs<00:03:07.300> I<00:03:07.720> didn't<00:03:08.560> realize<00:03:08.740> how<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:08.890> look<00:03:09.100> at<00:03:09.190> the

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.680 
signs I didn't realize how I look at the
back<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.670> signs<00:03:09.880> were<00:03:10.090> until<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.480> glued

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
back so the signs were until I glued

back so the signs were until I glued
them<00:03:10.870> on<00:03:10.990> so<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.290> decided<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.710> spray-paint<00:03:12.160> that

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310
