00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
in florence i actually like to slice it

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.870 
in florence i actually like to slice it
thinly<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.680> and<00:00:16.680> then<00:00:17.010> put<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.369> on<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.640> plate

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
thinly and and then put it on the plate

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.179 
thinly and and then put it on the plate
because<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.449> way<00:00:18.690> i<00:00:19.020> don't<00:00:19.380> these<00:00:19.920> days

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
because that way i don't these days

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.010 
because that way i don't these days
people<00:00:20.279> don't<00:00:20.699> eat<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.939> pound<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.600> half<00:00:21.630> of

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
people don't eat a pound and a half of

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.029 
people don't eat a pound and a half of
meat<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:23.039> they<00:00:23.070> will<00:00:23.400> eat<00:00:24.439> they<00:00:25.439> will<00:00:25.650> eat<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
meat but they will eat they will eat a

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.509 
meat but they will eat they will eat a
good<00:00:26.849> amount<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:28.920> perfect<00:00:29.099> it's

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
good amount so this is just perfect it's

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.939 
good amount so this is just perfect it's
medium-rare<00:00:30.000> more<00:00:30.750> towards<00:00:31.080> medium<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.769> think

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
medium-rare more towards medium I think

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.350 
medium-rare more towards medium I think
because<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.489> hot<00:00:32.669> day<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:33.090> might<00:00:33.210> have

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
because it's a hot day it might have

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.299 
because it's a hot day it might have
cooked<00:00:33.600> more<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> would<00:00:34.710> really<00:00:34.860> wouldn't

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
cooked more but I would really wouldn't

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.610 
cooked more but I would really wouldn't
take<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.640> off<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.969> pan<00:00:36.210> under<00:00:36.690> 120<00:00:37.350> that's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
take it off the pan under 120 that's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.520 
take it off the pan under 120 that's
about<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.219> low<00:00:38.910> as<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.210> want<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.480> go<00:00:39.600> that's

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
about as low as you want to go that's

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.660 
about as low as you want to go that's
really<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.129> nice<00:00:41.340> color<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.090> beef<00:00:42.469> okay<00:00:43.469> so

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
really a nice color for the beef okay so

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.760 
really a nice color for the beef okay so
when<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.820> put<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.180> meat<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.230> plate<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
when we put the meat on the plate the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.639 
when we put the meat on the plate the
steak<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.480> just<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.750> overlap<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.410> nicely

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
steak I just like to overlap it nicely

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.740 
steak I just like to overlap it nicely
and<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.309> think<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.760> usually<00:00:51.210> give<00:00:51.360> people

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
and I think I usually give people

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.709 
and I think I usually give people
approximately<00:00:52.559> six<00:00:52.860> ounces<00:00:53.370> they<00:00:54.210> want<00:00:54.449> more

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
approximately six ounces they want more

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.580 
approximately six ounces they want more
they<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.379> more<00:00:56.360> then<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.750> big<00:00:57.930> next<00:00:58.289> big

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
they can have more then the big next big

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.540 
they can have more then the big next big
step<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.640> to<00:01:00.149> finish<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
step is to to finish it and and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.270 
step is to to finish it and and
finishing<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.870> really<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.589> extra<00:01:05.250> virgin

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280
