00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
now it's time to get some beads onto our

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.170 
now it's time to get some beads onto our
yarn<00:01:04.809> I<00:01:05.110> tend<00:01:06.009> to<00:01:06.100> keep<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.520> beads<00:01:06.790> in<00:01:07.060> the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
yarn I tend to keep the beads in the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.200 
yarn I tend to keep the beads in the
palm<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.630> my<00:01:07.780> hand<00:01:08.140> because<00:01:08.740> I<00:01:08.950> find<00:01:09.549> that<00:01:09.880> this

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
palm of my hand because I find that this

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.570 
palm of my hand because I find that this
is<00:01:10.360> easier<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:10.900> can<00:01:11.170> cut<00:01:11.409> my<00:01:11.439> palm<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.920> little<00:01:12.430> bit

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
is easier I can cut my palm a little bit

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.060 
is easier I can cut my palm a little bit
and<00:01:12.850> then<00:01:13.299> angle<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.960> bead<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.350> get<00:01:14.619> it<00:01:14.740> on<00:01:14.890> to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
and then angle the bead to get it on to

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.789 
and then angle the bead to get it on to
the<00:01:15.189> dental<00:01:15.520> floss<00:01:15.610> threader<00:01:16.079> now<00:01:17.079> you<00:01:17.439> don't

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
the dental floss threader now you don't

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.170 
the dental floss threader now you don't
want<00:01:18.040> to<00:01:18.130> hold<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.460> dental<00:01:18.729> floss<00:01:18.909> threader

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
want to hold the dental floss threader

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.450 
want to hold the dental floss threader
way<00:01:19.600> back<00:01:19.960> here<00:01:20.470> because<00:01:20.920> it'll<00:01:21.250> be<00:01:21.340> all

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
way back here because it'll be all

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.240 
way back here because it'll be all
floppy<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:22.180> hard<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.780> control<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.920> want<00:01:24.130> to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
floppy and hard to control you want to

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.969 
floppy and hard to control you want to
hold<00:01:24.400> it<00:01:24.579> right<00:01:24.939> up<00:01:25.299> at<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.720> tip<00:01:25.960> so<00:01:26.619> that<00:01:26.650> it's

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
hold it right up at the tip so that it's

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.039 
hold it right up at the tip so that it's
stiff<00:01:27.369> and<00:01:27.610> you<00:01:27.790> can<00:01:27.970> easily<00:01:28.270> pick<00:01:28.689> up<00:01:28.869> the

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
stiff and you can easily pick up the

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.080 
stiff and you can easily pick up the
beads<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.369> now<00:01:30.579> I'll<00:01:30.790> go<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.360> I'll<00:01:31.869> slide<00:01:32.259> a

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
beads so now I'll go and I'll slide a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.700 
beads so now I'll go and I'll slide a
fair<00:01:34.090> number<00:01:34.299> of<00:01:34.540> beads<00:01:34.780> like<00:01:35.079> maybe<00:01:35.350> five<00:01:35.680> or

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
fair number of beads like maybe five or

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.460 
fair number of beads like maybe five or
six<00:01:36.659> there's<00:01:37.659> no<00:01:37.780> exact<00:01:38.320> number<00:01:38.860> here<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:40.570> and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
six there's no exact number here on and

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.499 
six there's no exact number here on and
when<00:01:41.950> I<00:01:41.979> have<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:42.460> on<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.090> dental<00:01:43.420> floss

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
when I have that on to the dental floss

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.080 
when I have that on to the dental floss
letter<00:01:43.930> then<00:01:44.740> I'll<00:01:44.920> just<00:01:45.130> slide<00:01:45.549> them<00:01:45.790> down

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
letter then I'll just slide them down

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.410 
letter then I'll just slide them down
onto<00:01:46.509> my<00:01:47.290> yarn<00:01:47.770> and<00:01:48.070> what<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.729> want<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.119> do<00:01:49.240> is

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
onto my yarn and what I want to do is

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.319 
onto my yarn and what I want to do is
pull<00:01:49.659> them<00:01:49.719> all<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:50.380> way<00:01:50.469> down<00:01:50.649> on<00:01:50.829> my<00:01:51.009> yarn<00:01:51.329> so

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
pull them all the way down on my yarn so

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:53.789 
pull them all the way down on my yarn so
that<00:01:52.360> they're<00:01:52.719> past<00:01:52.990> where<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.409> yarn<00:01:53.619> is

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
that they're past where the yarn is

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.069 
that they're past where the yarn is
doubled<00:01:54.189> and<00:01:54.340> onto<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.270> working<00:01:55.479> yarn<00:01:55.659> and

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
doubled and onto the working yarn and

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.200 
doubled and onto the working yarn and
then<00:01:56.619> just<00:01:56.799> slide<00:01:56.979> them<00:01:57.100> down<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.310> bit<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:57.700> you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
then just slide them down a bit and you

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.779 
then just slide them down a bit and you
can<00:01:58.390> slide<00:01:58.659> as<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:58.810> go<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.289> then<00:02:00.009> continue<00:02:00.759> to

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
can slide as you go and then continue to

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.630 
can slide as you go and then continue to
do<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:01.860> until<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:02.920> have<00:02:03.219> the<00:02:03.369> correct

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
do this until you have the correct

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.450 
do this until you have the correct
number<00:02:03.820> of<00:02:04.180> beads<00:02:04.570> on<00:02:04.869> for<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.619> pattern<00:02:06.039> that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
number of beads on for the pattern that

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.600 
number of beads on for the pattern that
you<00:02:06.670> are<00:02:07.030> working
