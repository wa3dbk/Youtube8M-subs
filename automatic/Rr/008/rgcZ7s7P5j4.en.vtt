the fast bug thing I think that'd be

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.990 
the fast bug thing I think that'd be
better<00:00:19.279> yeah<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.609> would<00:00:20.850> be<00:00:20.880> better

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
better yeah that would be better

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
let's lead off with Elektra it seems

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.529 
let's lead off with Elektra it seems
like<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> best<00:00:25.800> lead<00:00:26.090> he<00:00:27.090> wants<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.449> do

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
like the best lead he wants to do

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:36.850 
like the best lead he wants to do
shenanigans<00:00:28.580> then<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:33.739> can<00:00:34.739> rule<00:00:34.890> him<00:00:34.980> out

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
shenanigans then I can rule him out

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:47.360 
shenanigans then I can rule him out
simple<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.940> let's<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:44.960> raw<00:00:46.370> he's

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
simple as that so let's do that raw he's

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.410 
simple as that so let's do that raw he's
probably<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.149> go<00:00:48.329> into<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:50.420> stupid

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
