wars<00:00:07.470> have<00:00:07.740> actually<00:00:08.099> been<00:00:08.250> over<00:00:08.580> now<00:00:08.760> for<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
wars have actually been over now for the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.810 
wars have actually been over now for the
past<00:00:09.269> few<00:00:09.630> years<00:00:10.050> but<00:00:10.590> they're<00:00:11.219> just<00:00:11.460> starting

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
past few years but they're just starting

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.019 
past few years but they're just starting
again<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.980> as<00:00:13.980> I've<00:00:14.849> told<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.269> before<00:00:15.299> that

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
again and as I've told you before that

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.970 
again and as I've told you before that
you<00:00:18.029> know<00:00:18.150> real<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.990> realistically<00:00:19.529> like<00:00:19.770> for

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
you know real it realistically like for

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.480 
you know real it realistically like for
example<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.550> nikon<00:00:21.210> d700<00:00:22.109> i<00:00:22.380> mean<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:23.400> a

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
example the nikon d700 i mean it's a

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.670 
example the nikon d700 i mean it's a
12.1<00:00:23.970> megapixel<00:00:24.660> camera<00:00:25.140> i<00:00:25.320> mean<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.590> will

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
12.1 megapixel camera i mean it will

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.000 
12.1 megapixel camera i mean it will
print<00:00:25.859> out<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.160> gorgeous<00:00:26.760> 20<00:00:27.150> by<00:00:27.300> 30<00:00:27.800> prints<00:00:28.800> I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
print out to gorgeous 20 by 30 prints I

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.130 
print out to gorgeous 20 by 30 prints I
mean<00:00:29.130> I've<00:00:29.279> even<00:00:29.310> seen<00:00:29.789> large<00:00:30.480> posters

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
mean I've even seen large posters

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.840 
mean I've even seen large posters
printed<00:00:31.380> off<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.769> d700<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.759> they're

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
printed off the d700 and they're

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.850 
printed off the d700 and they're
absolutely<00:00:33.300> gorgeous<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.559> want<00:00:34.739> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
absolutely gorgeous now if you want to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.540 
absolutely gorgeous now if you want to
zoom<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.300> really<00:00:36.300> tight<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.840> crop<00:00:37.550> well

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
zoom in really tight and crop well

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.420 
zoom in really tight and crop well
that's<00:00:38.760> another<00:00:39.120> issue<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.170> mean<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:41.190> far

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
that's another issue but I mean as far

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.450 
that's another issue but I mean as far
as<00:00:41.700> making<00:00:41.940> prints<00:00:42.360> at<00:00:42.719> any<00:00:43.200> wedding<00:00:43.500> would<00:00:44.309> be

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
as making prints at any wedding would be

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.940 
as making prints at any wedding would be
happy<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.719> properly<00:00:46.140> composed<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
happy to have if properly composed and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.369 
happy to have if properly composed and
lits<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.820> not<00:00:48.059> an<00:00:48.180> issue<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.870> megapixel

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
lits it's not an issue so the megapixel

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.170 
lits it's not an issue so the megapixel
wars<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.800> been<00:00:49.950> over<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> few<00:00:50.610> years<00:00:50.850> but

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
wars have been over for a few years but

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.260 
wars have been over for a few years but
the<00:00:51.809> megapixel<00:00:52.440> wars<00:00:52.680> are<00:00:53.219> starting<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:53.850> again

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the megapixel wars are starting up again

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.660 
the megapixel wars are starting up again
and<00:00:54.690> there's<00:00:55.320> two<00:00:55.530> reasons<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.250> real

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
and there's two reasons for that real

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.209 
and there's two reasons for that real
really<00:00:56.969> three<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.420> four<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:59.070> main

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
really three and four but the main

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.720 
really three and four but the main
reason<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.820> 4k<00:01:00.570> monitors<00:01:01.230> 4k<00:01:01.710> displays<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
reason is 4k monitors 4k displays and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.640 
reason is 4k monitors 4k displays and
also<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.660> either<00:01:03.840> innovate<00:01:04.320> or<00:01:04.470> die

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
also it's either innovate or die

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.330 
also it's either innovate or die
I<00:01:04.920> mean<00:01:05.100> Sony<00:01:05.369> Nikon<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:07.170> Canon<00:01:07.200> they've<00:01:08.100> all

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
I mean Sony Nikon and Canon they've all

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.500 
I mean Sony Nikon and Canon they've all
been<00:01:08.520> sitting<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.240> three<00:01:09.540> years<00:01:09.810> now

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
been sitting on this for three years now

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
been sitting on this for three years now
actually<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.780> hundred<00:01:12.960> percent<00:01:13.140> positive

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
actually I'm a hundred percent positive

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.440 
actually I'm a hundred percent positive
the<00:01:14.040> SanDisk<00:01:14.549> could<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:14.909> rolled<00:01:15.060> out<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the SanDisk could have rolled out the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.620 
the SanDisk could have rolled out the
much<00:01:15.630> faster<00:01:16.259> see<00:01:16.740> fast<00:01:17.009> cards<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:18.420> two

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
much faster see fast cards like two

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.120 
much faster see fast cards like two
years<00:01:18.930> ago<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.380> claim<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.710> they've<00:01:20.040> been

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
years ago they claim that they've been

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.280 
years ago they claim that they've been
working<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.259> a

working on it and this is it's not a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.170 
working on it and this is it's not a
conspiracy<00:01:22.799> theory<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.280> know<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.700> total<00:01:24.060> BS

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
conspiracy theory I know it's total BS

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.850 
conspiracy theory I know it's total BS
it's<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.380> total<00:01:25.770> BS<00:01:26.330> Nikon<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.840> Canon<00:01:28.290> it

it's just total BS Nikon and Canon it

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.219 
it's just total BS Nikon and Canon it

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
cameras the buffers have been there the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.310 
cameras the buffers have been there the
processing<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.970> handle<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> 50<00:01:39.750> megapixel

sensors<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:41.520> been<00:01:41.820> there<00:01:42.740> as<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.890> also<00:01:44.040> told

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
sensors have been there as I also told

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.740 
sensors have been there as I also told
you<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> new<00:01:44.850> theft<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.329> make<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> pixel

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
you the new theft you make a pixel

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.899 
you the new theft you make a pixel
sensor<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.280> rolling<00:01:47.610> out<00:01:47.759> is

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
sensor that can is rolling out is

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.920 
sensor that can is rolling out is
technically<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:49.100> 662<00:01:50.100> megapixel<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.939> know<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.780> is

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
technically a 662 megapixel I know it is

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.200 
technically a 662 megapixel I know it is
at<00:01:52.229> least<00:01:52.530> 60<00:01:53.220> megapixels<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.030> they're

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
at least 60 megapixels but they're

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.240 
at least 60 megapixels but they're
limiting<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> sample<00:01:55.229> rate<00:01:55.380> which<00:01:56.070> is

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
limiting the sample rate which is

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.280 
limiting the sample rate which is
awesome<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:56.700> them<00:01:57.000> which<00:01:57.240> means<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> year

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
awesome for them which means they a year

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.899 
awesome for them which means they a year
or<00:01:58.469> two<00:01:58.680> after<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.189> they<00:01:59.430> could<00:01:59.579> roll<00:01:59.700> out<00:01:59.759> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
or two after that they could roll out a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.200 
or two after that they could roll out a
60<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.630> use<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.170> same<00:02:01.469> sensor<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
60 and use the same sensor just the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.420 
60 and use the same sensor just the
higher<00:02:03.390> sampling<00:02:03.960> rate<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> little<00:02:04.860> bit<00:02:04.950> faster

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
higher sampling rate a little bit faster

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.760
