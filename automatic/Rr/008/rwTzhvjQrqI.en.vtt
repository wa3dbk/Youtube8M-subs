00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.439 

all<00:00:01.709> right<00:00:01.920> I'm<00:00:02.310> going<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.850> show<00:00:03.000> you<00:00:03.060> how<00:00:03.179> to

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
all right I'm going to show you how to

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.639 
all right I'm going to show you how to
play<00:00:03.659> aerials<00:00:04.290> by<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.500> system<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.069> down<00:00:05.569> and

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
play aerials by a system of a down and

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:08.900 
play aerials by a system of a down and
first<00:00:07.649> thing<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:07.859> want<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.069> do<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.610> play<00:00:08.790> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
first thing I want to do to play the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.580 
first thing I want to do to play the
song<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.150> want<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.570> have<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.960> add<00:00:10.139> drop<00:00:10.380> D

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
song you want to have it to add drop D

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.310 
song you want to have it to add drop D
tuning<00:00:11.630> there<00:00:12.630> are<00:00:12.690> other<00:00:12.750> ways<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:12.990> do<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.290> but

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
tuning there are other ways to do it but

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.820 
tuning there are other ways to do it but
this<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.650> much<00:00:13.830> easier<00:00:14.160> than<00:00:14.849> much<00:00:15.179> quicker<00:00:15.830> um

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
this is much easier than much quicker um

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.679 
this is much easier than much quicker um
so<00:00:17.220> your<00:00:17.400> standard<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.240> drop<00:00:18.449> D<00:00:20.539> but<00:00:21.539> your

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
so your standard this is drop D but your

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:31.070 
so your standard this is drop D but your
standard<00:00:22.199> tuning<00:00:22.380> will<00:00:23.340> be<00:00:29.720> pretty<00:00:30.720> close<00:00:30.900> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
standard tuning will be pretty close to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.170 
standard tuning will be pretty close to
this<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:34.800> drop<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:35.850> drop<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
this to drop the I like to just drop the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.389 
this to drop the I like to just drop the
top<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.649> figure<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:38.129> how<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> tune

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
top one but to figure out how to tune

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.049 
top one but to figure out how to tune
that<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.210> fastest<00:00:39.690> way<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.850> match<00:00:41.850> up

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
that the fastest way is just to match up

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:50.690 
that the fastest way is just to match up
these<00:00:42.210> two<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.920> much<00:00:50.070> your<00:00:50.219> first<00:00:50.430> thing<00:00:50.579> with

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
these two so much your first thing with

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.660 
these two so much your first thing with
string<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.360> your<00:00:51.390> thirsting<00:00:52.489> now<00:00:53.489> we're

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
string with your thirsting now we're

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.310 
string with your thirsting now we're
going<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.090> fingering<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:55.010> 32<00:00:56.010> open

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
going to do this fingering it's 32 open

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:09.590 
going to do this fingering it's 32 open
5<00:00:58.320> 3<00:00:59.129> 2<00:00:59.969> 3<00:01:01.370> 5<00:01:02.370> 7<00:01:03.149> 8<00:01:04.760> 753<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:07.640> open<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.420> whole

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
5 3 2 3 5 7 8 753 to open the whole

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.600 
5 3 2 3 5 7 8 753 to open the whole
pattern<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> top<00:01:10.680> three<00:01:13.369> like<00:01:14.369> that

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
pattern is just the top three like that

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:49.070 
pattern is just the top three like that
so

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.330 

so<00:01:50.080> as<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.260> can<00:01:50.380> see<00:01:50.590> when<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.800> gets<00:01:50.920> up<00:01:51.010> here

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
so as you can see when it gets up here

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.710 
so as you can see when it gets up here
it<00:01:51.700> gets<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:52.240> lot<00:01:52.660> harder<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.610> um<00:01:54.970> this<00:01:55.510> is<00:01:55.690> the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
it gets a lot harder so um this is the

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.300 
it gets a lot harder so um this is the
first<00:01:55.990> part<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.620> video<00:01:56.860> I'll<00:01:56.980> just<00:01:57.130> show

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
first part to the video I'll just show

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.120 
first part to the video I'll just show
you<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.730> bottom<00:01:58.330> part<00:01:58.480> down<00:01:58.690> here<00:01:59.010> if<00:02:00.010> you

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
you the bottom part down here if you

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.640 
you the bottom part down here if you
watch<00:02:00.310> my<00:02:00.340> second<00:02:01.060> part<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:02.170> this<00:02:02.200> video<00:02:02.590> I

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
watch my second part to this video I

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.610 
watch my second part to this video I
will<00:02:02.890> have<00:02:03.430> this<00:02:04.000> part<00:02:04.270> up<00:02:04.360> here<00:02:04.470> now<00:02:05.470> one

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
will have this part up here now one

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.510 
will have this part up here now one
thing<00:02:05.650> you<00:02:05.800> might<00:02:05.920> have<00:02:06.040> noticed<00:02:06.100> when<00:02:06.460> I

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
thing you might have noticed when I

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.139 
thing you might have noticed when I
played<00:02:06.760> it<00:02:06.880> first<00:02:07.180> is<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:08.410> down<00:02:09.030> from<00:02:10.030> the

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
played it first is that it down from the

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.820 
played it first is that it down from the
top<00:02:10.300> note<00:02:10.540> twice<00:02:10.840> once<00:02:11.110> I'll<00:02:11.470> show<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.710> and

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
top note twice once I'll show you and

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:20.880 
top note twice once I'll show you and
that<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:16.770> right<00:02:17.770> here<00:02:19.500> except<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.620> put<00:02:20.770> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
that is right here except you put the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.460 
that is right here except you put the
fifth<00:02:21.160> no<00:02:21.400> off<00:02:21.640> your<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.330> put<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.230> fifth

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
fifth no off your you put the fifth

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.620 
fifth no off your you put the fifth
strip<00:02:24.280> fret<00:02:24.850> now<00:02:25.270> so<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.880> then<00:02:31.330> right<00:02:31.480> there

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
strip fret now so and then right there

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.620 
strip fret now so and then right there
again<00:02:32.340> when<00:02:33.340> you're<00:02:33.430> from<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:34.030> second<00:02:34.390> fret

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
again when you're from the second fret

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.870 
again when you're from the second fret
you<00:02:34.870> go<00:02:34.990> to<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.170> third<00:02:35.350> fret<00:02:35.590> but<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.580> are

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
you go to the third fret but you are

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:46.640 
you go to the third fret but you are
strung<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:38.170> top<00:02:38.380> string<00:02:38.740> twice

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.530 

and<00:02:47.650> then<00:02:47.799> when<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.099> get<00:02:48.220> up<00:02:48.310> here<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:49.060> pace

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
and then when you get up here the pace

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.180 
and then when you get up here the pace
quickens<00:02:50.440> up<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.739> little<00:02:50.950> bit<00:02:51.209> um<00:02:52.209> well<00:02:52.540> not

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
quickens up a little bit um well not

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.729 
quickens up a little bit um well not
really<00:02:54.190> but<00:02:54.430> you'd<00:02:54.580> switch<00:02:55.049> frets<00:02:56.049> faster<00:02:56.470> so

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
really but you'd switch frets faster so

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.979 
really but you'd switch frets faster so
if<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.370> can<00:02:57.489> just<00:02:57.519> watch<00:02:57.819> this<00:02:58.120> maybe<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.780> can

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
if you can just watch this maybe you can

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:10.230 
if you can just watch this maybe you can
get<00:02:59.530> an<00:02:59.620> idea

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:25.620 

sold<00:03:11.240> it<00:03:11.360> again<00:03:20.830> so<00:03:21.830> when<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:22.310> hit<00:03:22.550> the<00:03:22.700> eighth

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.570 

all<00:03:26.630> right<00:03:26.750> there<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.650> seven<00:03:27.980> this<00:03:28.340> is<00:03:28.490> the

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
all right there the seven this is the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.190 
all right there the seven this is the
eighth<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:28.970> then<00:03:29.270> the<00:03:29.540> seventh<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.050> the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
eighth and then the seventh and the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.060 
eighth and then the seventh and the
fifth<00:03:30.500> fret<00:03:31.030> who<00:03:32.030> only<00:03:32.240> play<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.540> top<00:03:32.690> two<00:03:33.070> and

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
fifth fret who only play the top two and

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.560 
fifth fret who only play the top two and
then<00:03:34.250> move<00:03:34.400> on<00:03:34.520> in<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.640> next<00:03:34.850> room<00:03:37.330> and<00:03:38.330> play

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
then move on in the next room and play

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.460 
then move on in the next room and play
