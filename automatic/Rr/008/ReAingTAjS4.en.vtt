00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
but Shelley's almost done here what I'll

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.550 
but Shelley's almost done here what I'll
do<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.680> we'll<00:01:39.430> probably<00:01:39.700> get<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.200> most<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.440> this

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
do is we'll probably get a most of this

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.730 
do is we'll probably get a most of this
out<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:42.280> then<00:01:42.910> get<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.240> water<00:01:43.480> hose<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:44.110> rinse

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
out just the tail end of it you can

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.940 
out just the tail end of it you can
throw<00:01:48.070> your<00:01:48.280> pond<00:01:48.580> back<00:01:48.910> up<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.710> replace<00:01:50.710> your

which<00:02:57.070> are<00:02:57.280> toxic<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.930> my<00:02:59.050> fish<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.620> I<00:02:59.680> don't

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
which are toxic to my fish and I don't

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.850 
which are toxic to my fish and I don't
want<00:03:00.070> them

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.650 

that's<00:03:03.520> about<00:03:03.730> all<00:03:03.790> I'm<00:03:04.090> here<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.300> do<00:03:04.480> right

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
that's about all I'm here to do right

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.920 
that's about all I'm here to do right
there<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:06.400> you're<00:03:06.670> using<00:03:06.880> well<00:03:07.360> water<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:07.840> you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
there and you're using well water so you

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.330 
there and you're using well water so you
don't<00:03:08.080> have<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.260> worry<00:03:08.410> about<00:03:08.440> chlorine<00:03:08.950> no

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
don't have to worry about chlorine no

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.820 
don't have to worry about chlorine no
chlorine<00:03:09.640> in<00:03:10.240> my<00:03:10.480> well<00:03:10.690> if<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.140> was<00:03:11.380> if<00:03:11.650> this

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
chlorine in my well if this was if this

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.590 
chlorine in my well if this was if this
was<00:03:12.040> city<00:03:12.280> water<00:03:12.580> we'd<00:03:12.880> have<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.150> do<00:03:13.270> something

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
was city water we'd have to do something

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.480 
was city water we'd have to do something
else<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.990> water<00:03:14.170> would<00:03:14.340> lose<00:03:15.340> the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
else so the water would lose the

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.370 
else so the water would lose the
chlorine<00:03:15.820> if<00:03:16.090> this<00:03:16.330> was<00:03:16.540> city<00:03:16.780> water<00:03:17.050> what<00:03:17.350> I

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
chlorine if this was city water what I

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.560 
chlorine if this was city water what I
would<00:03:17.650> suggest<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:18.400> just<00:03:18.670> filling<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.180> up<00:03:19.330> and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
would suggest is just filling it up and

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.720 
would suggest is just filling it up and
letting<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:19.840> sit<00:03:19.900> for<00:03:20.290> two<00:03:20.440> or<00:03:20.530> three<00:03:20.710> days<00:03:20.890> you

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
letting it sit for two or three days you

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.970 
letting it sit for two or three days you
can<00:03:21.970> treat<00:03:22.270> it<00:03:22.390> with<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.540> chemical<00:03:23.080> but<00:03:23.290> it's

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
can treat it with a chemical but it's

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.160 
can treat it with a chemical but it's
not<00:03:24.190> necessary<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.450> less<00:03:25.630> I<00:03:25.840> can<00:03:25.900> use

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
not necessary and the less I can use

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.340 
not necessary and the less I can use
chemicals<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:27.340> better<00:03:27.520> I<00:03:27.610> like<00:03:27.910> it<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:29.290> are

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
chemicals the better I like it we are

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.370 
chemicals the better I like it we are
setting<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.400> water<00:03:31.180> lilies<00:03:31.600> back<00:03:31.810> in<00:03:32.050> as<00:03:32.230> you

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
setting the water lilies back in as you

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.290 
setting the water lilies back in as you
can<00:03:32.590> see<00:03:32.860> some<00:03:33.550> of<00:03:33.670> these<00:03:33.790> need<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.180> be

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
can see some of these need to be

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.690 
can see some of these need to be
repotted<00:03:34.720> we've<00:03:35.470> got<00:03:35.710> about<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.130> two<00:03:36.460> month

the bucket in here and let it kind of
start<00:04:27.460> getting<00:04:27.730> acclimated<00:04:30.630> Curtis<00:04:31.630> I'm

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
start getting acclimated Curtis I'm

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
when we get the water level up high

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.780 
when we get the water level up high
enough<00:04:50.470> we<00:04:50.680> can<00:04:50.860> plug<00:04:51.100> it<00:04:51.280> in<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:51.700> our
