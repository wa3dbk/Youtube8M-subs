00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.850
 it performs the same functions as 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.880
 traditional currency 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.650
 it represents a unit of account it's 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.190
 to say that it measures the value 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.290
 a good or a service 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.980

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.500
 pair of bitcoin voodoo socks

 goods and services 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.800
 and it can be stored to be 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.170
 used in the future 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.360
 bitcoin sense can be qualified as 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.829
 currency in the same way as the euro 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.530
 example 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.120
 but beware the euro and bitcoin have 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.270
 different characteristics 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.649
 the euro to a legal tender it means 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.809
 that he is recognized by the powers 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.909
 public and that everyone in the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.020
 euro zone is obliged to accept being 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.390
 paid in euros 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.640
 gold even though more and more sites 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.100
 e-commerce and even some shops 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.719
 physical accepts bitcoin as a means 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.340
 of payment 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.920
 nothing obliges by 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.380
 accept and no one guarantees that they 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.119
 will be accepted in the future the 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.579
 bitcoin exchange is possible 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.979
 only between people who accept 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.720
 to use it we say it's a 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.210
 currency due to uses 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.900
 moreover the use of the euro is 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.140
 framed by centralized systems 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.650
 for example when he takes or scared too much 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.840
 valuable 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.520
 the European Central Bank intervenes 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.520
 to regulate these fluctuations 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.050
 bitcoin is based on a 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.240
 decentralized system 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.060
 its value therefore depends solely on 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.399
 supply and demand 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.770
 more people buy bitcoin more 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.570
 their value will increase loving people 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.140
 will buy more their value 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.319
 fallen 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.599
 so it's a very volatile currency 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.639
 Bitcoin was worth about 40 euros in March 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.609
 2013 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:17.930
 800 euros in November 2013 and more than 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.830
 480 euros 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.520
 beginning of June 2014 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.630
 otherwise in a centralized system 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.270
 the use of the currency is framed 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.850
 by rules for example in France 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.130
 in case of fraudulent use of his 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.840
 credit card the banks are 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.640
 obliged to repay us 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.560
 in a decentralized system like 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.150
 bitcoin in case of fraud 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.680
 There is no possible legal recourse 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.450
 but the user can 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.790
 take out insurance with 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.690
 specialized organizations to get 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.670
 compensate for any problem 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.890
 bitcoin conforms to the definition 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.450
 theoretical of money and is the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.970
 first money this meaning banks 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.290
 however, it still has some 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.290
 significant risks for users 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.620
 for that
