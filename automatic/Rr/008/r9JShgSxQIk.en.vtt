00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.120
 the game with the foot seems a priori the 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.940
 easiest way to advance in the 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.669
 rival field exert real pressure and 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.919
 continue the offensive movement from 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.959
 the tactical point of view its correct 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.540
 use towards the full player 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.960
 This is very important taking 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.750
 decision on what type of kick to use 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.370
 when and where to use it beyond 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.560
 foot employment the conversions behind 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.050
 the penalties decided upon to execute the 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.770
 sticks other types of kits are used 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.260
 during the general movement of the game 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.360
 rock roll is almost always used since 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.840
 a fixed or mobile training to mark 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.780
 points 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.340
 the click to load android is used more 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.440
 in the first moments of the matches 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.090
 to test the quality of the receivers 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.020
 that they have adversary at the bottom of the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.090
 court and to put the expression 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.800
 the diagonal click goes to the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.260
 backs of the wing open to search 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.300
 free spaces and generate uncertainty 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.130
 in that about the decision to go out to 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.950
 tick or delay by the 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.960
 possible click is also used to 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.570
 enable an unmarked partner in the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.760
 open close to the touch 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.590
 the trail manages to see cake is a 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.840
 alternative to generate uncertainty 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.460
 in the center of the court also at 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.710
 same as the previous one to beat 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.830
 fast and flat defenses and with spaces 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.840
 between barriers the kick to the box or the box 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.880
 constitutes a variant to exercise 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.009
 pressure on the blind wing inside 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.520
 for outside with a high probability of 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.130
 recover possession 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.799
 the kit between two defenders or click chip 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.630
 above or below is a solution 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.939
 to overcome defensive lines when 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.189
 there is numerical equality or inferiority 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.120
 looking for spaces and throwing in 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.340
 speed to support 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.200
 the dribbling of loose balls is 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.850
 used to carry the controlled without 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.030
 make mistakes until you can 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.000
 get up or lean on the ingoal 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.590
 finally the kick to the spaces to the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.960
 which is used to move away in the game 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.580
 from the field itself exerting pressure 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.340
 about the few players that are in the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.620
 zone and so eventually get a 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.620
 recovery or return of the ball 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.340
 do not
