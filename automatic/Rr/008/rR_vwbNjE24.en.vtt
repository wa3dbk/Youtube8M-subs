00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
preheating I have the same thing as

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.749 
preheating I have the same thing as
pound<00:00:26.990> spray<00:00:27.560> but<00:00:27.949> it's<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:28.249> store-brand

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
pound spray but it's the store-brand

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.689 
pound spray but it's the store-brand
which<00:00:29.210> is<00:00:29.359> much<00:00:29.720> cheaper<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:30.829> does<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:31.669> same

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
which is much cheaper and does the same

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.090 
which is much cheaper and does the same
job<00:00:31.999> as<00:00:32.630> pound<00:00:32.960> spray<00:00:33.350> I'm<00:00:33.620> going<00:00:33.920> to<00:00:34.010> be

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
to keep it from sticking it probably

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.810 
to keep it from sticking it probably
would<00:00:50.510> not<00:00:50.540> stick<00:00:51.110> anyway<00:00:51.650> in<00:00:51.920> this<00:00:52.130> pan<00:00:52.460> this

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:16.999 
I'm not doing measurement that might be

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:18.910 
I'm not doing measurement that might be
a<00:01:17.030> good<00:01:17.210> idea<00:01:17.390> but<00:01:17.780> I'm<00:01:17.869> going<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.619> go<00:01:18.799> ahead

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
a good idea but I'm going to go ahead

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.330 
a good idea but I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:19.249> turn<00:01:19.460> on<00:01:20.079> this<00:01:21.079> pan<00:01:21.409> here<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.829> get<00:01:21.979> it<00:01:22.100> hot

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
and turn on this pan here to get it hot

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.880 
and turn on this pan here to get it hot
so<00:01:22.700> when<00:01:22.850> I<00:01:22.880> put<00:01:23.210> my<00:01:23.240> cornmeal<00:01:24.049> mixture<00:01:24.590> in

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
so when I put my cornmeal mixture in

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.109 
so when I put my cornmeal mixture in
there<00:01:25.189> it<00:01:25.999> will<00:01:27.249> sear<00:01:28.249> it<00:01:28.429> and<00:01:28.549> make<00:01:28.789> a<00:01:28.819> nice

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
there it will sear it and make a nice

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.950 
there it will sear it and make a nice
crust<00:01:29.719> on<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.140> bottom<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.679> cornbread<00:01:31.960> I'm

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
crust on the bottom of the cornbread I'm

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.270 
crust on the bottom of the cornbread I'm
going<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:33.439> use<00:01:33.619> partly<00:01:34.280> Crisco<00:01:35.119> in<00:01:35.569> it<00:01:35.929> and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
going to use partly Crisco in it and

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.399 
going to use partly Crisco in it and
part<00:01:37.280> bacon<00:01:38.090> grease<00:01:38.389> this<00:01:38.719> is<00:01:38.929> from<00:01:39.170> where<00:01:39.380> I

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
part bacon grease this is from where I

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.480 
part bacon grease this is from where I
fried<00:01:39.829> bacon<00:01:40.219> and<00:01:40.700> had<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:41.450> grease<00:01:42.490> saved

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.330 
fried bacon and had the grease saved
from<00:01:44.240> frying<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:44.899> bacon<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.979> gives<00:01:46.189> the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
from frying the bacon and it gives the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.559 
from frying the bacon and it gives the
cornbread<00:01:46.759> a<00:01:47.090> really<00:01:47.569> good<00:01:47.780> taste<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:49.450> have<00:01:50.450> an

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
cornbread a really good taste I have an

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.139 
cornbread a really good taste I have an
egg<00:01:51.079> you<00:01:51.499> don't<00:01:51.679> always<00:01:51.920> have<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.459> use<00:01:52.490> an<00:01:52.850> egg

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
egg you don't always have to use an egg

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.840 
egg you don't always have to use an egg
but<00:01:53.389> it<00:01:53.509> does<00:01:53.719> add<00:01:54.109> a<00:01:54.439> richness<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:55.039> it<00:01:55.369> that's

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
but it does add a richness to it that's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.929 
but it does add a richness to it that's
really<00:01:56.259> good<00:01:57.259> I<00:01:59.709> have<00:02:00.709> some<00:02:01.069> buttermilk<00:02:01.429> in

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
really good I have some buttermilk in

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.830 
really good I have some buttermilk in
and<00:02:02.389> I'll<00:02:03.170> be<00:02:03.560> mixing<00:02:04.219> it<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.549> see<00:02:04.909> how<00:02:05.659> much

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
and I'll be mixing it to see how much

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.239 
and I'll be mixing it to see how much
more<00:02:06.289> buttermilk

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
more buttermilk

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:12.670 
more buttermilk
I<00:02:07.310> might<00:02:07.639> need<00:02:08.030> I<00:02:09.850> definitely<00:02:10.850> do<00:02:11.090> need<00:02:11.680> some

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
I might need I definitely do need some

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.230 
I might need I definitely do need some
more<00:02:13.069> I<00:02:13.430> don't<00:02:14.120> want<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.659> be<00:02:14.840> dry

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
more I don't want it to be dry

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.940 
more I don't want it to be dry
it<00:02:17.240> actually<00:02:17.750> needs<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.080> be<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.290> little<00:02:18.560> over

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
it actually needs to be a little over

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.690 
it actually needs to be a little over
moist<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:20.360> give<00:02:20.570> it<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:21.010> tenderness<00:02:22.010> when<00:02:22.580> it

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
moist to give it a tenderness when it

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.830 
moist to give it a tenderness when it
gets<00:02:22.910> done<00:02:23.240> so<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:25.550> need<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.910> little<00:02:26.300> bit<00:02:26.600> more

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
gets done so I need a little bit more

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.790 
gets done so I need a little bit more
buttermilk<00:02:27.290> just<00:02:27.890> put<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.250> in<00:02:28.400> unto<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.800> until

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
it is very moist mixing mixing well so

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.060 
it is very moist mixing mixing well so

it here because it fits exactly so the

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.200 
it here because it fits exactly so the
air<00:04:21.729> can<00:04:22.000> circulate<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:24.010> um<00:04:24.280> if<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:24.820> turn

air can circulate and it um if you turn
it<00:04:25.240> out<00:04:25.450> on<00:04:25.600> a<00:04:25.630> plate<00:04:25.960> immediately<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.800> bottom

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
it out on a plate immediately the bottom

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.330 
it out on a plate immediately the bottom
side<00:04:27.370> gets<00:04:27.760> soggy<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.600> going<00:04:29.530> to<00:04:29.620> stay<00:04:29.800> crisp

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
side gets soggy and going to stay crisp

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.000
