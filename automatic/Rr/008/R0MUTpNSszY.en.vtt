 the young high school student 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:19.149
 Nobody knows 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.549
 she does not ask lyon 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.379

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.609
 on a new music TV series 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.229

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:44.009
 when I'm afraid of no longer meeting human needs 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:45.379
 but there 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.110

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.419
 harder will be the fall
