crafting<00:01:13.890> recipes<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.540> realize<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.229> am

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
crafting recipes and I realize that I am

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.030 
crafting recipes and I realize that I am
made<00:01:17.280> way<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> MIT<00:01:18.570> much<00:01:18.899> of<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> stuff<00:01:19.530> eating

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
made way to MIT much of the stuff eating

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.810 
made way to MIT much of the stuff eating
this<00:01:20.100> stuff<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.520> my<00:01:20.580> heart<00:01:20.910> bar<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:22.550> first<00:01:23.550> off

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
this stuff on my heart bar so first off

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.020 
this stuff on my heart bar so first off
what<00:01:24.149> we<00:01:24.300> got<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:25.110> tar<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:26.100> center<00:01:26.729> V

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
what we got here is the tar the center V

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.020 
what we got here is the tar the center V
white<00:01:27.330> wine<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.020> that's<00:01:28.200> vertical<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.100> think

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
white wine so that's vertical I think

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.270 
white wine so that's vertical I think
it's<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:31.020> right<00:01:31.820> yes<00:01:32.820> then<00:01:33.810> we've<00:01:33.960> got<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
it's this right yes then we've got the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.340 
it's this right yes then we've got the
horizontal<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.720> as<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:36.990> see<00:01:37.020> whatever

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
horizontal and as you can see whatever

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.170 
horizontal and as you can see whatever
direction<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.040> place<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.460> from<00:01:38.670> it'll<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
direction I place it from it'll be the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.700 
direction I place it from it'll be the
same<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.600> isn't<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:39.930> Pistons<00:01:40.490> we've<00:01:41.490> got<00:01:41.729> on

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
same it isn't like Pistons we've got on

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.580 
same it isn't like Pistons we've got on
an<00:01:43.710> angle<00:01:44.220> top<00:01:44.640> left<00:01:44.970> top<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.020> go

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
an angle top left top right and go

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.550 
an angle top left top right and go
bottom<00:01:46.920> left<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.280> bottom<00:01:47.460> right<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.560> these

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
bottom left and bottom right and these

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.620 
bottom left and bottom right and these
are<00:01:49.740> kind<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.040> confusing<00:01:50.760> as<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.330> see

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
are kind of confusing as you can see

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.520 
are kind of confusing as you can see
like<00:01:51.900> this<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.650> this<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:55.049> if<00:01:55.080> this<00:01:55.350> is

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
like this one is this one so if this is

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.410 
like this one is this one so if this is
angle<00:01:55.890> bottom<00:01:56.220> right<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.240> should

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
angle bottom right then this one should

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.280 
angle bottom right then this one should
be<00:01:57.450> angled<00:01:57.900> soft<00:01:58.590> left<00:01:58.970> yes<00:01:59.990> well<00:02:00.990> I'll<00:02:01.140> keep

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
be angled soft left yes well I'll keep

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.690 
be angled soft left yes well I'll keep
in<00:02:01.409> mind<00:02:01.650> that<00:02:01.710> top<00:02:02.040> left<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
in mind that top left is the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.390 
in mind that top left is the
intersection<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.479> three<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.840> u<00:02:04.140> f3<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.979> evil

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
intersection of three is u f3 is evil

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.940 
intersection of three is u f3 is evil
then<00:02:05.549> um<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:09.269> example<00:02:09.360> if<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.929> wanted<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.679> I

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
then um so for example if I wanted to I

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.090 
then um so for example if I wanted to I
think<00:02:11.130> I<00:02:11.519> could<00:02:11.580> do<00:02:11.850> something<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:13.100> research

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
think I could do something like research

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.070 
think I could do something like research
is<00:02:14.519> I'm<00:02:14.760> sorry<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.269> is<00:02:15.330> taking<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:15.870> long

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
is I'm sorry that this is taking so long

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.990 
is I'm sorry that this is taking so long

16 harm um
now<00:02:42.569> that's<00:02:43.349> that's<00:02:43.769> this<00:02:43.920> point<00:02:44.189> our<00:02:44.549> this

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
now that's that's this point our this

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.920 
now that's that's this point our this
black<00:02:45.510> stuff<00:02:45.930> as<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.469> can<00:02:46.620> see<00:02:47.060> no<00:02:48.060> no<00:02:48.420> nothing

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
black stuff as you can see no no nothing

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.390 
black stuff as you can see no no nothing
on<00:02:49.109> it<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.560> um<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.750> now<00:02:51.930> we<00:02:51.989> have<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.319> set<00:02:52.560> how

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
on it and um so now we have the set how

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.300 
on it and um so now we have the set how
to<00:02:53.459> make<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.760> center<00:02:54.120> v1<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.689> have<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.930> put

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
to make the center v1 you have to put

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.699 
to make the center v1 you have to put
throw<00:02:56.310> at<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.549> top<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.090> think<00:02:57.439> Bonin<00:02:58.439> in<00:02:58.560> the

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
throw at the top I think Bonin in the

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.890 
throw at the top I think Bonin in the
middle<00:02:58.980> grabill<00:02:59.579> on<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.849> bottom<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.329> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
middle grabill on the bottom and the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.259 
middle grabill on the bottom and the
bone<00:03:01.109> is<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.409> weight<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.549> get<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.879> center

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
bone is the weight so you get the center

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.199 
bone is the weight so you get the center
v-line<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.019> if<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.680> put<00:03:04.950> do<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.519> horizontally

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
v-line and if you put do it horizontally

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.740 
v-line and if you put do it horizontally
you<00:03:06.269> got<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.569> horizontal<00:03:07.519> stuff<00:03:08.519> now<00:03:09.299> if<00:03:09.599> you

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
you got the horizontal stuff now if you

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.960 
you got the horizontal stuff now if you
want<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.049> do<00:03:10.969> angles<00:03:11.969> you<00:03:12.569> put<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.170> tar<00:03:13.379> oh

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
want to do angles you put the tar oh

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.899 
want to do angles you put the tar oh
there<00:03:14.970> there<00:03:15.689> I<00:03:15.750> think<00:03:16.200> there<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.920> they're<00:03:17.250> me

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
there there I think there and they're me

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.140 
there there I think there and they're me
that's<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.329> top<00:03:18.780> left<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:20.099> book<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.939> tar

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
that's the top left so the book the tar

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.690 
that's the top left so the book the tar
is<00:03:21.269> closer<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.629> the<00:03:21.780> top<00:03:22.079> of<00:03:22.109> all<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.680> do<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:23.549> you

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
is closer to the top of all I do if you

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.270 
is closer to the top of all I do if you
want<00:03:23.939> the<00:03:24.540> left<00:03:24.810> all<00:03:25.739> right<00:03:25.859> if<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.099> makes

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
want the left all right if that makes

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.119 
want the left all right if that makes
sense<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.359> it<00:03:27.480> gives<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.870> top<00:03:28.290> left<00:03:28.620> now

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
sense so that it gives you top left now

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:35.270 
sense so that it gives you top left now
for<00:03:29.790> top<00:03:30.419> right<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.870> do<00:03:31.049> this<00:03:32.209> um<00:03:33.889> then<00:03:34.889> for

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
for top right you do this um then for

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.849 
for top right you do this um then for
bottom<00:03:36.180> for<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.780> bottom<00:03:37.169> this<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.349> bottom

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
bottom for the bottom this is bottom

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.369 
bottom for the bottom this is bottom
left<00:03:38.609> no<00:03:39.060> that's<00:03:39.269> bottom<00:03:39.480> right<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.230> is

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
left no that's bottom right and this is

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.819 
left no that's bottom right and this is
bottom<00:03:40.709> left<00:03:41.180> so<00:03:42.180> I<00:03:42.209> guess<00:03:42.629> let's<00:03:42.780> make<00:03:43.139> one<00:03:43.680> of

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
bottom left so I guess let's make one of

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.430 
bottom left so I guess let's make one of
them<00:03:43.980> first<00:03:44.310> for<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:44.939> reason<00:03:45.419> I<00:03:45.720> don't<00:03:45.840> give

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
them first for the reason I don't give

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.569 
them first for the reason I don't give
me<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.590> second<00:03:49.010> yeah<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.040> don't<00:03:50.190> know<00:03:50.400> how<00:03:50.489> to

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
if that Officer lunch a hook now just

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.390 
if that Officer lunch a hook now just
put<00:04:26.849> just<00:04:27.090> replace<00:04:27.510> whoa<00:04:28.020> this<00:04:28.650> entire<00:04:28.979> middle

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
put just replace whoa this entire middle

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.730

line<00:04:29.580> with<00:04:29.880> um<00:04:30.150> yellow<00:04:32.240> for<00:04:33.240> now

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
line with um yellow for now

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.330 
line with um yellow for now
for<00:04:35.580> example<00:04:36.120> so<00:04:36.750> we<00:04:37.139> can<00:04:37.289> have<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.470> busier<00:04:38.009> road

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
for example so we can have a busier road

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.620 
for example so we can have a busier road
this<00:04:39.030> could<00:04:39.090> be<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.389> busy<00:04:39.810> road<00:04:40.020> than<00:04:40.259> the<00:04:40.380> best

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
this could be a busy road than the best

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.730 
this could be a busy road than the best
now<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.690> know<00:04:42.840> this<00:04:43.139> is<00:04:43.289> not<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.590> most

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
now I know this is not the most

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.839 
now I know this is not the most
interesting<00:04:43.889> stuff<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.759> watch<00:04:44.910> easy<00:04:45.349> but

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
interesting stuff to watch easy but

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.850 
interesting stuff to watch easy but
still<00:04:47.849> very<00:04:48.650> cool<00:04:51.259> and<00:04:52.259> that's<00:04:52.530> pretty<00:04:52.740> much

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
still very cool and that's pretty much

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.749 
still very cool and that's pretty much
the<00:04:53.009> mod<00:04:53.460> as<00:04:53.819> of<00:04:54.509> now<00:04:54.720> if<00:04:55.069> if<00:04:56.069> you<00:04:56.220> stuff<00:04:56.550> gets

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
the mod as of now if if you stuff gets
