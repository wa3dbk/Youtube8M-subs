00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.959
 hi friends of imaginary earth today 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.790
 let's introduce let's make a new 

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:13.270
 tutorial after so much time we're going to 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.490
 aromas started with tutorials about 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.430
 how to make home trees for 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.250
 scenography of warhammer mordéis or what 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.940
 to be 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.540
 war games in general 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:30.770
 it is very resultistic it is simple easy and 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:34.280
 quick to say how to get put together 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.920
 in one day to be 20 trees things like that 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.250
 or more depending on the capacity of each 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.250
 one 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.140
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.490
 I show that 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.980
 against branches 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.100
 true tree norms 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.320
 and with all these branches then you can 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.250
 do is look for the long and 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.250
 cut it 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.380
 as long as we want if 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.380
 now 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.880
 once we cut the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.799
 twigs what we have to do is 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.670
 a weight of fibrofácil of 3 millimeters 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:32.570
 until barbarian is impeccable we cut the 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:36.330
 piece as you can see here what 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.710
 we have to do is once we have 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.729
 what the tree will do 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.680
 We have to insert this gas 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.460
 as we do with a cutter or cutter 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.710
 as they say 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.350
 we took out tips as we did in the 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.350
 school the pencils exactly like that 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.190
 once we get the tip 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.179
 enough what we have to do is 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.420
 with a drill 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.700
 or screwdriver 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.950
 automatic we grab receives the edge 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.950
 easy and we do a drilling 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.810
 how easy from side to side if it's a wick 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.160
 fine each one will use what most 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.250
 like 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.490
 or what you have then we take 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.400
 the trunk and insert it 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.120
 in the cells in this way 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.120
 then 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.689
 we look for we grab in noise with a 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.689
 spatula like this 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.620
 we invest on the edges of the tree 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.620
 in this way 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:07.000
 with this we do that the way that 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.570
 are around the trunk of what 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.210
 would be the tree or the supposed tree that 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.880
 the rest 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:19.100
 irregular of the dam new grounds 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.100
 short irregular shape this yes 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.910
 there you can see 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.459
 a little 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.870
 tree 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.180
 quick simple and ready to play 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.730
 after all this you can do a 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.450
 lots of things like for example 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.810
 finish filling it all edges 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.920
 so that it does not look safe when 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.709
 we see it on the other side to make it 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.220
 well that is not so intern so that 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.379
 then the base is firm on tour and 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.180
 then you can paint and you can 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.180
 put foliage to those who are interested 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.050
 now bigger when I know all this 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.090
 let's move on to the base to continue with 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.130
 the completion and make a few hands of 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.950
 paint these trees that I'm putting together 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.410
 are for a good bite table like 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.880
 can see in the course of half 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.920
 hour or so 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.449
 to be doing little holes by cutting 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.729
 with the hand pieces of fibrofácil 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.189
 putting in your ear and placing the 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.259
 twigs I say in half an hour maybe 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:37.499
 something less this is the production that 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.499
 I achieved 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:51.159
 as it was said missing to give to a 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.159
 termination
