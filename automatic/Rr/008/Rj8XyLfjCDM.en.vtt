whatever and then there's a really weird
ones<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.750> know<00:00:36.870> some<00:00:37.079> are<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.469> kind<00:00:38.100> of

aqua<00:00:39.059> green<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.780> guess<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.260> match<00:00:40.440> toilet<00:00:40.920> water

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
aqua green I guess to match toilet water

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.529 
aqua green I guess to match toilet water
or<00:00:41.820> whatever<00:00:43.399> one<00:00:44.399> thing<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.670> want<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> make

or whatever one thing you want to make
sure<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.079> if<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.410> trumpet<00:00:46.710> player<00:00:47.390> you

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
sure of is if your trumpet player you

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.850 
sure of is if your trumpet player you
want<00:00:48.539> one<00:00:48.780> that's<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.170> cover<00:00:49.410> your<00:00:49.649> bell

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
want one that's going to cover your bell

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.639 
want one that's going to cover your bell
and<00:00:50.789> not<00:00:51.000> sink<00:00:51.420> inside<00:00:51.809> too<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.590> I

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and not sink inside too much and I

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.020 
and not sink inside too much and I
actually<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.640> little<00:00:53.910> bit

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
actually like one just a little bit

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.990 
actually like one just a little bit
bigger<00:00:54.270> than<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:56.640> would<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.850> something

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
bigger than this that would be something

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.580 
bigger than this that would be something
to<00:00:57.210> keep<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.420> mind<00:00:57.480> trombone<00:00:58.050> player<00:00:58.260> wants<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
to keep in mind trombone player wants to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.430 
to keep in mind trombone player wants to
be<00:00:58.739> bigger<00:00:58.920> than<00:00:59.010> this<00:01:00.020> there's<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.109> junior

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
be bigger than this there's a junior

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.329 
be bigger than this there's a junior
plunger<00:01:01.859> that's<00:01:02.100> smaller<00:01:02.460> than<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:04.100> this<00:01:05.100> is

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
plunger that's smaller than this this is

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.399 
plunger that's smaller than this this is
I<00:01:05.640> guess<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> regular<00:01:06.720> plunger<00:01:07.080> side<00:01:07.260> then

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
I guess a regular plunger side then

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.420 
I guess a regular plunger side then
there's<00:01:07.560> an<00:01:07.650> even<00:01:07.770> bigger<00:01:07.979> one<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
there's an even bigger one that the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.060 
there's an even bigger one that the
trombone<00:01:08.820> should<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.560> I've<00:01:10.560> seen<00:01:10.830> bass

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
trombone should have I've seen bass

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.960 
trombone should have I've seen bass
trombone<00:01:11.490> players<00:01:11.729> use<00:01:12.119> pipelines<00:01:12.960> and

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
trombone players use pipelines and

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.330 
trombone players use pipelines and
that's<00:01:14.970> kind<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.240> work<00:01:15.390> pretty<00:01:15.570> well<00:01:15.689> too<00:01:16.340> so

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that's kind of work pretty well too so

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.399 
that's kind of work pretty well too so
you<00:01:18.150> want<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.360> pick<00:01:18.479> yourself<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.990> plunger

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
you want to pick yourself up a plunger

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.179 
you want to pick yourself up a plunger
and<00:01:19.650> then<00:01:20.040> i'll<00:01:20.189> tell<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.580> how<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:22.189> to

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
and then i'll tell you how to to

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.980 
and then i'll tell you how to to
retrofit<00:01:23.670> them<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.479> makes<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> sound

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
retrofit them so that it makes the sound

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:48.399 
retrofit them so that it makes the sound
that<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.290> both<00:01:26.159> want<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.820> make

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.550 

now<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.740> see<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.840> when<00:01:51.840> when<00:01:52.289> you<00:01:52.380> don't

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
now you can see that when when you don't

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.620 
now you can see that when when you don't
have<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.770> hole<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.190> plunger<00:01:53.460> then<00:01:54.299> it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
have a hole on the plunger then it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.289 
have a hole on the plunger then it
changes<00:01:54.930> things<00:01:55.080> by<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.289> half<00:01:55.560> step<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.299> lose

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
changes things by a half step and lose

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.910 
changes things by a half step and lose
control<00:01:57.659> goes<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.049> upper<00:01:58.289> register<00:01:58.680> I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
control goes to the upper register I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.740 
control goes to the upper register I
start<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.640> splat<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.240> over<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.539> place

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
start to splat all over the place

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.870 
start to splat all over the place
anything<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.610> hard<00:02:02.789> to

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
anything like that and it's hard to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.999 
anything like that and it's hard to
control<00:02:03.179> so<00:02:03.539> now<00:02:04.080> I'm<00:02:04.170> going<00:02:04.289> to<00:02:04.409> show<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.950> how

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
control so now I'm going to show you how

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.930 
control so now I'm going to show you how
I<00:02:05.100> would<00:02:05.960> would<00:02:06.960> actually<00:02:07.519> work<00:02:08.519> out<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.759> this

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
I would would actually work out in this

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.920 
I would would actually work out in this
a<00:02:09.259> puncture<00:02:10.259> uh<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:11.880> see<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.269> we've<00:02:12.900> got

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
a puncture uh you see that we've got

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.690 
a puncture uh you see that we've got
this<00:02:14.540> plunger<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:16.350> has<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:17.600> hole<00:02:18.600> in<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.900> and

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
this plunger that has a hole in it and

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.690 
this plunger that has a hole in it and
I'm<00:02:20.700> going<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:20.910> take<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.390> scissors<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.670> poke<00:02:23.670> a

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
I'm going to take a scissors and poke a

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.960 
I'm going to take a scissors and poke a
hole<00:02:23.850> right<00:02:24.060> through<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.930> center<00:02:25.290> here<00:02:25.970> see

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
hole right through the center here see

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.809 
hole right through the center here see
if<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.060> can<00:02:27.180> get<00:02:27.269> through<00:02:27.330> there<00:02:27.750> there<00:02:28.110> we<00:02:28.260> go

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
if I can get through there there we go

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.059 
if I can get through there there we go
and<00:02:29.819> maybe<00:02:30.569> go<00:02:30.810> on<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.019> other<00:02:31.170> side<00:02:31.470> with<00:02:31.739> more

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
and maybe go on the other side with more

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.090 
and maybe go on the other side with more
than<00:02:32.220> with<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.640> knife<00:02:32.940> end<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.709> try<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.769> room

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
than with a knife end of it try to room

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.420 
than with a knife end of it try to room
it<00:02:35.280> out<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:37.590> should<00:02:37.799> see<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.010> pretty<00:02:38.250> big

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
it out you should see a pretty big

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.810 
it out you should see a pretty big
difference<00:02:38.610> when<00:02:38.940> we're<00:02:39.120> done<00:02:39.269> here<00:02:40.820> maybe

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
difference when we're done here maybe

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.910 
difference when we're done here maybe
you<00:02:41.910> can<00:02:42.000> even<00:02:42.150> cut<00:02:42.510> some<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.530> out<00:02:43.560> of

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
you can even cut some of that out of

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.190 
you can even cut some of that out of
there<00:02:46.489> see<00:02:47.489> people<00:02:47.840> actually<00:02:48.840> just<00:02:49.019> use<00:02:49.049> a

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
there see people actually just use a

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.310 
there see people actually just use a
large<00:02:52.010> drill<00:02:53.010> bit<00:02:54.680> now<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:56.010> can<00:02:56.250> see<00:02:56.519> I'm

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
large drill bit now you can see I'm

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.420 
large drill bit now you can see I'm
getting<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.410> rimmed<00:02:58.680> up<00:02:58.920> there<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.310> get

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
getting that rimmed up there you get

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.670 
getting that rimmed up there you get
this<00:02:59.579> little<00:02:59.870> little<00:03:00.870> tailor<00:03:01.109> man<00:03:01.410> it's

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
looks like see right through there and

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:49.470 
looks like see right through there and
we<00:03:29.360> should<00:03:30.350> have<00:03:30.500> a<00:03:30.530> difference<00:03:30.890> in<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.100> sound

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.810 

and<00:03:50.480> that's<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.780> way<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.530> know<00:03:51.650> i<00:03:51.680> would<00:03:51.820> i'd

and that's the way you know i would i'd

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.700 
and that's the way you know i would i'd
want<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.180> see<00:03:53.330> that<00:03:53.680> one<00:03:54.680> section<00:03:55.100> in<00:03:56.590> like<00:03:57.590> the

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
want to see that one section in like the

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.300 
want to see that one section in like the
chatter<00:03:58.010> section<00:03:58.970> or<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.180> crowd<00:03:59.930> scene<00:04:00.350> it'd

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
chatter section or the crowd scene it'd

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.850 
chatter section or the crowd scene it'd
be<00:04:01.460> great<00:04:01.670> if<00:04:01.700> it<00:04:01.940> if<00:04:02.240> it<00:04:02.750> sounded<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:03.560> that

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
be great if it if it sounded like that

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.300 
be great if it if it sounded like that
there<00:04:05.080> as<00:04:06.080> far<00:04:06.290> as<00:04:06.410> growling<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:07.010> a<00:04:07.040> lot<00:04:07.280> of

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
there as far as growling to a lot of

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.330 
there as far as growling to a lot of
times<00:04:07.520> people<00:04:08.410> flutter<00:04:09.410> tongue<00:04:09.680> into<00:04:10.250> the

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
times people flutter tongue into the

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.190 
times people flutter tongue into the
more<00:04:10.580> like<00:04:10.760> this<00:04:10.940> ah<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.910> this<00:04:14.120> that<00:04:14.540> gives

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
more like this ah and this that gives

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.789 
more like this ah and this that gives
them<00:04:15.380> a<00:04:15.470> growl<00:04:16.209> no<00:04:17.209> no<00:04:17.720> but<00:04:18.290> it's<00:04:18.680> actually

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
them a growl no no but it's actually

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:29.730 
them a growl no no but it's actually
easier<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:28.580> get<00:04:28.700> a<00:04:28.730> little<00:04:28.910> bit<00:04:29.000> better<00:04:29.090> sound

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
easier you get a little bit better sound

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.320 
easier you get a little bit better sound
when<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.830> do<00:04:30.950> that<00:04:31.130> that's<00:04:31.370> why<00:04:31.490> your<00:04:32.060> people

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
when you do that that's why your people

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.670 
when you do that that's why your people
like<00:04:32.480> Louie<00:04:32.690> Armstrong<00:04:33.230> you<00:04:33.470> know<00:04:33.560> they

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
like Louie Armstrong you know they

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.500 
like Louie Armstrong you know they
started<00:04:34.010> to<00:04:34.430> get<00:04:34.550> that<00:04:34.730> really<00:04:34.910> gravelly

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
started to get that really gravelly

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.480 
started to get that really gravelly
voice<00:04:35.750> because<00:04:36.530> they<00:04:36.680> just<00:04:36.830> all<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.220> soft

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
voice because they just all the soft

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.790 
voice because they just all the soft
tissue<00:04:37.790> in<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.060> back<00:04:38.210> of<00:04:38.360> their<00:04:38.450> throat<00:04:38.800> it's

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
tissue in the back of their throat it's

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.110 
tissue in the back of their throat it's
loosened<00:04:40.190> up<00:04:40.280> from<00:04:40.490> years<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:40.790> years<00:04:40.910> of

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
loosened up from years and years of

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.480 
loosened up from years and years of
doing<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.800> but<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:42.920> is<00:04:43.010> a<00:04:43.040> more<00:04:43.310> effective

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
doing that but it is a more effective

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.800 
doing that but it is a more effective
growl<00:04:43.970> this<00:04:44.390> is<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.930> little<00:04:45.110> bit<00:04:45.230> a<00:04:46.450> little<00:04:47.450> bit

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
growl this is a little bit a little bit

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:58.990 
growl this is a little bit a little bit
too<00:04:48.460> too<00:04:49.460> predictable<00:04:49.970> i<00:04:50.090> guess<00:04:57.250> so<00:04:58.250> again<00:04:58.520> you

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
too too predictable i guess so again you

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.570 
too too predictable i guess so again you
get<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.390> technique<00:04:59.990> is

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.470 

that's<00:05:08.580> what<00:05:08.700> we're<00:05:08.850> looking<00:05:09.060> for<00:05:09.090> in<00:05:09.330> that

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
that's what we're looking for in that

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.190 
that's what we're looking for in that
section<00:05:09.720> they<00:05:10.590> can<00:05:10.770> slow<00:05:10.920> it<00:05:10.950> down<00:05:11.840> that<00:05:12.840> I<00:05:12.870> was

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
section they can slow it down that I was

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.080 
section they can slow it down that I was
double<00:05:13.500> tonguing<00:05:13.710> in<00:05:14.010> moving<00:05:14.370> there<00:05:14.640> the

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
double tonguing in moving there the

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:28.250 
double tonguing in moving there the
plunger<00:05:15.660> at<00:05:15.720> the<00:05:15.810> same<00:05:16.020> time<00:05:16.200> but<00:05:26.990> you<00:05:27.990> think

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
plunger at the same time but you think

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.910 
plunger at the same time but you think
he<00:05:28.320> said<00:05:28.500> you<00:05:28.980> know<00:05:29.070> to<00:05:29.130> get<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.400> scream<00:05:30.000> um

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
he said you know to get the scream um

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.630 
he said you know to get the scream um
and<00:05:31.920> to<00:05:32.700> create<00:05:32.880> kind<00:05:33.090> of<00:05:33.150> a<00:05:33.210> vocal<00:05:33.630> effect<00:05:34.640> if

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
and to create kind of a vocal effect if

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.670 
and to create kind of a vocal effect if
you<00:05:35.730> study<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.140> plunger<00:05:37.140> players<00:05:37.410> of
