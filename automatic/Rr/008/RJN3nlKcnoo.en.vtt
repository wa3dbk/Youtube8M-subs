to<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.000> speed<00:03:36.270> is<00:03:36.420> actually<00:03:36.750> pretty<00:03:36.959> good

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
to the speed is actually pretty good

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.350 
to the speed is actually pretty good
it's<00:03:37.410> not<00:03:37.650> I've<00:03:38.459> done<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.000> know<00:03:39.120> I've<00:03:39.209> done

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
it's not I've done so you know I've done

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.150 
it's not I've done so you know I've done
some<00:03:39.570> tests<00:03:39.810> it's<00:03:40.170> not<00:03:40.440> catching<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.860> droid

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
some tests it's not catching the droid

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.600 
some tests it's not catching the droid
but<00:03:41.490> it<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.910> it's<00:03:42.780> in<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.020> ballpark<00:03:43.610> it's

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
but it is it's in the ballpark it's

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.100 
but it is it's in the ballpark it's
definitely<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.120> ballpark<00:03:45.500> but<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:48.930> see

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
definitely in the ballpark but you see

00:03:49.110 --> 00:04:01.199 
definitely in the ballpark but you see
that's<00:03:49.230> an<00:03:49.410> embeddable<00:03:49.770> flash<00:03:50.370> audio<00:03:50.760> player

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.059 

close<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:02.239> up<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:03.349> mean<00:04:03.769> basically

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
close that up you mean basically

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.039 
close that up you mean basically
everything<00:04:04.609> you<00:04:05.120> know<00:04:05.239> some<00:04:05.510> things<00:04:05.689> don't

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
everything you know some things don't

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.229 
everything you know some things don't
work<00:04:06.230> it<00:04:06.409> doesn't<00:04:06.620> play<00:04:06.890> all<00:04:07.219> flash<00:04:07.670> but<00:04:08.060> it

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
work it doesn't play all flash but it

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.630 
work it doesn't play all flash but it
does<00:04:08.480> play<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.140> majority<00:04:10.099> of<00:04:10.129> it<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:10.549> it

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
does play the majority of it and it

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.670 
does play the majority of it and it
handles<00:04:10.790> it<00:04:11.060> pretty<00:04:11.090> well<00:04:11.450> so<00:04:11.810> if<00:04:12.409> you're<00:04:12.650> a

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
handles it pretty well so if you're a

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.860 
handles it pretty well so if you're a
