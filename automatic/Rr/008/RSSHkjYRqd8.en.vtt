00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.300
 Hello dear friends I present you 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.680
 the 77 84 is the ultimate batmobile 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.410
 the year 2006 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.890
 it does not contain mini figures and 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.640
 contains 1045 tyler the age recommendation 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.870
 Lego is between 10 and 14 years old 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.420
 Unfortunately, my carton is already something 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.440
 but you can still the great 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.050
 imprint okay 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.750
 the carton has i think so too 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.460
 lego universe unique and we 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.820
 of course also show the carton 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.650
 once from the back always the construction of the 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.589
 sets number can look beautiful and 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.640
 of course, the other models 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.339
 the lego batman series 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.479
 the model is for a lego vehicle 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.839
 quite big 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.909
 It has a size of 45 times 15 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.810
 centimeters and a weight of anti 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.270
 two kilo 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.680
 it is very reminiscent of the batmobile 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.260
 the tim burton film from 1989 but with 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.330
 a big sign on the front 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.310
 which certainly bothers some but it is in 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.869
 the old batman comics to the 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.969
 Vehicles have been such a shield 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.979
 to have alan of course bullets 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.229
 should fight off and I have me 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.719
 made smart and a catwoman comic 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.009
 from the year 2004 found and that the 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.560
 number 35 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.600
 and there you can find that pretty much 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.119
 same vehicle as lego 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.770
 rausgebracht has on the model you can 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.780
 many nice details how to recognize 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.869
 for example the wheel caps with the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.020
 batman logo or on each side respectively 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.710
 a completely synonymous graz or 1 set of parts 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.929
 the one turbine then show 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.689
 of course, the low-lying headlights 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.509
 the on the mobile home of the old movies 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.479
 point out how and of course the 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.429
 big wings from the castings it knows 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.860
 Maybe you have the kites 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.010
 but I believe in black she gave it 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.770
 only in this model and here too good 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.020
 The turbines see the flames spit 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.450
 how of course the bet mobile from the 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.950
 older films the model has, of course 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.930
 also some great features 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.530
 For example, open now for the first time 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.960
 You can sit the roof on the dark red 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.470
 on which it batman nicely comfortable 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.470
 can make 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.130
 if you open the cockpit you can 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.780
 but recognize the steering wheel if you 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.090
 Unfortunately this does not move 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.790
 be the speech but the shield in front 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.320
 works with a jerk up and 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.050
 the turbines become visible 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.970
 Of course, air is sucked in to 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.970
 issue back properly before 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.690
 Now if you look at the top of the model 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.489
 you can see the many gears 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.840
 actually does not have any features 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.810
 just awesome if you have the 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.540
 wheels and everything moves 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.680
 finds the turbines working naturally 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.220
 also against each other and the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.690
 they all turn 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.350
 Let's take a look at the back of the batmobile 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.660
 on 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.220
 we can recognize the flames well 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.840
 Turning out of the top two of them comes 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.210
 now the rear axle 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.000
 or you start wheels in it 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.920
 just like the turbines are in front 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.480
 turn or turn the back now the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.790
 flames through the rear axle 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.250
 So you move on the vehicle now 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.030
 the table back and forth or on the floor 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:53.460
 the wheels turn in front and behind 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:56.190
 the flames in the 1045 parts are two 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:00.800
 Construction manuals contain the if one 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.800
 They also work upright to read 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.080
 The difficulty with the set was over 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.570
 especially the large number of black ones 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.290
 Stones as you can in the second guide 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.290
 can still see 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.200
 Here it gets a bit trickier 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.060
 the whole stones neat 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.560
 placement or to see where 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.740
 which now the limits here and there 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.070
 or the stones divisions demarcations 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.190
 not so well done in the instructions 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.020
 Here you can see the model again 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.870
 or the function of the model 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.300
 here is the romper respectively 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.000
 blue as always from the batman movie 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.300
 from 2005 the model is now from 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.620
 2006 what you build as an alternative model 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.140
 could be the value in the guide 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:59.540
 available and on the last page here 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:05.510
 are a few lego sets and the 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:10.130
 parts list is still an idea 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:13.220
 for a batmobile or for a motorcycle 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.160
 a bed bike so to speak but for that 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.110
 Unfortunately, no instructions so many 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.950
 thanks for the attention and me 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.950
 hope to see you next time
