 a continuation of dragon ball z created 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.309
 for the fans it is worth having made manga a 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.900
 French comics are the kids but the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.850
 comic is in a lot of languages ​​worth 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.730
 has managed to publish it in a lot of 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.329
 languages ​​with an image of other countries 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.339
 translating it and good for what it is for 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.690
 that you know a little bit of what is going and good 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.090
 in what is the manga is called dragon 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.399
 ball multiuniverso vale I'll leave it for 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.240
 here in the description box I'll put 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.840
 the link to the page 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.990
 where is the comic you can read it 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.990
 It's worth it, I've also sent permission 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.640
 to be able to double the voices of a 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.280
 animation of what is comic but in 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.860
 the animation blocks in a video that 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.149
 I had also made other fans and I 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.860
 I will put the voice to him so you will see it by 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.630
 my channel also all ways but look 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.460
 his comic because it's really amazing 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.070
 good as I said called dragon ball 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.520
 multi universe 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.530
 and what is it good to see for what purpose? 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.920
 a little bit in general it turns out that there is a 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.890
 obviously alien race no longer have 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.010
 created 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.670
 a martial arts environment that happens 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.770
 that everyone participates and that I say 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.780
 that not everyone all the universes 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.880
 rather it is like all the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.220
 universes that you are telling me I am 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.050
 well, it turns out that there are different 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.360
 universes for example is the universe 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.190
 where 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.760
 we are used to seeing 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.890
 dragon ball where it is stronger etc 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.940
 but nevertheless there is another link in another 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.230
 universe where a negligible change 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.030
 I am the least bit can change the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.600
 story for example there is in one where 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.600
 cell 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.760
 destroys bojan vale and kills him then 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.709
 what happens when the cell arrives and is 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.550
 the king of all that does not kill all the 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.910
 world over there is already another where vegetates 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.470
 and goku when they merge when they 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.500
 merge with the earrings because 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.930
 exploits the one that happens that do not get to 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.140
 separate and remain united forever as 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.459
 has been so they stay together to 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.310
 always then what happens because the 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.110
 object is 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.020
 the husband of chile and more than 1000 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:05.150
 Well, there is no question about whether others are worth 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.150
 that for example bar duch 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.800
 The matal king of jeta and gives time to 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.320
 stop freezer 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.890
 they finish with freezer all the have 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.020
 retained by the dominants of space 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.220
 and all that not in others where freezer for 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:26.310
 example is who reigns without being culé for 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.770
 defense and retreat 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.780
 Well, there are different stories or 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.940
 all unam and of course it is very strong that 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.360
 it is charged to everyone that we work 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.980
 let's say that in each universe it happens 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.650
 some different things than those 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.510
 we were in the funds are to see us very 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.879
 different 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.439
 for example that there may be more people 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.170
 strong than what we are used to 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:53.040
 to see the loosest others where by 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:59.569
 example killing is going fatal with me 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.569
 I do not know if you do not organize goku raked uy 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.200
 root as a vegetable as they form a 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.810
 good team there is no good is super 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.689
 well the truth is that I at night and 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.569
 one morning in the hours I practically 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.669
 I read it right away they are enough and peak 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.250
 pages at the moment assumes that the 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:25.150
 Monday Wednesday and Friday 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.300
 It's Friday and Sunday Perón 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.680
 and update with a page but good 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.090
 I eat what I discovered a very little 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.410
 not if they are still updating 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.780
 because also this out there that I already 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.660
 they will continue with the anime with the manga 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.770
 the truth is that it would be a bitch because 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.050
 would punish a lot because it hooks a 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.180
 heap and he really looks gorgeous to me 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.190
 I loved it 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.320
 the drawings are super well done and 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.539
 well in fact they have been nailed but 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.699
 nailed except some pages that are 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.510
 note that he encouraged another and I do not like 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.490
 own style 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.110
 but good because the story is very 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.360
 well I highly recommend you what 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.800
 ye see and read it quickly sl the 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.840
 true if you like that you read it right away 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.880
 and good the thin sheets because not the 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.470
 I think of all the very well I actually 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.030
 I started reading the first second and said 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.200
 well this does not have one and I almost take it 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.300
 until they told me he hears from a 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.830
 little bit more advanced a few leaves and you 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.230
 you will already know what the story is about and 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.600
 then they already explain it to you, it's like, 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.390
 they make you hard a scene ahead but 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.320
 back and they explain everything to you 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.320
 great is amazing 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.880
 and well I do not want to do much 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.220
 after I told you a little 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.700
 since buck there are different universes and 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.680
 they all meet in a championship vale 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.690
 where the dragon contribution 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.760
 you will see that you only have to 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.930
 steal truth you like it so good more 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.520
 clear in this video what I wanted was 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.510
 leave this comic for you to see 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.820
 because I know I have so many 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.980
 followers who like dragon and 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.430
 so I said then this I have to 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.440
 put let's go this I do not have good and good 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.140
 also say that for those who do not 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.160
 like to read anything that is already male 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.500
 you can upload an animation 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.320
 doubled by me it's worth with the voices 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.689
 imitating school 6 that I like that 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.659
 a lot to me 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:15.659
 and it's about me in parts 

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:26.429
 simply on the link and now they give you 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:26.429
 one thing to give a like
