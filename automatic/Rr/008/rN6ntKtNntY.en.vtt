00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
as you can see here it pretty much blew

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.590 
as you can see here it pretty much blew
his<00:00:32.070> brains<00:00:32.099> out<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.940> know<00:00:33.150> that's<00:00:33.330> kind<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
his brains out I know that's kind of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.120 
his brains out I know that's kind of
graphic<00:00:34.080> but<00:00:34.350> that's<00:00:34.560> what<00:00:34.740> you<00:00:34.830> want<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
graphic but that's what you want it to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.620 
graphic but that's what you want it to
do<00:00:35.310> I<00:00:35.340> promise<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.060> squirrel<00:00:36.330> didn't

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
do I promise you the squirrel didn't

00:00:36.630 --> 00:01:00.040 
do I promise you the squirrel didn't
feel<00:00:36.840> anything

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.300 

so<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.260> see<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.590> did<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.830> number<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.280> that

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
so you can see this did a number on that

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:31.910 
so you can see this did a number on that
squirrel<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:03.090> well

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.410 

my<00:01:32.920> shot<00:01:33.160> placement<00:01:33.490> was<00:01:33.910> a<00:01:33.940> little<00:01:34.240> off<00:01:34.390> on

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
my shot placement was a little off on

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.360 
my shot placement was a little off on
this<00:01:34.810> one<00:01:35.020> I<00:01:35.080> hit<00:01:35.350> him<00:01:35.500> at<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.710> base<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:36.220> the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
this one I hit him at the base of the

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.130 
this one I hit him at the base of the
skull<00:01:36.640> instead<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.270> at<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.480> skull<00:01:37.750> itself

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
skull instead of at the skull itself

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.980 
skull instead of at the skull itself
what<00:01:38.979> that<00:01:39.190> did<00:01:39.490> was<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:39.760> caused<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.630> bullet

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
what that did was that caused the bullet

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.100 
what that did was that caused the bullet
to<00:01:41.260> go<00:01:41.560> right<00:01:41.950> into<00:01:42.160> his<00:01:42.430> chest<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.150> it<00:01:43.870> blew

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
to go right into his chest and it blew

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.230 
to go right into his chest and it blew
his<00:01:44.140> chest<00:01:44.590> up<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:45.040> it<00:01:45.100> wasn't<00:01:45.310> obvious<00:01:45.550> until

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
his chest up and it wasn't obvious until

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.460 
his chest up and it wasn't obvious until
I<00:01:46.270> cleaned<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.780> squirrel<00:01:47.080> but<00:01:47.320> when<00:01:47.440> I

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
I cleaned the squirrel but when I

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.500 
I cleaned the squirrel but when I
cleaned<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.010> squirrel<00:01:48.340> his<00:01:48.610> chest<00:01:48.940> was<00:01:49.180> just

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
cleaned the squirrel his chest was just

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.960 
cleaned the squirrel his chest was just
totally<00:01:49.960> blown<00:01:50.200> up<00:01:50.790> unfortunately<00:01:51.790> that

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
totally blown up unfortunately that

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.609 
totally blown up unfortunately that
actually<00:01:52.360> damaged<00:01:52.869> some<00:01:53.050> of<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.229> shoulder

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
actually damaged some of the shoulder

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.140 
actually damaged some of the shoulder
meat<00:01:53.830> so<00:01:54.130> that<00:01:54.340> was<00:01:54.460> actually<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.850> little<00:01:54.940> bit

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
meat so that was actually a little bit

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.230 
meat so that was actually a little bit
too<00:01:55.300> much<00:01:55.479> power<00:01:55.780> for<00:01:56.290> that<00:01:56.619> particular<00:01:57.240> shot

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
too much power for that particular shot

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:14.600 
too much power for that particular shot
placement

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.580 

this<00:02:15.610> was<00:02:15.790> really<00:02:16.000> bad<00:02:16.330> shot<00:02:16.750> placement<00:02:17.320> on<00:02:17.410> my

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
this was really bad shot placement on my

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.490 
this was really bad shot placement on my
part<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.130> did<00:02:18.820> not<00:02:19.030> have<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.540> scope<00:02:19.810> zoomed<00:02:20.200> in

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
part I did not have the scope zoomed in

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.310 
part I did not have the scope zoomed in
as<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:20.830> should<00:02:21.220> have<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.880> thought<00:02:22.570> where<00:02:23.290> I

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
as I should have and I thought where I

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.350 
as I should have and I thought where I
put<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.860> crosshairs<00:02:24.370> was<00:02:24.550> his<00:02:24.730> head<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.270> in

right<00:02:27.730> behind<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.120> shoulder<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:28.990> can<00:02:29.140> see

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
right behind the shoulder you can see

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.110 
right behind the shoulder you can see
that<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:29.860> bullet<00:02:30.220> just<00:02:30.430> made<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> straight

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
that the bullet just made a straight
