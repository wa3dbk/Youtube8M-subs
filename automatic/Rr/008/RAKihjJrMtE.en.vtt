00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and get ourselves a real positive

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.799 
and get ourselves a real positive
performance<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.820> resort<00:00:39.120> today<00:00:39.270> obviously

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
wanted to bring players into this squad

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.619 
wanted to bring players into this squad
I<00:00:41.670> suppose<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.239> thing<00:00:42.390> bringing

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
I suppose it's one thing bringing

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.180 
I suppose it's one thing bringing
buddies<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.260> bringing<00:00:43.440> two<00:00:43.649> quality

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
buddies in but bringing two quality

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.190 
buddies in but bringing two quality
plates<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.730> insulin<00:00:45.480> God<00:00:45.660> gives<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> real

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
plates and insulin God gives you a real

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.600 
plates and insulin God gives you a real
boost<00:00:46.469> well<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> think<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.370> group<00:00:47.579> that

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
boost well I think with the group that

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.310 
boost well I think with the group that
we've<00:00:47.910> got<00:00:48.180> there's<00:00:48.360> no<00:00:48.480> point<00:00:48.750> bringing<00:00:48.870> body

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
we've got there's no point bringing body

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.139 
we've got there's no point bringing body
think<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.160> bring<00:00:50.309> quality<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.969> you

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
think you have to bring quality and you

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.750 
think you have to bring quality and you
know<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> players<00:00:51.660> want<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.230> get<00:00:52.680> help<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.610> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
was I mean what God came off he was he

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.929 
was I mean what God came off he was he
was<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.770> lot<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.979> pain<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.490> his<00:01:38.610> ankle
