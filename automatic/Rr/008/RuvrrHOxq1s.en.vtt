00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
thing it was pretty cool but in that

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.500 
thing it was pretty cool but in that
video<00:00:42.199> I<00:00:42.290> mentioned<00:00:42.410> that<00:00:43.010> I<00:00:43.430> was<00:00:43.640> kind<00:00:44.000> of<00:00:44.239> an

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
video I mentioned that I was kind of an

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.689 
video I mentioned that I was kind of an
over-thinker<00:00:44.930> I<00:00:45.260> would<00:00:45.620> take<00:00:45.890> a<00:00:45.920> situation<00:00:46.580> I

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
over-thinker I would take a situation I

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.119 
over-thinker I would take a situation I
would<00:00:46.760> just<00:00:46.940> overthink<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:47.780> or<00:00:47.930> over<00:00:48.199> analyze

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
would just overthink it or over analyze

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.609 
would just overthink it or over analyze
it<00:00:49.339> and<00:00:49.489> it<00:00:49.820> would<00:00:50.059> end<00:00:50.299> up<00:00:50.479> not<00:00:50.989> being<00:00:51.019> for<00:00:51.559> the

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:51.619 
it and it would end up not being for the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:54.250 
it and it would end up not being for the
best<00:00:51.769> like<00:00:51.949> sometimes<00:00:52.339> you<00:00:52.610> can<00:00:53.260> overthink

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
best like sometimes you can overthink

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.780 
best like sometimes you can overthink
something<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:54.799> it<00:00:54.890> turns<00:00:55.070> out<00:00:55.220> okay<00:00:55.519> it<00:00:55.610> turns

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
something and it turns out okay it turns

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.009 
something and it turns out okay it turns
out<00:00:55.909> fine<00:00:56.089> you<00:00:56.330> know<00:00:56.360> works<00:00:56.690> out<00:00:56.839> for<00:00:56.960> the

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
out fine you know works out for the

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.780 
out fine you know works out for the
better<00:00:57.170> but<00:00:57.769> a<00:00:57.830> lot<00:00:57.979> of<00:00:58.010> times<00:00:58.250> you<00:00:58.430> do<00:00:58.610> you

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
could happen just kind of started

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.399 
could happen just kind of started
getting<00:01:25.490> like<00:01:26.060> racked<00:01:26.420> up<00:01:26.600> in<00:01:26.780> my<00:01:26.869> head<00:01:27.109> and

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
getting like racked up in my head and

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.380 
getting like racked up in my head and
pretty<00:01:28.039> soon<00:01:28.189> I<00:01:28.399> would<00:01:28.520> just<00:01:28.549> talk<00:01:28.909> myself<00:01:29.119> out

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
pretty soon I would just talk myself out

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.090 
pretty soon I would just talk myself out
of<00:01:29.450> doing<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:30.109> wouldn't<00:01:30.409> even<00:01:30.560> attempt

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
of doing it and I wouldn't even attempt

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.859 
of doing it and I wouldn't even attempt
to<00:01:31.159> do<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.399> just<00:01:31.490> because<00:01:31.609> I<00:01:31.759> overthought<00:01:32.359> the

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
to do it just because I overthought the

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.190 
to do it just because I overthought the
whole<00:01:33.020> thing<00:01:33.320> on<00:01:33.729> now<00:01:34.729> more<00:01:35.060> relevant<00:01:35.840> I<00:01:35.929> guess

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
whole thing on now more relevant I guess

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.770 
whole thing on now more relevant I guess
is<00:01:36.520> freshman<00:01:37.520> year<00:01:37.789> of<00:01:37.820> high<00:01:37.999> school<00:01:38.030> there

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
is freshman year of high school there

if that would have amounted to dates or

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.520 
if that would have amounted to dates or
anything<00:04:20.820> like<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.150> but<00:04:21.870> you<00:04:21.989> know<00:04:22.109> just<00:04:22.140> the
