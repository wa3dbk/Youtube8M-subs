00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.799
 suggest making light nonetheless 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:11.490
 elegant hairstyle do it yourself 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.900

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.969
 ease of doing this hairstyle on 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.730
 do it yourself with medium-sized hair 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.280
 you don't need special hairstyle skills with 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.470
 the bulk beam is always obtained simply 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.590
 sometimes it is more refined but more often 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.110
 careless so let's get started 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.480
 hairstyle volumetric bunch we got 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.649
 you need to have a comb for the gum 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.470
 invisible hair 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.290
 or studs and of course the lacquer itself 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.190
 hair to carry this hairstyle on 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.020
 medium hair 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.380
 the first step is to split the hair 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.320
 into two unequal parts one in the frontal area 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.390
 other occipital forehead hair 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.280
 fix with a hairpin or 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.079
 invisible and in the back of the head 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.930
 form horse tail 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.239
 then sharing the resulting part of the hair 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.430
 on the strands we make easy bouffant for 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.320
 creating volume and using studs 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.770
 fix each strand on top 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.719
 we get a sloppy volumetric bunch now 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.670
 to perform this hairstyle but 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:12.249
 occipital under the horse tail 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.490
 gently pull the hair down for 

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:17.319
 creating smooth loops of hair 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.130
 Now we work with the rest 

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:20.709
 hair 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.039
 for this we divide them into three parts 2 

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:25.869
 temporal right and left and one middle 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.329
 right temporal part a little combing 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.939
 back and down and anchoring under bulk 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.189
 bundle the frontal part of the hair 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.889
 up and right towards the head and 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.529
 fasten let's do the same with the left 

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:41.319
 the temporal side is now left 

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:43.359
 perform the final touches and styling of 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:46.539
 cycle hairstyle on your average hair 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:48.999
 hands will be completed using fingers 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.399
 hands pull the cap hair forward now and 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:53.829
