00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
was fighting a Titan I guess I sort of

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.290 
was fighting a Titan I guess I sort of
did<00:01:51.520> but<00:01:51.550> you<00:01:51.910> know<00:01:53.700> finding<00:01:54.700> abnormals<00:01:55.150> are

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
did but you know finding abnormals are

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:03.360 
did but you know finding abnormals are
so<00:01:55.630> much<00:01:58.860> yeah<00:02:01.290> i<00:02:02.290> think<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:03.040> there<00:02:03.190> another

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
so much yeah i think is there another

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.990 
so much yeah i think is there another
caller<00:02:03.700> around<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.120> i<00:02:04.440> value<00:02:05.440> sure<00:02:05.830> that<00:02:06.610> again

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
caller around it i value sure that again

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.240 
caller around it i value sure that again
so<00:02:07.270> uh<00:02:07.380> if<00:02:08.380> you're<00:02:08.560> tuning<00:02:08.679> in<00:02:08.920> its<00:02:09.130> new

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
so uh if you're tuning in its new

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.470 
so uh if you're tuning in its new
character<00:02:09.670> going<00:02:09.880> yeah<00:02:10.869> see<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.620> later<00:02:12.480> rinse
