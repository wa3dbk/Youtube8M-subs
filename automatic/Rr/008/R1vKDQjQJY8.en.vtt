pure basics of all that it other
commands<00:01:19.380> are<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.950> expand<00:01:20.869> which<00:01:21.869> expands

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
commands are like expand which expands

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.700

commands to activate that rain but yeah

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.430 
commands to activate that rain but yeah
that<00:03:24.030> was<00:03:24.150> perfectly<00:03:24.660> on<00:03:24.900> cue<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.989> starts

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
that was perfectly on cue so it starts

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.890

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.680 
into my shelter and yeah guys so that is
basically<00:03:34.830> how<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.340> use<00:03:35.790> worldedit<00:03:36.239> to

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
basically how you use worldedit to

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.860 
basically how you use worldedit to
create<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.350> house<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:38.190> pretty<00:03:39.000> much<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.690> can

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
create a house and pretty much you can

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.770 
create a house and pretty much you can
use<00:03:40.050> it<00:03:40.080> to<00:03:40.380> do<00:03:40.739> whatever<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.190> want<00:03:41.630> you<00:03:42.630> can

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
use it to do whatever you want you can

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.580 
use it to do whatever you want you can
make<00:03:42.959> large<00:03:44.060> things<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.420> platforms<00:03:46.380> or

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
make large things of platforms or

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.570 
make large things of platforms or
whatever<00:03:47.100> you<00:03:47.250> want<00:03:47.959> for<00:03:48.959> making<00:03:49.290> roads<00:03:49.580> I

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
whatever you want for making roads I

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.759 
whatever you want for making roads I
think<00:03:51.060> there's<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.330> lazy<00:03:51.630> road<00:03:51.989> plugin<00:03:52.530> which

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
think there's a lazy road plugin which

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.370 
think there's a lazy road plugin which
is<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.130> lot<00:03:53.400> better<00:03:53.840> I'm<00:03:54.840> not<00:03:55.019> sure<00:03:55.200> if<00:03:55.260> that's

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
is a lot better I'm not sure if that's

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.470 
is a lot better I'm not sure if that's
for<00:03:55.650> single<00:03:55.950> player<00:03:56.040> as<00:03:56.250> well<00:03:56.400> but<00:03:56.700> single
