00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello everybody this video lesson was 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.620
 ready to talk a little 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.960
 chain and web 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.130
 main differences that people 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.070
 between them and what are all the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.720
 living things they need energy 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.730
 to keep in books can not 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.630
 perform all the functions of your 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.170
 body 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.930
 then living things can produce 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.750
 but others can only get the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.630
 consuming other living things 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.969
 in this relationship between food 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.090
 alive in the search for energy called 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.460
 whole food chain 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.430
 then begins with those living beings who 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.469
 able to produce the energy are 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.050
 called producers 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.180
 they can be both vegetables and 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.520
 the algae 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.190
 producers are able to convert 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.149
 energy into energy to be 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.809
 used his body and an animal that 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.080
 consuming these producers are called 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.840
 of primary consumers in the case here 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.600
 of the new food chain is an insect 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.350
 then the energy of the vegetable passes to the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.150
 insect and the arrow indicates the direction the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.150
 energy is passing 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:29.159
 then when another animal consumes this 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.740
 animal this insect it is consuming 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.770
 energy of him also so he is called 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.020
 consumer only now secondary 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.009
 Why are you consuming the consumer? 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.570
 primary 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.939
 then in this case the consumer 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.140
 Secondary our food chain is 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.680
 thrush 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.100
 just as the one who consumed frog will be 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.430
 being a consumer because why 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.420
 is consuming the secondary consumer 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.450
 what a bag 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.219
 that our food chain then 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:04.259
 tertiary consumer is the hawk 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:08.720
 so like I said to the food chain 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.970
 it is a relation of obtaining of energy 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.300
 in between 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.290
 the living then we start with a 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.010
 producer and soon after him whom to consume 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.530
 would then be consumers only that the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.140
 energy is spent by beings 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.070
 alive then the vegetable produces energy 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.170
 but it uses to grow root 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.840
 to bear fruit 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.840
 finally he uses his metabolism 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.390
 so what is left of that energy is that it is 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.730
 the next level 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.570
 chart for the consumer 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.180
 primary 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.459
 when the insect consumes energy from the 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.240
 vegetable it will be consuming energy 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:56.200
 less than that produced by him 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:58.510
 so the energy is going to be is to decrease it 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.970
 is being lost along the levels 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.330
 as we can see 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.630
 here the energy that the hawk consumes 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.880
 frog is already much smaller than that which the 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.200
 insect consumed on the principle of the producer 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.120
 whole food chain 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.959
 she then has three trophic levels 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.209
 Minimum 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.489
 then you have to have at least one producer 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.010
 You will always be those who will start 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.150
 the food chain and then 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.670
 consumers 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.090
 then we can have a consumer only 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.470
 but we can have several consumers 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.720
 secondary and tertiary education 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.060
 and so on 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.150
 only an element that we did not have 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.160
 made are still the composers 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.220
 should also be present throughout the 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.890
 food chain the decomposers they 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.230
 have a very important role because 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.840
 they can make the recycling 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.230
 matter in nature 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.360
 as well as the fungi and bacteria that are 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.850
 the decomposers of the environment 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.030
 they can transform matter 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.030
 organic matter in nutrients in salts 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.730
 minerals to soil that will serve one day 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.120
 for a producer to develop 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.120
 so when all living beings are 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.419
 he producer the consumer dies 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.170
 they are decomposed and that matter 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.750
 their 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.570
 now dead is transformed into 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.430
 minerals that lies on the ground and 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.420
 these mineral salts serve to 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.610
 the plant future will develop. 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.240
 then matter in nature has this 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.330
 recycling it never lost and fungi 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.780
 and bacteria play a key role 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.960
 in the whole chain 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.330
 now if we think a frog beyond 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.460
 of being consumed by the hawk he also 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.370
 can be consumed by a snake per 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.230
 example, we 're talking about no 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.260
 more in a food chain people 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.120
 is now talking about a food web 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.970
 because what I killed fed the 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.380
 definition of it is to have more than one 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.410
 food chain 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.240
 so in our new scheme that now 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.350
 a food web we can 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.020
 view two food chains 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.800
 food chain number 1 that we see 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:27.610
 is formed by the plant by the insect 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.890
 bag and the hawk and all of them being 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.520
 recomposed later by the 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:38.440
 composers already to the food chain 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:42.070
 number 2 it is formed by the vegetable 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.500
 insect by the sack and the snake and possesses 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.910
 all of which are composed of 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.400
 composers 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.250
 So when we can visualize 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.230
 more than one food chain in one 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:58.840
 schematic we are talking about then a 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:06:00.640
 web food stuff, that's it 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.340
 I hope it has become clear to 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.890
 difference between the food chain 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.920
 you can see this decrease 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:13.810
 is in energy along the levels 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:17.140
 and help you to understand 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.340
 as a whole is this cycle that happens 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.320
 in nature 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.320
 then that's it until the next
