00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.630 
together you want to eventually get to
the<00:01:59.619> point<00:01:59.740> where<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.009> can<00:02:00.159> do<00:02:00.280> this<00:02:00.429> move

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
the point where you can do this move

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.270 
the point where you can do this move
faster<00:02:01.179> and<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.450> faster<00:02:02.409> that<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:02.890> go<00:02:03.100> the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
faster and the faster that you go the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.550 
faster and the faster that you go the
smaller<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.880> step<00:02:04.119> becomes<00:02:04.300> so<00:02:05.229> if<00:02:05.380> we're

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
smaller the step becomes so if we're

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.859 
smaller the step becomes so if we're
going<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.830> travel<00:02:06.159> quickly<00:02:06.909> we're<00:02:07.659> going<00:02:07.780> to

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
going to travel quickly we're going to

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.499 
going to travel quickly we're going to
take<00:02:08.019> a<00:02:08.080> very<00:02:08.350> small<00:02:08.590> step<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:10.239> scoot

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
take a very small step and just scoot

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.850 
take a very small step and just scoot
the<00:02:10.660> feet<00:02:12.030> across<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.299> floor

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.399 

so<00:02:18.860> step<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.519> only<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:19.970> few<00:02:20.269> maybe<00:02:21.110> two<00:02:21.260> or<00:02:21.290> three

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
so step is only a few maybe two or three

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.380 
so step is only a few maybe two or three
inches<00:02:21.739> apart<00:02:22.189> if<00:02:22.459> you're<00:02:22.879> doing<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.209> as<00:02:23.360> a

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
inches apart if you're doing it as a

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.980 
inches apart if you're doing it as a
small<00:02:23.780> good<00:02:24.079> the<00:02:24.739> right<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:27.140> left
