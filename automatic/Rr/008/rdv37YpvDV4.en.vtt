00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.640
 I am often asked how I did to get to the so-muscled Twelve Foot Ninja sound. 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.040
 It was laborious. 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:27.740
 I had to climb the mountain to meet the oracle. 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:38.220
 Since it's not given to everyone, 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.320
 I suggest you use a noise gate 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.860
 and the Treadplate model: 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.060
 in fact, that's all I do. 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.280
 I use the default settings: 67 Condenser, 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.040
 412 Treadplate and Vintage 30. 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.760
 Joking aside, I'm not a guru in this matter: 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.320
 I'm just making sounds that I like. 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.160
 The secret is not to adjust the gain thoroughly. 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.260
 I usually rule it around 11am ... 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.700
 for clarity. 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.200
 The chords I play must ring 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.731
 like a chord and not like the sizzle 

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.531
 Massive of a badly tuned TV. 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.540
 I therefore decrease the DRIVE setting. 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.040
 I also attenuate the BASS setting because the sound contains a little too much bass and the tuning is low too. 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.660
 Say 11am. 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.180
 I tend to boost the MID and TREBLE somewhat by setting them to 1h. 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.920
 The PRESENCE command, on the other hand, is on 3h. 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.540
 The volume of the channel is set to maximum because this sound serves as a reference. 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:16.100
 This sound is a simple amp model with a noise gate in front. 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.000
 This is what happens when the noise gate is active. 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.780
 We always hear the movements of strings. 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.608
 I cut it: 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.860
 the sound of the strings is much more pronounced and you hear the sizzling of the amp model. 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.920
 That's the sound I want to delete. 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.600
 When we have very tight and perfectly synchronized parts, 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:56.520
 it should sound like a monk passing a needle through a glass bottle. 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.620
 I use the MASTER command to adjust the final volume. 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.180
 My heavy sound is very simple. 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.040
 The guitar model is a modified Les Paul. 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.880
 In Workbench, 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.040
 I slightly oriented the pickups to the bridge 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.300
 to have more bite on the low notes. 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.880
 The result fits really well with the bass 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.780
 bass and bass drum to give a median sound of incredible punch when he is strafing. 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.260
 I hope this will help you find your sound.
