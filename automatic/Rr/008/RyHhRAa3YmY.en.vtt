00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.940
 something in game although something that I doubt 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.729
 that will be the same or not, because we are 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.790

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.979
 what happens but in the pc version that 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.630
 will include all the same 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.090
 basic characteristics that come in the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.830
 playstation 4 and xbox world as they have 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.820
 given the official characteristics that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.330
 They are the following which are not 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.700
 recommended 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:36.020
 intel and 52 thousand 553 as 4 gigahertz 8 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.979
 gb of ram space of hard disk of 15 gb 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.229
 then also a graphics card 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:49.110

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.810
 the required rows 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:00.880
 really because I 'm not asking for a 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.939
 an intel core 2 a cook 6.604 a 2 like 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.070

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.650
 guarantee 5770 hd and nvidia gtx 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.739
 650 that's why 9 frames and in the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.720
 recommended this ask 160 I think that 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.459
 it will be a typo and you will say 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:28.510
 vice versa not the recommended 650 and the 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.750
 minimum required the 460 so this is 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.220
 the information and you know I hope that you 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.700
 have liked as always informing the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.069
 last and a small reflection that 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.489
 I wanted to say about the principle if 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.130
 You have a family member, a friend or someone 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.020
 he wants to be your help and you are better 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.800
 economically 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.350
 a small gesture can be very big 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.160
 for him a hug to everyone and see you in 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.160
