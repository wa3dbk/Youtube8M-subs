00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
where all the electronics are and I

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.259 
where all the electronics are and I
mounted<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.140> little<00:02:18.379> bus<00:02:18.590> right<00:02:19.489> here<00:02:19.519> with

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
mounted a little bus right here with

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.729 
mounted a little bus right here with
fuses<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.040> I'm<00:02:22.040> going<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.220> mount<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.790> relay

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
fuses and I'm going to mount a relay

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.869 
fuses and I'm going to mount a relay

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
sitting over here which pulls off the

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.140 
sitting over here which pulls off the
battery<00:02:26.269> and<00:02:27.109> you'll<00:02:27.260> go<00:02:27.410> from<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:28.310> relay<00:02:28.819> to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
battery and you'll go from the relay to

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.020 
battery and you'll go from the relay to
the<00:02:29.420> power<00:02:30.200> bus<00:02:31.810> your<00:02:32.810> hero<00:02:33.019> back<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:34.819> have

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
the power bus your hero back so I have

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.879 
the power bus your hero back so I have
my<00:02:35.209> fuse<00:02:35.900> panel<00:02:36.230> it's<00:02:36.349> actually<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:36.739> on

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:36.889 
my fuse panel it's actually just on

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.720 
covered up a little nut is back there
step<00:02:41.660> this<00:02:41.810> back<00:02:42.019> there<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.440> ran<00:02:43.220> two<00:02:43.430> lines

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
step this back there I ran two lines

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.870 
step this back there I ran two lines
purely<00:02:44.420> because<00:02:44.980> my<00:02:45.980> line<00:02:46.190> wasn't<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.579> large

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
purely because my line wasn't that large

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.970 
purely because my line wasn't that large
and<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.750> know<00:02:47.870> it's<00:02:48.019> not<00:02:48.260> hard<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.650> saw<00:02:48.799> it<00:02:48.859> and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
and you know it's not hard to saw it and

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.620 
and you know it's not hard to saw it and
remain<00:02:49.250> there<00:02:51.069> whew<00:02:52.099> I'm<00:02:52.430> sorry<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.940> relay

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
remain there whew I'm sorry the relay

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.309 
remain there whew I'm sorry the relay
sitting<00:02:53.989> here<00:02:55.180> just<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.239> ground<00:02:56.450> then<00:02:57.139> of

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
sitting here just the ground then of

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.030 
sitting here just the ground then of
course<00:02:57.500> not<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:59.319> this<00:03:00.319> is<00:03:00.500> essentially<00:03:00.859> the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
course not and this is essentially the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.409 
course not and this is essentially the
fuse<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.310> will<00:03:01.549> set<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.349> total<00:03:03.349> capacity<00:03:03.889> of

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
fuse that will set the total capacity of

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.580 
fuse that will set the total capacity of
the<00:03:05.419> system<00:03:05.810> now<00:03:06.169> I'm<00:03:06.230> going<00:03:06.349> to<00:03:06.410> start

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
the system now I'm going to start

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.240 
the system now I'm going to start
putting<00:03:06.799> things<00:03:07.099> like<00:03:07.250> my<00:03:07.730> GPS<00:03:09.010> heated<00:03:10.010> grips

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
putting things like my GPS heated grips

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.990 
putting things like my GPS heated grips
get<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.150> connected<00:03:11.359> in<00:03:12.609> alright<00:03:13.609> we're<00:03:13.819> back

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
get it connected in alright we're back

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.080 
get it connected in alright we're back
once<00:03:14.209> again<00:03:15.310> how<00:03:16.310> much<00:03:16.459> wrapped<00:03:16.790> up<00:03:16.910> our

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
once again how much wrapped up our

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.490 
once again how much wrapped up our
wiring<00:03:17.299> easy<00:03:17.599> to<00:03:17.780> clean<00:03:17.989> up<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.230> few<00:03:18.410> more

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
wiring easy to clean up a few more

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.339 
wiring easy to clean up a few more
things<00:03:18.799> here<00:03:19.030> but<00:03:20.030> essentially<00:03:20.599> what<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.260> have

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
things here but essentially what I have

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.210 
things here but essentially what I have
is<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.599> fuse<00:03:23.599> box<00:03:23.750> which<00:03:24.049> is<00:03:24.139> actually<00:03:24.410> taped<00:03:24.980> on

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
is a fuse box which is actually taped on

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.860 
is a fuse box which is actually taped on
there<00:03:25.400> with<00:03:25.549> some<00:03:25.579> velcro<00:03:26.090> tape<00:03:26.269> but<00:03:26.419> I<00:03:26.510> threw

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
there with some velcro tape but I threw

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.030 
there with some velcro tape but I threw
a<00:03:26.930> strap<00:03:27.260> in<00:03:27.440> there<00:03:27.590> just<00:03:27.739> for<00:03:27.859> good<00:03:27.980> measure

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
a strap in there just for good measure

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.420 
a strap in there just for good measure
it's<00:03:29.000> going<00:03:29.269> nowhere<00:03:30.099> this<00:03:31.099> is<00:03:31.160> actually<00:03:31.370> my

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
it's going nowhere this is actually my

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.050 
it's going nowhere this is actually my
grounding<00:03:31.849> point<00:03:32.060> that<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.810> use<00:03:33.019> for<00:03:33.290> all<00:03:33.349> the

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
grounding point that I use for all the

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.860 
grounding point that I use for all the
connections<00:03:35.060> on<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.269> fuse<00:03:35.480> box<00:03:35.660> that

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
connections on the fuse box that

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.589 
connections on the fuse box that
actually<00:03:35.959> needed<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.349> ground<00:03:36.620> other<00:03:36.829> places

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
actually needed to ground other places

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.349 
actually needed to ground other places
where<00:03:38.599> I<00:03:39.049> put<00:03:39.410> my<00:03:39.440> grounds<00:03:40.000> spread<00:03:41.000> out<00:03:41.150> I'm

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
where I put my grounds spread out I'm

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.910 
where I put my grounds spread out I'm
going<00:03:41.539> to<00:03:41.630> get<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.650> um

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
going to get a um

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.400
