00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
gonna do a rainbow pattern so I'm gonna

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.689 
gonna do a rainbow pattern so I'm gonna
start<00:00:56.980> with<00:00:57.309> pink<00:01:01.830> you<00:01:02.830> just<00:01:03.010> kind<00:01:03.220> of<00:01:03.280> slather

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
all the way around the star until you

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.109 
all the way around the star until you
have<00:01:47.110> about<00:01:47.380> four<00:01:47.950> layers<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.460> tissue<00:01:48.759> paper

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
have about four layers of tissue paper

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.240 
have about four layers of tissue paper
on<00:01:49.240> there<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.909> keep<00:01:52.090> going<00:01:52.149> and<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.920> we'll<00:01:54.100> go

on there so keep going and then we'll go
on<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.460> next<00:01:54.700> step<00:01:55.259> okay<00:01:56.259> so<00:01:56.320> I<00:01:56.829> finished

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
on to the next step okay so I finished

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.880 
on to the next step okay so I finished
paper<00:01:58.600> machine<00:01:59.110> I<00:01:59.970> covered<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.090> whole<00:02:01.119> thing

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
paper machine I covered the whole thing

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.240 
paper machine I covered the whole thing
I'm<00:02:02.890> not<00:02:03.100> sure<00:02:03.280> how<00:02:03.520> many<00:02:03.580> layers<00:02:03.970> I<00:02:04.330> did<00:02:04.600> I

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
I'm not sure how many layers I did I

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.370 
I'm not sure how many layers I did I
actually<00:02:06.250> lost<00:02:06.640> track<00:02:06.939> but<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.929> more<00:02:08.140> layers

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
actually lost track but the more layers

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.550 
actually lost track but the more layers
that<00:02:08.590> you<00:02:08.709> put<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.789> better<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.300> will<00:02:10.479> be<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:10.929> if

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
that you put the better it will be so if

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.320 
that you put the better it will be so if
you<00:02:11.650> think<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.010> have<00:02:12.130> enough<00:02:12.250> layers<00:02:12.580> go

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
you think you have enough layers go

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.460 
you think you have enough layers go
ahead<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.660> do<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.900> one<00:02:14.049> more<00:02:14.080> layer<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:16.470> we're

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
ahead and do it one more layer and we're

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.250 
ahead and do it one more layer and we're
just<00:02:17.620> gonna<00:02:17.769> wait<00:02:18.010> for<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.430> dry<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:19.260> then

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
just gonna wait for that to dry and then

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.740 
just gonna wait for that to dry and then
we'll<00:02:20.440> move<00:02:20.680> on<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:20.950> our<00:02:21.100> next<00:02:21.250> step

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.510 

all<00:02:28.750> right<00:02:28.959> when<00:02:29.110> it's<00:02:29.290> dry<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.950> should<00:02:30.310> look

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
all right when it's dry it should look

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.430 
all right when it's dry it should look
something<00:02:30.790> like<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:35.110> next<00:02:35.349> thing

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
something like this and the next thing

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.350 
something like this and the next thing
we<00:02:35.530> need<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.709> do<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.250> let<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.670> air<00:02:36.819> out<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.120> the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
we need to do is let the air out of the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.030 
we need to do is let the air out of the
balloon<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:37.810> I'm<00:02:38.200> just<00:02:38.380> gonna<00:02:38.470> use<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.739> needle

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
balloon so I'm just gonna use a needle

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.190 
balloon so I'm just gonna use a needle

gonna<00:02:41.319> poke<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.920> hole<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.760> balloon<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.209> let

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
gonna poke a hole in the balloon and let

00:02:43.450 --> 00:03:00.620 
gonna poke a hole in the balloon and let
it<00:02:43.569> deflate<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.970> just<00:02:58.209> let<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.450> deflate
