00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.370 

now<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.060> think<00:00:18.240> my<00:00:18.539> position<00:00:18.689> is<00:00:19.050> getting

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
now I think my position is getting

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.919 
now I think my position is getting
seriously<00:00:19.890> better

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:23.929 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.150 

he<00:00:24.929> was<00:00:25.050> also<00:00:25.230> spending<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.859> lot<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.009> time

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
he was also spending a lot of time

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.430 
he was also spending a lot of time
around<00:00:26.640> here<00:00:30.710> yeah<00:00:31.790> 9:35<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.230> think<00:00:34.230> that's

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
around here yeah 9:35 I think that's

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.009 
around here yeah 9:35 I think that's
also<00:00:34.620> bad<00:00:34.890> move<00:00:35.129> the<00:00:35.850> night<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.510> not<00:00:36.720> doing

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
also bad move the night is not doing

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:42.439 
also bad move the night is not doing
much<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:40.579> therefore<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:41.909> at<00:00:42.300> least

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
much here and therefore it is at least

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:55.670 
much here and therefore it is at least
pushing<00:00:42.930> six<00:00:50.839> I<00:00:52.729> could<00:00:53.729> have<00:00:54.049> if<00:00:55.049> I<00:00:55.229> played<00:00:55.439> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
pushing six I could have if I played and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.280 
pushing six I could have if I played and
I<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.670> four<00:00:57.000> hair<00:00:57.269> then<00:00:57.689> the<00:00:57.809> point<00:00:58.019> is<00:00:58.170> that

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
I see four hair then the point is that

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.710 
I see four hair then the point is that
it<00:00:58.470> takes<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.070> Ruby<00:00:59.309> eight<00:00:59.610> with<00:00:59.970> some

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
it takes and Ruby eight with some

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:23.020 
it takes and Ruby eight with some
confidence<00:01:03.229> that<00:01:05.450> thanks<00:01:20.659> yeah

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
confidence that thanks yeah

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.510 
confidence that thanks yeah
here<00:01:24.030> I'm<00:01:24.329> obviously<00:01:24.780> better<00:01:25.469> after<00:01:26.069> almost

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
here I'm obviously better after almost

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
here I'm obviously better after almost
any<00:01:26.759> move<00:01:27.590> but<00:01:29.359> but<00:01:30.359> it's<00:01:30.539> maybe<00:01:30.929> not<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.350> easy

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
any move but but it's maybe not so easy

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.039 
any move but but it's maybe not so easy
to<00:01:31.799> win<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.609> it's<00:01:33.179> the<00:01:33.329> time<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.539> play<00:01:33.869> Bishop

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049

act one way and night for episode I

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.239 
act one way and night for episode I
calculated<00:01:38.609> how<00:01:39.389> calculated<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.560> should

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:44.029 
calculated how calculated that I should
be<00:01:41.369> winning<00:01:41.579> after<00:01:41.819> night<00:01:42.090> c4<00:01:42.569> so<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.319> didn't

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
be winning after night c4 so I didn't

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.680 
be winning after night c4 so I didn't
see<00:01:44.189> one<00:01:44.369> not<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.850> go

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.100 

yes<00:01:51.370> looks<00:01:52.370> like<00:01:52.430> this<00:01:52.760> hey<00:01:53.090> seven<00:01:53.480> if<00:01:53.630> he<00:01:53.840> goes

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
yes looks like this hey seven if he goes

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.540 
yes looks like this hey seven if he goes
to<00:01:54.290> work<00:01:55.930> h7<00:01:56.930> then<00:01:57.260> I<00:01:57.410> I<00:01:57.680> think<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.160> can<00:01:58.340> sync

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
to work h7 then I I think I can sync

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.960 
to work h7 then I I think I can sync
with<00:01:58.610> Larry<00:01:58.910> Bishop<00:01:59.210> e5<00:01:59.540> and<00:02:00.280> takes<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:01.670> didn't

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
with Larry Bishop e5 and takes I didn't

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.320 
with Larry Bishop e5 and takes I didn't
take<00:02:02.360> on<00:02:02.540> v2<00:02:02.780> probably<00:02:03.500> or<00:02:03.680> just<00:02:04.430> by<00:02:04.610> King<00:02:04.820> e7

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
take on v2 probably or just by King e7

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.790 
take on v2 probably or just by King e7
when<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.830> bishop<00:02:07.190> is<00:02:07.340> probably<00:02:07.730> gonna<00:02:07.940> fall

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
when the bishop is probably gonna fall

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.000 
when the bishop is probably gonna fall
or<00:02:09.800> at<00:02:10.520> least<00:02:10.790> his<00:02:10.970> screen<00:02:11.360> sizes<00:02:12.010> falling

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
or at least his screen sizes falling

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:24.850 
or at least his screen sizes falling
apart<00:02:13.280> okay<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:20.530> -<00:02:21.530> okay<00:02:22.160> no<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.500> repeat<00:02:24.500> -<00:02:24.680> then

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
apart okay so - okay no I repeat - then

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.620 
apart okay so - okay no I repeat - then
he<00:02:24.950> can<00:02:25.130> check<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.580> take<00:02:25.820> ownership<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.480> this

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
he can check and take ownership so this

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.150 
he can check and take ownership so this
I<00:02:26.870> cannot<00:02:27.080> do<00:02:27.320> my<00:02:29.020> p2<00:02:30.020> was<00:02:30.230> supposed<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.920> fall

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.820 
I cannot do my p2 was supposed to fall
but<00:02:31.510> now<00:02:32.510> at<00:02:32.660> least<00:02:32.840> she<00:02:33.170> has<00:02:33.320> something<00:02:33.800> to

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
yeah here we actually resigned I

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.280 
yeah here we actually resigned I
consider<00:03:01.820> my<00:03:02.000> position<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.750> be<00:03:02.900> winning

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
consider my position to be winning

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.860 
consider my position to be winning
because<00:03:03.680> I'm<00:03:04.040> winning<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:04.640> bishop<00:03:04.970> but<00:03:05.600> I

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
because I'm winning the bishop but I

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.200 
because I'm winning the bishop but I
thought<00:03:06.320> you<00:03:06.470> were<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.650> best<00:03:06.860> try<00:03:09.730> with<00:03:10.730> maybe

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
thought you were the best try with maybe

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:27.010 
thought you were the best try with maybe
a<00:03:11.330> rook<00:03:11.600> eight<00:03:11.840> five<00:03:13.420> six<00:03:15.400> then<00:03:17.050> okay<00:03:25.900> then<00:03:26.900> I'm

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
a rook eight five six then okay then I'm

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.710 
a rook eight five six then okay then I'm
looking<00:03:27.200> at<00:03:27.530> seven<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:29.350> check<00:03:30.350> then<00:03:30.680> King<00:03:30.950> t6

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
looking at seven and check then King t6

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:43.440 
looking at seven and check then King t6
by<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.780> way<00:03:35.170> you<00:03:36.170> could<00:03:36.350> also<00:03:36.580> try<00:03:39.280> okay<00:03:40.280> fine

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.830 

then<00:03:44.450> I<00:03:44.990> wasn't<00:03:46.000> entirely<00:03:47.000> sure<00:03:47.180> what<00:03:47.570> to<00:03:47.690> do

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
then I wasn't entirely sure what to do

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.170 
then I wasn't entirely sure what to do
it<00:03:48.200> seemed<00:03:48.380> to<00:03:48.530> me<00:03:48.650> that<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.890> best<00:03:49.040> was<00:03:52.180> text

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
it seemed to me that the best was text

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.370 
it seemed to me that the best was text
and<00:03:54.050> now<00:03:54.590> vision<00:03:54.950> PA<00:03:55.130> because<00:03:55.820> Bishop<00:03:56.570> d6<00:03:56.990> and

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
and now vision PA because Bishop d6 and

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.290 
and now vision PA because Bishop d6 and
c6<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:59.000> this<00:04:00.460> five<00:04:01.460> and<00:04:01.490> it<00:04:01.820> seems<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.150> me<00:04:02.270> that

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
c6 and this five and it seems to me that

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.060 
c6 and this five and it seems to me that
they<00:04:02.570> would<00:04:02.690> say<00:04:03.140> this<00:04:03.290> bishop<00:04:03.620> because<00:04:03.950> it

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
they would say this bishop because it

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:16.510 
they would say this bishop because it
has<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.550> e4<00:04:04.970> square<00:04:12.190> so<00:04:13.630> I<00:04:14.630> was<00:04:15.250> interning<00:04:16.250> to

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
has the e4 square so I was interning to

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.950 
has the e4 square so I was interning to
play<00:04:16.700> Bishop<00:04:16.880> PA<00:04:17.210> instead

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.279 

and<00:04:23.350> now<00:04:23.889> I<00:04:23.919> cannot<00:04:24.280> see<00:04:24.610> any<00:04:24.850> way<00:04:25.840> for<00:04:26.110> him<00:04:26.229> to

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
and now I cannot see any way for him to

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:35.779 
and now I cannot see any way for him to
save<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.740> game<00:04:27.810> Rick<00:04:28.810> CI<00:04:29.100> 7<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:33.389> yeah<00:04:34.419> u5<00:04:35.350> I

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
save the game Rick CI 7 and yeah u5 I

00:04:35.789 --> 00:05:01.290 
save the game Rick CI 7 and yeah u5 I
guess<00:04:36.789> I<00:04:36.910> can<00:04:37.090> simply<00:04:37.509> take<00:04:59.699> so<00:05:00.699> yeah<00:05:00.849> I<00:05:01.120> think

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
guess I can simply take so yeah I think

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.360 
guess I can simply take so yeah I think
it<00:05:01.630> was<00:05:02.160> quite<00:05:03.160> lost<00:05:03.430> in<00:05:03.610> any<00:05:03.759> case<00:05:04.000> but<00:05:05.370> that

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
it was quite lost in any case but that

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.999 
it was quite lost in any case but that
is<00:05:06.520> our<00:05:06.669> tried<00:05:06.880> for<00:05:07.150> life<00:05:07.300> okay<00:05:07.599> this<00:05:08.470> is<00:05:08.620> sort

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
say this year well I think I would be

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.909 
say this year well I think I would be
very<00:05:20.139> happy<00:05:20.440> if<00:05:20.620> I<00:05:20.919> make<00:05:21.160> up<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.520> score<00:05:21.970> and

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
very happy if I make up the score and

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.580 
very happy if I make up the score and
when<00:05:23.919> I<00:05:23.949> win<00:05:24.160> in<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.400> first<00:05:24.580> round<00:05:24.729> that's

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
when I win in the first round that's

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:33.570 
when I win in the first round that's
yeah<00:05:26.590> I<00:05:26.620> guess<00:05:26.830> my<00:05:27.070> mid<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:29.490> know<00:05:30.490> I<00:05:32.430> hope<00:05:33.430> to

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
yeah I guess my mid you know I hope to

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.719 
yeah I guess my mid you know I hope to
face<00:05:33.789> the<00:05:34.120> tournament<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:35.130> be<00:05:36.130> happy<00:05:36.340> with<00:05:36.580> my

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.870 
places and I mean compared to last there
at<00:05:41.590> least<00:05:42.840> when<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:43.960> wasn't<00:05:44.139> very<00:05:44.349> happy

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
at least when I wasn't very happy

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.100 
at least when I wasn't very happy
well<00:05:45.880> but<00:05:46.060> it<00:05:46.210> results<00:05:46.599> for<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:46.780> rest<00:05:46.900> of<00:05:46.990> the

where he lost the thread but from

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.140 
where he lost the thread but from
looking<00:06:30.590> at<00:06:30.770> this<00:06:30.890> game<00:06:31.070> again<00:06:31.340> somewhere

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
looking at this game again somewhere

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.800 
looking at this game again somewhere
around<00:06:32.240> 54<00:06:32.960> and<00:06:33.080> at<00:06:33.170> age<00:06:33.290> 5<00:06:33.560> yes<00:06:34.570> you<00:06:35.570> know<00:06:35.660> at

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
around 54 and at age 5 yes you know at

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.320 
around 54 and at age 5 yes you know at
this<00:06:35.960> point<00:06:36.500> the<00:06:37.010> position<00:06:37.430> was<00:06:37.580> probably

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
this point the position was probably

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.670 
this point the position was probably
equal<00:06:38.750> to<00:06:39.020> critical<00:06:39.680> for<00:06:40.190> him<00:06:40.930> so<00:06:41.930> in<00:06:42.410> a<00:06:42.500> very

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
equal to critical for him so in a very

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.450 
equal to critical for him so in a very
short<00:06:42.800> time<00:06:43.040> yes<00:06:44.710> we<00:06:45.710> may<00:06:45.800> be<00:06:45.980> looking<00:06:46.280> back

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
short time yes we may be looking back

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.820 
short time yes we may be looking back
you<00:06:46.640> shouldn't<00:06:46.850> even<00:06:47.120> have<00:06:47.240> taken<00:06:47.660> it<00:06:47.870> 86<00:06:48.530> but

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
you shouldn't even have taken it 86 but

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.670 
you shouldn't even have taken it 86 but
I'm<00:06:49.340> not<00:06:49.550> sure<00:06:49.730> about<00:06:49.850> this<00:06:50.350> if<00:06:51.350> you<00:06:51.560> were

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
I'm not sure about this if you were

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.370 
I'm not sure about this if you were
playing<00:06:51.920> White's<00:06:52.610> position<00:06:52.820> at<00:06:53.240> the<00:06:53.360> end<00:06:53.510> you

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
playing White's position at the end you

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.440 
playing White's position at the end you
think<00:06:54.590> you<00:06:54.650> would<00:06:54.770> have<00:06:54.860> played<00:06:55.040> on<00:06:55.420> yeah<00:06:56.420> I

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.450 
think you would have played on yeah I

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.670 
think you would have played on yeah I
would<00:06:56.720> certainly<00:06:56.960> I<00:06:57.140> played<00:06:57.380> it

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
would certainly I played it

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.090 
would certainly I played it
I'm<00:06:58.040> certainly<00:06:58.400> a<00:06:58.460> few<00:06:59.210> more<00:06:59.420> moves<00:06:59.770> I<00:07:00.770> think<00:07:00.830> I

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.100 
I'm certainly a few more moves I think I

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.930 
I'm certainly a few more moves I think I
would<00:07:01.220> have<00:07:01.280> tried<00:07:01.430> cooking<00:07:01.910> time<00:07:02.120> and<00:07:03.730> yeah

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.400 

because<00:07:07.940> they're<00:07:08.240> not<00:07:08.360> a<00:07:08.420> spike<00:07:08.870> has<00:07:09.050> to<00:07:09.230> play

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410 
because they're not a spike has to play

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:19.719 
because they're not a spike has to play
play<00:07:10.010> precisely<00:07:10.700> it<00:07:11.360> was<00:07:11.770> big<00:07:12.770> my<00:07:12.950> own<00:07:13.100> messes

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:19.729 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.729 

okay
