longer where you go about and do that

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.800 
longer where you go about and do that
the<00:02:08.009> other<00:02:08.190> thing<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.520> did<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.210> I<00:02:09.420> did<00:02:09.780> not

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
the other thing I did is that I did not

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.830

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
recommended but I don't really think

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.320 
recommended but I don't really think
that<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.510> need<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.140> as<00:02:19.319> far<00:02:20.130> as<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.459> see<00:02:20.819> if<00:02:21.090> I
