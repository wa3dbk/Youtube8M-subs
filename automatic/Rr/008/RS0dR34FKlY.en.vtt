hi guys okay so basically this will not
be<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.210> full<00:00:03.419> tutorial<00:00:03.600> on<00:00:04.020> how<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.170> do<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:05.190> Lego

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
be a full tutorial on how to do the Lego

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.570 
be a full tutorial on how to do the Lego
dice<00:00:06.390> tower<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:07.529> way<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:07.950> did<00:00:08.280> it

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
dice tower the way that I did it

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.330 
dice tower the way that I did it
but<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.480> will<00:00:09.660> basically<00:00:10.469> just<00:00:10.889> show<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.099> what

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
but it will basically just show you what

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.530 
but it will basically just show you what
you<00:00:11.460> need<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.670> know<00:00:11.849> because<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.150> found<00:00:12.360> it

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
you need to know because I found it

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.070 
you need to know because I found it
really<00:00:12.719> hard<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.290> couldn't<00:00:13.590> find<00:00:13.769> online<00:00:15.080> any

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
really hard I couldn't find online any

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.900 
really hard I couldn't find online any
plans<00:00:16.440> or<00:00:16.560> tutorials<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.130> just<00:00:17.310> figured<00:00:17.789> it

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
plans or tutorials so I just figured it

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.070 
plans or tutorials so I just figured it
out<00:00:18.000> myself

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
out myself

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.980 
out myself
it<00:00:19.170> wasn't<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.529> hard<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:20.039> mean<00:00:20.750> it's<00:00:21.750> pretty

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
it wasn't that hard I mean it's pretty

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.420 
it wasn't that hard I mean it's pretty
simple<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.619> with<00:00:23.430> let<00:00:23.640> go<00:00:24.230> alright<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.500> here

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
simple but with let go alright so here

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.870 
simple but with let go alright so here
and<00:00:26.519> let<00:00:26.609> me<00:00:26.670> just<00:00:26.699> show<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.170> I<00:00:28.640> actually<00:00:29.640> took

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
and let me just show you I actually took

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.130 
and let me just show you I actually took
a<00:00:29.939> part<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.210> my<00:00:30.330> dice<00:00:30.510> tower<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:31.170> do<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:31.980> video

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
a part in my dice tower to do this video

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.350 
a part in my dice tower to do this video
so<00:00:34.250> this<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.430> how<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.579> actually<00:00:35.850> did<00:00:36.090> my<00:00:36.210> dice

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
so this is how I actually did my dice

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.420 
so this is how I actually did my dice
tower<00:00:36.630> basically<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.410> what<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.100> want<00:00:38.129> to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
tower basically if what you want to

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.569 
tower basically if what you want to
start<00:00:38.730> with<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.350> maybe<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.890> first<00:00:41.190> thing<00:00:41.340> that

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
start with is maybe the first thing that

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.139 
start with is maybe the first thing that
I<00:00:41.610> started<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.210> was<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.950> arch<00:00:43.950> here<00:00:44.309> which

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
I started with was this arch here which

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.490 
I started with was this arch here which
would<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.360> where<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.719> dice<00:00:45.960> actually<00:00:46.320> come

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
would be where the dice actually come

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.799 
would be where the dice actually come
out<00:00:46.700> make<00:00:47.700> sure<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> right<00:00:48.270> height<00:00:48.510> it

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
out make sure is the right height it

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.470 
out make sure is the right height it
depends<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.350> your<00:00:49.530> dice<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.399> play<00:00:51.270> king

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
depends on your dice because I play king

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.209 
depends on your dice because I play king
of<00:00:51.570> Tokyo<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.559> quite<00:00:52.770> huge<00:00:53.070> dice<00:00:55.010> one<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
of Tokyo I have quite huge dice one of

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.400 
of Tokyo I have quite huge dice one of
the<00:00:56.340> problems<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.300> had<00:00:57.660> was<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the problems that I had was that the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.319 
the problems that I had was that the
dice<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.710> get<00:00:58.859> stuck<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> actually<00:01:00.000> had<00:01:00.300> to

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
dice to get stuck so I actually had to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.850 
dice to get stuck so I actually had to
raise<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.109> arch<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:03.600> make<00:01:03.809> these<00:01:04.110> angular

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
raise the arch to make these angular

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.020 
raise the arch to make these angular
slants<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.909> your<00:01:06.060> dice<00:01:06.240> bounce<00:01:06.990> off<00:01:08.030> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
slants so that your dice bounce off the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.969 
slants so that your dice bounce off the
walls<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.420> each<00:01:09.510> other<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.960> actually<00:01:10.170> used<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
walls of each other I actually used the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.490 
walls of each other I actually used the
Lego<00:01:11.280> roof<00:01:11.820> tiles<00:01:13.430> these<00:01:14.430> these<00:01:15.080> these<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.350> be

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
Lego roof tiles these these these can be

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.999 
Lego roof tiles these these these can be
bought<00:01:17.450> separately<00:01:18.450> because<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.290> don't<00:01:19.920> know<00:01:19.979> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
bought separately because I don't know I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.859 
bought separately because I don't know I
just<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> lot<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> Lego<00:01:20.939> lying<00:01:21.240> around<00:01:21.390> so

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
just have a lot of Lego lying around so

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.890 
just have a lot of Lego lying around so
I<00:01:22.140> decided<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.770> use<00:01:22.890> these<00:01:23.600> what<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.689> do

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I decided to use these what you do

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.630 
I decided to use these what you do
basically<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:27.200> just<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:29.869> and

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
basically is you just just like and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.090 
basically is you just just like and
that's<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:33.530> that<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.710> will<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:34.920> your

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
that's your that that will be your

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.429 
that's your that that will be your
slanted<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:36.630> angle<00:01:37.520> for<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> bounce

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
slanted your your angle for it to bounce

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.120 
slanted your your angle for it to bounce
okay<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:40.799> moving<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:42.710> I'm<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.829> telling

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
okay and then moving on I'm just telling

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.560 
okay and then moving on I'm just telling
you<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.460> basically<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.000> problems<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.540> I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
you here basically the problems that I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.880 
you here basically the problems that I
actually<00:01:45.750> faced<00:01:46.079> while<00:01:46.290> making<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.649> dice

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
actually faced while making this dice

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.530 
actually faced while making this dice
tower<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:48.060> could<00:01:49.020> not<00:01:49.170> get<00:01:49.470> my<00:01:49.500> dice<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:51.090> roll

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
tower I could not get my dice to roll

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.800 
tower I could not get my dice to roll
out<00:01:52.500> into<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:54.270> area<00:01:56.000> with<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.600> roof

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
out into this area with just the roof

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.319 
out into this area with just the roof
the<00:01:58.350> roof<00:01:58.560> tiles<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.250> actually<00:01:59.549> had<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.060> find

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the roof tiles so I actually had to find

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.980 
the roof tiles so I actually had to find
amongst<00:02:00.960> all<00:02:01.350> my<00:02:01.409> Lego<00:02:01.829> um<00:02:02.600> these<00:02:03.600> pieces

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
amongst all my Lego um these pieces

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.550 
amongst all my Lego um these pieces
which<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:05.149> am<00:02:06.149> not<00:02:06.420> too<00:02:06.689> sure<00:02:06.719> where<00:02:07.350> they're

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
which I am not too sure where they're

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.080 
which I am not too sure where they're
from<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:07.890> there<00:02:08.220> are<00:02:08.280> LEGO<00:02:08.429> pieces<00:02:08.550> and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
from but there are LEGO pieces and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.750 
from but there are LEGO pieces and
they're<00:02:09.360> very<00:02:09.569> smooth<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.250> dice<00:02:11.459> would

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
they're very smooth so the dice would

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.010 
they're very smooth so the dice would
actually<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.569> roll<00:02:12.810> out<00:02:12.840> like<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
actually just roll out like the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.570 
actually just roll out like the
see<00:02:15.020> then<00:02:15.710> it<00:02:15.860> would<00:02:15.980> go<00:02:16.130> up<00:02:16.250> onto<00:02:16.490> here<00:02:18.400> when<00:02:19.400> I

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
see then it would go up onto here when I

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.080 
see then it would go up onto here when I
used<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.840> without<00:02:21.020> these<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:22.580> die<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:22.940> can

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
used it without these the die so I can

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.240 
used it without these the die so I can
get<00:02:23.420> stuck<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:26.290> if<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.440> can<00:02:27.560> find<00:02:27.710> these<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.010> am

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
get stuck so if you can find these I am

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.330 
get stuck so if you can find these I am
not<00:02:28.490> too<00:02:28.670> sure<00:02:28.700> where<00:02:29.180> they're<00:02:29.330> actually<00:02:29.480> from

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
not too sure where they're actually from

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.140 
not too sure where they're actually from
which<00:02:31.340> said<00:02:31.820> they're<00:02:32.090> actually<00:02:32.480> from<00:02:32.720> but<00:02:33.070> I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
which said they're actually from but I

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.140 
which said they're actually from but I
believe<00:02:35.150> it's<00:02:35.390> from<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:36.440> set<00:02:36.920> which<00:02:39.790> I'm<00:02:40.790> not

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
believe it's from this set which I'm not

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.250 
believe it's from this set which I'm not
too<00:02:41.330> sure<00:02:42.040> because<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.310> see<00:02:43.520> here<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:44.570> this

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
too sure because you see here the this

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.190 
too sure because you see here the this
piece<00:02:46.000> on<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.060> car<00:02:47.330> I<00:02:47.570> think<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:48.050> yeah

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
piece on the car I think that yeah

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.750 
piece on the car I think that yeah
that's<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.560> piece<00:02:48.740> that's<00:02:48.770> actually<00:02:49.580> used

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
that's the piece that's actually used

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.410 
that's the piece that's actually used
here<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:51.610> yeah<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:52.670> want<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.030> start<00:02:53.270> with<00:02:53.360> your

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
here so yeah you want to start with your

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.130 
here so yeah you want to start with your
arch<00:02:53.800> probably<00:02:54.800> do<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:55.430> did<00:02:55.760> for<00:02:56.060> because<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.780> ran

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
arch probably do I did for because I ran

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.180 
arch probably do I did for because I ran
out<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.320> roof<00:02:57.620> tiles

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
out of roof tiles

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.120 
out of roof tiles
I<00:02:58.780> put<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.900> window<00:03:00.140> here<00:03:00.320> just<00:03:00.530> for<00:03:00.680> fun<00:03:00.740> for

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
I put the window here just for fun for

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.720 
I put the window here just for fun for
added<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.460> cube<00:03:01.640> decoration<00:03:02.710> so<00:03:03.730> basically

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
added a cube decoration so basically

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.050 
added a cube decoration so basically
that's<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:06.050> if<00:03:07.040> you're<00:03:07.370> going<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.760> do<00:03:07.910> this

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
that's it so if you're going to do this

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.850 
that's it so if you're going to do this
out<00:03:08.270> of<00:03:08.420> Lego<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.840> would<00:03:09.110> probably<00:03:09.620> most

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
out of Lego you would probably most

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.400 
out of Lego you would probably most
likely<00:03:10.280> know<00:03:10.640> how<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:10.880> use<00:03:11.150> Lego<00:03:11.510> so<00:03:11.780> I'm<00:03:12.290> not

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
likely know how to use Lego so I'm not

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.640 
likely know how to use Lego so I'm not
gonna<00:03:12.530> go<00:03:12.710> into<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:12.980> details<00:03:13.010> of<00:03:13.460> that<00:03:14.650> I'll

show you how it works so I'll put this

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.990 
show you how it works so I'll put this
together<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.520> I'll<00:03:19.670> show<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:19.850> how<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.210> works

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
dice Tower is compatible with all sorts

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.280 
dice Tower is compatible with all sorts
of<00:03:28.520> dice<00:03:28.760> well<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.300> haven't<00:03:29.480> just<00:03:29.720> in<00:03:29.840> mine<00:03:30.050> on

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
of dice well I haven't just in mine on

Kings<00:03:33.350> over<00:03:33.500> here<00:03:33.620> dice<00:03:33.800> really<00:03:34.340> big<00:03:34.550> one<00:03:34.820> of

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
Kings over here dice really big one of

Kings over here dice really big one of
the<00:03:35.000> biggest<00:03:35.270> dice<00:03:35.420> I've<00:03:35.780> ever<00:03:35.990> played<00:03:36.260> with

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
the biggest dice I've ever played with

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.650 
the biggest dice I've ever played with
so<00:03:37.310> if<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.150> if<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.600> play<00:03:38.840> with<00:03:39.140> big<00:03:39.770> dice<00:03:40.660> just

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
so if you if you play with big dice just

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.690 
so if you if you play with big dice just
so<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:41.900> know<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.170> measurements<00:03:42.650> in<00:03:42.860> Lego

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
so you know the measurements in Lego

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.780 
so you know the measurements in Lego
form<00:03:44.060> would<00:03:44.570> be<00:03:46.480> I'm<00:03:47.480> not<00:03:47.690> sure<00:03:47.750> about<00:03:48.020> 1<00:03:48.850> 2<00:03:49.850> 3<00:03:50.810> 4

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
form would be I'm not sure about 1 2 3 4

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.870 
form would be I'm not sure about 1 2 3 4
5<00:03:52.850> so<00:03:53.660> it<00:03:53.840> basically<00:03:53.990> be<00:03:54.920> 5<00:03:55.400> pieces<00:03:55.790> of<00:03:57.880> the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
5 so it basically be 5 pieces of the

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:10.170 
5 so it basically be 5 pieces of the
square<00:03:59.680> being<00:04:00.680> 10<00:04:02.680> 10<00:04:03.680> Lego<00:04:03.980> dots<00:04:04.190> by<00:04:06.580> 1<00:04:07.580> 2<00:04:08.240> 3<00:04:08.920> 4

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180
