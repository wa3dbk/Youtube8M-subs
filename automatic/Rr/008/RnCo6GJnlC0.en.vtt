00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
have with the multiplayer it seems to

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.630 
have with the multiplayer it seems to
match<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.710> games<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.400> aren't

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
match you in games that aren't

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.080 
match you in games that aren't
necessarily<00:00:27.500> fair<00:00:28.500> at<00:00:29.189> least<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.519> seems<00:00:29.820> like

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
necessarily fair at least it seems like

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.290 
necessarily fair at least it seems like
um<00:00:31.189> so<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.550> kind<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.790> want<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:32.969> get<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.120> better

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
um so you kind of want to get a better

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.870 
um so you kind of want to get a better
idea<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.750> what's<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.640> once<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.760> get

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
idea of what's going on once you get

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.360 
idea of what's going on once you get
into<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.239> game<00:00:36.440> because<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.920> addition<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
into the game because in addition to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.010 
into the game because in addition to
that<00:00:38.579> they<00:00:39.000> don't<00:00:39.800> really<00:00:40.800> let<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:42.020> what

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that they don't really let you know what

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.240 
that they don't really let you know what
you're<00:00:43.200> fighting<00:00:43.440> against<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> pregame

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
you're fighting against in the pregame

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.279 
you're fighting against in the pregame
lobby<00:00:44.610> boy<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.300> don't<00:00:45.390> figure<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.750> out<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.079> get

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
lobby boy you don't figure it out to get

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.720 
lobby boy you don't figure it out to get
in<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> game<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.010> i<00:00:47.039> would<00:00:47.219> suggest<00:00:47.340> just

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
in the game so i would suggest just

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.279 
in the game so i would suggest just
pressing<00:00:48.090> start<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.539> figuring<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.989> out<00:00:49.050> as

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
pressing start and figuring that out as

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.979 
pressing start and figuring that out as
soon<00:00:49.440> as<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.620> jump<00:00:49.800> into<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.219> oh<00:00:50.809> not<00:00:51.809> that

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
soon as you jump into it oh not that

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.439 
soon as you jump into it oh not that
it'll<00:00:52.170> really<00:00:52.320> matter<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.210> will

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
it'll really matter but you know it will

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.049 
it'll really matter but you know it will
i<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.070> what<00:00:56.309> I'm<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.520> against

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
i just like to know what I'm up against

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.360 
i just like to know what I'm up against
really<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.360> guess<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:58.590> kind<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.980> my

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
really I guess so that's kind of my

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.819 
really I guess so that's kind of my
suggestions<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.359> um<00:01:01.230> I'm<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:01.770> really

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
suggestions on that um I'm not really

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.979 
suggestions on that um I'm not really
gonna<00:01:02.160> go<00:01:02.340> over<00:01:02.579> talking<00:01:03.300> about<00:01:03.510> too<00:01:03.719> much<00:01:03.840> of

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
while it gets pretty simple it's not

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.020 
while it gets pretty simple it's not
really<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.400> complicated<00:01:11.670> oh<00:01:13.100> but<00:01:14.100> when<00:01:14.909> you

easier<00:02:22.040> as<00:02:22.670> far<00:02:22.819> as<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:23.000> gameplay<00:02:23.330> goes<00:02:23.569> I'm

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
easier as far as the gameplay goes I'm

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.720 
easier as far as the gameplay goes I'm
either<00:02:24.140> doing<00:02:24.290> more<00:02:24.590> damage<00:02:24.770> or<00:02:25.370> I'm<00:02:25.550> just

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
either doing more damage or I'm just

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
like that so those are just kind of my

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.900 
like that so those are just kind of my
suggestions<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.830> started<00:02:48.830> off<00:02:49.010> with<00:02:49.190> Zeus<00:02:49.550> and

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
suggestions I started off with Zeus and

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.820 
suggestions I started off with Zeus and
that<00:02:50.120> wasn't<00:02:50.300> really<00:02:50.540> working<00:02:50.720> for<00:02:50.900> me<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.440> I

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
that wasn't really working for me so I

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.270 
that wasn't really working for me so I
switched<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.670> Ares<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.800> that<00:02:54.800> seemed<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.160> work

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
switched to Ares and that seemed to work

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.810 
switched to Ares and that seemed to work
a<00:02:55.519> lot<00:02:55.670> better<00:02:55.910> for<00:02:56.300> me<00:02:56.480> Joe's<00:02:56.989> so<00:02:57.730> kind<00:02:58.730> of

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
a lot better for me Joe's so kind of

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.490 
a lot better for me Joe's so kind of
just<00:02:59.000> switch<00:02:59.269> allegiances<00:02:59.870> as<00:03:00.079> well<00:03:00.290> to

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
just switch allegiances as well to

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.819 
just switch allegiances as well to
figure<00:03:00.739> out<00:03:00.860> what<00:03:01.010> works<00:03:01.190> best<00:03:01.489> for<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:02.829> you
