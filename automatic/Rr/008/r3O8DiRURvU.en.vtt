00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.790
 the methane in fuel that it costs 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.530
 less but if you take a look at the list 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:26.880
 new cars are not there then 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:28.380
 so many models that go to gas at 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.179
 a tg the first methane machine of the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.619
 volkswagen group to arrive on 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.149
 market in the golf category 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.250
 that of family cars le 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.140
 machines suitable for every need can be 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.210
 have 5-door and station wagon e 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.780
 promises to travel 100 km spending 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.780
 three and a half euros 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.040
 inside the leon in the middle is not 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.140
 recognizes for the writing on the tailgate 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.690
 there is a double filler to make 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.370
 refueling with gasoline and methane and then 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.250
 opening the hood is the new engine 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.879
 approved with emissions of 94 g km of 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.230
 co2 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.520
 curious instead the exhaust terminal 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.800
 put in front of the suspension 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.700
 rear and therefore invisible from behind 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.110
 as if the car were electric the 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.590
 trunk is a bit smaller than respect 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.830
 you pass a petrol or diesel leon 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.649
 from a minimum capacity of 380 liters a 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.570
 270 with all the position seats 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.690
 while knocking down the seats either way 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.190
 a nice flat floor that less 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.810
 space because the cylinders are under the 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.850
 floor in fact there is no longer the wheel of 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.220
 stock but a compressor and the full one 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.350
 it costs less than 15 euros and there are 15 kg 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.759
 of methane equal to about 97 liters 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.830
 no renouncement of space instead for 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.240
 who sits behind the habitability is a lot 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.660
 good for the category as for the others 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.660
 leon 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.020
 in a methane leon changes little there 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.300
 plenty of space, a great driving position and i 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.070
 materials and perceived quality are of 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.260
 high level and then no lack of accessories 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.430
 as touch screen infotainment and with 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:25.270
 proximity sensors 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:27.040
 the dual- zone 110 automatic climate control system 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.260
 horses may seem few but in 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.670
 actually this four-cylinder 1400 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.160
 Direct injection turbo was 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.950
 optimized for half operation 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.350
 not making a comparison with the lion 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.660
 1600 turbodiesel with 5 speeds I have 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.130
 recently driven I would say that I prefer 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.810
 this to methane than in addition to a change 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.810
 six well- spaced gears 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.830
 the maximum torque is 200 newton meters 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.170
 at 1,500 rpm 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.420
 the turbo intervenes immediately and the thrust e 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.040
 begins to miss a little after i 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.650
 4,000 rpm 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.040
 I cannot however say that the leon is one 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.040
 slow machine 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.680
 beyond the 10.9 seconds declared for 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.870
 get to 100 now I like the answer 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.780
 of the smooth and fluid motor 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.790
 silence the change then remains one of the 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.130
 best not only for a category e 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.570
 the arrangement with an excellent balance between 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:39.750
 sportiness and comfort 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:41.820
 the weight of the cylinders is hardly heard 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.310
 400 km of autonomy declared with a 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.630
 full to realistic 350 begin to 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.340
 be interesting for not having to 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.750
 stop the dispenser too often 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.270
 in addition the petrol tank remains 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.500
 of normal size 50 liters to use 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.630
 if on a long journey they are not found 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.770
 methane distributors like the like 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.750
 methane transformation was 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.400
 fully integrated into the car 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.480
 you can tell from details like the double 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.460
 fuel gauge 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.330
 methane gas or the indicator of the 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.280
 gas consumption 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.690
 the smooth engine pleasing and in my opinion 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.250
 performance is not bad either 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.750
 compared to versions comparable to 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.340
 petrol or diesel 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.020
 whereas the mqb platform of the 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.820
 volkswagen is very recent but I would have 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.890
 preferred that the cylinders do not take off 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.510
 luggage space but also the 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.130
 dsg double clutch in the list of 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.600
 optional and to lower the price there 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.310
 a lesser version would also look good 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.590
 equipped with the only style 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.900
 available I was able to consume 5 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.460
 kg per 100 km a figure not far from the 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.170
 declared and keep in mind that guided 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.190
 also trying to understand performance 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.170
 of the engine 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.060
 this means that to do 100 km yes 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.040
 they realistically spend less than 5 euros 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.140
 with a car comparable to LPG yes 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.910
 would spend more or less 8 euros 10 with 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.910
 a diesel and 15 with a gasoline 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.270
 all starting from just over 22 thousand e 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.400
 700 euros against about 19,700 of a 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.010
 lion 1200 petrol comparable as 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.520
 set-up of 21,700 of a 1600 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.740
 diesel 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.270
 according to me a competitive price for 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.930
 an ecological family car e 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.930
 frugal 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.330
 the agreement
