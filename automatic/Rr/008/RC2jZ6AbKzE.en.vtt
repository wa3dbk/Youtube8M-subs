00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.300 
different characters throwing woody up
to<00:01:53.900> a<00:01:53.930> desk<00:01:54.229> so<00:01:54.439> we<00:01:54.470> can<00:01:54.680> reach<00:01:54.860> something<00:01:55.100> that

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
to a desk so we can reach something that

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.950 
to a desk so we can reach something that
the<00:01:55.400> other<00:01:55.520> characters<00:01:55.700> can't<00:01:56.240> add<00:01:56.450> something

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
the other characters can't add something

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.210 
the other characters can't add something
different<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.530> game<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:57.950> could<00:01:58.100> have

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
different to a game that could have

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.850 
different to a game that could have
gotten<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.549> little<00:01:58.700> bit<00:01:58.939> repetitive<00:01:59.530> Toy<00:02:00.530> Story

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
gotten a little bit repetitive Toy Story

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.770 
gotten a little bit repetitive Toy Story
3<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:01.189> also<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.759> perfect<00:02:01.970> difficulty<00:02:02.600> for

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
3 is also the perfect difficulty for

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.420 
3 is also the perfect difficulty for
target<00:02:03.200> audience<00:02:03.530> now<00:02:03.920> I'm<00:02:04.070> not<00:02:04.250> that

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
target audience now I'm not that

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.770 
target audience now I'm not that
audience<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.090> found<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.450> game<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.600> be

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
audience so I found the game to be

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.450 
audience so I found the game to be
pretty<00:02:05.990> easy<00:02:06.170> except<00:02:06.650> for<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.799> few<00:02:06.979> jumps<00:02:07.220> near

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
pretty easy except for a few jumps near

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.100 
pretty easy except for a few jumps near
the<00:02:07.520> very<00:02:07.670> beginning<00:02:08.119> but<00:02:08.540> the<00:02:08.660> kids<00:02:08.869> this<00:02:09.049> is

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
the very beginning but the kids this is

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.539 
the very beginning but the kids this is
meant<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.470> appeal<00:02:09.799> to<00:02:09.829> shouldn't<00:02:10.340> have<00:02:10.429> any

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
meant to appeal to shouldn't have any

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.430

problem<00:02:10.940> with<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.180> at<00:02:11.269> all<00:02:11.360> missions<00:02:12.170> can<00:02:12.350> also

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
problem with it at all missions can also

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.990 
problem with it at all missions can also
be<00:02:12.650> marked<00:02:12.829> with<00:02:12.950> an<00:02:13.100> arrow<00:02:13.280> on<00:02:13.519> your<00:02:13.640> compass
