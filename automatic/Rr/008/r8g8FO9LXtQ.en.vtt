offer any other protection some people

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.720 
offer any other protection some people
think<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.769> better<00:00:25.890> coverage<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.519> back

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
think it's a better coverage in the back

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.670 
think it's a better coverage in the back
it's<00:00:27.000> not<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.510> option<00:00:27.660> same<00:00:28.019> type<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.380> neck

protection the new offer a little bit

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.450 
protection the new offer a little bit
better<00:00:30.630> side<00:00:30.960> impact<00:00:31.470> protection<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
better side impact protection the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.250 
better side impact protection the
biggest<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.880> beige<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.510> racers<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.140> they

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
biggest of beige is for racers so they

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.010 
biggest of beige is for racers so they
can<00:00:34.440> add<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.800> jogger<00:00:35.780> secondly<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.930> have

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
can add that jogger secondly you have

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.990 
can add that jogger secondly you have

half shell these have soft flexible ears

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.670 
half shell these have soft flexible ears
so<00:00:42.149> they're<00:00:42.300> very<00:00:42.329> comfortable<00:00:43.050> they<00:00:43.379> keep

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
better they also a while here a little

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.979 
better they also a while here a little
bit<00:00:47.340> better<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.390> lot<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.600> these<00:00:48.719> now<00:00:48.930> you

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
bit better and a lot of these now you

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.510 
bit better and a lot of these now you
can<00:00:49.260> interchange<00:00:49.469> where<00:00:49.950> they<00:00:50.129> already<00:00:50.250> come

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
can interchange where they already come

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.729 
can interchange where they already come
with<00:00:50.700> audio<00:00:51.289> capabilities<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.590> can

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
with audio capabilities so you can

listen to music talk on your phone right
same<00:00:56.579> way<00:00:56.699> we're<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.059> talk<00:00:57.210> about

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
same way we're going to talk about

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.260 
same way we're going to talk about
construction<00:00:57.930> here<00:00:58.850> there's<00:00:59.850> three<00:01:00.059> basic

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
construction here there's three basic

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.549 
construction here there's three basic
types<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.809> construction<00:01:01.140> there's<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
types of construction there's a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.750 
types of construction there's a
hardshell<00:01:02.070> hybrid<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.470> mold<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
hardshell hybrid and a in mold this is a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.810 
hardshell hybrid and a in mold this is a
hard<00:01:06.000> shell<00:01:06.180> helmet<00:01:06.630> hard<00:01:07.350> shells<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:07.979> kind

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
hard shell helmet hard shells are kind

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.700 
hard shell helmet hard shells are kind
of<00:01:08.880> sounds<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.570> got<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> harder<00:01:10.140> shell<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
of sounds it's got a harder shell to it

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.160 
of sounds it's got a harder shell to it
with<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> software<00:01:11.880> interior<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> two

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
with the software interior so it's a two

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.190 
with the software interior so it's a two
piece<00:01:13.439> system<00:01:14.150> can't<00:01:15.150> get<00:01:15.299> very<00:01:15.450> many<00:01:15.659> options

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
piece system can't get very many options

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
piece system can't get very many options
if<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> venting<00:01:17.189> system<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.640> these

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
if you have a venting system with these

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.600 
if you have a venting system with these
it's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.270> plug<00:01:18.810> meant<00:01:19.110> there's<00:01:19.470> no<00:01:19.680> adjustable

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
it's a plug meant there's no adjustable

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.340 
it's a plug meant there's no adjustable
vents<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.210> five<00:01:21.509> minutes<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.020> these<00:01:22.140> type

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
vents on the five minutes of these type

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.950 
vents on the five minutes of these type
of<00:01:22.380> helmets<00:01:23.060> second<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.270> into<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.720> same

we're relatively new type of helmet
called<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.649> hybrid<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.909> actually<00:02:03.240> where

called the hybrid this is actually where
you<00:02:03.450> combine<00:02:03.840> an<00:02:04.079> in-mold<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.859> hardshell

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you combine an in-mold and a hardshell

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.730 
you combine an in-mold and a hardshell
together<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:06.270> has<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> reinforced<00:02:06.840> hard<00:02:07.409> shell

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
together it has a reinforced hard shell

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.990 
together it has a reinforced hard shell
a<00:02:08.720> kind<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.780> exoskeleton<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.799> it<00:02:10.950> with<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
a kind of exoskeleton to it with the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.410 
a kind of exoskeleton to it with the
soft<00:02:12.330> in<00:02:12.569> mol<00:02:12.870> liner<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.180> get<00:02:15.360> a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
soft in mol liner to it so you get a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.970 
soft in mol liner to it so you get a
little<00:02:15.720> bit<00:02:15.870> lighter<00:02:16.080> weight<00:02:16.349> helmet<00:02:16.739> then<00:02:16.890> I

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
little bit lighter weight helmet then I

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.490 
little bit lighter weight helmet then I
hardshell<00:02:17.670> how<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.360> does<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.260> get<00:02:19.379> the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
hardshell how it does but you get the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.900 
hardshell how it does but you get the
added<00:02:19.650> protection<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.340> hard<00:02:20.549> shell<00:02:20.760> as

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
added protection of the hard shell as

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.990 
added protection of the hard shell as
well<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.390> impact<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.379> your<00:02:22.500> genome<00:02:22.739> akimbo<00:02:23.160> so

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
well and impact of your genome akimbo so

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.900 
well and impact of your genome akimbo so
those<00:02:24.120> are<00:02:24.150> basic<00:02:24.660> types<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.620> helmets<00:02:25.980> they're

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
those are basic types of helmets they're

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.360 
those are basic types of helmets they're
