00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:32.760
 [Music] 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:34.860
 contemplation of history and 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.049
 so this is where according to legend 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.840
 Charles 15 was happy to walk around 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:43.830
 with his fingers while painting them 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.360

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.420

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.900

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.560
 clean 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.670
 in addition the color is extremely 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.470
 important because it is purple so 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:09.510
 it fits well in summer scratched with the 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:10.920
 enough lights from reading the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.239
 gardening 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.879
 in this region we find 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:18.560
 beautiful specimens of honeysuckle 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.560
 and sometimes even scale 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:33.169
