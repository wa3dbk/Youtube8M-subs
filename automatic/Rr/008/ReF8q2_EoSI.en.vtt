00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
shortly later this week but just a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.690 
shortly later this week but just a
little<00:00:35.990> bit<00:00:36.110> about<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.680> game<00:00:36.890> I'm<00:00:37.220> using<00:00:37.520> the

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
little bit about the game I'm using the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.810 
little bit about the game I'm using the
AC<00:00:37.850> are<00:00:38.240> silenced<00:00:39.140> not<00:00:39.260> a<00:00:39.800> typical<00:00:40.220> class<00:00:40.610> for

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
AC are silenced not a typical class for

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.660 
AC are silenced not a typical class for
me<00:00:40.850> but<00:00:41.510> I<00:00:41.540> decided<00:00:41.930> to<00:00:42.710> try<00:00:43.130> to<00:00:43.190> use<00:00:43.400> this<00:00:43.490> one

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
me but I decided to try to use this one

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.819 
me but I decided to try to use this one
only<00:00:43.880> because<00:00:44.240> this<00:00:44.870> class<00:00:45.110> setup<00:00:45.470> that<00:00:45.590> I<00:00:45.620> had

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
only because this class setup that I had

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.690 
only because this class setup that I had
has<00:00:46.579> hardline<00:00:47.090> equipped<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.920> for<00:00:48.920> me<00:00:49.040> I<00:00:49.250> was

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
has hardline equipped and for me I was

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.960 
has hardline equipped and for me I was
really<00:00:49.850> trying<00:00:50.600> to<00:00:50.720> get<00:00:50.840> that<00:00:50.990> nuke<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:51.970> hard

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
really trying to get that nuke so hard

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.729 
really trying to get that nuke so hard
line<00:00:53.120> was<00:00:53.540> kind<00:00:53.810> of<00:00:53.840> essential<00:00:54.230> in<00:00:54.320> this<00:00:54.470> match

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
line was kind of essential in this match

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.640 
line was kind of essential in this match
in<00:00:55.040> particular<00:00:55.520> because<00:00:56.060> if<00:00:56.630> you<00:00:56.989> watch<00:00:57.380> to

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
in particular because if you watch to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.040 
in particular because if you watch to
the<00:00:57.680> end<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.550> score<00:00:58.910> is<00:00:58.940> like<00:00:59.149> 9800<00:00:59.899> to

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
the end the score is like 9800 to

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.490 
the end the score is like 9800 to
whatever<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:01.030> so<00:01:02.030> it<00:01:02.120> was<00:01:02.210> barely<00:01:02.510> let<00:01:03.230> end<00:01:03.410> a

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
whatever and so it was barely let end a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.930 
whatever and so it was barely let end a
game<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:03.920> I<00:01:04.009> called<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:04.370> in<00:01:04.460> right<00:01:04.610> at<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.820> end

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
game and I called it in right at the end

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.760 
game and I called it in right at the end
it<00:01:05.059> was<00:01:05.150> pretty<00:01:05.390> pretty<00:01:05.750> clutch<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:06.320> was<00:01:06.650> really

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
it was pretty pretty clutch I was really

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.090 
it was pretty pretty clutch I was really
glad<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:07.040> get<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:08.440> but<00:01:09.440> yeah<00:01:09.620> i'm<00:01:09.740> using<00:01:10.010> the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
glad to get it but yeah i'm using the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.280 
glad to get it but yeah i'm using the
ACR<00:01:10.370> silence<00:01:10.790> though<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.300> i<00:01:11.420> don't<00:01:11.870> usually

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
ACR silence though and i don't usually

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.620 
ACR silence though and i don't usually
use<00:01:12.620> a<00:01:12.680> silencer<00:01:12.979> either<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:14.240> was<00:01:14.360> kind<00:01:14.540> of

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
use a silencer either so it was kind of

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.870 
use a silencer either so it was kind of
a<00:01:14.690> different<00:01:15.170> setup<00:01:15.440> for<00:01:15.620> me<00:01:15.740> now<00:01:16.280> i<00:01:16.549> would

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
a different setup for me now i would

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.060 
a different setup for me now i would
describe<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.479> gameplay<00:01:17.900> that<00:01:18.170> i<00:01:18.229> am<00:01:18.710> using

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
describe the gameplay that i am using

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.719 
describe the gameplay that i am using
here<00:01:19.220> as<00:01:20.170> tactic<00:01:21.170> hole<00:01:21.770> i<00:01:21.799> guess<00:01:22.130> like<00:01:22.370> I'm

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
here as tactic hole i guess like I'm

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.539 
here as tactic hole i guess like I'm
basically<00:01:23.330> not<00:01:24.229> rushing<00:01:24.650> in<00:01:24.770> as<00:01:24.920> hard<00:01:25.370> as<00:01:25.460> I

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
basically not rushing in as hard as I

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.310 
basically not rushing in as hard as I
normally<00:01:25.610> would<00:01:25.940> because<00:01:26.270> if<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:26.930> rush<00:01:27.110> into

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
normally would because if you rush into

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.969 
normally would because if you rush into
hard<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.190> enemy<00:01:28.430> spawn<00:01:28.930> I<00:01:29.930> mean<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:30.680> get

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
hard to the enemy spawn I mean you get

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.469 
hard to the enemy spawn I mean you get
overwhelmed<00:01:31.490> pretty<00:01:31.729> easily<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:32.030> I'm<00:01:32.210> kind<00:01:32.420> of

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
overwhelmed pretty easily so I'm kind of

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.480 
overwhelmed pretty easily so I'm kind of
just<00:01:32.659> going<00:01:33.350> with<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.560> flow<00:01:33.650> of<00:01:33.830> things<00:01:33.950> going

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
just going with the flow of things going

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.149 
just going with the flow of things going
a<00:01:34.549> little<00:01:34.640> bit<00:01:34.760> slow<00:01:35.090> watching<00:01:36.020> my<00:01:36.080> grounds<00:01:36.799> we

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
a little bit slow watching my grounds we

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.940 
a little bit slow watching my grounds we
as<00:01:38.000> you<00:01:38.119> can<00:01:38.270> see<00:01:38.570> we<00:01:38.720> kind<00:01:38.930> of<00:01:38.990> invaded<00:01:39.680> their

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
as you can see we kind of invaded their

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.920 
as you can see we kind of invaded their
spawn<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.520> out<00:01:40.640> flipped<00:01:41.030> now<00:01:41.600> i'm<00:01:41.720> not

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
spawn and out flipped now i'm not

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.899 
spawn and out flipped now i'm not
working<00:01:42.110> my<00:01:42.260> way<00:01:42.290> back<00:01:42.580> this<00:01:43.580> is<00:01:43.729> a<00:01:43.760> good

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
working my way back this is a good

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.830 
working my way back this is a good
little<00:01:44.060> perks<00:01:44.390> right<00:01:44.630> here<00:01:44.900> to<00:01:45.290> kill<00:01:45.530> people

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
little perks right here to kill people

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.080 
little perks right here to kill people
it's<00:01:47.840> basically<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.710> trick<00:01:49.280> for<00:01:49.460> me<00:01:49.580> trying

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
it's basically the trick for me trying

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.300 
it's basically the trick for me trying
to<00:01:50.119> get<00:01:50.270> kills<00:01:50.510> in<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:51.619> in<00:01:51.710> black<00:01:51.920> ops<00:01:52.130> is

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
to get kills in this and in black ops is

no<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.519> think<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.090> Harrier<00:03:24.359> strikes<00:03:24.600> was<00:03:24.750> one

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
no I think the Harrier strikes was one

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.740 
no I think the Harrier strikes was one
of<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.319> best<00:03:25.680> kill<00:03:25.950> streaks<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.370> any<00:03:26.600> call<00:03:27.600> of

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
of the best kill streaks in any call of

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.300 
of the best kill streaks in any call of
duty<00:03:27.930> games<00:03:28.139> just<00:03:28.500> because<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.769> get<00:03:29.100> that

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
duty games just because you get that

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.970 
duty games just because you get that
precision<00:03:30.269> air<00:03:30.569> strike<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.590> then<00:03:31.680> obviously

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
precision air strike and then obviously

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.949 
precision air strike and then obviously
the<00:03:32.430> hair<00:03:32.760> your<00:03:32.940> kills<00:03:33.450> people<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.780> then<00:03:33.930> I

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
the hair your kills people and then I

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:34.970 
the hair your kills people and then I
don't<00:03:34.230> know<00:03:34.290> if<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.470> knew<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:34.620> but<00:03:34.769> the

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
don't know if you knew this but the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.039 
don't know if you knew this but the
Harrier<00:03:35.250> also<00:03:35.579> destroys<00:03:36.299> like<00:03:36.480> helicopters

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
Harrier also destroys like helicopters

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.449 
Harrier also destroys like helicopters
and<00:03:37.139> stuff<00:03:37.319> like<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.470> randomly<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.250> don't

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
and stuff like that randomly I don't

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.460 
and stuff like that randomly I don't
know<00:03:38.549> how<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.880> does<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.180> or<00:03:39.329> choose<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.720> but

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
know how it does it or choose it to but

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.680 
know how it does it or choose it to but
it<00:03:40.500> destroys<00:03:40.940> helicopters<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.090> UAVs<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.510> all

that's<00:03:50.639> another<00:03:50.850> thing<00:03:51.000> i<00:03:51.090> miss<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.450> 8130

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
that's another thing i miss the 8130

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.879 
that's another thing i miss the 8130
that<00:03:52.590> was<00:03:52.709> just<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:52.980> beastie<00:03:54.350> kill<00:03:55.350> streak<00:03:55.650> and

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
that was just a beastie kill streak and

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.900 
that was just a beastie kill streak and
it<00:03:56.480> beats<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:59.280> chopper<00:03:59.489> gunner<00:03:59.730> in<00:03:59.819> my

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
it beats the the chopper gunner in my

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.300 
it beats the the chopper gunner in my
opinion<00:04:00.150> in<00:04:00.420> ground<00:04:00.989> war<00:04:01.290> now<00:04:01.470> if<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.769> use<00:04:01.980> the

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
opinion in ground war now if you use the

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.940 
opinion in ground war now if you use the
chopper<00:04:03.299> gunner<00:04:03.480> in<00:04:03.750> ground<00:04:04.440> war<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.650> lot<00:04:04.829> of

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
chopper gunner in ground war a lot of

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.800 
chopper gunner in ground war a lot of
times<00:04:05.099> just<00:04:05.190> gets<00:04:05.519> shot<00:04:05.730> down<00:04:05.760> too<00:04:06.269> easily<00:04:06.299> so

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
times just gets shot down too easily so

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.339 
times just gets shot down too easily so
by<00:04:07.319> using<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.680> chopper<00:04:07.980> gunner<00:04:08.190> in

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
by using the chopper gunner in

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.210 
by using the chopper gunner in
domination<00:04:10.349> or<00:04:10.709> something<00:04:11.099> like<00:04:11.160> that

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
domination or something like that

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.830 
domination or something like that
sometimes<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.269> might<00:04:12.359> have<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.569> better<00:04:12.750> chance

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
sometimes you might have a better chance

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.349 
sometimes you might have a better chance
but<00:04:13.319> if<00:04:13.889> you<00:04:13.980> use<00:04:14.099> a<00:04:14.130> c-130<00:04:14.910> in<00:04:15.090> just<00:04:15.299> a

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
but if you use a c-130 in just a

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.300 
but if you use a c-130 in just a
straight<00:04:15.569> domination<00:04:16.109> game<00:04:16.139> it<00:04:16.500> sometimes

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
straight domination game it sometimes

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.490 
straight domination game it sometimes
will<00:04:17.430> give<00:04:17.609> me<00:04:17.669> enough<00:04:17.849> multi<00:04:18.120> kills<00:04:18.359> but<00:04:18.630> in

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
will give me enough multi kills but in

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.190 
will give me enough multi kills but in
this<00:04:19.769> situation<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.760> didn't<00:04:21.659> get<00:04:21.750> quite<00:04:21.900> enough

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
this situation I didn't get quite enough

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.100 
this situation I didn't get quite enough
for<00:04:22.560> new<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.039> I<00:04:24.000> think<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.270> was<00:04:24.390> three<00:04:24.599> shy<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:25.080> I

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
for new and I think I was three shy so I

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.810 
for new and I think I was three shy so I
just<00:04:25.380> had<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.500> two

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
just had a two

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.160 
just had a two
to<00:04:26.910> get<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.090> last<00:04:27.240> three<00:04:27.420> kills<00:04:27.630> on<00:04:27.900> my<00:04:28.020> own

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
to get the last three kills on my own

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.930 
to get the last three kills on my own
but<00:04:29.100> that's<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.430> other<00:04:29.490> thing<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.730> miss<00:04:29.790> about

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
but that's the other thing I miss about

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.630 
but that's the other thing I miss about
modern<00:04:30.570> warfare<00:04:30.690> 2<00:04:30.960> is<00:04:31.110> that<00:04:31.290> that<00:04:32.010> heart

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
modern warfare 2 is that that heart

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.130 
modern warfare 2 is that that heart
racing<00:04:33.030> moment<00:04:33.360> when<00:04:33.540> you<00:04:33.660> get<00:04:33.810> out<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:34.050> this

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
racing moment when you get out of this

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.870 
racing moment when you get out of this
right<00:04:34.380> now<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:34.620> get<00:04:34.860> out<00:04:34.980> of<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.100> 8130<00:04:35.490> you're

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
right now you get out of the 8130 you're
