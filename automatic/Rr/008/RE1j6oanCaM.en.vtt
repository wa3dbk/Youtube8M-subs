but<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.140> packs<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.560> punch<00:00:19.789> in<00:00:20.789> any<00:00:20.970> case<00:00:21.029> I

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
but it packs a punch in any case I

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.300 
but it packs a punch in any case I
really<00:00:21.810> loved<00:00:22.080> all<00:00:22.380> these<00:00:22.590> new<00:00:22.769> weapons<00:00:22.920> I

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
really loved all these new weapons I

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.470 
really loved all these new weapons I
think<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:23.820> really<00:00:23.939> cool<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.210> they're

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
think it's really cool that they're

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.580 
think it's really cool that they're
adding<00:00:24.750> weapons<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.199> late<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.529> game

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
adding weapons this late in the game

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.849 
adding weapons this late in the game
it's<00:00:26.250> true<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.609> they're<00:00:27.359> not<00:00:27.539> necessarily

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
it's true that they're not necessarily

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.050 
it's true that they're not necessarily
free<00:00:28.859> like<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.340> have<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.670> get<00:00:29.820> them<00:00:29.939> from

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
free like you have to get them from

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.939 
free like you have to get them from
either<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.570> regular<00:00:31.170> supply<00:00:31.320> drop<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.859> an

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
either a regular supply drop of an

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.760 
either a regular supply drop of an
advanced<00:00:32.219> Supply<00:00:32.489> Drop<00:00:32.550> but<00:00:33.530> like<00:00:34.530> for

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
advanced Supply Drop but like for

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.340 
advanced Supply Drop but like for
example<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.399> first<00:00:35.670> 20<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.780> bought<00:00:37.020> I

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
example the first 20 that I bought I

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.830 
example the first 20 that I bought I
think<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.010> had<00:00:38.160> all<00:00:38.309> three<00:00:38.579> guns<00:00:38.790> by<00:00:38.969> then<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.809> I

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
think I had all three guns by then so I

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.049 
think I had all three guns by then so I
think<00:00:40.110> they<00:00:40.469> wait<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.430> chances<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.879> you

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
think they wait the the chances of you

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.330 
think they wait the the chances of you
getting<00:00:42.270> these<00:00:42.540> guns<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.140> pretty<00:00:43.440> high<00:00:43.680> I'm

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
getting these guns to be pretty high I'm

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.850 
getting these guns to be pretty high I'm
not<00:00:44.610> sure<00:00:44.670> uh<00:00:45.329> either<00:00:45.899> way<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.410> thought<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.800> is

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
not sure uh either way I thought this is

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.959 
not sure uh either way I thought this is
some<00:00:47.070> really<00:00:47.219> good<00:00:47.370> gameplay<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.789> some
