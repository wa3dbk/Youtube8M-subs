00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 Ronny Nikol scored foul-eleven meters in extra time 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.049
 Wiener then hovered in seventh heaven and the Erfurt 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:13.029
 Jan Sting looked sour in the first place on himself in just over two hours before 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.429
 the thing with something else 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.570
 red-white had the cup game under control and that clear in the first half 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.820
 dominant 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.860
 logically 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.130
 against the team of coach Stefan Emmerling also with 1 0 in the lead Tino 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.520
 Semmer was 17 minutes faster than Moses Sichone 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.279
 and it seemed so hockey Erfurt 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.580
 his role as a favorite in cable sports field 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.330
 especially since the host in the first half hardly anything was visible 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.470
 we have big problems gave the first time soldiers will be 20 minutes 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.410
 Sun again brought her silver 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.450
 However, the plans show they want to have it 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.639
 but this picture changed completely in the second half 

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:55.199
 now only the FC Carl Zeiss played and worked out a scoring chance 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.420
 the other 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.870
 only the ball did not want info 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.380
 »More Forsten was in the way or Erfurt strong goalkeeper Dirk Orlishausen 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.410
 but the Jena 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.670
 Albbruck he was getting bigger and therefore the equalizer was there only 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.900
 still a matter of time 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.570
 so promoted Ruhl dense shrubbery 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.160
 ibbenbüren 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.360
 and so to have been criminalized over necessary and managed by anyway 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.140
 but the greed for Vans had to wait until 76 minutes before Moses Sichone per 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.810
 Header goal that 1 2 1 succeeded 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.010
 He also gave Erfurt's defender a slight push 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.410
 the hit counted and it went into extra time 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.210
 and in the dismantling again Erfurt first at the pusher Jena could of 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.300
 Fortunately, after passing by Malura, two red and white players are playing on the ball 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.660
 slip past in the extension who would make the first mistake that would 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.440
 lose this game and made the mistake Erfurt defender Martin Pohl 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.499
 by bringing Lenas' avoidance from the legs in the box 

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:58.319
 if you had to give penalties because of that was there but anyway 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.429
 not completely full, he did not care much, he completely changed the penalty 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.929
 for sure 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.029
 and led that into the semi-finals of the Thuringia Cup the uptrend 

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:09.489
 under coach Wolfgang Frank continues with it
