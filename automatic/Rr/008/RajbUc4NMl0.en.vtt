00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.100
 but 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.380
 in the depths of the ocean there are 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.400
 several species of fish that man 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.300
 he has not discovered 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.279
 in fact to understand the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.840
 ignorance of the depths more 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.600
 it is enough to mention that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.199
 you have more knowledge about 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.470
 moon that on our own background the 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.470
 sea 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.560
 the species that inhabit this mysterious 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.350
 habitat due to lack of light and as a means 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.100
 of survival lack their majority 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:17.000
 of pigmentation which causes them to be 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.240
 in a way transparent of this 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.600
 shape the predators immersed in the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.440
 depths do not detect so easily 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.440
 to its victims 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.280
 the ostracods are tiny crustaceans 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.210
 that are sometimes 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.210
 at the bottom of the sea 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.060
 this is a small marine cardinal who 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.480
 as a defense mechanism it has become 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.380
 transparent and almost impossible to see in 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.380
 the dark sea 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.819
 when the cardinal met with a 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:35.090
 small ostrÃ¡codos happens the most natural 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.799
 the bigger one eats the smaller one but 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.409
 is then when the tiny 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.230
 ostracods activates its mechanism 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.930
 defense getting rid of the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.420
 danger 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.420
 let's see again what happened 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.030
 when eaten the oyster co2 emits 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.790
 immediately a bio substance 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.450
 luminous that reveals the exact location 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.450
 of the cardinal to note this the cardinal 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.790
 is quickly cooper its prey and it 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.060
 move away before being attacked by some 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.060
 predator 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.840
 undoubtedly a marine show worthy of 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.780
 appreciate yourself and you if you were a creature 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.230
 marine of the depths that method 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.540
 of defense would you like to be creative 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.230
 and leave us the answer in the box 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.230
