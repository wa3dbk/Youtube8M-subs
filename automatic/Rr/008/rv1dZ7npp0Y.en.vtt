00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.469
 I have not loved so much 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.540
 hello to all friends of experience is worth 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.000
 only enzo we do the unboxing of the 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.760
 samsung galaxy and terminal location seen 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.260
 a few weeks ago in barcelona how 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.180
 always in life he leaves a nice video kiss 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.920
 to share etc. a technician 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.529
 a symbian that you want so much the packaging 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.730
 a little different from the usual yellow 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:31.360
 very very lithe shoots let's say 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.190
 then convection usual things then 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.820
 wall power supply with an output from 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.129
 an amp and a half earphones in mine from 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.219
 discrete poet with bombini levels for i 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.020
 pavilions and the micro usb usb cable 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.449
 classic white donation but it will be white 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.789
 even thinks with dark breakfast phones 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.079
 let's put it away and let's see everything a little 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.410
 terminal ok 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.109
 here he announces a hundred 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.430
 we hope that how well he is and he is 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.929
 so let's turn on the first one 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.910
 video for me too 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.040
 let's talk about characteristic dimensions e 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.780
 anything else we have 15 points and 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.390
 width of 7.7 centimeters in height 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.430
 the thickness of only 7 coasters mm in a 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.800
 thin node that here camera scor 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.570
 people weight a hundred when a large then 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.020
 very light is a blush because we have 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.740
 a 5.5 inch hd amoled display with 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.770
 270 inch pixar should be so 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.690
 let's see immediately going we should 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.470
 be the same display as the galaxy note 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.090
 it's mine 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.710
 because it should have penta matrix must 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.440
 see a rgb thesis and not think 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.440
 however now we see immediately 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:56.030
 ok excuse me from today mark immediately 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:06.479
 sorry you focus the venue first 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.880
 and then me too myself personally 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.280
 It looks the same display in fact not 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.770
 scales of the Friday pixel that of the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.290
 which I am always complaining about is therefore that the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.700
 display is matrix rgb so it's not is not 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.920
 not bad anyway 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.730
 the processor is a snapdragon 410 quad 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.470
 core 64-bit 2GB with gpu adreno 306 2 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.870
 gb of ram 16 again internal 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.550
 expandable with 12 microsd camera 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.090
 megapixel autofocus flash led 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.310
 here we gave pallante and hello 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.730
 battery but excuse me 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.470
 yes yes 2950 milly ampere battery we see 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.570
 a bit if removable the body is not 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.070
 removable so we keep it so the 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.510
 terminal in this case is a dual sim 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.940
 I didn't know where I thought only that 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.130
 we are a symbol okay now in two up 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.430
 in two so even better could if 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.340
 for someone 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.890
 practically a galaxy at 5 a bit 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.150
 enlarged for the hardware is the same 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.950
 basically here the battery is 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.790
 upper queen should also last than 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.359
 more 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.280
 android let's see some device info 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.629
 4.4.4 kat kit 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.159
 I hope it gets updated and last 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.680
 touch wiz so we don't have it here either 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.389
 big news but we'll see if 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.459
 conclusive of the battery part however 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:19.790
 nice room for this processor 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.139
 should last almost as long as louis 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.719
 set that was one of the terminals that 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.159
 measured more absolute and then also the 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.319
 performance sum because anyway a ago 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.720
 black and at a price of around 300 euros 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.370
 online with these features is 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.290
 however it could still be 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.730
 so interesting for this short 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.900
 video and everything would be great details 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.439
 like he's done mine down here in the 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.060
 comments 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.680
 we are in the next videos not 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.919
 they will be more than their presidency but never 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.919
 Hello
