00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
I ran into this rock instead it works

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.390 
I ran into this rock instead it works
well<00:03:18.320> as<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:18.590> comes<00:03:18.800> in<00:03:18.950> here

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
well as it comes in here

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.050 
well as it comes in here
this<00:03:19.790> lever<00:03:20.170> needs<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.320> be<00:03:21.380> pulled<00:03:21.680> down<00:03:22.060> so

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
this lever needs to be pulled down so

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.280 
this lever needs to be pulled down so
there's<00:03:23.239> like<00:03:23.330> a<00:03:23.390> Kerber<00:03:23.780> here<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.050> it<00:03:24.110> pushes

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
there's like a Kerber here and it pushes

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.670 
there's like a Kerber here and it pushes
these<00:03:24.590> in<00:03:24.830> which<00:03:25.400> push<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:26.720> two<00:03:27.080> brake<00:03:27.320> pads

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
these in which push the two brake pads

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.850 
these in which push the two brake pads
together<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:28.400> disc<00:03:29.390> brake<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.530> spring<00:03:30.830> is

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
together a disc brake and the spring is

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.550 
together a disc brake and the spring is
so<00:03:31.489> it<00:03:31.550> pulls<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:31.910> back<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:33.170> it<00:03:33.230> has<00:03:33.350> like<00:03:33.500> a

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
so it pulls it back so it has like a

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.040 
so it pulls it back so it has like a
retract<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.870> works<00:03:36.110> for<00:03:36.620> most<00:03:36.860> part<00:03:37.160> um<00:03:38.050> not
