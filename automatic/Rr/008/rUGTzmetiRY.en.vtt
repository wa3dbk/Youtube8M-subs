00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
just a little bit so I could play with

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.550 
just a little bit so I could play with
my<00:00:14.219> right<00:00:14.429> hand<00:00:15.020> it's<00:00:16.020> just<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.440> little

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
my right hand it's just a little

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.050 
my right hand it's just a little
difficult<00:00:17.039> with<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.250> tripod<00:00:17.580> right<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.880> front

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
difficult with the tripod right in front

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.849 
difficult with the tripod right in front
of<00:00:18.119> me<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.270> can't<00:00:18.630> get<00:00:19.230> enough<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.470> get<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.740> all

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
of me I can't get enough to get to all

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.769 
of me I can't get enough to get to all
the<00:00:19.890> keys<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.060> one<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.300> need<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.570> play<00:00:21.689> a

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
the keys but this one I need to play a

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.189 
the keys but this one I need to play a
little<00:00:22.109> bit<00:00:22.320> over<00:00:22.500> here<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:22.920> moved<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:24.199> where

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
little bit over here so I moved it where

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.450 
little bit over here so I moved it where
did<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.439> end<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.800> last<00:00:26.430> time<00:00:26.820> oh<00:00:28.070> right<00:00:29.070> we

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
did we end up last time oh right we

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.380 
did we end up last time oh right we
played<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.820> twice<00:00:30.000> over<00:00:30.900> um<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:33.239> way

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
played it twice over um so the way

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.790 
played it twice over um so the way
you're<00:00:33.540> going<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.719> break<00:00:33.840> off<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:36.739> let's<00:00:37.739> start

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
you're going to break off is let's start

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.350 
you're going to break off is let's start
from<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.040> beginning<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.550> then<00:00:38.700> I'll<00:00:38.790> stop

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
from the beginning and then I'll stop

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.330 
from the beginning and then I'll stop
you<00:00:39.390> where<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.320> need<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.500> break<00:00:40.829> up<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.100> think

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
you where you need to break up I think

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.430 
you where you need to break up I think
that's<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.550> simplest<00:00:41.940> way<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:43.200> we

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
that's it simplest way to do it so we

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:56.350 
that's it simplest way to do it so we
start<00:00:43.649> off<00:00:43.860> really<00:00:44.100> slow<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> beginning

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.530 

that<00:00:57.290> was<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.500> first<00:00:57.740> part<00:00:57.980> no<00:00:58.850> problem<00:00:59.270> sir

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
that was the first part no problem sir

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.590 
that was the first part no problem sir
second<00:01:00.320> one<00:01:00.440> we're<00:01:00.680> going<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:00.860> stop<00:01:01.600> right

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
second one we're going to stop right

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.720 
second one we're going to stop right
after<00:01:02.870> would<00:01:03.410> play<00:01:03.620> this<00:01:03.800> crazy<00:01:04.250> one<00:01:04.550> right

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
after would play this crazy one right

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.240 
after would play this crazy one right
here<00:01:04.970> remember<00:01:05.840> that<00:01:05.960> as<00:01:06.710> soon<00:01:06.860> as<00:01:06.950> we<00:01:07.070> play

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
here remember that as soon as we play

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.740 
here remember that as soon as we play
that<00:01:07.490> we're<00:01:07.940> going<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.120> play<00:01:08.300> something<00:01:08.510> else

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
that we're going to play something else

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.030 
that we're going to play something else
on<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.050> right<00:01:09.230> hand<00:01:09.410> it's<00:01:09.590> not<00:01:09.710> going<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:09.980> the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
on the right hand it's not going to the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.820 
on the right hand it's not going to the
same<00:01:10.220> stuff<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:11.750> here's<00:01:12.080> how<00:01:12.260> it<00:01:12.410> sounds

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
same stuff so here's how it sounds

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:23.380 
same stuff so here's how it sounds
before<00:01:13.670> we<00:01:13.820> break<00:01:14.030> off<00:01:21.790> right<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.090> we<00:01:23.150> played

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
before we break off right so we played

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.410 
before we break off right so we played
this<00:01:24.340> so<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.430> second<00:01:25.760> time<00:01:25.880> we'll<00:01:26.060> play<00:01:26.210> this

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
this so the second time we'll play this

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.670 
this so the second time we'll play this
we're<00:01:27.170> going<00:01:27.410> to<00:01:27.500> come<00:01:27.710> with<00:01:28.040> a<00:01:28.070> right<00:01:28.369> hand<00:01:32.680> so

the right hand on a few notes and then
the<00:02:46.739> right<00:02:46.920> hand<00:02:46.950> again<00:02:47.670> remember<00:02:48.600> the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
the right hand again remember the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.790 
the right hand again remember the
beginning<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.140> told<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.470> we're<00:02:49.620> switching

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
beginning I told you we're switching

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.530 
beginning I told you we're switching
back<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.100> forth<00:02:50.310> which<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.120> really<00:02:51.300> simple

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
back and forth which is really simple

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.590 
back and forth which is really simple
well<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.769> course<00:02:52.830> it<00:02:53.580> has<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.090> get<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.450> little

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
well of course it has to get a little

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.979 
well of course it has to get a little
bit<00:02:54.810> more<00:02:54.930> difficult<00:02:55.220> that's<00:02:56.220> why<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.900> know

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
bit more difficult that's why you know

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.290 
bit more difficult that's why you know
takes<00:02:58.230> practice<00:02:58.580> so<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.640> start<00:02:59.940> with<00:03:00.000> this

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
takes practice so you start with this

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.759 
takes practice so you start with this
one<00:03:00.360> we<00:03:00.720> just<00:03:00.900> talked<00:03:01.080> about<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.440> right<00:03:01.620> I'm
