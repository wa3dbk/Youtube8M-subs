00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.180
 this is the most dangerous 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:18.860
 You do not even on the road and there are certain 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.500
 all series are dangerous but 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:27.060
 lily is the most dangerous is champion is 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.940
 the next I'm in the fourth low on 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.540
 automatic car ak the same gear as 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.740
 it rises to the fourth line even though under the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:42.540
 table that gave 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:45.710
 I'm not using brake with the brake 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.710
 motor scania in this result 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:02:00.870
 by 2000 and 2006 by 2 200 ha or at 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:12.950
 times up to 2 300 events generated 2 thousand 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:12.950
 two at most even 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:33.870
 I remembered that it had yellow and should not be 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:48.329
 linked almost not to suffer earlier 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:55.280
 already dropped turn turned on a short time ago 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:55.280
 the Bahian must have been by a can 1664 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:06.810
 left very frank held here in the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:27.080
 brakes can be sure that 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:31.070
 It's hard to hold the champion of life. 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.830
 the cross number was exactly what 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.340
 I took it later and I'm going to put these videos 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:41.680
 for you to see I was acting is coming back 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.680
 I stopped to give him help 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.580
 It is very long although I think that already 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.959
 gives a disguise for this is 48 descent 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.959
 until you get to the right city 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:40.610
 it's really good you go down with a lot more 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:41.870
 the motor to hold the 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:48.699
 emergency 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.699
 if you need the service 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:05:03.740
 now you come down from there some of this farm 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:09.340
 each thinks the way you need or 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.340
 no not for 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:26.979
 under the same circumstances as the first 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.979
 until one below
