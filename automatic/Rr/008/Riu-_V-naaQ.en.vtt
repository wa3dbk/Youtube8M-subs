00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:10.269
 How to make a difficult base make-up and recommended it was requested today 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:17.250
 I would like to introduce foundations and powders 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:17.250
 There are three things that use this but it's all nothing. 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.230
 This is the end of the state that has just been a battleship 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.090
 Well then first Nivea Software etc. 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:37.090
 It sounds like an emerging child who will beat the whole 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:44.170
 Until you become addicted to the height of the video by using plenty of possession 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:46.130
 After Masusono go in knocked me anymore Chappa nature of the hate of powder-free by hand 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.450
 Liquid foundation 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.070
 Hmm 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.160
 From 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.400
 I will spread and paint 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:59.930
 And gradually small parts such as the nose and around the eyes 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.250
 I'll paint, but this is a day kid 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.450
 To and 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:12.680
 It feels so light that it's soothing to put on a sarah like powder 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.680
 I really like it, so I think it is a person with a good coverage too 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.880
 And I firmly firmly so as not to leave unpainted 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.880
 I will hold in the palm of the hand and get familiar 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.520
 And or hotter or According be a good place is pickled pile of this foundation 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:38.509
 There is no place 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:38.509
 I am painted Umayoru God repeatedly as saying this is the place to be worried about because it is 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:09.070
 And I will finish it with finishing powder 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:10.780
 Because it is a company of ballet products, this product has a covering power and is hard to collapse 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.010
 It is powder 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:19.959
 This is really recommended 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.959
 This is a cheap 30 g at 1260 yen 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.390
 It is the point of putting in 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.170
 And 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.620
 Bates the powder with a bang 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.620
 to come 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.950
 This is completed 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.340
 It looks like this when you look at the place where you are not putting the reserve 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.340
 I will 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.580
 Before and after will be like this bears under eyes 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.770
 Naa made 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.280
