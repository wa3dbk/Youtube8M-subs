00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.229
 directive for example 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.710
 how to give a little push to fix the 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:15.180
 classroom to make me realize that if I 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.720
 I was saying it was mania 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.360

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.439
 mess with my school with my classroom with 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.439

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.710

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.680

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.660

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.180
 good this 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.049

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.700

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.700
 I'm walking 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.630
 thank you is well seriously 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.310
 I insist I do not like is it is 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.080
 that you are walking now with 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.700
 this audience is not so important or very 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.510
 political but I will achieve 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.310
 I can give me the debate step 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.800
 you understand, I have to take in my car 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.800
 for your house and it does not cost me 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.150
 night 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.370
 good but a few blocks nothing more 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.370
 statues 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.590
 do not 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.080
 many of you can suddenly do these 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.550
 successes I do not cut myself and I have 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.910
 we need also 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.110
 it's one thing that despite all entity 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.110
 for you but the subject of the pension 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.800
 I could never stop thinking about more 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.580
 me neither 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.540
 Thank you, thank you, thank you for being 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.090
 Although you were insisting yes and 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.070
 Well now you're here with me a bear like that 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.070
 bad hard 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:59.760
 we are different but it does not matter 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.760
 I want it to change, it was traveled 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.110
 I actually live more over there but if 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.980
 I buy something for dinner 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:18.300
 but then it's good because nothing 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:20.930
 I wanted my sister to see that she is 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:26.780
 like a capricious 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:28.970
 nothing raised the tastes and I do not know good 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.760
 actually me too because we 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.880
 we raise together and all but what do I know is 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.340
 like I have a different vision 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.420
 then I learned to value more the 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.320
 things 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:45.350
 and that's why I think different but she is 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:50.770
 good just to live like that I want the 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:53.770
 yecula good thank you and parana too 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.770
 bye 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.520
 What is it 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.070
 and that if we get off that car 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:35.940
 they fixed a couple of classrooms good even 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.940
 whole go agile 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.990
 what are they doing for those who 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.830
 it happens 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.200
 what happens to see good miguelito is a 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.940
 guacho 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.520
 yes it's fine but I'm going to pay not 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:57.699
 grab with the school 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.699
 and always 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.460
 the rest 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.760
 some days the rain came to leave 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.760
 some nights 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.760
 hear 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.310
 I do not want it 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.460
 but you have to wait
