00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
had our like 30 times for something yeah

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.330 
had our like 30 times for something yeah
there<00:04:10.950> we<00:04:11.040> go<00:04:11.069> and<00:04:11.549> then<00:04:12.030> ba<00:04:12.420> ba<00:04:12.599> ba<00:04:12.659> in<00:04:12.930> town

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.319 

that<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:18.570> entire<00:04:18.840> hack<00:04:20.090> okay<00:04:21.090> I

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
that it is that the entire hack okay I

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.710

guess<00:04:22.109> that's<00:04:22.139> it<00:04:22.500> I<00:04:22.710> can't<00:04:23.250> go<00:04:23.490> down<00:04:23.759> and<00:04:24.509> if<00:04:24.660> I

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
guess that's it I can't go down and if I

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.980 
guess that's it I can't go down and if I
