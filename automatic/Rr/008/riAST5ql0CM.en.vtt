very<00:01:07.260> often<00:01:07.740> because<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.460> keep<00:01:08.640> brushing

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
very often because if you keep brushing

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.929 
very often because if you keep brushing
your<00:01:09.270> dog<00:01:09.540> you're<00:01:10.470> brushing<00:01:10.830> out<00:01:11.159> all<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
undercoat that they are supposed to have

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.620 
undercoat that they are supposed to have
to<00:01:14.340> protect<00:01:14.670> him<00:01:14.990> when<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.200> go<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.890> water

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
to protect him when they go in the water

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.800 
to protect him when they go in the water
so<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:19.080> don't<00:01:19.619> wash<00:01:19.860> him<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.880> often<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.600> wash

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so I don't wash him that often I wash

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.929 
so I don't wash him that often I wash
them<00:01:21.990> when<00:01:22.140> he<00:01:22.259> smells<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.570> not<00:01:24.799> regularly

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
them when he smells and not regularly

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
long because the barbed a is supposed to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.109
