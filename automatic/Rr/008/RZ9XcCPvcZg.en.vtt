00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.799
 I have to go a few 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.809
 solve math tasks if we with the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.610
 First we can finish one 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.150
 You are taking friend with you on board 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.150
 ready 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.350
 Before the train starts we have to get one 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.180
 Choose difficulty level on the 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:41.050
 arrow to practice paying first 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:44.280
 which number is the 3 which number is 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.280
 the function 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.980
 which number is the 3 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.680
 Nyse the task 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.990
 In Reckenfeld are most of the rectangles 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.990
 In Reckenfeld you can find most rectangles 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.960
 in which field are the most 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.960
 rectangles 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.380
 satire the parts of cough until 2 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.000
 which character is not a number 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.970
 which character is not a number 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.119
 which sign is not 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.229
 who is allowed to enter next? 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.350
 You can choose and board him or her 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.350
 pull 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.520
 I have to go on the way before the train starts 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:59.640
 in which field is in which field are 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.640
 25 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:15.090
 solve the task count the numbers 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:24.799
 together and pull the right woman in 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:24.799
 The result is three plus one 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.670
 cases the numbers together and trains 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:41.170
 right time 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:41.170
 the result is equal to 65 plus one 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.020
 the numbers together and you the right one 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.020
 number falls in the result 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.249
 three plus one remains 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.170
 sort the numbers from the small 13 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:16.010
 the computing task and pulls the right one 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.010
 number in the result 14 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.630
 solve the computational task and seven 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.630
 right time
