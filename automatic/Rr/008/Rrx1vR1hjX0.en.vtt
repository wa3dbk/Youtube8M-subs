copying what somebody else has already
done<00:00:27.750> but<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.400> an<00:00:29.519> example<00:00:29.640> for<00:00:30.240> you

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
done but it's just an example for you

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.939 
done but it's just an example for you
guys<00:00:30.689> out<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.289> think<00:00:31.560> about<00:00:31.679> something

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
guys out there to think about something

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.660 
guys out there to think about something
else<00:00:32.130> anyways<00:00:32.579> basically<00:00:33.510> he<00:00:33.690> did<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.670> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
else anyways basically he did is the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.119 
else anyways basically he did is the
halos<00:00:36.059> right<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.809> are<00:00:36.989> pretty<00:00:37.380> dark<00:00:37.770> as<00:00:37.980> you

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
halos right here are pretty dark as you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.520 
halos right here are pretty dark as you
can<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.460> there<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.510> swap<00:00:39.989> them<00:00:40.200> out<00:00:40.290> with

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
can see there so you swap them out with

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
can see there so you swap them out with
LEDs<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:43.200> goes<00:00:43.469> through<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> step

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
LEDs and it goes through here the step

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.139 
LEDs and it goes through here the step
by<00:00:44.730> steps<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.239> how<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:46.190> put<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> LEDs<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
by steps on how to put the LEDs in and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
by steps on how to put the LEDs in and
things<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.600> nature<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:50.160> only<00:00:50.370> thing

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
things of that nature the only thing

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.540 
things of that nature the only thing
different<00:00:50.879> he<00:00:51.300> did<00:00:51.570> was<00:00:52.260> he<00:00:52.289> mounted<00:00:52.860> his<00:00:52.920> LEDs

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
different he did was he mounted his LEDs

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.490 
different he did was he mounted his LEDs
to<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:55.340> original<00:00:56.340> halos<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.030> did<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.289> that

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
to the original halos I did not do that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.540 
to the original halos I did not do that
because<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.820> fact<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.800> I<00:01:01.800> believe<00:01:02.399> my

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
because of the fact that I believe my

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.320 
because of the fact that I believe my
halo<00:01:02.760> rings<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.449> i<00:01:03.480> bought<00:01:03.840> which<00:01:04.229> would<00:01:04.470> be

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
halo rings that i bought which would be

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.410 
halo rings that i bought which would be
these<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:07.100> slightly<00:01:08.100> larger<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
these here are slightly larger so it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
these here are slightly larger so it
didn't<00:01:09.630> match<00:01:09.750> up<00:01:09.780> quite<00:01:10.229> perfectly<00:01:10.760> you'll

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
didn't match up quite perfectly you'll

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.820 
didn't match up quite perfectly you'll
see<00:01:11.939> here<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.210> second<00:01:12.650> there's<00:01:13.650> your

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
see here in a second there's your

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.890 
see here in a second there's your
complete<00:01:14.189> finished<00:01:14.700> product<00:01:15.119> he<00:01:15.390> had<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.630> do

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
complete finished product he had to do

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.980 
complete finished product he had to do
some<00:01:16.110> grinding<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:17.720> there<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.869> go

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
some grinding out there you go

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.649 
some grinding out there you go
unfortunately<00:01:19.950> he<00:01:20.159> doesn't<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.909> photos<00:01:21.479> or

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
unfortunately he doesn't have photos or

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.710 
unfortunately he doesn't have photos or
he<00:01:21.840> does<00:01:22.640> but<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.880> been<00:01:24.090> deleted<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.570> moved

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720

here<00:02:22.459> how<00:02:22.580> does<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:22.819> work<00:02:23.000> ok<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:24.110> as<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:25.220> can

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
here how does this work ok so as you can

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.089 
here how does this work ok so as you can
see<00:02:25.519> in<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.730> photo<00:02:26.349> they<00:02:27.349> look<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.680> lot<00:02:27.860> like

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
see in the photo they look a lot like

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.229 
see in the photo they look a lot like
this<00:02:28.720> this<00:02:29.720> is<00:02:29.900> missing<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.470> glass<00:02:31.000> which<00:02:32.000> is

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
this this is missing the glass which is

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.240 
this this is missing the glass which is
here<00:02:33.549> so<00:02:34.549> what<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:35.000> have<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.239> do<00:02:35.569> is<00:02:35.870> they<00:02:36.860> come

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
here so what you have to do is they come

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.150 
here so what you have to do is they come
together<00:02:37.519> here<00:02:38.030> we<00:02:38.299> go<00:02:38.420> like<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.140> as<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:40.069> can

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
see I've already put the halo ring in

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.720 
see I've already put the halo ring in
this<00:02:42.110> one<00:02:42.319> but<00:02:43.160> they<00:02:43.310> come<00:02:43.459> together<00:02:43.670> as<00:02:44.230> so

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
this one but they come together as so

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.949 
this one but they come together as so
and<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:48.440> need<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.950> hold<00:02:49.250> on<00:02:49.630> unlike<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.660> other

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
and you need to hold on unlike the other

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.320 
and you need to hold on unlike the other

less around the glass like so and you

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.009 
less around the glass like so and you
could<00:03:15.560> pull<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.880> apart<00:03:17.090> once<00:03:17.569> it's<00:03:17.780> pulled

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
you'll notice the inside here the bulbs

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.810 
you'll notice the inside here the bulbs
they<00:04:50.460> don't<00:04:50.640> they<00:04:51.120> don't<00:04:51.150> fit<00:04:52.670> actually<00:04:53.670> this

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
they don't they don't fit actually this

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.440 
they don't they don't fit actually this
bulb<00:04:54.120> here<00:04:54.570> I've<00:04:54.960> already<00:04:55.760> had<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:56.820> grind<00:04:57.180> off

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
bulb here I've already had to grind off

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.420 
bulb here I've already had to grind off
the<00:04:57.720> tabs<00:04:58.020> to<00:04:58.710> make<00:04:58.860> them<00:04:59.040> fit<00:04:59.250> in<00:04:59.340> the

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
the tabs to make them fit in the

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.720 
the tabs to make them fit in the
headlights<00:05:00.200> but<00:05:01.200> it<00:05:01.320> still<00:05:02.040> doesn't<00:05:02.280> fit<00:05:02.610> in

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
headlights but it still doesn't fit in

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.490 
headlights but it still doesn't fit in
here<00:05:03.090> with<00:05:03.240> these<00:05:03.390> two<00:05:03.600> screw<00:05:03.930> holes<00:05:03.960> in<00:05:04.320> this

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
here with these two screw holes in this

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.640 
here with these two screw holes in this
so<00:05:05.490> i<00:05:05.820> took<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.240> dremel<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:06.960> I<00:05:07.380> ground

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
so i took the dremel and I ground

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.260 
so i took the dremel and I ground
everything<00:05:08.100> out<00:05:08.280> and<00:05:08.460> now<00:05:09.210> it<00:05:09.420> fits<00:05:09.570> in<00:05:09.810> nicely

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
everything out and now it fits in nicely

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.790 
everything out and now it fits in nicely
I'm<00:05:12.270> thinking<00:05:12.930> this<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.200> going<00:05:13.290> to<00:05:13.380> be<00:05:13.530> a

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
I'm thinking this is going to be a

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.190 
I'm thinking this is going to be a
one-off<00:05:14.220> deal<00:05:14.640> when<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.390> bulbs<00:05:15.690> go<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:16.080> whole

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
one-off deal when the bulbs go the whole

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.990 
one-off deal when the bulbs go the whole
things<00:05:16.500> done<00:05:16.770> because<00:05:17.280> I'm<00:05:17.430> probably<00:05:17.700> going

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
things done because I'm probably going

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.850 
things done because I'm probably going
to<00:05:18.980> put<00:05:19.980> a<00:05:20.160> bead<00:05:20.550> of<00:05:20.690> sealant<00:05:21.690> around<00:05:22.020> here<00:05:22.590> so

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
to put a bead of sealant around here so

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.450 
to put a bead of sealant around here so
it's<00:05:23.010> watertight<00:05:24.710> otherwise<00:05:25.710> what<00:05:26.010> he<00:05:26.190> did<00:05:26.370> in

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
it's watertight otherwise what he did in

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.630 
it's watertight otherwise what he did in
his<00:05:26.610> video<00:05:26.850> was<00:05:27.600> he<00:05:27.780> drilled<00:05:28.140> a<00:05:28.230> hole<00:05:28.260> in<00:05:28.830> the

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
his video was he drilled a hole in the

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.780 
his video was he drilled a hole in the
cover<00:05:29.970> so<00:05:30.960> it<00:05:31.110> went<00:05:31.320> on<00:05:31.410> top<00:05:31.800> which<00:05:32.400> is<00:05:32.550> great

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
cover so it went on top which is great

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.580 
cover so it went on top which is great
and<00:05:32.820> all<00:05:33.030> but<00:05:33.090> I<00:05:33.450> have<00:05:33.540> nowhere<00:05:33.870> to<00:05:34.140> screw<00:05:34.410> them

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
and all but I have nowhere to screw them

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.330 
and all but I have nowhere to screw them
in<00:05:35.240> or<00:05:36.240> in<00:05:36.390> his<00:05:36.510> in<00:05:36.750> his<00:05:36.780> article<00:05:37.190> so<00:05:38.190> I'm

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
in or in his in his article so I'm

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.620 
in or in his in his article so I'm
probably<00:05:38.520> just<00:05:38.730> going<00:05:38.910> to<00:05:39.000> do<00:05:39.120> it<00:05:39.240> that<00:05:39.419> way<00:05:39.600> or

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
probably just going to do it that way or

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.300 
probably just going to do it that way or
maybe<00:05:39.990> I'll<00:05:40.169> do<00:05:40.290> both<00:05:40.530> I'm<00:05:40.770> not<00:05:40.950> sure<00:05:41.010> we'll

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
maybe I'll do both I'm not sure we'll

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.550 
maybe I'll do both I'm not sure we'll
see<00:05:41.460> anyways<00:05:42.210> um<00:05:42.950> so<00:05:43.950> it<00:05:44.610> all<00:05:44.730> comes<00:05:45.000> together

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
see anyways um so it all comes together

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.310 
see anyways um so it all comes together
like<00:05:46.560> this<00:05:46.830> and<00:05:47.190> then<00:05:48.169> that<00:05:49.169> sits<00:05:49.590> in<00:05:49.860> here

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
like this and then that sits in here

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:58.670 
like this and then that sits in here
like<00:05:52.320> so<00:05:54.290> let's<00:05:55.290> do<00:05:55.440> this<00:05:55.620> example<00:05:57.350> that<00:05:58.350> sits

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
like so let's do this example that sits

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.159 
like so let's do this example that sits
in<00:05:58.860> there<00:05:59.040> like<00:05:59.310> so<00:05:59.760> and<00:06:00.030> then<00:06:00.600> you've<00:06:00.900> got

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
in there like so and then you've got

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:06.920 
in there like so and then you've got
your<00:06:02.390> glass<00:06:03.410> with<00:06:04.410> your<00:06:04.620> halo<00:06:05.010> ring<00:06:05.450> that<00:06:06.450> sits

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
your glass with your halo ring that sits

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.150 
your glass with your halo ring that sits
like<00:06:07.830> this<00:06:08.390> and<00:06:09.390> it<00:06:09.540> all<00:06:09.690> sits<00:06:10.650> there<00:06:10.860> halo

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
like this and it all sits there halo

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.690 
like this and it all sits there halo
rings<00:06:11.490> are<00:06:11.610> obviously<00:06:12.030> very<00:06:12.150> large<00:06:13.430> but<00:06:14.430> you

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
rings are obviously very large but you

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.780 
rings are obviously very large but you
know<00:06:14.820> it<00:06:14.970> is<00:06:15.000> what<00:06:15.210> it<00:06:15.270> is<00:06:15.360> and<00:06:16.220> i<00:06:17.220> guess<00:06:17.760> the

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
know it is what it is and i guess the

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.220 
know it is what it is and i guess the
nice<00:06:18.060> thing<00:06:18.240> about<00:06:18.300> that<00:06:18.570> is<00:06:18.630> if<00:06:18.840> I<00:06:18.900> got<00:06:19.080> one

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
nice thing about that is if I got one

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.740 
nice thing about that is if I got one
slightly<00:06:19.740> smaller<00:06:20.250> in<00:06:20.490> diameter<00:06:20.610> I<00:06:21.180> can<00:06:21.660> have

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
slightly smaller in diameter I can have

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.390 
slightly smaller in diameter I can have
a<00:06:21.810> double<00:06:22.050> halo<00:06:22.350> I'm<00:06:22.650> not<00:06:22.860> sure<00:06:22.919> how<00:06:23.190> that

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
a double halo I'm not sure how that

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.790 
a double halo I'm not sure how that
would<00:06:23.520> look<00:06:23.580> if<00:06:23.940> that<00:06:24.419> was<00:06:24.600> the<00:06:24.720> case<00:06:24.750> may<00:06:25.620> be<00:06:25.650> I

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
would look if that was the case may be I

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.580 
would look if that was the case may be I
would<00:06:26.039> use<00:06:26.280> the

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
would use the

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:34.520 
would use the
stock<00:06:26.860> halo<00:06:32.670> maybe<00:06:33.670> I<00:06:33.790> would<00:06:34.000> put<00:06:34.210> it<00:06:34.240> around

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
stock halo maybe I would put it around

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.140 
stock halo maybe I would put it around
the<00:06:35.530> halo<00:06:35.740> that<00:06:35.980> it<00:06:36.100> comes<00:06:36.340> with<00:06:36.430> to<00:06:36.820> hold<00:06:37.030> it

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
the halo that it comes with to hold it

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.930 
the halo that it comes with to hold it
in<00:06:37.270> as<00:06:37.450> you<00:06:38.020> can<00:06:38.140> see<00:06:38.380> it's<00:06:39.160> not<00:06:39.430> the<00:06:39.580> perfect

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
in as you can see it's not the perfect

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.170 
in as you can see it's not the perfect
fit<00:06:40.620> so<00:06:41.620> then<00:06:41.860> double<00:06:42.520> halo<00:06:42.670> I'm<00:06:42.970> not<00:06:43.120> sure

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
fit so then double halo I'm not sure

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.370 
fit so then double halo I'm not sure
we'll<00:06:43.540> see<00:06:43.800> but<00:06:44.800> either<00:06:45.010> way<00:06:45.510> that's<00:06:46.510> kind<00:06:47.230> of

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
we'll see but either way that's kind of

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.230 
we'll see but either way that's kind of
how<00:06:47.560> you're<00:06:47.830> going<00:06:48.040> to<00:06:48.310> need<00:06:48.490> to<00:06:48.520> put<00:06:49.060> these

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
how you're going to need to put these

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.070 
how you're going to need to put these
things<00:06:49.480> together<00:06:51.450> you<00:06:52.450> could<00:06:52.600> see<00:06:52.750> my<00:06:52.960> other

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
things together you could see my other

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.900 
things together you could see my other
videos<00:06:53.170> as<00:06:53.770> far<00:06:53.980> as<00:06:54.130> getting<00:06:54.280> clogged<00:06:54.640> lights

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910 
videos as far as getting clogged lights

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.910 
videos as far as getting clogged lights
in<00:06:55.060> or<00:06:55.180> out<00:06:55.330> so<00:06:55.960> really<00:06:56.380> putting<00:06:56.650> the<00:06:56.740> fog

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
in or out so really putting the fog

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.830 
in or out so really putting the fog
lights<00:06:57.190> in<00:06:57.430> is<00:06:57.640> not<00:06:58.180> going<00:06:58.300> to<00:06:58.360> be<00:06:58.480> that<00:06:58.510> big<00:06:58.810> of

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
lights in is not going to be that big of

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.020 
lights in is not going to be that big of
a<00:06:58.990> deal<00:06:59.200> it's<00:06:59.980> already<00:07:00.250> has<00:07:00.460> the<00:07:00.610> brackets

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
a deal it's already has the brackets

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.570 
a deal it's already has the brackets
here<00:07:01.090> for<00:07:01.540> the<00:07:01.660> Jeep<00:07:01.870> which<00:07:02.410> I<00:07:02.620> believe<00:07:02.860> is<00:07:02.920> the

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
here for the Jeep which I believe is the

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.680 
here for the Jeep which I believe is the
screw<00:07:03.820> holes<00:07:04.000> which<00:07:04.150> i<00:07:04.270> think<00:07:04.330> is<00:07:04.510> pretty

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:04.690 
screw holes which i think is pretty

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:08.280 
screw holes which i think is pretty
similar<00:07:05.020> to<00:07:05.320> the<00:07:05.470> 300<00:07:06.010> if<00:07:06.700> not<00:07:06.970> I<00:07:07.270> drill<00:07:07.870> inside

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.290 
similar to the 300 if not I drill inside

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.280 
similar to the 300 if not I drill inside
spots<00:07:08.650> or<00:07:08.860> something<00:07:09.130> not<00:07:09.370> not<00:07:09.730> concerned<00:07:10.290> but

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.290 
spots or something not not concerned but

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.180 
spots or something not not concerned but
anyways<00:07:11.650> so<00:07:12.570> it's<00:07:13.570> going<00:07:13.660> to<00:07:13.720> fit<00:07:13.930> in<00:07:14.190> I'll

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.190 
anyways so it's going to fit in I'll

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.790 
anyways so it's going to fit in I'll
show<00:07:15.580> you<00:07:15.640> the<00:07:15.910> finished<00:07:16.090> version<00:07:16.420> here<00:07:17.260> soon
