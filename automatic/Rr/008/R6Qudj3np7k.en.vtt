00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.240
 welcome to my stupidity I am channel 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.430

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.470
 leverage your time listening to what 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.750
 want and when they want I am 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.530
 talking about downloading audio from books 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.600
 articles lectures movies poetry 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.430
 and more for it, they 're just going to have 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.910
 that go to the next page called i 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.789
 box where they will look for what they want in 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.560
 my marketing case 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.980
 at the bottom are all the 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.250
 results we can listen to them online and 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.590
 see others hate the author 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.720
 although there are categories such as 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.870
 history sport science 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.010
 music and so on once we've already 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.500
 chosen the option 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.090
 this player where we are going to be able 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.310
 listen to it but we can also 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.170
 download by clicking on this box 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.930
 now if you do not like to wait so long 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.490
 I recommend that you have the and dm that with 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.720
 only one click 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.790
 download the audio as well as the time 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.180

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.160

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.860

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.510
 especially when they study is in the 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.520
 university for example they send them to 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.110
 bundle books that can be found and 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.500
 they simply listen to it while going to 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.720

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.400
