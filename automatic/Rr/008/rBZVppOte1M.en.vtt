00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
was really not so much about Bridal but

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.870 
was really not so much about Bridal but
about<00:00:15.850> fashion<00:00:16.830> particularly<00:00:17.830> this<00:00:18.100> season<00:00:18.670> I

about fashion particularly this season I

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.960 
about fashion particularly this season I
was<00:00:19.150> very<00:00:19.390> inspired<00:00:19.750> by<00:00:20.189> witches<00:00:21.189> and<00:00:21.490> covens

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
was very inspired by witches and covens

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.720 
was very inspired by witches and covens
and<00:00:22.290> the<00:00:23.290> fact<00:00:23.560> that<00:00:23.650> broto<00:00:23.980> could<00:00:24.340> be<00:00:24.460> viewed

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
and the fact that broto could be viewed

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.940 
and the fact that broto could be viewed
in<00:00:24.849> a<00:00:24.970> totally<00:00:25.509> different<00:00:25.570> perspective<00:00:26.170> I've

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
in a totally different perspective I've

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.740 
in a totally different perspective I've
always<00:00:27.279> tried<00:00:27.550> to<00:00:27.610> convey<00:00:28.000> a<00:00:28.029> certain<00:00:28.480> sense

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
always tried to convey a certain sense

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.170 
always tried to convey a certain sense
of<00:00:28.899> mystery<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:29.739> beauty<00:00:30.520> with<00:00:30.669> Bridal<00:00:31.149> and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
of mystery and beauty with Bridal and

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.139 
of mystery and beauty with Bridal and
sensuality<00:00:32.050> but<00:00:32.520> choosing<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.610> work<00:00:33.850> in

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
sensuality but choosing the work in

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.720 
sensuality but choosing the work in
underwear<00:00:34.989> colors<00:00:35.440> such<00:00:35.739> as<00:00:35.890> nude<00:00:36.190> -<00:00:36.460> black

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
underwear colors such as nude - black

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.540 
underwear colors such as nude - black
helped<00:00:37.690> to<00:00:37.840> create<00:00:38.170> a<00:00:38.200> whole<00:00:38.800> different<00:00:38.829> sense

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
helped to create a whole different sense

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.910 
helped to create a whole different sense
of<00:00:41.100> darkness<00:00:42.100> and<00:00:42.460> beauty<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:43.600> freedom<00:00:44.290> and<00:00:44.739> I

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
of darkness and beauty and freedom and I

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.390 
of darkness and beauty and freedom and I
think<00:00:45.600> exploring<00:00:46.600> that<00:00:46.840> is<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.950> whole<00:00:48.160> reason

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
think exploring that is the whole reason

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.300 
think exploring that is the whole reason
this<00:00:48.820> collection<00:00:49.270> I<00:00:49.690> thought<00:00:50.260> so<00:00:50.560> monumental

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
this collection I thought so monumental

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.330 
this collection I thought so monumental
and<00:00:51.490> creative<00:00:51.970> for<00:00:52.180> me
