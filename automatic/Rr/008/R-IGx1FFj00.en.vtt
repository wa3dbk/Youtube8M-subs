00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 all rhythms are based and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.899
 they primarily use a few 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.150
 basic concepts which are 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.800
 They repeated throughout the course in several 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.599
 lessons 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.460
 it is important to understand these concepts 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.000
 before starting to practice 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.119
 lessons in this app chords doubling 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.710
 the eighth this is the triad of C major 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.130
 of my sun we can double the first note 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.340
 in octave above and we have and we can 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.710
 do in any investment 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.660
 this is a very pianistic resource and 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.430
 easy to make 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.810
 we will also get a voicing of 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.810
 four voices for the triads 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.690
 the eighth is a very stable interval 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.179
 with which we get a lot sound 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.079
 fuller without altering the loudness of the 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:53.199
 food 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.600
 besides having four notes we can 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.159
 create better lines voice to voice when 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.159
 we have chords in seventh 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.260
 chords in blocks or broken the triad 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.110
 we can break it in bulk as a block 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.440
 with simple notes using any 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.440
 Pattern 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.689
 in the left hand 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.800
 perfect octaves and fifths in the hand 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.560
 left 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.540
 in the left hand the use of octaves and 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.540
 fifth is the most effective when 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.760
 we create accompaniments on the piano and 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.230
 that these intervals sound better than 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.870
 others in the low register 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.070
 we are going to use this technique in almost 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.480
 all the exercises of the course 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.480
 in C major or minor 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.939
 tenths and sevenths in the left hand 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.700
 for examples with more tension as in 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:00.000
 jazz blues or gospel we can use 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.430
 tenths or sevenths in 27 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.760
 as you can see these intervals create 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.170
 much more tension than the eighth or fifth 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.179
 but they sound very good when 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.300
 we combine with voisins in the hand 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.300
 right 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.140
 ninth added and second suspended the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.850
 second that is also the ninth is 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.730
 almost always available in any 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.190
 I agreed and we're going to use the added ninth 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.650
 or the second suspended replacing the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.860
 third in several lessons throughout 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.790
 of the course we can play more with the 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.510
 ninth added or greater with the ninth 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.060
 suspended here the third one is replaced 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.489
 what is my 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.770
 the use of the novena is a very resource 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.440
 common and adds an interesting color to 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.510
 chord without changing its function or sound 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.110
 basic and we will use it with 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.110
 frequency 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.020
 and eighth-note accents with 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.030
 swing or even these concepts are 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.490
 probably the most important when 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.860
 we accompany the rhythm not only creates 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.680
 when we play the note but also 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.680
 it is fundamental how we touch them we are going to 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.750
 use accents joints and ya fox 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.270
 or swing on the eighth note to create the 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.160
 Accompaniments in different styles is 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.410
 impossible to create a good accompaniment 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.750
 without considering where to put the 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.230
 accents and what kind of joints 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.090
 playing is not the same playing eight eighth notes 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.090
 even or couples without accents or 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.040
 joints that touch the same 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.970
 even eighth notes with accents 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.930
 with swing 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.010
 or touch a line above time or 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.010
 back of time 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.700
 cortez what jls or the scale 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.129
 corresponding to the chord 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.560
 when we play an agreed on a song 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.870
 we are not just touching the notes 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.690
 of the chord rather a sound in 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.500
 particular, we can almost always associate 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.490
 this sound at a specific scale 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.770
 for example in a song of C major 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:12.610
 I remember, it's working 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.790
 like 27 we can associate the scale 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.040
 of rhetoric which implies that we have 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.570
 all the notes of the scale to create 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.820
 voisins and patterns 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.070
 to use this concept is 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.230
 fundamental to have a basic knowledge 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.780
 of harmony with which we can associate 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.889
 a chord with a function and ende with a 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.930
 scale 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.599
 if you want to go deeper into the subject 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.610
 check our other harmony application 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.020
 tonal pro which is an excellent 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.849
 tool to learn these 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.090
 harmonic concepts in all 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.090
 tonalities
