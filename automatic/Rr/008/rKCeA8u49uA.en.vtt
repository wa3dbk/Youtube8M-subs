continue to spin the ball and it's just

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.709 
continue to spin the ball and it's just
kind<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.280> really<00:02:05.790> spinny<00:02:06.240> kind<00:02:06.659> of

weak shot and they really struggle
finishing<00:02:08.940> points<00:02:09.390> because<00:02:09.929> they<00:02:10.080> just

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
finishing points because they just

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.650

topspin<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:51.690> if<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.870> have<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.020> very

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
topspin and so if you have a very

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.320 
topspin and so if you have a very
extreme<00:03:52.709> grip<00:03:52.920> one<00:03:53.220> way<00:03:53.370> or<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:53.640> other<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:54.150> can

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
extreme grip one way or the other it can

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.350 
extreme grip one way or the other it can
very<00:03:54.540> often<00:03:54.950> lend<00:03:55.950> itself<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.610> giving<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:57.330> a

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
very often lend itself to giving you a

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.300 
very often lend itself to giving you a
natural<00:03:57.959> ability<00:03:58.050> to<00:03:58.500> create<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.860> whole<00:03:59.100> bunch

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
natural ability to create a whole bunch

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.060 
natural ability to create a whole bunch
of<00:03:59.430> one<00:03:59.700> but<00:04:00.060> not<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.600> other<00:04:00.900> okay<00:04:01.500> hopefully

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
of one but not the other okay hopefully

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.590 
of one but not the other okay hopefully
that's<00:04:02.220> making<00:04:02.580> sense

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
that's making sense

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.190 
that's making sense
amad<00:04:03.980> so<00:04:04.980> in<00:04:05.280> my<00:04:05.520> experience<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:06.600> in<00:04:07.050> my

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
amad so in my experience and in my

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.530 
amad so in my experience and in my
opinion<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:08.160> best<00:04:08.400> grip<00:04:08.670> on<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.910> forehand<00:04:09.330> is

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
opinion the best grip on the forehand is

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.050 
opinion the best grip on the forehand is
either<00:04:09.780> in<00:04:10.320> eastern<00:04:10.739> or<00:04:10.920> semi<00:04:11.220> Western<00:04:11.459> or

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
either in eastern or semi Western or

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.060 
either in eastern or semi Western or
some<00:04:12.720> something<00:04:13.230> in<00:04:13.410> between<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:13.920> know<00:04:14.010> it

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
some something in between you know it

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.620 
some something in between you know it
doesn't<00:04:14.190> have<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.610> be<00:04:14.730> just<00:04:14.760> straight<00:04:15.209> one<00:04:15.510> or

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
doesn't have to be just straight one or

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.090 
doesn't have to be just straight one or
the<00:04:15.750> other<00:04:15.870> Eastern<00:04:16.320> or<00:04:16.440> semi<00:04:16.650> Western

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
the other Eastern or semi Western

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.070 
the other Eastern or semi Western
because<00:04:17.609> both<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:17.970> those<00:04:18.239> grips<00:04:18.510> put<00:04:18.900> your

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
because both of those grips put your

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.650 
because both of those grips put your
hands<00:04:19.590> in<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:20.100> position<00:04:20.549> in<00:04:20.700> between<00:04:20.970> the

hands in a position in between the

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.000 
hands in a position in between the

extremes now Roger Federer and

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.490 
extremes now Roger Federer and
actually<00:04:26.280> many<00:04:26.640> other<00:04:26.880> players<00:04:27.210> uses<00:04:28.080> just<00:04:28.350> an

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
actually many other players uses just an

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.860 
actually many other players uses just an
Eastern<00:04:28.920> forehand<00:04:29.220> grip<00:04:29.640> now<00:04:30.390> he's<00:04:30.630> still

Eastern forehand grip now he's still

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.200 
Eastern forehand grip now he's still
able<00:04:31.200> to<00:04:31.290> make<00:04:31.410> plenty<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:32.070> topspin<00:04:32.580> trust<00:04:33.000> me

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
able to make plenty of topspin trust me

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.810 
able to make plenty of topspin trust me
a<00:04:33.420> lot<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.140> people<00:04:34.410> out<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.770> lot<00:04:35.130> of<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.370> tuning

in today might say oh well yeah Roger
Federer<00:04:38.490> makes<00:04:38.730> topspin<00:04:39.570> but<00:04:39.750> not<00:04:39.870> as<00:04:40.020> much<00:04:40.140> as

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
Federer makes topspin but not as much as

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.380 
Federer makes topspin but not as much as
Nadal<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.550> doll<00:04:41.730> has<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:41.970> more<00:04:42.270> aggressive

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
Nadal and the doll has a more aggressive

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.410 
Nadal and the doll has a more aggressive
grip<00:04:42.960> well<00:04:43.680> yes<00:04:43.920> but<00:04:44.160> Nadal<00:04:44.460> also<00:04:44.820> creates

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
grip well yes but Nadal also creates

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.210 
grip well yes but Nadal also creates
more<00:04:45.570> topspin<00:04:46.050> than<00:04:46.200> anybody<00:04:46.560> in<00:04:46.830> human

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
more topspin than anybody in human

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.690 
more topspin than anybody in human
history<00:04:47.610> in<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.750> game<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:49.080> tennis<00:04:49.320> so<00:04:49.950> if<00:04:50.460> you

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
history in the game of tennis so if you

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.550 
history in the game of tennis so if you
need<00:04:50.880> topspin<00:04:51.360> it<00:04:51.510> doesn't<00:04:51.780> it<00:04:52.020> doesn't<00:04:52.410> mean

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
need topspin it doesn't it doesn't mean

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.500 
need topspin it doesn't it doesn't mean
that<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:52.800> have<00:04:52.980> to<00:04:53.010> copy<00:04:53.730> in<00:04:53.940> a<00:04:54.000> doll<00:04:54.210> and<00:04:54.390> use

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
that you have to copy in a doll and use

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.840 
that you have to copy in a doll and use
the<00:04:54.630> exact<00:04:54.930> exact<00:04:55.440> same<00:04:55.650> grip<00:04:55.920> and<00:04:56.130> you<00:04:56.760> know

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
the exact exact same grip and you know

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.310 
the exact exact same grip and you know
finish<00:04:57.120> with<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.420> reverse<00:04:57.720> follow-through

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
finish with the reverse follow-through

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.320 
finish with the reverse follow-through
and<00:04:58.470> all<00:04:58.560> that<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:59.460> can<00:04:59.610> still<00:04:59.880> make<00:04:59.910> plenty

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
and all that you can still make plenty

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.750 
and all that you can still make plenty
of<00:05:00.540> spin<00:05:00.870> with<00:05:01.770> just<00:05:02.190> an<00:05:02.340> Eastern<00:05:02.730> forehand

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
of spin with just an Eastern forehand

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.810 
of spin with just an Eastern forehand
grip<00:05:03.420> so<00:05:03.840> so<00:05:04.350> which<00:05:04.530> should<00:05:04.560> you<00:05:04.740> use<00:05:05.040> Eastern

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
grip so so which should you use Eastern

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.300 
grip so so which should you use Eastern
forehand<00:05:06.060> or<00:05:06.300> semi<00:05:06.510> western<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.770> really

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
forehand or semi western it really

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.400 
forehand or semi western it really
depends<00:05:08.790> on<00:05:08.850> your<00:05:09.860> body<00:05:11.270> your<00:05:12.270> natural<00:05:12.870> swing

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
depends on your body your natural swing

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.220 
depends on your body your natural swing
motion<00:05:14.100> on<00:05:14.310> that<00:05:14.610> forehand<00:05:15.240> side<00:05:15.450> a<00:05:15.780> med

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
motion on that forehand side a med

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.320 
motion on that forehand side a med
depends<00:05:17.220> on<00:05:17.310> which<00:05:17.460> one<00:05:17.610> you<00:05:17.730> kind<00:05:17.940> of<00:05:18.030> pick<00:05:18.180> up

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
depends on which one you kind of pick up

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.750 
depends on which one you kind of pick up
most<00:05:18.570> easily<00:05:18.900> and<00:05:19.260> in<00:05:19.830> my<00:05:19.950> opinion<00:05:20.100> which<00:05:20.550> one

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
most easily and in my opinion which one

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.500 
most easily and in my opinion which one
allows<00:05:21.030> you<00:05:21.410> to<00:05:22.410> hit<00:05:22.800> with<00:05:23.010> Drive<00:05:23.460> and<00:05:23.730> spin

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
allows you to hit with Drive and spin

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.200 
allows you to hit with Drive and spin
relatively<00:05:25.410> comfortably<00:05:25.920> and<00:05:26.280> it<00:05:26.940> very

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
relatively comfortably and it very

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.030 
relatively comfortably and it very
possibly<00:05:27.870> may<00:05:28.020> be<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.320> case<00:05:28.470> that<00:05:28.530> you<00:05:28.800> still

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
possibly may be the case that you still

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.490 
possibly may be the case that you still
naturally<00:05:29.670> do<00:05:30.150> one<00:05:30.450> a<00:05:30.720> little<00:05:31.020> bit<00:05:31.110> easier

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
naturally do one a little bit easier

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.650 
naturally do one a little bit easier
than<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.740> other<00:05:32.060> but<00:05:33.060> you<00:05:33.180> should<00:05:33.360> at<00:05:33.450> least

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
than the other but you should at least

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.230 
than the other but you should at least
have<00:05:34.040> the<00:05:35.040> feel<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:36.030> ability<00:05:36.360> to<00:05:36.840> do<00:05:37.710> both<00:05:38.240> you

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
have the feel the ability to do both you

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.540 
have the feel the ability to do both you
know<00:05:39.300> relatively<00:05:39.810> easily<00:05:40.170> if<00:05:40.620> you<00:05:41.070> if<00:05:41.280> you<00:05:41.400> try

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
know relatively easily if you if you try

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.250 
know relatively easily if you if you try
one<00:05:41.910> of<00:05:41.940> those<00:05:42.120> grips<00:05:42.450> or<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:42.690> other<00:05:42.840> and<00:05:43.140> you

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
one of those grips or the other and you
