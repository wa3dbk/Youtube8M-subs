comfort<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.079> durability<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.950> decided<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.939> was

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
comfort and durability I decided it was

you will notice that the earcups are
relatively<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.099> same<00:02:23.219> size<00:02:23.540> now<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.780> far<00:02:24.900> as

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
sturdy far as the x 41 s go they do feel

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.729 
sturdy far as the x 41 s go they do feel
a<00:02:35.819> little<00:02:36.060> bit<00:02:36.209> plasticky<00:02:36.450> they<00:02:37.349> don't<00:02:37.530> feel

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
a little bit plasticky they don't feel

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.129 
a little bit plasticky they don't feel
cheap<00:02:38.099> though<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:39.180> one<00:02:39.599> thing<00:02:39.780> that's<00:02:39.930> great

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
cheap though but one thing that's great

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.080 
cheap though but one thing that's great
about<00:02:40.170> these<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.620> since<00:02:41.340> they<00:02:41.489> are<00:02:41.579> wireless

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
about these is since they are wireless

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.119 
about these is since they are wireless
and<00:02:42.299> since<00:02:42.510> they<00:02:42.689> are<00:02:42.840> most<00:02:43.290> part<00:02:43.530> plastic

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
and since they are most part plastic

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.610 
and since they are most part plastic
they<00:02:44.579> are<00:02:44.760> super<00:02:45.120> super<00:02:45.870> super<00:02:46.230> lightweight

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
they are super super super lightweight

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.220 
they are super super super lightweight
this<00:02:47.040> will<00:02:47.489> definitely<00:02:47.700> be<00:02:48.419> a<00:02:48.450> good<00:02:48.930> trait<00:02:49.200> to

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
this will definitely be a good trait to

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
I said before this headset does use

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.960 
I said before this headset does use
eight<00:03:42.180> dedicated<00:03:42.959> speaker<00:03:43.409> drivers<00:03:43.919> and<00:03:44.189> I

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
eight dedicated speaker drivers and I

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.280 
eight dedicated speaker drivers and I
noticed<00:03:45.299> that<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.629> surround<00:03:46.169> sound

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
noticed that the surround sound

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.610 
noticed that the surround sound
experience<00:03:47.419> did<00:03:48.419> sound<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:48.959> best<00:03:49.139> on<00:03:49.379> these

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
experience did sound the best on these

leave the actual sound quality behind if

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.420 
leave the actual sound quality behind if
you're<00:04:01.530> looking<00:04:01.620> for<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.949> best<00:04:02.040> surround

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430

sound<00:04:02.759> experience<00:04:02.939> and<00:04:03.629> you<00:04:04.109> don't<00:04:04.259> really

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
sound experience and you don't really

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.469

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
diminished because of so then I think

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.059 
diminished because of so then I think
the<00:04:08.819> ax<00:04:09.659> pros<00:04:10.019> would<00:04:10.590> be<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.859> right<00:04:11.040> choice
