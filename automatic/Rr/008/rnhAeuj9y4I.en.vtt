is<00:02:05.340> actually<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.939> design<00:02:06.270> grill<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.719> you

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
is actually just a design grill and you

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.589 
is actually just a design grill and you
have<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.049> volume<00:02:07.380> rockers<00:02:08.060> almost<00:02:09.060> identical

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
have the volume rockers almost identical

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.240 
have the volume rockers almost identical
to<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.840> design<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.470> saw<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.800> HTC

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
to the design that you saw on the HTC

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.040 
to the design that you saw on the HTC
One

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
One

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.410 
One
on<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.230> top<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:12.830> flip<00:02:13.220> cover<00:02:13.700> port<00:02:14.030> which

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
on the top is this flip cover port which

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.210 
on the top is this flip cover port which
covers<00:02:15.080> your<00:02:15.200> SIM<00:02:15.380> card<00:02:15.560> slot<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.010> micro

covers your SIM card slot and the micro
SD<00:02:16.490> card<00:02:16.700> slot<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.180> do<00:02:17.360> get<00:02:17.450> expandability

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
SD card slot so you do get expandability

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.960 
SD card slot so you do get expandability
you<00:02:18.980> also<00:02:19.160> have<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.310> power<00:02:19.490> button<00:02:19.580> which<00:02:19.940> has

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
you also have a power button which has

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.980

like<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:28.940> said<00:02:29.120> earlier<00:02:29.450> so<00:02:29.510> dual<00:02:29.750> microphones

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
like I said earlier so dual microphones

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.890 
like I said earlier so dual microphones
the<00:02:31.310> left<00:02:31.460> side<00:02:31.640> remains<00:02:31.940> clean<00:02:32.300> with<00:02:32.660> just

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
the left side remains clean with just

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.080 
the left side remains clean with just
the<00:02:33.020> grill<00:02:33.370> following<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.490> design<00:02:34.730> from<00:02:34.940> the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
the grill following the design from the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.600 
the grill following the design from the
right<00:02:35.240> towards<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.810> left<00:02:36.190> on<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.250> back<00:02:37.400> like

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
right towards the left on the back like

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.550 
right towards the left on the back like
I<00:02:37.730> said<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.120> four<00:02:38.330> megapixel<00:02:38.810> ultrapixel

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
I said the four megapixel ultrapixel

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.070 
I said the four megapixel ultrapixel
camera<00:02:39.590> Full<00:02:40.520> HD<00:02:40.550> video<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.210> have<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.570> 1<00:02:41.840> by<00:02:42.050> 3

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
camera Full HD video you have a 1 by 3

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.370 
camera Full HD video you have a 1 by 3
inch<00:02:42.710> sensor<00:02:43.430> size<00:02:43.960> and<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:46.130> pixel<00:02:46.550> is<00:02:46.790> 2<00:02:47.720> so

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
inch sensor size and the pixel is 2 so

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.780 
inch sensor size and the pixel is 2 so
it's<00:02:48.530> almost<00:02:48.770> double<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.130> size<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.430> pixel

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
it's almost double the size of the pixel

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.790 
it's almost double the size of the pixel

cameras now let's take a look at the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.610 
cameras now let's take a look at the
interface<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.720> minute<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.020> power<00:03:03.350> it<00:03:03.410> on

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620

interface the minute you power it on
you'll<00:03:03.800> just<00:03:03.880> start<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.060> notice<00:03:05.270> that<00:03:06.020> it<00:03:06.170> is

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
you'll just start to notice that it is

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.710 
you'll just start to notice that it is
identical<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.070> HTC<00:03:07.430> one<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:08.540> get

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
identical to the HTC one you get

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.440 
identical to the HTC one you get
blinkfeed<00:03:09.110> right<00:03:09.500> out<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.830> box<00:03:10.040> so<00:03:10.760> you

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
blinkfeed right out of the box so you

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.260 
blinkfeed right out of the box so you
get<00:03:11.840> HTC's<00:03:12.560> latest<00:03:13.010> blink<00:03:13.310> feed<00:03:13.490> a<00:03:13.730> lot<00:03:14.210> of

changes<00:03:14.720> have<00:03:14.870> been<00:03:15.020> made<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.440> blink<00:03:15.680> feed<00:03:15.830> and

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
changes have been made to blink feed and

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.750 
changes have been made to blink feed and
the<00:03:16.340> overall<00:03:16.640> interface<00:03:17.150> on<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:18.050> new<00:03:18.260> sense
