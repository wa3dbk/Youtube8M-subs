one of the secrets to this bike really
is<00:00:32.169> all<00:00:33.040> about<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:33.489> geometry<00:00:33.910> right<00:00:34.090> with<00:00:34.600> a

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
is all about the geometry right with a

is all about the geometry right with a
two-niner<00:00:35.050> layout<00:00:35.470> one<00:00:35.739> of<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:35.920> tricks<00:00:36.160> we

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
two-niner layout one of the tricks we

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.250 
two-niner layout one of the tricks we
wanted<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.610> do<00:00:36.760> was<00:00:36.940> not<00:00:37.449> just<00:00:37.750> turn<00:00:37.989> our

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
wanted to do was not just turn our

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.830 
wanted to do was not just turn our

venerable our very successful transects
into<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.170> two<00:00:41.380> Niner<00:00:41.590> we<00:00:42.130> needed<00:00:42.399> to<00:00:42.460> really

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
into a two Niner we needed to really

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.220 
into a two Niner we needed to really
figure<00:00:42.790> out<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:43.030> geometry<00:00:43.390> we<00:00:43.870> couldn't<00:00:44.110> just

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
figure out the geometry we couldn't just

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.020 
figure out the geometry we couldn't just

those 29 inch wheels you end up with a

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.650 
those 29 inch wheels you end up with a
wheelbase<00:01:12.250> that's<00:01:12.520> really<00:01:12.819> really<00:01:13.030> long<00:01:13.300> and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660

that really long wheelbase ends up kind

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.460 
that really long wheelbase ends up kind

single track we didn't want that with
this<00:01:23.110> bike<00:01:23.289> we<00:01:23.740> wanted<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.039> bike<00:01:24.190> like<00:01:24.399> I<00:01:24.429> said

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
this bike we wanted a bike like I said

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.160 
this bike we wanted a bike like I said
that<00:01:24.819> was<00:01:24.880> fast<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:25.300> flickable<00:01:25.630> so<00:01:25.899> really

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
that was fast and flickable so really

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.109 
that was fast and flickable so really

bike<00:01:42.970> we<00:01:43.630> really<00:01:43.869> wanted<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.140> shorten<00:01:44.560> that<00:01:44.590> RC

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
bike we really wanted to shorten that RC

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.190 
bike we really wanted to shorten that RC
because<00:01:45.429> with<00:01:45.670> a<00:01:45.700> shorter<00:01:46.060> RC<00:01:46.539> the<00:01:46.840> rear<00:01:47.020> wheel

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
because with a shorter RC the rear wheel

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.930 
because with a shorter RC the rear wheel
gets<00:01:47.440> tucked<00:01:47.740> in<00:01:47.890> underneath<00:01:48.429> the<00:01:48.520> rider<00:01:48.819> a

gets tucked in underneath the rider a
lot<00:01:49.149> tighter<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.840> gives<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.349> that<00:01:50.380> fast<00:01:50.679> and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
lot tighter and gives it that fast and

engineering challenge we had with this

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.320 
engineering challenge we had with this
bike<00:01:57.039> was<00:01:57.250> how<00:01:57.399> to<00:01:57.429> bring<00:01:57.789> that<00:01:58.000> rear<00:01:58.300> end

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
bike was how to bring that rear end

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.719 
bike was how to bring that rear end
closer<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.229> rider<00:01:59.440> and<00:01:59.800> if<00:02:00.610> you're

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
closer to the rider and if you're

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.160 
closer to the rider and if you're

like the trance aksar anthem acts it had

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.010 
like the trance aksar anthem acts it had

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
to get proper tire clearance so we

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.750 
to get proper tire clearance so we
really<00:02:11.770> had<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:11.890> think<00:02:12.010> about<00:02:12.160> this<00:02:12.370> bike<00:02:12.550> from

really had to think about this bike from
the<00:02:12.819> ground<00:02:13.090> up<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.390> how<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.540> design<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.230> a

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
the ground up and how to design it in a

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
way that brought that rear wheel in well

way that brought that rear wheel in well
the<00:02:16.870> secret<00:02:17.230> or<00:02:17.409> the<00:02:17.530> answer<00:02:17.829> to<00:02:17.890> that

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
the secret or the answer to that

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.229 
the secret or the answer to that

that shortens the RC that brings the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.630 
that shortens the RC that brings the
rear<00:02:38.230> wheel<00:02:38.380> in<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:38.980> makes<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.310> bike<00:02:39.459> a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
rear wheel in and that makes the bike a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.740 
rear wheel in and that makes the bike a
lot<00:02:39.790> shorter<00:02:40.830> overall<00:02:41.830> length<00:02:42.310> than<00:02:42.849> a<00:02:43.269> lot<00:02:43.630> of

lot shorter overall length than a lot of
our<00:02:43.840> competitors<00:02:43.989> making<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.800> fast<00:02:45.010> and

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
our competitors making it fast and

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.309 
our competitors making it fast and
flickable<00:02:45.599> another<00:02:46.599> thing<00:02:46.810> you've<00:02:46.930> seen<00:02:47.080> here

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
flickable another thing you've seen here

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.229 
flickable another thing you've seen here
is<00:02:47.380> we've<00:02:47.620> really<00:02:48.010> angled<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.760> seat<00:02:49.030> tube

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
is we've really angled the seat tube

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.750 
is we've really angled the seat tube
here<00:02:49.569> and<00:02:50.290> while<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.799> looks<00:02:50.830> very<00:02:51.129> very<00:02:51.250> angled

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
here and while it looks very very angled

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.120 
here and while it looks very very angled
effectively<00:02:52.330> it's<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.510> 73°<00:02:53.290> seat<00:02:53.709> tube<00:02:53.920> angle

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
effectively it's a 73° seat tube angle

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.309 
effectively it's a 73° seat tube angle
but<00:02:54.849> you've<00:02:55.000> noticed<00:02:55.330> we've<00:02:55.480> really<00:02:55.840> stepped

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
but you've noticed we've really stepped

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.110 
but you've noticed we've really stepped
it<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.799> again<00:02:57.040> give<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.549> tire<00:02:57.849> clearance

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
it in to again give that tire clearance

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.550 
it in to again give that tire clearance
give<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.630> clearance<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.049> allowed<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.380> bring

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
give that clearance it allowed to bring

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.170 
give that clearance it allowed to bring
the<00:02:59.680> rear<00:02:59.829> wheel<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.190> tighter<00:03:00.579> than<00:03:00.970> ever

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
the rear wheel in tighter than ever

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.860 
the rear wheel in tighter than ever
before

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
before

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.289 
before
so<00:03:02.410> overall<00:03:02.709> this<00:03:03.280> bike<00:03:03.489> is<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.670> 5<00:03:03.910> inch<00:03:03.940> travel

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
so overall this bike is a 5 inch travel

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.420 
so overall this bike is a 5 inch travel
bike<00:03:04.630> always<00:03:05.110> uses<00:03:05.380> our<00:03:05.500> maestro<00:03:05.709> suspension
