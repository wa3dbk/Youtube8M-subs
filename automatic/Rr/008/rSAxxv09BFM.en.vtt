asking how it's doing I think a lot of

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.660 
asking how it's doing I think a lot of
people<00:00:41.470> didn't<00:00:41.890> believe<00:00:41.980> that<00:00:42.129> it<00:00:42.400> was<00:00:42.489> gonna

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
people didn't believe that it was gonna

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.290 
people didn't believe that it was gonna
work<00:00:42.820> out<00:00:43.059> so<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:45.520> know<00:00:45.610> give<00:00:45.820> it<00:00:45.910> a<00:00:46.000> try

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.389 
there'll be a link over here for the
video<00:00:49.989> on<00:00:50.230> how<00:00:50.410> we<00:00:50.470> planted<00:00:50.950> the<00:00:51.040> pineapple

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
video on how we planted the pineapple

00:00:51.399 --> 00:01:00.260 
video on how we planted the pineapple
plant<00:00:51.640> so<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.980> further<00:00:54.309> ado<00:00:54.790> here<00:00:55.270> it<00:00:56.200> is

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.830 

there<00:01:01.270> it<00:01:01.360> is<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:02.559> um<00:01:03.309> huge<00:01:04.979> well<00:01:05.979> huge<00:01:06.670> by<00:01:07.450> my

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
there it is it's um huge well huge by my

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.120 
there it is it's um huge well huge by my
standards<00:01:08.740> I<00:01:09.039> guess<00:01:09.300> it<00:01:10.300> could<00:01:10.780> have<00:01:11.130> probably

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
standards I guess it could have probably

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.540 
standards I guess it could have probably
grown<00:01:12.610> bigger<00:01:12.910> but<00:01:13.660> you<00:01:14.350> know<00:01:14.470> we<00:01:14.710> trial<00:01:15.340> and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
grown bigger but you know we trial and

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.490 
grown bigger but you know we trial and
error<00:01:15.700> different<00:01:16.360> things<00:01:16.600> whatever<00:01:17.170> this<00:01:17.440> is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
error different things whatever this is

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.100 
error different things whatever this is
I<00:01:18.009> promise<00:01:18.550> you<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.850> same<00:01:19.090> pineapple<00:01:21.990> let<00:01:22.990> me

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
I promise you the same pineapple let me

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.940 
I promise you the same pineapple let me
see<00:01:23.350> when<00:01:23.920> we<00:01:24.039> first<00:01:24.340> planted<00:01:24.819> it<00:01:25.149> we<00:01:26.140> put<00:01:26.860> it

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
see when we first planted it we put it

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.400 
see when we first planted it we put it
outside<00:01:27.100> during<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.119> summer<00:01:28.450> in<00:01:28.750> our

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
outside during the summer in our

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.740 
outside during the summer in our
greenhouse<00:01:29.950> expecting<00:01:30.910> that<00:01:31.270> it<00:01:31.450> would<00:01:31.569> like

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
greenhouse expecting that it would like

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.910 
greenhouse expecting that it would like
it<00:01:31.899> out<00:01:32.020> there<00:01:32.310> then<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.050> fall<00:01:35.440> we<00:01:35.709> brought

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
it out there then in the fall we brought

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.760 
it out there then in the fall we brought
it<00:01:36.099> inside<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:37.030> it<00:01:37.899> always<00:01:38.140> did<00:01:38.410> much<00:01:38.740> better

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
it inside and it always did much better

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.270 
it inside and it always did much better
inside<00:01:39.729> than<00:01:39.940> it<00:01:39.970> ever<00:01:40.179> did<00:01:40.270> outside<00:01:40.810> so<00:01:41.709> we've

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
inside than it ever did outside so we've

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.910 
inside than it ever did outside so we've
kept<00:01:42.610> it<00:01:42.729> inside<00:01:42.929> we<00:01:43.929> kept<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:44.349> on<00:01:44.440> top<00:01:44.619> of<00:01:44.679> our

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
kept it inside we kept it on top of our

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.820 
kept it inside we kept it on top of our
microwave<00:01:45.490> most<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.179> time<00:01:46.560> which<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.590> in

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
microwave most of that time which is in

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.040 
microwave most of that time which is in
front<00:01:47.979> of<00:01:48.039> a<00:01:48.130> window<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.509> very<00:01:49.750> good

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
front of a window it's a very good

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.469 
front of a window it's a very good
window<00:01:50.380> as<00:01:50.500> far<00:01:50.649> as<00:01:50.740> light<00:01:50.950> goes<00:01:51.190> except<00:01:52.090> for<00:01:52.270> I

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
window as far as light goes except for I

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.089 
window as far as light goes except for I
usually<00:01:52.929> keep<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.229> blinds<00:01:53.470> closed<00:01:53.800> so<00:01:54.069> I

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099 
usually keep the blinds closed so I

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:57.240 
usually keep the blinds closed so I
guess<00:01:54.220> that's<00:01:54.429> counterproductive<00:01:54.929> but<00:01:56.250> it's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
guess that's counterproductive but it's

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.979 
guess that's counterproductive but it's
also<00:01:57.429> the<00:01:57.910> coldest<00:01:58.300> window<00:01:58.569> in<00:01:58.720> our<00:01:58.840> house

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:58.989 
also the coldest window in our house

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:00.719 
also the coldest window in our house
because<00:01:59.170> it's<00:01:59.410> the<00:01:59.619> only<00:01:59.649> window<00:02:00.099> that<00:02:00.369> hasn't

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
because it's the only window that hasn't

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.760 
because it's the only window that hasn't
been<00:02:00.910> updated<00:02:01.179> so<00:02:01.599> we<00:02:01.780> just<00:02:02.020> moved<00:02:02.470> to<00:02:02.619> the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
been updated so we just moved to the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.680 
been updated so we just moved to the
pineapple<00:02:03.220> plant<00:02:03.459> to<00:02:03.789> this<00:02:04.239> other<00:02:04.479> window

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
pineapple plant to this other window

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.520 
pineapple plant to this other window
which<00:02:05.619> probably<00:02:06.009> won't<00:02:06.429> be<00:02:06.610> as<00:02:06.700> drafty<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.530> it

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
which probably won't be as drafty and it

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.979 
which probably won't be as drafty and it
has<00:02:08.649> more<00:02:08.830> space<00:02:09.130> over<00:02:09.369> here<00:02:09.489> and<00:02:10.060> we're<00:02:10.899> going

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
has more space over here and we're going

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.050 
has more space over here and we're going
to<00:02:11.050> see<00:02:11.230> how<00:02:11.410> we<00:02:11.920> like<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.160> here<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.610> how<00:02:12.760> it

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
to see how we like it here and how it

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.760 
to see how we like it here and how it
likes<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.480> over<00:02:13.660> here<00:02:13.840> anyways<00:02:14.349> it<00:02:14.500> was<00:02:14.530> just

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
likes it over here anyways it was just

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.430 
likes it over here anyways it was just
moved<00:02:14.950> today<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.360> update<00:02:16.660> it's<00:02:16.930> very

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
moved today this is the update it's very

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.620 
moved today this is the update it's very
large<00:02:17.739> we<00:02:18.430> water<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.849> when<00:02:19.090> we<00:02:19.180> think<00:02:19.330> about<00:02:19.450> it

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
large we water it when we think about it

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.949 
large we water it when we think about it
which<00:02:19.989> is<00:02:20.170> probably<00:02:20.440> about<00:02:20.739> once<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.129> week

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
which is probably about once a week

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.959 
which is probably about once a week
that's<00:02:22.959> about<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.260> I've<00:02:23.799> transplanted<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.849> a

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
that's about it I've transplanted it a

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:25.950 
that's about it I've transplanted it a
couple<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.269> times

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
couple of times

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.210 
couple of times
I<00:02:26.670> guess<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.790> could<00:02:27.940> show<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.770> how<00:02:29.770> big<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.130> is

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
I guess I could show you how big it is

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.330 
I guess I could show you how big it is
there's<00:02:31.180> my<00:02:31.450> hand<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.970> they're<00:02:33.970> humongous<00:02:35.340> so

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
