00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.260 

I<00:00:00.579> got<00:00:01.579> a<00:00:01.610> request<00:00:01.910> to<00:00:02.149> do<00:00:02.360> a<00:00:02.949> quick<00:00:03.949> overview

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:04.270 
I got a request to do a quick overview

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.660 
I got a request to do a quick overview
comparison<00:00:05.270> of<00:00:05.510> the<00:00:05.830> big<00:00:06.830> frame<00:00:07.160> locks<00:00:07.460> from

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
comparison of the big frame locks from

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.390 
comparison of the big frame locks from
the<00:00:07.730> zero-tolerance<00:00:08.209> line<00:00:09.009> so<00:00:10.009> you<00:00:10.099> have<00:00:10.249> the

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
the zero-tolerance line so you have the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:21.340 
the zero-tolerance line so you have the
03<00:00:10.879> 01<00:00:12.969> 05<00:00:14.139> 51<00:00:15.139> and<00:00:15.580> the<00:00:16.580> 05<00:00:17.510> 61<00:00:18.170> here<00:00:20.200> they<00:00:21.200> all

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
03 01 05 51 and the 05 61 here they all

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.970 
03 01 05 51 and the 05 61 here they all
ended<00:00:21.590> one<00:00:24.070> you<00:00:25.070> can<00:00:25.280> see<00:00:25.580> they're<00:00:26.980> roughly

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
ended one you can see they're roughly

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.160 
ended one you can see they're roughly
roughly<00:00:28.670> comparably<00:00:29.330> sized<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:30.789> 03<00:00:31.789> 01<00:00:32.300> is

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
roughly comparably sized the 03 01 is

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.090 
roughly comparably sized the 03 01 is
about<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.680> same<00:00:33.860> length<00:00:34.190> as<00:00:35.530> 056<00:00:36.530> one<00:00:36.740> except

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
about the same length as 056 one except

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.750 
about the same length as 056 one except
it's<00:00:37.280> um<00:00:37.550> it's<00:00:38.480> a<00:00:38.570> lot<00:00:38.720> deeper<00:00:38.930> it's<00:00:39.560> also

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
it's um it's a lot deeper it's also

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.130 
it's um it's a lot deeper it's also
considerably<00:00:40.760> heavier<00:00:41.030> it<00:00:41.390> is<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.840> heaviest

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
considerably heavier it is the heaviest

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.250 
considerably heavier it is the heaviest
of<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.440> bunch<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:42.920> has<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:43.190> deepest<00:00:43.579> blade

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:54.090 
of the bunch it has the deepest blade
thickness<00:00:45.260> was<00:00:50.110> let's<00:00:51.110> try<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.559> set<00:00:51.770> this<00:00:51.890> up

thickness was let's try and set this up
maybe<00:00:55.100> it<00:00:55.340> will<00:00:55.489> refuse<00:00:56.710> thickness<00:00:57.710> was<00:00:57.920> they

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
maybe it will refuse thickness was they

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.450 
maybe it will refuse thickness was they
are<00:00:58.570> roughly<00:00:59.570> comparable<00:01:00.070> this<00:01:01.070> one<00:01:01.280> is

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
are roughly comparable this one is

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.329 
are roughly comparable this one is
easily<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.149> thickest<00:01:02.750> because<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.649> it

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
easily the thickest because and it

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.039 
easily the thickest because and it
appears<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.940> thickest<00:01:05.299> as<00:01:05.479> well<00:01:05.659> because

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
appears the thickest as well because

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.590 
appears the thickest as well because
this<00:01:06.409> is<00:01:06.620> not<00:01:06.860> really<00:01:07.340> rounded<00:01:07.909> or<00:01:08.060> contoured

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
this is not really rounded or contoured

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:21.850 
this is not really rounded or contoured
it's<00:01:08.830> just<00:01:09.830> flat<00:01:18.010> size-wise<00:01:20.590> 056<00:01:21.590> one<00:01:21.770> is

it's just flat size-wise 056 one is

on<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.830> surface<00:02:04.190> grinder<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:05.810> looks<00:02:07.149> slightly

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
on the surface grinder it looks slightly

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.969 
on the surface grinder it looks slightly
thinner<00:02:08.660> on<00:02:08.750> this<00:02:09.080> one<00:02:09.259> because<00:02:09.380> this<00:02:09.680> one<00:02:09.860> is

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
thinner on this one because this one is

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.770 
thinner on this one because this one is
nicely<00:02:10.250> rounded<00:02:10.700> especially<00:02:11.390> on<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.570> gym

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
nicely rounded especially on the gym

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.240 
nicely rounded especially on the gym
thing<00:02:11.960> whereas<00:02:12.170> these<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.680> gym<00:02:12.920> being<00:02:13.100> is

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
thing whereas these to the gym being is

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.720 
thing whereas these to the gym being is
left<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:14.270> little<00:02:15.200> sharp<00:02:15.470> edges<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:16.070> one<00:02:16.280> the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
left a little sharp edges this one the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.340 
left a little sharp edges this one the
gym<00:02:16.970> thing<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.240> a<00:02:17.270> little<00:02:17.690> more<00:02:17.840> rounded<00:02:18.320> than

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
gym thing is a little more rounded than

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.470 
gym thing is a little more rounded than
the<00:02:18.980> zeroth<00:02:19.280> easier<00:02:19.610> one<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:20.000> i<00:02:20.030> would<00:02:20.270> say

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
the zeroth easier one but i would say

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.740 
the zeroth easier one but i would say
that<00:02:20.510> these<00:02:21.080> two<00:02:21.670> definitely<00:02:22.670> could<00:02:23.240> benefit

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
that these two definitely could benefit

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.100 
that these two definitely could benefit
from<00:02:23.960> um<00:02:25.510> rounding<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.570> gym<00:02:26.750> fee<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.900> little

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
from um rounding the gym fee a little

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.480 
from um rounding the gym fee a little
more<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:27.350> it's<00:02:27.470> just<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.800> little<00:02:27.950> less<00:02:28.130> sharp

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
more so it's just a little less sharp

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.520 
more so it's just a little less sharp
where<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.850> this<00:02:28.970> one<00:02:29.240> this<00:02:29.570> one's<00:02:29.840> nice<00:02:30.080> its

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
where is this one this one's nice its

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.070 
where is this one this one's nice its

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
even when you're cutting something kind

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.550 
even when you're cutting something kind

of aggressively all three of them are
good<00:02:39.740> knives<00:02:39.950> i<00:02:40.340> guess<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.940> lack<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.150> a

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
good knives i guess the lack of a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.650 
good knives i guess the lack of a
flipper<00:02:41.750> on<00:02:42.640> on<00:02:43.640> this<00:02:43.910> one<00:02:44.150> sort<00:02:44.570> of

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.490 
position of the thumb stud is also i
think<00:02:49.490> a<00:02:49.670> little<00:02:50.120> bit<00:02:50.330> disadvantageous<00:02:51.230> to

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
think a little bit disadvantageous to

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.140 
think a little bit disadvantageous to
opening<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.040> blade<00:02:52.280> i<00:02:52.310> took<00:02:52.670> me<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:52.910> while<00:02:53.090> to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
opening the blade i took me a while to

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.730 
opening the blade i took me a while to
sort<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.630> break<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:53.990> in<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.380> point<00:02:54.620> where

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
sort of break it in to the point where

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.160 
sort of break it in to the point where
it<00:02:54.830> was<00:02:54.860> easy<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.280> open<00:02:55.550> like<00:02:56.390> this<00:02:56.420> most

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
it was easy to open like this most

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.650 
it was easy to open like this most
people<00:02:57.320> who<00:02:57.709> pick<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.100> up<00:02:58.250> that's<00:02:59.150> their<00:02:59.420> first

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
people who pick it up that's their first

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.180 
people who pick it up that's their first
complaint<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.320> that<00:03:00.350> they<00:03:00.590> have<00:03:00.740> a<00:03:00.770> hard<00:03:01.010> time

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
complaint is that they have a hard time

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.210 
complaint is that they have a hard time
using<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.670> thumb<00:03:01.820> stud<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.300> get<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.570> open<00:03:03.220> this

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
using the thumb stud to get it open this

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.180 
using the thumb stud to get it open this
one<00:03:04.780> doesn't<00:03:05.780> really<00:03:06.140> have<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.560> problem<00:03:06.920> and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
one doesn't really have that problem and

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.140 
one doesn't really have that problem and
the<00:03:07.430> flipper<00:03:07.700> obviously<00:03:08.570> makes<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.700> easy<00:03:10.700> and

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
the flipper obviously makes it easy and

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.540 
the flipper obviously makes it easy and
the<00:03:11.750> bearings<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.500> KBT<00:03:13.010> makes<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.340> quite

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
the bearings the KBT makes it quite

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.040 
the bearings the KBT makes it quite
smooth<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.300> of<00:03:14.450> course<00:03:14.480> open

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
smooth and this is of course open

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.360 
smooth and this is of course open
assisted<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:15.590> don't<00:03:15.739> know<00:03:15.890> anyone<00:03:16.250> who

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
assisted I don't know anyone who

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.090 
assisted I don't know anyone who
actually<00:03:16.550> uses<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.630> thumb<00:03:18.260> stud<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.769> open<00:03:19.010> it

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
actually uses the thumb stud to open it

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.650 
actually uses the thumb stud to open it
but<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:20.239> doesn't<00:03:20.540> have<00:03:20.690> any<00:03:20.840> detent<00:03:22.060> it's<00:03:23.060> just

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
but it doesn't have any detent it's just

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.660 
but it doesn't have any detent it's just
the<00:03:24.590> torsion<00:03:25.280> bar<00:03:25.700> that<00:03:25.910> holds<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.269> closed<00:03:26.630> and

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
the torsion bar that holds it closed and

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.250 
the torsion bar that holds it closed and
allows<00:03:28.670> it<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:28.910> pop<00:03:29.209> out<00:03:29.860> so<00:03:30.860> yeah<00:03:30.980> that's<00:03:31.370> just

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
allows it to pop out so yeah that's just

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.290 
allows it to pop out so yeah that's just
about<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.320> any<00:03:33.739> questions<00:03:34.489> you<00:03:34.760> can<00:03:34.790> put<00:03:35.150> them
