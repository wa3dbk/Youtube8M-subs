00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
to deal 31,000 damage so it's going to

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.899 
to deal 31,000 damage so it's going to
actually<00:02:31.579> increase<00:02:31.790> my<00:02:32.329> damage<00:02:32.750> by<00:02:33.700> 10,000<00:02:34.700> so

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
that's pretty good I guess it could if

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.759 
that's pretty good I guess it could if
you<00:02:37.489> you<00:02:38.239> know<00:02:38.359> I<00:02:38.659> don't<00:02:39.200> know<00:02:39.290> maybe<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.650> go

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
you you know I don't know maybe you go

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.170 
you you know I don't know maybe you go
down<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> lot<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.519> could<00:02:40.670> be<00:02:40.730> good<00:02:40.909> for<00:02:41.060> you

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
down a lot so it could be good for you

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.699 
down a lot so it could be good for you
but<00:02:41.359> check<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.569> out<00:02:41.720> now<00:02:41.930> now<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.379> my<00:02:42.500> beef

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
but check it out now now that my beef

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.740 
but check it out now now that my beef
showed<00:02:42.980> is<00:02:43.099> regenerated<00:02:43.819> you<00:02:44.239> can<00:02:44.450> see<00:02:44.599> that

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
showed is regenerated you can see that

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.379 
showed is regenerated you can see that
I'm<00:02:44.870> actually<00:02:45.049> doing<00:02:45.519> 64%<00:02:46.519> while<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.239> one

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
I'm actually doing 64% while that one

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.720 
I'm actually doing 64% while that one
was<00:02:47.540> 20<00:02:47.900> but<00:02:48.709> you<00:02:48.829> can<00:02:49.010> see<00:02:49.129> that<00:02:49.280> I<00:02:49.310> was<00:02:49.519> doing

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
was 20 but you can see that I was doing

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.679 
was 20 but you can see that I was doing
64<00:02:50.359> percent<00:02:51.139> compared<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.680> 52%<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.569> way

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
64 percent compared to 52% so the way

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.750 
64 percent compared to 52% so the way
this<00:02:53.840> works<00:02:54.049> is<00:02:54.319> after<00:02:54.859> you<00:02:55.040> get<00:02:55.189> that<00:02:55.340> second
