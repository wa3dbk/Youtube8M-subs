00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.080 

so<00:00:00.870> there's<00:00:01.110> that<00:00:01.410> there's<00:00:01.740> our<00:00:02.490> eyes<00:00:02.790> our

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
so there's that there's our eyes our

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.559 
so there's that there's our eyes our
vanishing<00:00:03.540> points<00:00:04.049> there<00:00:04.609> so<00:00:05.609> we<00:00:06.000> see<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.390> top

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
vanishing points there so we see the top

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.509 
vanishing points there so we see the top
again<00:00:06.870> we've<00:00:07.049> moved<00:00:07.350> below<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.890> horizon<00:00:08.010> line

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
again we've moved below the horizon line

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.900 
again we've moved below the horizon line
against<00:00:08.910> we<00:00:09.059> see<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.360> top<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:10.460> we<00:00:11.460> move<00:00:11.670> that

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
against we see the top and we move that

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.230 
against we see the top and we move that
up<00:00:12.150> there<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:13.309> here<00:00:14.309> I'll<00:00:14.460> color<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.030> top

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
up there and here I'll color in the top

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.840 
up there and here I'll color in the top
again<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:15.960> can<00:00:16.109> kind<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.379> keep<00:00:16.529> track

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
again so that you can kind of keep track

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.519 
again so that you can kind of keep track
there's<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.289> okay

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
there's that okay

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.769 
there's that okay
we're<00:00:19.890> moving<00:00:20.189> around<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:20.789> see<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.630> we've

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
we're moving around and we see so we've

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.380 
we're moving around and we see so we've
moved<00:00:21.930> around<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.500> now<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.680> see<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:24.150> side

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
moved around and now we see the side

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.279 
moved around and now we see the side
again<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:26.930> here's<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.109> vanishing<00:00:28.680> point

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
again and here's the vanishing point

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:39.400 
again and here's the vanishing point
there<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.910> now<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> see<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> lot<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> top

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.139 

because<00:00:40.410> I'm<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.980> lot<00:00:41.250> farther<00:00:41.640> from<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
because I'm a lot farther from the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.600 
because I'm a lot farther from the
horizon<00:00:43.079> line<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.440> I'm<00:00:43.530> seeing<00:00:43.800> far<00:00:44.250> more<00:00:44.489> of

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
horizon line so I'm seeing far more of

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.000 
horizon line so I'm seeing far more of
the<00:00:44.760> top<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.329> close<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.500> vanishing<00:00:46.829> point

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the top I'm close to the vanishing point

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.920 
the top I'm close to the vanishing point
though<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.670> I'm<00:00:47.820> not<00:00:47.969> seeing<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.360> whole<00:00:48.390> lot<00:00:48.539> of

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
though so I'm not seeing a whole lot of

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.500 
though so I'm not seeing a whole lot of
the<00:00:49.170> side<00:00:49.440> see<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> lot<00:00:50.370> more<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.700> there<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.239> I

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the side see a lot more of there and I

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.810 
the side see a lot more of there and I
don't<00:00:51.719> see<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.050> there<00:00:52.430> okay<00:00:53.430> we're<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
don't see it there okay we're going to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:02.990 
don't see it there okay we're going to
go<00:00:54.000> over<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:55.070> here's<00:00:56.070> my<00:00:56.340> top<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.399> notice

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
go over here here's my top so you notice

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.270 
go over here here's my top so you notice
this<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.110> way<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.710> don't<00:01:05.100> I

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
this is going this way so I don't I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.640 
this is going this way so I don't I
don't<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:06.150> too<00:01:06.510> much<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.140> at<00:01:07.409> all

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
don't really see too much of this at all

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.399 
don't really see too much of this at all
I<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.460> little<00:01:08.700> sliver<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.689> I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
I see just a little sliver of that and I

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.230 
I see just a little sliver of that and I
see<00:01:10.740> basically<00:01:11.430> my<00:01:11.670> top<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.210> my<00:01:12.330> front<00:01:12.689> there

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
see basically my top and my front there

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.870 
see basically my top and my front there
okay<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:16.380> there's<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.580> we've<00:01:17.700> gone<00:01:17.820> from

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
okay so there's that so we've gone from

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.870 
okay so there's that so we've gone from
here<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:18.960> here<00:01:19.439> nothing<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.820> then

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
here here here nothing there and then

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.929 
here here here nothing there and then
we're<00:01:21.509> getting<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.840> lot<00:01:22.020> here<00:01:22.530> then<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.790> go

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
we're getting a lot here then if we go

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.010 
we're getting a lot here then if we go
over<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:25.100> what's<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> happen<00:01:27.020> I'm

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
over here what's going to happen I'm

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.109 
over here what's going to happen I'm
going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.500> start<00:01:28.799> seeing<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.280> bottom<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
going to start seeing the bottom of the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:38.359 
going to start seeing the bottom of the
box<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.110> I'm<00:01:34.409> going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.280> bottom<00:01:37.369> sort

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
box so I'm going to see the bottom sort

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.219 
box so I'm going to see the bottom sort
of<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.030> maybe<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.229> side<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.869> see<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
of going and maybe this side so I see a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.550 
of going and maybe this side so I see a
bottom<00:01:43.979> here<00:01:44.880> instead<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.659> seeing<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.170> top<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
bottom here instead of seeing the top I

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.520 
bottom here instead of seeing the top I
won't<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> top<00:01:47.340> anymore<00:01:51.259> okay<00:01:52.259> we've<00:01:52.409> got

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
won't see the top anymore okay we've got

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740 
won't see the top anymore okay we've got
a<00:01:52.560> side<00:01:52.920> again<00:01:53.250> because<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.720> know

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
a side again because it's it's you know

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.190 
a side again because it's it's you know
in<00:01:55.020> front<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.380> us<00:01:55.500> kind<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.250> box<00:01:57.200> but

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
in front of us kind of like that box but

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.270 
in front of us kind of like that box but
now<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.500> see<00:01:59.420> the<00:02:00.420> bottom<00:02:00.840> edge<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:02.009> see

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
now we see the bottom edge and we see

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.450 
now we see the bottom edge and we see
this<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.930> instead<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.350> seeing<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.890> top<00:02:05.159> up

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
this so instead of seeing the top up

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.850 
this so instead of seeing the top up
here<00:02:05.780> we<00:02:06.780> see<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> bottom<00:02:07.320> here<00:02:09.379> so<00:02:10.379> these<00:02:10.590> are

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
here we see the bottom here so these are

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.470 
here we see the bottom here so these are
both<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.280> sort<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> same<00:02:11.940> place<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.390> that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
both in sort of the same place in that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.700 
both in sort of the same place in that
we<00:02:12.629> see<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.870> front

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
we see the front

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.340 
we see the front
but<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.310> see<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.850> bottom<00:02:15.240> there<00:02:15.510> we<00:02:16.020> see<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
but we see the bottom there we see the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.860 
but we see the bottom there we see the
top<00:02:16.530> there
