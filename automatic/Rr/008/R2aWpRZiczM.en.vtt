00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.560 
actually ever get a chance to compete
again<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:30.990> competing<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:32.040> amazing<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
again so competing here is amazing and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.750 
again so competing here is amazing and
to<00:00:33.870> win<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.320> was<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.680> expecting<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.610> was

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
to win it I was not expecting that I was

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.389 
to win it I was not expecting that I was
just<00:00:36.059> expecting<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.660> compete<00:00:37.230> no<00:00:37.920> come<00:00:38.160> top

just expecting to compete no come top

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.049 
just expecting to compete no come top
ten<00:00:38.700> or<00:00:39.210> hope<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.480> was<00:00:39.809> my<00:00:39.840> goal<00:00:40.140> now<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
ten or hope that was my goal now to

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.549 
ten or hope that was my goal now to
actually<00:00:42.059> win<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.480> means<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> can

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
actually win that means that I can

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.569 
actually win that means that I can
hopefully<00:00:44.450> do<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> lot<00:00:45.750> more<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.230> Canada<00:00:46.649> for

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
hopefully do a lot more for Canada for

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.369 
hopefully do a lot more for Canada for
those<00:00:47.760> who<00:00:47.969> don't<00:00:48.210> know<00:00:48.300> your<00:00:48.660> story<00:00:49.110> could

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
those who don't know your story could

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.110 
those who don't know your story could
you<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.649> sort<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.920> briefly<00:00:50.100> describe<00:00:50.760> what

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.959 
you just sort of briefly describe what

how fast you progressed in the gym prior

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.570 
how fast you progressed in the gym prior
to<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.450> event<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:20.140> wanted<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.860> go<00:02:20.980> faster<00:02:21.550> and

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
to this event I wanted to go faster and

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.730 
to this event I wanted to go faster and
Kelly<00:02:22.180> was<00:02:22.480> always<00:02:22.690> saying<00:02:22.900> slow<00:02:23.110> down<00:02:23.380> don't

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.410 
Kelly was always saying slow down don't
injure<00:02:24.130> yourself<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.820> know<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.000> have<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.330> be

injure yourself you know you have to be
healthy<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.230> think<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.590> was<00:02:26.740> one<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.040> the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
healthy and I think that was one of the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.030 
healthy and I think that was one of the
things<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:28.030> was<00:02:28.810> not<00:02:29.020> used<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.560> was<00:02:29.830> just

things that I was not used to was just

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.060 
things that I was not used to was just
slowing<00:02:30.820> down<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.600> kind<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.870> feeling<00:02:32.530> my

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
slowing down and kind of feeling my

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.880 
slowing down and kind of feeling my
gymnastics<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.880> breathing<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:35.230> being<00:02:35.800> very

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890

my release skill I changed my hybrid a
low<00:03:18.130> bar<00:03:18.280> skills<00:03:18.580> still<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.910> same<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.300> added

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660

some new skills and some new connections

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.000 
some new skills and some new connections
so<00:03:21.670> bars<00:03:22.090> was<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.840> first<00:03:23.080> thing<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.500> got<00:03:23.769> back

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
so bars was the first thing I got back

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.370 
so bars was the first thing I got back
but<00:03:24.280> getting<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.300> kick<00:03:25.450> ass<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.810> him<00:03:26.140> for<00:03:26.320> the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
but getting the kick ass to him for the

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
but getting the kick ass to him for the
first<00:03:26.560> time<00:03:26.890> took

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
first time took

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.479 
first time took
first<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:28.360> it<00:03:28.780> was<00:03:29.019> I<00:03:29.260> was<00:03:29.560> not<00:03:29.769> physically

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
first so it was I was not physically

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.250 
first so it was I was not physically
ready<00:03:30.519> for<00:03:30.909> gymnastics<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.780> conditioning

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
ready for gymnastics so the conditioning

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.069 
ready for gymnastics so the conditioning
was<00:03:32.439> definitely<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.159> hardest<00:03:33.340> part<00:03:33.790> and

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
was definitely the hardest part and
