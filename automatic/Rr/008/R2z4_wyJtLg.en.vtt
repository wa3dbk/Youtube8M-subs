another piece stick it right there this
is<00:01:03.090> gonna<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.840> tail<00:01:04.140> part<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.630> hold

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
is gonna be the tail part so just hold

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.530 
is gonna be the tail part so just hold
it<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.200> then<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.470> want<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.710> take<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> white<00:01:08.340> 1<00:01:08.850> by

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
it so then you want to take a white 1 by

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.649 
it so then you want to take a white 1 by
2<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> stud<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> middle<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> top

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.390 

then<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.689> want<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.290> get<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> black<00:01:16.860> stud<00:01:17.250> you

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
then you want to get a black stud you

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
then you want to get a black stud you
should<00:01:17.640> probably<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.330> one<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.720> these<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.200> if

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
should probably have one of these so if

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.710 
should probably have one of these so if
you<00:01:19.530> can't<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.920> guess<00:01:20.159> another<00:01:20.640> color<00:01:21.180> works<00:01:21.450> I

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
you can't I guess another color works I

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.760 
you can't I guess another color works I
guess<00:01:21.810> black<00:01:22.350> was<00:01:22.680> probably<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> best<00:01:24.770> then

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
guess black was probably the best then

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.640 
guess black was probably the best then
you<00:01:25.979> would<00:01:26.130> want<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> take<00:01:26.900> this<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.290> make

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
you would want to take this and make

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.410 
you would want to take this and make
sure<00:01:28.710> has<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> split<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.850> middle<00:01:29.939> there's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
sure has the split in the middle there's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.060 
sure has the split in the middle there's
no<00:01:30.600> distinction<00:01:31.140> between<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.829> legs<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.110> this

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
no distinction between the legs so this

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.330 
no distinction between the legs so this
is<00:01:35.189> kind<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.520> broadly<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> rare<00:01:36.090> piece<00:01:37.340> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
is kind of broadly the rare piece you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.399 
is kind of broadly the rare piece you
might<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.640> able<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.850> use<00:01:39.119> something<00:01:39.390> else<00:01:42.409> so

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
might be able to use something else so

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.260 
might be able to use something else so
just<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.890> go<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.340> there<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.090> other
