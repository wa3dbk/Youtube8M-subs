 Hi there, this is a channel basket of toys and 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.569
 today we will review you 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.700
 toys fixes or rather the whole family 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:14.059
 fixes because we have here and 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.770
 masta papus and simka and of course zero 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.140
 there are still such small figures 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.670
 sims and zeros 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.500
 data toys licensed original 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.500
 fixes are all interesting in their own way and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.849
 there are interactive speakers here 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.939
 Masya Papus 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.710
 and zero is not saying this synco is 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.860
 soft like papus and Masya 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.690
 In general, there are very interesting toys 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.149
 so to say what to see and what 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.239
 tell so let's start with a toe 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.739
 consider it in more detail the first thing I want 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.200
 say if you want to purchase 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.450
 original license fixes then 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.129
 focus on such manufacturers 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.660
 like marmalade media and brand inventors 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.420
 it is these companies that produce 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.730
 original fixes they make them by 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.890
 licenses from an airplane company owner 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.070
 trademark fixings as you can see here 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.270
 there are holograms with the emblem of fixes 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.670
 be sure to pay attention to her 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.470
 when buying these toys in general let 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.020
 for you such a manufacturer as marmalade 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.680
 Media and brand inventors will be a guide 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.290
 when buying fixes 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.820
 although they do not only fixes but also 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.570
 heroes from such famous cartoons 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.090
 as for example smeshariki here I will show you 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.540
 Looks closer to the logo 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.950
 so you have a clear idea here 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.030
 and producer of jujube media so 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.000
 open toe 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.790
 and consider it more in detail 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.180
 I already unpacked these toys long ago and mine 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.610
 kid 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.050
 they play not the first month so 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.700
 believe me they were good 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.759
 tested and now i can do 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.100
 good objective review regarding 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.740
 toe then he's pretty pretty and 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.479
 as for me it is very similar to the fact that 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.990
 cartoons to start 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.040
 talk need to pull this check a 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.220
 talking toe through this speaker 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:25.209
 on his back for him to speak 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:29.870
 need to trot so still zero can 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:36.349
 turn your head up 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:38.390
 and move the legs but noticed on 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.239
 His foot still says fixes and 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.409
 when zero is talking then his face and 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.819
 the head starts to glow blue 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.010
 now it is not very noticeable because 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.170
 there is pretty strong coverage in 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:57.110
 darker room is very noticeable 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.030
 and it looks spectacular now Simka 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.190
 to her motor functions she is exactly 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.040
 same as zero but unlike 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.660
 she doesn’t talk 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.480
 the producer is the same inventors 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.349
 but two versions of the figures speak and not 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:16.010
 speaking speakers are sold in such 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:18.709
 tubes in which I had a toe they 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.930
 the speakers are on cardboard and tight 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.060
 transparent plastic but there and there 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.519
 must be present 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.430
 hologram quality they are the same 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.200
 appearance is a little different matter in 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.769
 the fact that when I bought the speaker 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.780
 toe 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.790
 talking sims there was no availability 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.190
 one online store had to take 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.769
 not telling the look of these toys 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.919
 I like it very much but painting 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.829
 performed somewhere on the 4 production of these 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:48.230
 toys is in China probably this 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.120
 and explains the quality of painting i 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.250
 I perfectly understand that there are times when 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.410
 seeing the inscription on the purchased products 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.000
 Maid Ying China buyer plunged into 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.519
 frustrations are long gone 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.470
 but none the less when in China they paint 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.069
 even cool and very serious and 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.799
 toys 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.680
 they don't always do it well and here 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.329
 papus’s turn unlike sims and 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.699
 zero it can be classified as 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.790
 soft toys 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:15.440
 only his head is made of plastic 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.940
 for your information are the same soft 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.729
 simka and zero 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.289
 is also on sale but I personally have more 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.410
 like completely plastic 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.750
 so I purchased them 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.150
 The brightest feature of papus is that he 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:57.070
 can sing a song and speak different phrases 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:58.930
 let's listen he can talk more 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.210
 many different interesting phrases from 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.700
 cartoon during which his head 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.300
 glows bright green so 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.610
 cool so interactive papus what 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.950
 As for the mass, it is exactly the same 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.020
 its functionality like papus all 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.730
 myagenkaya except plastic heads 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.730
 who glow during the conversation 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.910
 characterizing mass and papus can 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.070
 say that these are nice toys pretty 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.720
 neat high-quality interactive feature 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.060
 conversation works like a clock 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.370
 the only thing is painting the head a bit 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.580
 limping and tac toys just 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.740
 wonderful and want to finish 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.360
 show you the little figures 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.820
 sims and zerk which i recently 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.830
 acquired you can say it 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.080
 small copies of those sims and zeros 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.710
 which I showed you at the beginning of this 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.050
 review in appearance they are very 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.510
 similar to each other but in my opinion 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.050
 all the same big figures are made more 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.180
 qualitative and natural with these 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.460
 funny kids can move hands 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.919
 head and legs 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.500
 I think that these figures are made well 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.720
 the only thing the manufacturer needs is 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.520
 a little work on the similarity of these 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.250
 figures with cartoon characters 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.990
 This is especially true for the toe and yet 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.819
 would like to in the production of these 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.580
 small figures are not used 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:29.199
 plastic and paint with such a pronounced 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.449
 the smell 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:34.460
 Well Well thanks for all the attention it was 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.770
