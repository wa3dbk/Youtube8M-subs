00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.050
 ef 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.779
 This is a young man and one in Senegal. 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:11.859
 This is a knife and it feeds. 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:15.579
 lately everyone has been little affected by what they have something to do 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.419
 with the safety of children 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.660
 the earth has a thin outer layer we go wild 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.860
 composed of several types of steel are the so-called greenhouse effects 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.570
 when the concentration of these cases increases the temperature of the planet also 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.780
 increases with negative consequences for the climate fund 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.760
 we lived 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.910
 then no one thinks at this time that both this month happens says it can 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.910
 have contributed to the inclusion of 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.040
 the steak since the cattle raising 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.700
 to feed the cattle needs grazing 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.840
 the more cattle the greater part 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.840
 and to make matters worse 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.790
 the dairy cattle in their digestion 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.040
 the twenty-one times more powerful methane gas that spends little more gas than 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.810
 greenhouse effect 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.609
 when meat consumption increases 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.610
 more monthly passes 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.640
 and the trees he helped to solve said hashim thaÃ§i carbonic 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.470
 atmosphere 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.700
 stop existing 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.990
 and just as the load on timber can also come from areas of deforestation 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.780
 may have been cut in sawmills in the middle of the Amazon and covered enormous 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.680
 distances to furniture factories burning fossil fuels 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.210
 like gasoline and diesel 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.090
 and that fuels have to do with this on Tuesday 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.420
 they also emit greenhouse gases 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.520
 how our consumption contributes to climate change each of us is 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.979
 part of the problem but it may be part of the solution how to do this 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.750
 well seeking to know the origin of the products consumed 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.560
 choosing those that cause less negative impacts to the environment than 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.300
 comment that society 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.560
 information researcher republic to valley 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.710
 and only then can we do 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.399
 the goal
