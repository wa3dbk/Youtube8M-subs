00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
pretty sure this comes a lot default

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.770 
pretty sure this comes a lot default
with<00:05:23.360> right<00:05:24.340> are<00:05:25.340> they<00:05:25.640> always<00:05:25.850> verify<00:05:26.300> but

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
with right are they always verify but

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.120 
with right are they always verify but
when<00:05:26.900> I<00:05:26.930> verify<00:05:27.410> sometimes<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:27.860> gets<00:05:27.950> bit

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
when I verify sometimes it gets bit

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.490 
when I verify sometimes it gets bit
buggy<00:05:28.340> yellow<00:05:28.540> well<00:05:29.540> that's<00:05:29.780> my<00:05:29.960> opinion<00:05:30.170> but

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
buggy yellow well that's my opinion but

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.070 
buggy yellow well that's my opinion but
it<00:05:31.010> usually<00:05:31.700> up<00:05:31.880> like<00:05:32.090> says<00:05:32.540> it<00:05:32.690> can't

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
it usually up like says it can't

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.720 
it usually up like says it can't
bear<00:05:33.260> for<00:05:33.530> whatever<00:05:33.920> and<00:05:34.130> then<00:05:34.190> it<00:05:34.430> just<00:05:34.550> ruins

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
bear for whatever and then it just ruins

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.150 
bear for whatever and then it just ruins
hope<00:05:35.120> this<00:05:35.390> but<00:05:35.660> anyway<00:05:35.900> you<00:05:36.650> don't<00:05:36.800> have<00:05:37.040> to
