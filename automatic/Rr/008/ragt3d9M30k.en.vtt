leaf<00:00:26.250> tip<00:00:26.490> let<00:00:27.060> me<00:00:27.180> showing<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:27.840> how<00:00:27.990> you

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
leaf tip let me showing you here how you

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.210 
leaf tip let me showing you here how you
can<00:00:28.320> make<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.740> your<00:00:28.859> own

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
can make one of your own

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.730 
can make one of your own
like<00:00:29.369> I've<00:00:29.490> done<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.849> couple<00:00:30.000> other<00:00:30.269> videos

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
like I've done in a couple other videos

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.319 
like I've done in a couple other videos
so<00:00:31.740> several<00:00:31.980> layers<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.489> sticky<00:00:32.790> tape<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
so several layers of sticky tape on the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.290 
so several layers of sticky tape on the
corner<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:35.100> reinforce<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.910> keep<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> from

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
corner to reinforce it to keep it from

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.080 
corner to reinforce it to keep it from
bursting<00:00:36.480> open<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.860> cut<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.340> little

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
bursting open and then just cut a little

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.430 
bursting open and then just cut a little
be<00:00:39.300> shaped<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.780> corner<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.980> there<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.850> go

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
be shaped in the corner and there you go

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.369 
be shaped in the corner and there you go
lift<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.610> then<00:00:44.840> you're<00:00:45.840> gonna<00:00:45.960> fill<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.320> up

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
lift it and then you're gonna fill it up

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.090 
lift it and then you're gonna fill it up
with<00:00:46.500> icing

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
with icing

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.130 
with icing
you<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.940> wait<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.629> kind<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.930> turn

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you just wait to do this is kind of turn

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.470 
you just wait to do this is kind of turn
it<00:00:49.260> partially<00:00:49.710> inside<00:00:50.039> out<00:00:50.250> or<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.300> case

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
it partially inside out or in this case

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.029 
it partially inside out or in this case
I'm<00:00:51.660> not<00:00:51.719> putting<00:00:52.020> very<00:00:52.170> much<00:00:52.320> icing<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.860> so

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
I'm not putting very much icing in it so

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.689 
I'm not putting very much icing in it so
I<00:00:53.190> didn't<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:55.399> then<00:00:56.399> just

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
I didn't have to do that and then just

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.400 
I didn't have to do that and then just
squish<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.000> down<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> corner<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.079> then

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
squish it down to the corner and then

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.240 
squish it down to the corner and then
you're<00:00:58.530> ready<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.770> go<00:01:02.600> now<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:04.500> best<00:01:04.769> kind<00:01:05.220> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
you're ready to go now it's best kind of

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.450 
you're ready to go now it's best kind of
to<00:01:05.369> practice<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.210> particular<00:01:07.189> full<00:01:08.189> leaf

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
to practice this particular full leaf

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.850 
to practice this particular full leaf
with<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.820> leaf<00:01:09.030> tip<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> get<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.619> right

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
with the leaf tip just to get the right

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.700 
with the leaf tip just to get the right
side<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> bag<00:01:11.909> up<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:13.500> just

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
side of the bag up and then just

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.070 
side of the bag up and then just
practice<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.189> little<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.549> get<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.570> right<00:01:15.780> shape

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
practice a little to get the right shape

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.499 
practice a little to get the right shape
so<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.350> squeeze<00:01:16.770> anchor<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:18.090> release

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
so you squeeze anchor and then release

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.240 
so you squeeze anchor and then release
and<00:01:18.750> pull<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.350> get<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> little<00:01:19.740> pointy

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and pull up so you get a little pointy

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.450 
and pull up so you get a little pointy
shape<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> leaf<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.159> start<00:01:23.369> from

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
shape like a leaf and you can start from

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.390 
shape like a leaf and you can start from
here<00:01:23.610> inside<00:01:23.909> edge<00:01:25.100> using<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.220> same

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
here inside edge using that same

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.359 
here inside edge using that same
technique<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.450> go<00:01:27.600> around<00:01:28.070> now<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.250> is

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
technique and just go around now this is

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.160 
technique and just go around now this is
exactly<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> same<00:01:30.119> technique<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.600> use<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:31.020> my

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
exactly the same technique I use in my

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.700 
exactly the same technique I use in my
sunflower<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.479> ladybug<00:01:33.479> cupcake<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.560> also

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
sunflower and ladybug cupcake and I also

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.080 
sunflower and ladybug cupcake and I also
demonstrated<00:01:35.400> there<00:01:35.549> as<00:01:35.700> well<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.030> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
demonstrated there as well if you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.300 
demonstrated there as well if you
haven't<00:01:36.329> seen<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.659> one<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.560> you're<00:01:38.189> just

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
haven't seen that one and you're just

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.710 
haven't seen that one and you're just
gonna<00:01:38.430> keep<00:01:38.700> going<00:01:38.880> around<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:42.360> right<00:01:42.540> now<00:01:42.630> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
gonna keep going around and right now it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.819 
gonna keep going around and right now it
does<00:01:42.869> look<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.079> little<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> green<00:01:43.619> flower

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
does look a little like a green flower

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:44.900 
does look a little like a green flower
doesn't

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
doesn't

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.760 
doesn't

and<00:01:47.460> then<00:01:47.759> you're<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.150> to<00:01:48.270> overlap

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and then you're just going to overlap

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.410 
and then you're just going to overlap
the<00:01:49.320> first<00:01:49.979> layer<00:01:50.280> slightly<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.149> keep

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the first layer slightly and just keep

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.149 
the first layer slightly and just keep
going<00:01:51.689> around<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.619> gonna<00:01:52.740> build<00:01:53.009> this

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
going around and it's gonna build this

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.690 
going around and it's gonna build this
up<00:01:53.369> until<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.850> get<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:55.140> reef<00:01:55.710> shape<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:56.670> a

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
center so I experimented here I use a

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.900 
center so I experimented here I use a
little<00:02:30.420> candy<00:02:30.840> bell<00:02:31.049> and<00:02:31.610> then<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.730> also

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
little candy bell and then I also

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.440 
little candy bell and then I also
decided<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.720> try<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.959> make<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.430> ribbon<00:02:35.450> using

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
decided to try to make a ribbon using

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.990 
decided to try to make a ribbon using
some<00:02:36.630> red<00:02:36.840> icing<00:02:37.049> but<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.799> icing<00:02:38.069> was<00:02:38.700> really

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
some red icing but the icing was really

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.430 
some red icing but the icing was really
thick<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.510> wasn't<00:02:39.660> cooperating<00:02:39.870> too<00:02:40.290> well

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
thick and it wasn't cooperating too well

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.860 
thick and it wasn't cooperating too well
but<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.040> get<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.340> idea<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.940> think<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.750> is

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
but you get the idea I think this is

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.990 
but you get the idea I think this is
really<00:02:43.110> cute<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:44.370> there<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.549> go<00:02:44.640> there's<00:02:44.910> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
really cute so there you go there's the

Bell<00:02:45.299> candy<00:02:45.840> ballot<00:02:46.230> ride<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.590> also<00:02:47.130> try<00:02:47.370> little
