00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.840
 hi to all today we are talking about 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.040
 the figure reindeer is emblematic of the 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.360
 surf the tube or study is not to 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.220
 properly speaking a maneuver in the sense 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.110
 technical of the term but rather a moment 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.640
 a particular moment when surfers 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.150
 gets to be totally wrapped 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.830
 by the wave 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.360
 more than any 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.559
 maneuvering the tube is only possible 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.110
 when the waves are enough 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.970
 consistent and hollow you can achieve 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.239
 a top turn or 1.4 bac in any type of 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.890
 waves 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.140
 the tube depends first and foremost on 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.519
 conditions that need to be appropriate there 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.650
 is necessarily rarer and therefore more 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.089
 complicated to master 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.589
 dlt kof your look must hang a 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.870
 distant point on the shoulder of the wave 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.220
 your recovery will have to be fast and 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.799
 adapted to the slope that opens in front 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.449
 you a big wave offers more space 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.070
 and will ask you for a supported bottom and 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.740
 intense to come and place you in the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.869
 hollow a smaller wave will require 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.430
 cut the bottom of driving the rail in 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.110
 the parish and be right away at 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.700
 hollow of the wave 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.930
 the goal of your entry into waves and 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.610
 place your board on a line of 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.760
 breaking up perfectly on the 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.310
 wave too low and that's the lip that 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.960
 will end his hopes of too many tubes 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.640
 it's the surf speed and the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.070
 hollow who trace planks and 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.330
 you with this first phase is the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.160
 more complicated because they ask you 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.810
 an analysis of the emergency wave of 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.640
 very fast decision making and 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.380
 intense support and adapted 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.910
 the goal is clear succeed in stalling 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.310
 perfectly on the tempo of the wave 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.740
 then comes the wrapping phase 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.120
 and trust your choices when entering 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.980
 waves stays steady on the 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.720
 chosen trajectory body weight 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.460
 ideally distributed between your two feet 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.170
 and the look that is out 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.520
 technically it's not more 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.800
 complicated than following the wave in 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.540
 through maintaining its balance but 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.580
 the concern comes rather from the emotion that 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.810
 is played at that moment that's where he gets you 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.580
 stay focused on the exit 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.350
 to hope to go out quietly by 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.820
 the big door 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.900
 little trick even if you think you 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.940
 will you be locked up by the wave 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.840
 stay on your supports 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.120
 look to the exit 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.659
 the most intense tubes are often 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.860
 those you do not expect to leave 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.430
 with experience and according to length 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.810
 waves 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.700
 it is possible to pick up speed 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.530
 in the tube either by moving the weight 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.760
 of the body forward either by undulating to 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.489
 inside as for a taking 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.319
 classic speed recap hires 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.700
 you in the slope let's adapt bottom for 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.560
 come you calais perfectly in the hollow of 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.250
 the wave and keeps its speed for 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.250
 prepare for the release 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.940
 now it's your turn to play 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.459
 takes into account those who are in the water 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.670
 with you take advantage of his advice and my 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.670
 surf 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.540
 the most intense tubes often have 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.540
 what you did not expect
