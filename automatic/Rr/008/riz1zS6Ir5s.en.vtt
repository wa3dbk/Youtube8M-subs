 panepane 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:15.140
 xperia z 4 is net Dragon to do before the launch 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:18.570
 There was concern about the fever problem due to 810, but release is more feverish than multiple users 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:22.410
 Many posts about 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.640
 Among them, we updated the maximum value of fever record 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:32.850
 There are a lot of posts that are dissatisfied, too hot to hold 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:35.820
 In addition, it is the guard against snap fever 800 which was measures against the fever with the opposite to the thread 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:42.210
 Updated and improved to 2.1 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:46.630
 There are positive opinions that Rixperia z 4 does not terminate forcibly even when shooting 4 systems 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:51.610
 From the user post is actually xperia 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:55.690
 The heat problem of z 4 is a difficult place to judge 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.390
 About such a fever problem of xperia z 4 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:03.070
 There is also a report that Sony has approved 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:09.220
 According to this report xperia z 4 64-bit 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:16.180
 Itself feel hotter than the other models for the generation of heat There are special heat dissipation use of Okutakoa TokuYo is 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:18.380
 It is normal, but on the other hand some camera pages and apps are dropped due to this heat 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.110
 For this problem 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:28.180
 It is to improve with the update provided during summer 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.360
 To improve with the update means that Sony itself recognized the heat problem 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:36.260
 I will 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:42.320
 The heat buildup problem does not seem to be so serious in reality though it exists 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.590
 Such as the post is not so much the operation goes wrong in the heat Saga cause as far as the domestic post 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.469
 It looked like 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:54.420
 Also according to the results of Zappa's heat endurance test of the wind mounted Snap Dragon 800 gun 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:02:00.420
 Xperia z 4 is in the models which seems to be fared 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:04.470
 This test is affected by heat by performing benchmark tests six consecutive times. 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:09.479
 Verification that the processing capacity changes 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.110
 The blue line in the graph is xperia z 4 but it is also large at the 6th benchmark 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.280
 I'm not going down 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:21.500
 By the way the top line is galaxy s 6 edge 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:28.000
 The original score is high and the 6th score is hardly lowered 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.000
 See this and galaxy s 6 location also becomes catapult want 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.780
