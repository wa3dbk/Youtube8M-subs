00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.880
 and high and gesa me sl manufacturers 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.090
 machinery since 1965 we have developed 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.250
 and adapted to the needs of the market 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:21.439
 the dosing machine m 75 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.779
 75 is specially designed for the 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.970
 production of round burgers and 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.750
 oval small and large meatballs 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.609
 as well as croquettes and gutters thanks to 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.250
 its versatility and adaptation to 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.450
 requests from our clients 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.080
 we get a considerable saving of 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.320
 time in high average productions the 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.480
 dosing machine m75 is a very machine 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.910
 easy to handle and its reduced 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.810
 dimensions allow you to adapt it to 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.810
 any space 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.360
 the dosing machine m75 consists of a 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.040
 deposit made of stainless steel 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.040
 11- liter capacity 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.540
 inside a set of shovels of 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.090
 aluminum are responsible for distributing 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.390
 and fill the model mold with meat 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.390
 selected 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.970
 plates or trays made in 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.070
 Food polyethylene exercise mold 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.830
 and thanks to the regulating lever of the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.580
 thickness we get a variable dose 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.580
 according to each need 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.000
 if we make hamburgers the dose of 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.640
 meat ranges from 60 to 200 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.220
 grams and we can elaborate a production 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.220
 of 1200 burgers per hour 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.620
 in the case of meatballs croquettes and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.260
 gutters the adjustable dose ranges 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.800
 between 10 and 40 grams and the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.040
 final production will be 2,400 pieces the 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.040
 hour 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.010
 the external speed regulator us 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.990
 allows to adjust the production according to 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.990
 of the skill of the manipulator 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.720
 the work pedal facilitates the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.459
 working with hands free 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.459
 to make the product 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.900
 Y 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.110
 The m 75 has two microphones 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.569
 security to guarantee a job without 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.760
 scares or dangers for the manipulator 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.129
 of the machine the first one is housed in the 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.680
 upper part of the deposit together with the 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.989
 This cap is responsible for stopping the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.209
 machinery in the event that the lid of the 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.700
 deposit is not correctly placed 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.950
 its mission is to prevent anyone from manipulating 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.130
 with hands the flesh of the interior 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.780
 while the machine works the second 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.640
 safety micro is in the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.890
 base of the tank next to the plate 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.110
 rotating and allows us with a slight 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.170
 contact stop the production of the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.800
 doser to 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.800
 all right 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.250
 75 m is the effective and easy machine 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.910
 assemble and disassemble for later 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.910
 cleaning 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.400
 first of all we will select the dish 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.650
 or mold depending on the product that 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.460
 we want to elaborate and we will introduce it in 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.470
 the central axis 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.930
 safely aligning the slots of the 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:16.030
 plate and the trailing axle and we will continue 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.030
 the assembly with the polyvinyl nut 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.310
 then we will assemble the deposit 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.860
 taking into account the placement of 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.379
 Side clamping levers 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.210
 parallel to the base of the doser a and 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:38.460
 we will arm them giving them a quarter of 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.460
 turns overlapping the deposit to the base 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.450
 we will place the inner shovels in 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.490
 the central axis of the deposit making 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.440
 match the slots of the four 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.440
 blades with the drag axle 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.880
 ensure the mounting nut 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.880
 polyvinyl 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.600
 finally we will place the devices 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.730
 of security the superior in the angle of 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.740
 the lid of the reservoir and the micro 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.290
 rotating plate in the metal support 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.870
 that hold him with these last two 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.320
 operations we will have the machine ready 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.320
 to work
