00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.300
 very good and that we are again in 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.210
 minecraft to bring a new movement 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.650
 graph 1.7 point 10 called now sniffer 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.150
 it works according so I'm not going to 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.830
 download it and install it and this mode 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.990
 consists of this block if you like 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.990
 mind in hand that what helps us is 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.119
 to between quotes smell the smells is a 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.890
 quite strange thing I know there are several 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.110
 modes that do similar things but 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.600
 this does a pretty weird thing for 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.820
 example we had that I know I went up 1 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.230
 Once what I was doing was putting a 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.550
 mask or something like that with that I already knew 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.040
 where were the closest soft 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.350
 but this what you do when you put it 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.210
 on the ground for example is 2 is 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.640
 everything just directly like that is in a 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.700
 radius of 25 by 25 by 25 a radius 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.650
 cubic good diameter forgiveness and good 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.240
 As you can see there are also blocks like 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.470
 sandstone that is something that does not reach me 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.390
 Like it in the confech or you can 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.010
 get to remove because a block of 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.170
 sandstone because it is not that it is so 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.150
 special not but for example as you see 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.199
 also it goes in the coal also 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.909
 distance we are from the coal 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.369
 how to see if I go away is growing if I 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.380
 acerco is also decreasing here 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.729
 we have for example iron as you see in 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.990
 this part we have iron this 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.759
 we are just looking at is a block 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.270
 of iron and here comes the distance to the 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.609
 what 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.689
 we do not have and if we go a little more to 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:24.009
 the depth we will also find 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:27.399
 other ingots or diamonds or whatever 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:30.340
 more valuable for example gold the 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.899
 diamond evil and so on then 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.670
 how do you create yourself directly from 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.789
 this way is worth 8 of iron ingot 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.869
 plus a diamond and we have the sniper and 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.969
 Now let's go here for the 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.799
 depths because I have how are you 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.039
 seeing there you can see that he has been 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.590
 using it and in quotes around here 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.209
 should have a hole that always 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.459
 I always lose maybe here is the 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:54.039
 hole I came here because as 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.959
 You will see here this part, because I have this 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.090
 the sniper that was studying in a 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:00.670
 degree of 25 by 25 and with this we can 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.310
 find the diamond the iron the network 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.880
 this the coal because we have more iron 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.349
 more diamond etcetera and for example this 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.789
 gold that is here does not reach it 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.500
 find because it is already out of the radius 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.810
 of 25 by 25 with the radio 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:23.050
 forgiveness diameter of 25 by 25 would be 1 2 3 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.370
 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 stays at 2 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.930
 what is just that it comes out 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.720
 example if this took it away from here and what 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.420
 put here then as it is the one yes yes that 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.480
 it looks in principle it should not but good 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.300
 you see the thing as I'm seeing it makes 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.100
 in the short distance for example I 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.560
 I think more or less the diameter of a 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.680
 zoom or something so that you see everything 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.630
 that we have both above and below as 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.670
 to all sides and the truth that is 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.560
 quite well the thing will also be 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.530
 people who say hey, I'm very quiet 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.760
 So, I do not like it 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.790
 you can find all three so easily 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.110
 Hey, well you're aware of if you 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.330
 you install now uses the landmarks 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.860
 downloaded is not worth it depends on the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.740
 likes of each one if you want to play with 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.120
 this kind of mods or not and well then in 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.280
 my case I think it's pretty cool 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.830
 I believe that because here it is worth 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.080
 these guarantees the ingot in purple 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.020
 because how cool is not activated 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.970
 example here is the normal rest and be 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.770
 active or change the ingot changes the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.020
 icon because it does not have an icon 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.670
 to subtract activated and that's it then 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.260
 good to avoid this here we go 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.540
 He gave back to where there was not 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.390
 up where is the exit here 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.969
 come here he has not come here perfect 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.859
 is that I have air holes in here 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:37.510
 half of the water I do not know why surely 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.060
 for some other way that I will have had 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.909
 since the water will have changed for some 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.739
 another block but good thing is this 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.180
 beautiful boy is presented a lot 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.370
 You can press the new favorite X's 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.000

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.000
