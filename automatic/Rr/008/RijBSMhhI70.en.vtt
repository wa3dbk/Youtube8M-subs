00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.639
 with the growth of the public gamer 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.830
 focused on robust pcs 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.540
 philips and decided to head into the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.550
 segment betting on the most recent 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.250
 nvidia g5 technology philips 272 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.410
 g5 is the ideal model for players who 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.869
 they are not satisfied with little 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.090
 in addition to bringing this advantageous feature 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.809
 for sync it still has rate 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.829
 update of 144 raps and low 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.680
 answer 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.690
 we spent a few days testing the novelty 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.790
 to bring a verdict to you that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.750
 are thinking of buying a new monitor 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.629
 game 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.879
 now let's check in details all 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.460
 the advantages of this product 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.410
 philips kept the look very 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.140
 similar to what we see in other 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.539
 products it develops line 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.780
 discreet on the front with the name of the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.670
 manufacturer combines with a whole design 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.220
 surprises both the edges of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.570
 reduced thickness as well as the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.240
 Big size 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.260
 it has position height adjustment 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.390
 horizontal and also vertical rotation 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.229
 can be configured in several ways and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.450
 adjust as you prefer the display by 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.659
 Yes it is already a spectacle 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.240
 It's 27 inches for you to enjoy your 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.009
 full size games and dive in 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.500
 universe of games 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.869
 Full HD resolution is perfect for 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.990
 ideal to play a number 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.990
 of players with the technology 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.869
 smart phones fons this monitor has time 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.360
 only one millisecond 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.110
 which is more than perfect for games 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.570
 the upgrade rate up to 144 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.420
 raps is another point that deserves 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.670
 highlight that you can synchronize the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.719
 frame rate with the frequency of 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.380
 monitor and get a perfect experience 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:07.069
 on account of g5 technology philips 272 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.300
 g5 only has displayport connection 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.489
 Unfortunately you can not use the 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.780
 adapter to connect to cards with 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.230
 hdmi 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.080
 in fact speaking in g 5 this resource is the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.840
 great product differential is good 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.060
 basically we have absolutely nothing 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.510
 than complain about performance 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.640
 of the monitor in the execution of the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.790
 we do not notice problems in games that 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.560
 rotated above 30 frames per second 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.870
 the video card synchronizes 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.610
 perfectly the frames with the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.950
 monitor update 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.200
 philips appliance also showed 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.380
 competence in the faithful reproduction of 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.380
 graphs the higher the rate of 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.620
 best update is the result but 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.480
 the truth is that g5 depends more on gpu 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.970
 than the monitor 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.200
 anyway if you have a plaque 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.910
 top video 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.900
 this monitor can be the companion 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.050
 ideal for gambling 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.000
 another nice feature is the lmb that serves 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.519
 to reduce the effect of motion blur 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.769
 avoiding ghosts and other problems 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.660
 when scrolling objects on the screen 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.910
 It is very fast 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.579
 this function is activated with a button 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.880
 that is in front of the monitor. 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.280
 the result is not always perceptible but 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.660
 in racing games it is possible to check 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.049
 some improvements 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.280
 the only detail is that rmb leaves the screen 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.610
 very dark 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.440
 this prevents visual fatigue but can be 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.580
 a problem for those who like colors 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.860
 vibrant 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.890
 besides all these advantages a monitor 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.680
 of philips is compatible with 3d vision 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.050
 Kit with glasses does not come in the box but 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.630
 if you already have or want to use this 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.910
 feature then compatibility is a 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.310
 hand on the wheel 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:02.330
 an additional cool is rap with four 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.170
 3.0 usb ports with easy connections 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.060
 access 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.370
 you do not need to use the connections on the 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.680
 The only problem is that the 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.049
 speed of a single port is 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.410
 shared among the four that are 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.410
 on the monitor 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.889
 We recommend the purchase of the philips 272 g5 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.590
 for gamers since it has the most 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.750
 new technologies from India and shows 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.280
 excellent results with the most 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.830
 recent 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.560
 besides good functionality the model is 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.750
 beautiful and has some nice extras 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.100
 with a suggested price of two thousand and 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.919
 two hundred reais 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.930
 we believe that this monitor is a 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.510
 the most viable options for 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.610
 players looking for high performance and 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.919
 cutting edge features 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.140

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.140
