00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.139
 hello today another super-fast recipe 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.289
 which always belongs to these bases 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.949
 and it is chocolate brownies and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.110
 hazelnuts then the brownies are thick 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.090
 classified as biscuits but in 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.029
 actually it is a cake that comes 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.000
 then cut into squared pieces i 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.100
 in short, pieces are cut and ice 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.940
 those songs are also known as 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.780
 boston brownies and they are naturally 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.210
 US and are called that 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.040
 just because they have a color 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.980
 very dark due to presence 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.680
 massive dark chocolate e 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.109
 can be covered with icing or 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.989
 also the chocolate stops above and 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.239
 they are very often enriched with fruit 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.370
 dry just like the nuts in fact the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.690
 absolute best known brownies is 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.480
 precisely this or that of the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.740
 dark chocolate with nuts but yes 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.899
 they can use hazelnut almonds 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.990
 so what about this 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.240
 brownies that really really are the basis 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.000
 and it is one of the simplest preparations 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.299
 no special ingredients will be needed 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.100
 or who knows what and the execution really a lot 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.079
 simple fact we have seen me now 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.439
 I lost the images a bit though 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.750
 just chop the walnuts coarsely 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.810
 with a knife make melt a 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.939
 bain-marie or in the microwave the chocolate 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.770
 dark and then add the pieces of 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.140
 butter that must be soft a 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.570
 room temperature in another bowl 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.079
 as the images show, we will have to 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.960
 whip the egg yolks well enough 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.649
 sugar and then add slowly 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.360
 previously not sifted flour 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.360
 there is no need for special care 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.439
 in this mixture in reality the important thing 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.240
 however work it enough then done 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.509
 this of the yolks the sugar yes 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.729
 add the chocolate with the butter 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.829
 naturally even if present 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.730
 pieces of butter there is no problem 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:15.440
 some because they will melt so much 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.290
 when 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.020
 you will always turn this dough well 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.480
 now when I started talking like that 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.550
 means I'm going to make one 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.470
 blunder so it goes well and if he keeps 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.210
 this dough as you see it worked 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.340
 energetically with the spatula and then 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.030
 finally it throws the dried fruit that has 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.250
 choice not to overdo it is always good 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.040
 so 50 grams will suffice I use 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.660
 always silicone cloths for convenience 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.330
 however, if they do not cease 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.720
 it should be lightly buttered 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.300
 flour and then nothing to 200 heated 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.340
 20 minutes should be enough but it depends 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.770
 always from the height you have chosen 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.230
 chosen is chosen I never know if to give of 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.120
 your boyfriend's and the brownies are low 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.760
 ready, however, just let them cool 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.100
 cut them and then serve them or with icing 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.960
 chocolate or with real skies above 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.960
 hello to the next a kiss
