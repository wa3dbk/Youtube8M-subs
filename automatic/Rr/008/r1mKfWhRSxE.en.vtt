another<00:01:46.100> video<00:01:46.430> how<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.640> fit<00:01:46.940> that<00:01:47.060> back

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
another video how to fit that back

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.180 
another video how to fit that back
together<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:47.960> then<00:01:48.350> you've<00:01:48.470> got<00:01:48.620> a<00:01:48.650> series<00:01:48.710> of

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
together and then you've got a series of

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.280 
together and then you've got a series of
wires<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:49.820> take<00:01:50.000> a<00:01:50.030> look<00:01:50.210> at<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.420> wires<00:01:50.630> okay

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
wires so take a look at the wires okay

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.010 
wires so take a look at the wires okay
there<00:01:51.830> right<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:52.640> we'll<00:01:52.790> go<00:01:52.940> through<00:01:53.270> them<00:01:53.420> so
