00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.590 
only has 88 decibels sensitivity but
we'll<00:00:46.260> see<00:00:46.440> how<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.710> hits<00:00:47.210> now<00:00:48.210> some<00:00:48.510> people

have said that this new HF x12 d4 is

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.160 
have said that this new HF x12 d4 is
actually<00:00:53.699> kind<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.000> downward<00:00:54.420> from<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.960> edge

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
actually kind of downward from the edge

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.250 
actually kind of downward from the edge
sighs<00:00:55.760> well<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.820> wasn't<00:00:57.000> sure<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:57.989> trying<00:00:58.230> to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
guys you know comment that this actually

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.950 
guys you know comment that this actually
has<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> better<00:01:05.150> specs<00:01:06.150> better<00:01:06.479> ts<00:01:07.460> specs<00:01:08.960> even

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
has a better specs better ts specs even

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.530 
has a better specs better ts specs even
though<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.170> has<00:01:10.350> its<00:01:10.909> listed<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.210> having<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
though it has its listed as of having a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.789 
though it has its listed as of having a
six<00:01:12.750> point<00:01:13.020> five<00:01:13.200> millimeter<00:01:14.119> xmax<00:01:15.619> this<00:01:16.619> new

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
six point five millimeter xmax this new

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.160 
six point five millimeter xmax this new
hf<00:01:17.100> x<00:01:17.280> versus<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.880> 11<00:01:18.210> millimeter<00:01:18.540> x<00:01:18.720> max<00:01:18.930> of

hf x versus the 11 millimeter x max of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.499 
hf x versus the 11 millimeter x max of
the<00:01:19.350> h5

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
the h5

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.219 
the h5
so<00:01:21.509> who<00:01:21.659> knows<00:01:21.799> this<00:01:22.799> also<00:01:23.009> has<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> higher<00:01:24.229> we

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
so who knows this also has a higher we

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.170 
so who knows this also has a higher we
recommend<00:01:25.650> three<00:01:25.920> resonance<00:01:26.610> frequency<00:01:27.150> I

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
recommend three resonance frequency I

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.260 
recommend three resonance frequency I
think<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.630> 40<00:01:28.200> point<00:01:28.439> 33<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:29.159> think<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.119> high

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
think it's 40 point 33 I think it's high

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.789 
think it's 40 point 33 I think it's high
I'm<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.659> sure<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.930> its<00:01:30.990> height<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.439> age<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.740> I

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
I'm not sure of its height and age but I

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.460 
I'm not sure of its height and age but I
can<00:01:32.040> remember<00:01:32.220> right<00:01:32.460> now<00:01:33.200> thirty<00:01:34.200> point

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
can remember right now thirty point

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.350 
can remember right now thirty point
Thursday<00:01:34.740> -<00:01:34.920> DB<00:01:35.250> lower<00:01:36.320> for<00:01:37.320> your<00:01:37.409> resonance

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
has only watts RMS reading on the box

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.580 
has only watts RMS reading on the box
and<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> same<00:01:50.399> thing<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:51.380> supposed<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> be

obviously the construction isn't the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.260 
obviously the construction isn't the
best<00:03:37.200> thing<00:03:37.290> in<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.590> world<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:38.070> don't<00:03:39.060> know<00:03:39.120> why

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
this mesh here the cooling mesh I guess

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.800 
this mesh here the cooling mesh I guess

just like it says I'm not sure I mean
I've<00:05:07.280> taken<00:05:07.520> a<00:05:07.640> pretty<00:05:07.880> close<00:05:08.120> look<00:05:08.420> at<00:05:08.570> the<00:05:09.010> h5

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
I've taken a pretty close look at the h5

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.430 
I've taken a pretty close look at the h5
d<00:05:11.470> h5<00:05:12.470> 12<00:05:13.220> d4<00:05:14.030> is<00:05:14.180> I've<00:05:14.300> seen<00:05:14.540> at<00:05:14.630> the<00:05:14.690> store<00:05:14.930> and

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
d h5 12 d4 is I've seen at the store and

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.020 
d h5 12 d4 is I've seen at the store and
I<00:05:15.620> really<00:05:15.920> think<00:05:16.070> that<00:05:16.130> this<00:05:16.430> has<00:05:16.610> a<00:05:16.670> thicker
