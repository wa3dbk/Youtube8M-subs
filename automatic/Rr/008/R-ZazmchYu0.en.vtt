00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
right one lights up this is the step I

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.010 
right one lights up this is the step I
was<00:00:40.230> talking<00:00:40.620> about<00:00:41.059> that<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.329> you're<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.930> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
was talking about that if you're in a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.799 
was talking about that if you're in a
seven<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.530> not<00:00:43.710> warm<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:45.090> go<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.570> this

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
seven is not warm and you go to do this

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.979 
seven is not warm and you go to do this
this<00:00:46.350> one<00:00:46.770> will<00:00:47.100> blink<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.730> off<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.420> won't

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
this one will blink on and off it won't

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.740 
this one will blink on and off it won't
stay<00:00:49.260> solid<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.210> that<00:00:51.210> will<00:00:51.329> present<00:00:51.719> some

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
stay solid and that will present some

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.540 
stay solid and that will present some
problems<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.980> calibration<00:00:54.020> it<00:00:55.550> did

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
problems for you in calibration it did

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.029 
problems for you in calibration it did
quite<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.879> number<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.329> me<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.960> I'd<00:00:58.710> say<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.949> week

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
quite a number on me for I'd say a week

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.720 
quite a number on me for I'd say a week
or<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.579> before<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.000> figured<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.420> out<00:01:00.770> but<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
or so before I figured it out but the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.780 
or so before I figured it out but the
reason<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.379> know<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.339> NS<00:01:05.549> Evan

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
reason is that you know the NS Evan

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.700 
reason is that you know the NS Evan
doesn't<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.390> great<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.750> cold<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
doesn't do that great with cold if you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.160 
doesn't do that great with cold if you
keep<00:01:08.610> your<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> seven<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.450> cold

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
keep your in a seven in a cold

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.289 
keep your in a seven in a cold
environment<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:11.040> would<00:01:11.460> recommend<00:01:11.970> turning

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
environment I would recommend turning

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
environment I would recommend turning
you're<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.689> seven<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.710> letting<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.010> sit

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you're in a seven on and letting it sit

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.969 
you're in a seven on and letting it sit
or<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:15.450> know<00:01:15.570> turn<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.439> playing<00:01:16.710> for

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
or you know turn it on and playing for

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.679 
or you know turn it on and playing for
about<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.729> know<00:01:17.759> fifteen<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.360> twenty<00:01:18.659> minutes

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
about you know fifteen to twenty minutes

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.899 
about you know fifteen to twenty minutes
let<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> get<00:01:19.380> nice<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.770> warmed<00:01:20.009> up<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.189> then

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
let it get nice and warmed up and then

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.450 
let it get nice and warmed up and then
do<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> calibration<00:01:21.450> because<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
do the calibration because if the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.920 
do the calibration because if the
strip-searched<00:01:24.060> thing<00:01:24.360> doesn't<00:01:24.840> get

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
strip-searched thing doesn't get

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.630 
strip-searched thing doesn't get
calibrated<00:01:25.500> correctly<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.369> will<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
calibrated correctly you will have a

is important if you get to this step and
your<00:02:09.300> one<00:02:09.479> doesn't<00:02:09.810> stay<00:02:09.930> solid<00:02:10.200> while<00:02:10.440> you're

and<00:02:15.390> let<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.870> continue<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.620> warm<00:02:16.890> up<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.250> then

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
and let it continue to warm up and then

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.530 
and let it continue to warm up and then
try<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.030> again

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
try it again

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.570 
try it again
because<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:19.110> will<00:02:19.410> present<00:02:19.860> problems<00:02:20.370> for

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
because this will present problems for

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.940 
because this will present problems for
you<00:02:20.760> your<00:02:21.330> tracks<00:02:21.660> will<00:02:21.870> skip<00:02:22.080> automatically

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
you your tracks will skip automatically

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.590 
you your tracks will skip automatically
back<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.460> like<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.790> first<00:02:24.060> one<00:02:24.300> or

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
back to the like the first one or

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.860 
back to the like the first one or
they'll<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.380> some<00:02:25.590> ridiculous<00:02:26.160> skipping<00:02:26.640> and

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
they'll do some ridiculous skipping and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.480 
they'll do some ridiculous skipping and
calibration<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:28.110> needed<00:02:28.440> as<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.250> matter<00:02:29.400> of

calibration is needed as a matter of
fact<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:30.290> didn't<00:02:31.290> have<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.560> calibrate<00:02:31.770> mine<00:02:32.280> for

fact I didn't have to calibrate mine for
the<00:02:33.300> first<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.990> don't<00:02:34.650> know<00:02:34.710> four<00:02:34.950> months<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.250> had

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
the first I don't know four months I had

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.080 
the first I don't know four months I had
it<00:02:35.490> so<00:02:36.240> anyway<00:02:37.040> back<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.100> what<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.340> was<00:02:38.520> doing

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
it so anyway back to what I was doing

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:53.120 
it so anyway back to what I was doing
solid<00:02:39.690> wine<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:44.520> then<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.660> middle<00:02:52.130> and

solid wine and then in the middle and

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.930

you're<00:02:53.250> good<00:02:53.989> that's<00:02:55.190> again<00:02:56.330> right<00:02:57.330> furthest

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940

is<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:22.380> uh<00:03:24.410> it<00:03:25.410> appears<00:03:25.799> that<00:03:25.890> they<00:03:26.549> designed

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
is that uh it appears that they designed

is that uh it appears that they designed
this<00:03:27.269> with<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:28.440> know<00:03:28.560> an<00:03:28.709> understanding<00:03:29.580> that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
this with you know an understanding that

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.949 
this with you know an understanding that
some<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:30.000> these<00:03:30.060> knobs<00:03:30.299> don't<00:03:30.630> have<00:03:30.750> like<00:03:30.930> a

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
some of these knobs don't have like a

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.729 
some of these knobs don't have like a
little<00:03:31.799> niche<00:03:32.040> for<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.700> middle<00:03:33.590> but<00:03:34.590> there's

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
little niche for the middle but there's

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.410 
little niche for the middle but there's
always<00:03:34.920> some<00:03:35.190> kind<00:03:35.220> of<00:03:35.459> like<00:03:35.670> guide<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.299> know

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
always some kind of like guide you know

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.979 
always some kind of like guide you know
and<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:37.470> don't<00:03:37.650> have<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.920> be<00:03:38.040> dead<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.989> you

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
and you don't have to be dead on you

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.020 
and you don't have to be dead on you
want<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.260> get<00:03:40.410> as<00:03:40.590> close<00:03:40.620> as<00:03:40.860> possible<00:03:41.010> but<00:03:41.760> I

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
want to get as close as possible but I

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.550 
want to get as close as possible but I
wouldn't<00:03:42.480> fret<00:03:42.690> too<00:03:42.900> hard<00:03:43.140> I<00:03:43.260> wouldn't<00:03:43.470> break

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
wouldn't fret too hard I wouldn't break

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.259 
wouldn't fret too hard I wouldn't break
out<00:03:43.739> like<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:43.950> ruler<00:03:44.340> or<00:03:44.370> anything<00:03:44.489> it's<00:03:45.030> it's

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
out like a ruler or anything it's it's

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.380 
out like a ruler or anything it's it's
not<00:03:45.480> really<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:45.780> big<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.230> deal<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:47.580> think

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
not really that big of a deal it I think

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.120 
not really that big of a deal it I think
it<00:03:48.480> comes<00:03:48.690> with<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:48.959> good<00:03:49.200> margin<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.860> error

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
it comes with a good margin of error

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.600 
it comes with a good margin of error
that<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.330> acceptable<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:53.100> won't<00:03:53.310> you

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
that is acceptable and that won't you

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.400 
that is acceptable and that won't you
know<00:03:53.880> really<00:03:54.720> interfere<00:03:55.200> with<00:03:55.730> getting<00:03:57.410> there

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
know really interfere with getting there

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.130 
know really interfere with getting there
like<00:03:58.560> setting<00:03:58.980> for<00:03:59.160> this<00:03:59.690> but<00:04:00.690> for<00:04:00.840> most<00:04:00.959> of

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
like setting for this but for most of

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.350 
like setting for this but for most of
these<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.380> can<00:04:01.500> hover<00:04:01.709> above<00:04:02.070> them<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.580> see

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
these you can hover above them and see

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.789 
these you can hover above them and see
that<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:04.680> line<00:04:04.890> is<00:04:04.920> on<00:04:05.780> so<00:04:06.780> that's<00:04:06.930> that's<00:04:07.590> an

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
that the line is on so that's that's an

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.220 
that the line is on so that's that's an
actual<00:04:08.160> hovering<00:04:08.730> above<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.180> know<00:04:09.360> it<00:04:10.080> doesn't

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
actual hovering above I know it doesn't

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.520 
actual hovering above I know it doesn't
look<00:04:10.380> like<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.920> but<00:04:11.220> it's<00:04:11.760> on<00:04:12.139> the<00:04:13.139> line<00:04:13.290> is

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
look like that but it's on the line is

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.620 
look like that but it's on the line is
like

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
like

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.699 
like

this range of error again don't forget

these<00:04:30.170> guys<00:04:30.230> these<00:04:30.650> guys<00:04:30.830> have<00:04:31.040> to<00:04:31.190> go<00:04:32.530> in<00:04:33.530> the

these guys these guys have to go in the

these guys these guys have to go in the

middle to your start time and your stop
time<00:04:36.410> nodes<00:04:36.950> I<00:04:38.620> don't<00:04:39.620> think<00:04:39.770> they<00:04:39.920> I<00:04:40.220> don't

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
time nodes I don't think they I don't

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.250 
time nodes I don't think they I don't
think<00:04:40.940> they're<00:04:41.060> very<00:04:41.090> clear<00:04:41.690> about<00:04:42.020> what

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
think they're very clear about what

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.910 
think they're very clear about what
knobs<00:04:42.580> they<00:04:43.580> want<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.090> do<00:04:44.240> or<00:04:44.720> what<00:04:45.500> ones

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
you know of course these this is the

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.920 
you know of course these this is the
part<00:05:01.640> where<00:05:01.880> I<00:05:02.380> got<00:05:03.380> really<00:05:03.410> messed<00:05:04.370> up<00:05:04.750> as<00:05:05.750> you

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
part where I got really messed up as you

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.290 
part where I got really messed up as you
look<00:05:06.050> down<00:05:06.110> at<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:06.530> volume<00:05:06.890> and<00:05:07.120> you<00:05:08.120> count

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
look down at the volume and you count

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.070 
look down at the volume and you count
the<00:05:08.510> lines<00:05:09.280> okay<00:05:10.300> you<00:05:11.300> count<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.690> lines<00:05:11.720> you

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
the lines okay you count the lines you

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:22.450 
the lines okay you count the lines you
go<00:05:13.300> 1<00:05:14.300> 2<00:05:14.930> 3<00:05:15.130> 4<00:05:16.130> 5<00:05:16.970> 6<00:05:17.510> 7<00:05:18.320> 8<00:05:18.710> 9<00:05:19.220> 10<00:05:19.760> 10<00:05:20.630> wise<00:05:20.870> so<00:05:21.560> what

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 wise so what

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.190 
go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 wise so what
do<00:05:22.520> you<00:05:22.580> think<00:05:22.760> the<00:05:22.850> middle<00:05:23.150> is<00:05:23.300> you<00:05:24.050> would

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
do you think the middle is you would

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.700 
do you think the middle is you would
think<00:05:24.410> on<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:25.280> fifth<00:05:25.520> line<00:05:25.760> it's<00:05:26.510> not<00:05:26.710> the

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
think on the fifth line it's not the

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.110 
think on the fifth line it's not the
middle<00:05:28.130> is<00:05:28.370> actually<00:05:28.970> in<00:05:29.840> between<00:05:30.670> the<00:05:31.670> fifth

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
middle is actually in between the fifth

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:40.460 
middle is actually in between the fifth
and<00:05:32.300> sixth<00:05:32.660> lines<00:05:32.870> 2<00:05:33.140> 1<00:05:33.380> 2<00:05:34.060> 3<00:05:35.060> 4<00:05:35.900> 5

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:47.310 

one<00:05:41.470> two<00:05:42.010> three<00:05:42.820> four<00:05:43.480> five<00:05:46.080> they<00:05:47.080> don't

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
one two three four five they don't

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.830 
one two three four five they don't
really<00:05:47.440> tell<00:05:47.770> you<00:05:47.890> that<00:05:48.300> know<00:05:49.300> any<00:05:49.450> reason<00:05:49.750> I

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
really tell you that know any reason I

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.980 
really tell you that know any reason I
found<00:05:50.050> out<00:05:50.290> is<00:05:50.530> because<00:05:50.710> I<00:05:50.920> was<00:05:51.040> thinking<00:05:51.400> okay

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
found out is because I was thinking okay

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.890 
found out is because I was thinking okay
what<00:05:52.990> if<00:05:53.110> they<00:05:53.230> didn't<00:05:53.440> count<00:05:53.590> that<00:05:53.830> last<00:05:53.860> line

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
what if they didn't count that last line

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.450 
what if they didn't count that last line
or<00:05:55.900> what<00:05:56.230> if<00:05:56.320> they<00:05:56.410> didn't<00:05:56.620> count<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:56.950> top<00:05:57.160> in

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
or what if they didn't count the top in

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.210 
or what if they didn't count the top in
what<00:05:58.420> if<00:05:58.510> they<00:05:58.600> did<00:05:58.780> count<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.140> top<00:05:59.290> in<00:05:59.560> so

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
what if they did count the top in so

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.280 
what if they did count the top in so
what<00:06:00.580> I<00:06:00.610> started<00:06:00.970> to<00:06:01.060> do<00:06:01.210> is<00:06:01.330> just<00:06:01.510> slowly<00:06:01.810> bump

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
what I started to do is just slowly bump

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.800 
what I started to do is just slowly bump
them<00:06:02.440> both<00:06:02.620> up<00:06:02.860> and<00:06:03.850> sure<00:06:04.030> enough<00:06:04.060> this<00:06:04.660> is

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
them both up and sure enough this is

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.460 
them both up and sure enough this is
what<00:06:04.960> I<00:06:04.990> found

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
what I found

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.370 
what I found
it's<00:06:05.860> between<00:06:06.430> the<00:06:07.300> fifth<00:06:07.600> and<00:06:07.810> sixth<00:06:08.200> line

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
it's between the fifth and sixth line

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.560 
it's between the fifth and sixth line
and<00:06:08.740> I'll<00:06:08.890> tell<00:06:09.160> you<00:06:09.310> if<00:06:09.820> you<00:06:09.970> don't<00:06:10.120> know<00:06:10.360> that

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
and I'll tell you if you don't know that

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.450 
and I'll tell you if you don't know that
and<00:06:10.780> you<00:06:10.840> go<00:06:11.020> into<00:06:11.200> doing<00:06:11.410> this<00:06:11.560> calibration<00:06:11.980> I

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
and you go into doing this calibration I

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.070 
and you go into doing this calibration I
think<00:06:12.760> nine<00:06:13.120> times<00:06:13.150> out<00:06:13.510> of<00:06:13.540> ten<00:06:13.840> this<00:06:14.020> is

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
think nine times out of ten this is

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.200 
think nine times out of ten this is
where<00:06:14.350> people<00:06:14.680> will<00:06:14.800> probably<00:06:15.190> get<00:06:15.340> hung<00:06:16.030> up

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
where people will probably get hung up

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.770 
where people will probably get hung up
on<00:06:16.450> it

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
on it

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.380 
on it
so<00:06:17.230> anyway<00:06:17.530> everything<00:06:18.280> is<00:06:18.310> all<00:06:18.670> in<00:06:19.270> the

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
so anyway everything is all in the

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.180 
so anyway everything is all in the
middle<00:06:21.330> of<00:06:22.330> things<00:06:22.540> all<00:06:22.780> good<00:06:23.050> and<00:06:23.290> again<00:06:23.650> the

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
middle of things all good and again the

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.330 
middle of things all good and again the
ns7<00:06:24.810> recognizes<00:06:25.810> that<00:06:26.470> everything's<00:06:26.920> been

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
ns7 recognizes that everything's been

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.470 
ns7 recognizes that everything's been
aligned<00:06:27.700> up<00:06:27.970> and<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:30.190> one<00:06:30.490> and<00:06:30.760> the<00:06:31.000> left<00:06:31.210> deck

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
aligned up and the one and the left deck

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.060 
aligned up and the one and the left deck
is<00:06:31.720> back<00:06:32.560> on<00:06:33.840> when<00:06:34.840> you<00:06:34.960> press<00:06:35.200> this<00:06:35.470> all<00:06:35.770> of

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
is back on when you press this all of

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.800 
is back on when you press this all of
them<00:06:36.160> will<00:06:36.370> flash<00:06:36.700> at<00:06:37.030> you<00:06:37.210> and<00:06:37.390> I'll<00:06:37.510> let<00:06:37.690> you
