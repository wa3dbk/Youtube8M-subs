00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:09.960
 all the pokéfans today we get 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:11.730
 found on pokemon so with a 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.700
 new tutor how to evolve the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.440
 pokemon match hopper and graulenne them 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.500
 no M 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.609
 and finally I wanted it to be in 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 all versions is the device 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.470
 so it needs compatible games what 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.800
 I mean by compatible to it's a 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.739
 game so on this one I have the version 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.270
 gold and on that there the diamond version 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.660
 that is, two cards that can 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.620
 exchange pokemon and tools at 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.530
 Oven world ds or friend who 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.379
 has the desk 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:54.600
 so you first need the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.070
 pokemon in question so launched an effort 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.940
 so we see we must first launched a 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:07.740
 exchange so here is your ta ta ta ta ta 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:12.930
 change sees where I know it's 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:18.049
 complicated to manage two devices with 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.350
 a hand because I mom smokes and so 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:27.119
 here all the princes 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.360
 which makes sense here so here I 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.360
 will choose 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:39.650
 yes I have to finance him the charges 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.970
 magnificent cinematic exchange that 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:55.530
 is that of very long and very 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:59.460
 so infuriating is where there sorry if you 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:07.680
 have heard a cry I do not know what 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:12.000
 that it was therefore to this magnificent 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:17.060
 cinematic that will end there 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.010
 pokéball which is included in the ds 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:26.069
 So here you have your pokemon such 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.390
 so there is normally so if everything goes 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.760
 well 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.150
 So here it evolves I'm still 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.040
 try evolution to show you the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:43.610
 td of pokemon but we analyze you 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:47.549
 know we have a hitter then 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.260
 drama allanche problems at once when 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.370
 I mean the relay margin but 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.730
 when I mean that we have mythical 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.260
 on the other hand less good bein sure this to more 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.510
 for a neighbor for a next 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.510
 video I do not know all the gamers
