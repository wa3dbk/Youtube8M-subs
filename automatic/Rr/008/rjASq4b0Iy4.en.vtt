00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
extra pressure on me especially this

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.100 
extra pressure on me especially this
year<00:04:45.340> at<00:04:45.460> state<00:04:45.700> after<00:04:45.940> coming<00:04:46.540> in<00:04:46.630> what<00:04:46.780> every

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
year at state after coming in what every

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.350 
year at state after coming in what every
I<00:04:47.380> mean<00:04:47.650> everybody<00:04:48.190> expects<00:04:49.000> you<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.210> win

I mean everybody expects you to win

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.320 
I mean everybody expects you to win
before<00:04:49.480> so<00:04:50.140> um<00:04:50.920> there's<00:04:51.760> a<00:04:51.820> lot<00:04:51.970> of<00:04:52.000> external

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
before so um there's a lot of external

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.700 
before so um there's a lot of external
pressure<00:04:52.660> but<00:04:52.870> I've<00:04:52.960> gotten<00:04:53.260> pretty<00:04:53.290> good<00:04:53.530> at

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
pressure but I've gotten pretty good at

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.770 
pressure but I've gotten pretty good at
trying<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.490> block<00:04:54.670> it<00:04:54.700> out<00:04:54.940> just<00:04:55.180> focusing<00:04:55.690> on

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
trying to block it out just focusing on

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.020 
trying to block it out just focusing on
my<00:04:55.930> own<00:04:56.080> race<00:04:56.410> and<00:04:56.680> I<00:04:56.800> think<00:04:57.040> it<00:04:57.550> helps<00:04:57.790> just

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
my own race and I think it helps just

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.560 
my own race and I think it helps just
going<00:04:58.510> out<00:04:58.740> just<00:04:59.740> getting<00:05:00.010> on<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.220> course<00:05:00.610> I

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
mean I'm so nervous before racing I just

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.630 
mean I'm so nervous before racing I just
want<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.060> go<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.390> once<00:05:04.600> it<00:05:04.750> on<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.020> arches
