00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
but not everything else because if you

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.190 
but not everything else because if you
get<00:00:37.920> reset<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:39.149> lose<00:00:39.329> everything<00:00:39.600> clean<00:00:39.989> your

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
get reset you lose everything clean your

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.049 
get reset you lose everything clean your
plate<00:00:40.320> I'm<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.250> reset<00:00:41.550> your<00:00:41.610> statues

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.459 
plate I'm but if you reset your statues
and<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> token<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.690> don't<00:00:42.899> use<00:00:43.050> your<00:00:43.170> play<00:00:43.320> time

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
so I would say this isn't a token or it

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.700 
so I would say this isn't a token or it
could<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:45.989> been<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.500> glitter
