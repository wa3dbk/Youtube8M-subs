00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Look at people at speed and 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.890
 irresponsibility of this biker in the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.890
 SÃ£o Paulo traffic puts the image 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.470
 maybe you only have 30 per hour at a minimum 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.610
 taking the ride the guy looks like 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.590
 believe in those china and rooster 2000 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.290
 in the playcenter genebra 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.850
 we get a little bit here just from 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:42.100
 Watching you have at home, are you? 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.660
 riding a motorcycle, which is the most 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.690
 because if the ball came to a halt that 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.340
 caught the wheel if you look at the car 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.320
 the detour of the route I do not keep looking 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.910
 for the only car you look does not bring 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.720
 in the direction of the wheel to see if it 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.400
 is coming back 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.739
 he threatens to return then what the guy 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.839
 died was there but the team is at 130 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.820
 to avoid 130 between two cars and not 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:08.670
 It is in a range to 131 to 130 and above the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.670
 white rock between the cars in the aisle 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.299
 It's in this do not you can run 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.360
 do so will die he speaks work is 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.040
 recording with the camera on the helmet 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.759
 looks cases the right now 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.380
 people give you the right to show there washed 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.790
 so if you're even quieter you can 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.050
 to see by her grandmother, she half said 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.229
 dilma gave guidance that it was not 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:47.420
 you should not drive a motorcycle 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:50.300
 actually is not marginal. 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.650
 Pine trees 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.650
 What madness do people put down again? 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:05.200
 ae 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:08.100
 an is reduced giving you a kiss for 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.100
 total control 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.320
 now a little for you to 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.210
 feel this sensation 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.210
 just looks we play next to each other 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.040
 these hours capital 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.040
 Sergio Mota in the house 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.069
 Look at us, one more thing, because 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.590
 I panicked did not catch the wheel 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.110
 Did you look at the car? 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.000
 the detour of the route does not appear in the car 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.620
 only you look does not bring in the direction of 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.360
 his wheel may be coming back 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.690
 he threatens to return then the guy 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.690
 saw 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.400
 What you should not do in transit 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.750
 SÃ£o Paulo with a motorcycle was with this 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.750
 boy just published
