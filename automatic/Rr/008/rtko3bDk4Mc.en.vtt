way<00:00:49.620> doing<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.070> canter<00:00:50.460> serpentine<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.660> course

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
way doing a canter serpentine of course

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.750 
way doing a canter serpentine of course
you<00:00:52.079> could<00:00:52.230> go<00:00:52.350> back<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> sitting<00:00:53.280> trot<00:00:53.489> or

again this is an excellent exercise
especially<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:58.260> equitation<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.609> control<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
especially for equitation and control of

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.380 
especially for equitation and control of
your<00:01:00.180> horse<00:01:00.920> your<00:01:01.920> centerline<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:03.120> your

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
your horse your centerline for your

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.660 
your horse your centerline for your
serpentine<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.739> vertical<00:01:05.129> line<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
serpentine is the vertical line down the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.850 
serpentine is the vertical line down the
middle<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.970> your<00:01:06.119> arena<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.710> where

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
middle of your arena so that is where

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.200 
middle of your arena so that is where
all<00:01:07.890> your<00:01:07.979> transitions<00:01:08.610> will<00:01:08.729> take<00:01:08.909> place

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
all your transitions will take place

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.179 
all your transitions will take place
where<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.049> halt<00:01:10.290> where<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> change<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
where you halt where you change a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.640 
where you halt where you change a
diagonal<00:01:11.460> where<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.030> change<00:01:12.299> your<00:01:12.450> leads<00:01:12.659> so

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
diagonal where you change your leads so

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.390 
diagonal where you change your leads so
with<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.950> we'll<00:01:14.220> go<00:01:14.310> ahead<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.610> started

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.020 

she's<00:01:20.400> got<00:01:20.670> their<00:01:20.939> correct<00:01:21.299> angle<00:01:23.030> she's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
she's got their correct angle she's

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.969 
she's got their correct angle she's
doing<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> first<00:01:24.720> loop<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.170> her<00:01:25.320> serpentine

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
doing the first loop of her serpentine

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.609 
doing the first loop of her serpentine
when<00:01:26.909> she<00:01:27.060> gets<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> center<00:01:27.780> has<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> little

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
when she gets to the center has a little

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.390 
when she gets to the center has a little
early<00:01:29.070> she's<00:01:29.670> got<00:01:29.850> changed<00:01:30.270> her<00:01:30.360> diagonal

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
early she's got changed her diagonal

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.980 
early she's got changed her diagonal
looking<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> right<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.270> she<00:01:33.329> knows<00:01:33.659> where

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
looking to the right so she knows where

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.770 
looking to the right so she knows where
to<00:01:34.020> go<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.970> we've<00:01:36.150> shortened<00:01:36.540> up<00:01:36.570> our

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
to go and we've shortened up our

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.300 
to go and we've shortened up our
serpentine<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.799> jumps<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
serpentine because we have jumps in the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.429 
serpentine because we have jumps in the
way<00:01:38.460> that's<00:01:39.360> why<00:01:39.540> she's<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:39.780> going<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
way that's why she's not going all the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.249 
way that's why she's not going all the
way<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> rail<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.070> every<00:01:41.280> case<00:01:42.259> she

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
way to the rail in every case she

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.630 
way to the rail in every case she
changed<00:01:43.649> her<00:01:43.710> diagonal<00:01:44.159> back<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
changed her diagonal back there in the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.730 
changed her diagonal back there in the
center<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.689> then<00:01:45.810> she<00:01:45.960> prepares<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
center and then she prepares for the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.260 
center and then she prepares for the
center<00:01:46.979> here<00:01:47.189> she's<00:01:47.369> gonna<00:01:47.490> sit<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:47.970> canner

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.920 
center here she's gonna sit in canner
right<00:01:48.659> at<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> end<00:01:50.030> she's<00:01:51.030> looking<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.780> where

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
