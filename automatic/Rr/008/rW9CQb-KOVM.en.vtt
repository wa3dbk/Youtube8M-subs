00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.300
 good hello 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.660
 The prestigious Japanese brand mizuno us 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:22.340
 presents the webcast in 8 a sneaker 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.910
 of trail running with changes 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.880
 interesting things that people from 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.820
 mizuno proposes changing a month that is a 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.520
 little more closed than the ascend 7 by 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.920
 so a little bit more resistant but 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.900
 with the virtue that continues to maintain a 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.449
 high breathability have been lowered 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.610
 slightly weight we are talking about 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:49.380
 a shoe that approximately the pair 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.390
 in 42 and a half weighs 600 grams and that 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.250
 we would highlight a sneaker like this 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.190
 we would highlight his last is a sneaker 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.690
 which has a good shape is wide and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.130
 so for all those people who do not 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.920
 you just found our shoe 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.620
 because you have wide foot the wave is a 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.720
 very suitable shoe 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:13.170
 who continue with their old philosophy of their 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.510
 wave-shaped chassis according what 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.910
 that ultimately allows us to give ourselves 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.470
 a lot of stability this chassis what 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.480
 is that it is very resistant to 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.040
 lateral torsion that doubles very well in the 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.300
 finger area that is just where I 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.510
 we need and the shape of their tacos is 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.130
 way in x what it does is that we have 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.220
 a lot of traction and that is practical in 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.260
 impossible that we have for that the bad 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.620
 good fortune to boot those happens 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.290
 lately with a very good amount of 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.500
 competitors of them with the wave I 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.530
 I've never seen a taco plucked 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.090
 good cushioning but you have to have 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.070
 in mind that it is a sneaker for 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.650
 people who are not extremely 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.670
 heavy as long as you are below 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.280
 the 75 kilos is a very very very shoe 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.990
 valued very interested very interesting 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.790
 and over there you you can start 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.369
 find problems of instability 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.330
 because it is tremendously damping 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.520
 nothing wave up to 8 a shoe with a 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.590
 new cosmetic more attractive to me 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.840
 way to see but mostly still 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.060
 keeping your technology still doing 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.920
 an excellent sole and still have a 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.850
 composition of the first materials 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.950
 quality 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.420
 nothing sneaker explained way fast in 8 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.420
 until another see you
