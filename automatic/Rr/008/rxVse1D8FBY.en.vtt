 This is the end I'm broken case 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.680
 I did not particularly drop it, but I put it in my pocket 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.539
 It can be said that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.539
 I will remove the case for a moment 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.370
 Remove the case 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.670
 I will show it to you 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.670
 This is it here 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.750
 this 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.549
 This I'm being chased 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.600
 I was broken 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.680
 this is 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:19.990
 In case you had and price as the genuine to 4000 yen 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.220
 this 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.820
 Low quality 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.820
 Say to the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.830
 How is it? 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:36.390
 I thought a little 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:41.010
 Those who can buy this Apple genuine case from now on will be very important as a point of caution 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:47.100
 He's saying but I think maybe it's something plastic 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.900
 I'm just sticking this river on a plastic case that wo n't cost 1,000 yen. 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.080
 Of the very 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.270
 Moroi will break immediately 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.840
 I really do not drop the knife I drop 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.950
 I just put everything in my pocket for indoor use 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.860
 Here is broken 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:09.700
 Because the brother of the earphone jack is so small 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:12.780
 Please be careful because the first absolute there is no bamboo grass and not a straight-type cable 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.780
 I use 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.130
 That's Dr. Dre and one of the beats b series 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.650
 It's not this straight type, so it gets caught 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.650
 It is severe 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.300
 So just think about this management and buy this first 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.080
 Positive in this case 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:41.180
 It's not that cheap, so only there really 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:47.240
 Please note that this is something I thought I used 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.950
 Ending anymore at Apple fan When told Well maybe I do I say if this another go or row 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.520
 I will leave 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.590
 Get c broken after c 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.590
 I will use another measure even if not 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.890
 Pre genuine case was a bit disappointing 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.890
 Have a nice day that will report over
