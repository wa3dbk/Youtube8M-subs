00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.080
 Fri. 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.029
 Heinrich probably knows himself 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.820
 be sure to decorate my room 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.380
 would like to renovate or that means one 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.140
 new federal and that means it lacks around 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.970
 new wall paint and new furniture and me 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.379
 of course not always know each 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.269
 has time and money too 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.010
 It's always a fire, too 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.510
 completely to renovate but he can 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.220
 densest now and then just such a time 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.420
 change yourself needs of 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.910
 I have a new lessing today 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.620
 studio album the video for you I have 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.400
 I already made two such so if 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.420
 you who have not seen yet 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.879
 father in the infobox 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.379
 That's what I'm laying for you and I would 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.480
 say we go directly and me 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.090
 show you what I created so the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.770
 Incidentally, I have idea of â€‹â€‹sandra resp 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.050
 vomp interest so i you that you me 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.720
 I think that made me up 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:11.399
 schÃ¶nberg so that one day at some point 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.720
 pink was pink, I had an old 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.369
 stand vase i will start at ikea 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.380
 bought and I just like that 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.410
 school blackboard was bought at the hardware store and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.789
 then just turn your nose to violence 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.170
 I just say year two 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.060
 stratified and in between 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.380
 Just let it dry well 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.240
 just cover well and you do not have to 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.740
 something prosa sees through that 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.679
 works really well and super 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.750
 dry too quickly with us too 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.369
 home in the cellar so a package all yellow 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.170
 found so I believe that the package 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.429
 is worth or just like that you make it 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.380
 can actually be in many different ways 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.000
 buy shops and I have just that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.979
 wrapped up so drum just stuck 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.289
 knots and then so a few 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.759
 wrapped along for centimeters and long 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.569
 back down a knot and that made 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.459
 are cut off 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.630
 the remains and then I find that 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.509
 actually a bit cooler from a 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.099
 a little bit special and then I have 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.509
 I can still order so chalk markers 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:02.520
 I link down the camera myself 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.780
 order cheap at amazon today and 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.670
 so a little bit of those flowers 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.349
 I had a very cool repainting 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.360
 it all looks a little bit more 3d 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.560
 and then i just have my flowers 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.300
 the previously also in the vase in it 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.300
 stuck again and me 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.590
 think that the totally cool from such a 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.150
 bit grown-up than just this 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.959
 pink a vase and I like it 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.959
 really good 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.090
 Here I have my shoulder again 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.010
 use topping and so a jar 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.120
 I just painted this completely 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.170
 you would not have the floor now 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.219
 necessarily know once 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.230
 I know I have it somehow 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:39.389
 started and then came 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.889
 and then I have top for the lid 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.810
 I use these basse children 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.609
 ordered at Amazon you can 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.049
 but also quite normal in the bastelladen 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.299
 buy so you do not have to do it 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.980
 order in contains in any case have 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.269
 I painted the lid with it and then 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.280
 so a little glitter on it scattered 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.260
 and just when it 's dry 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.810
 surplus blitzer so knocked out and 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.159
 posted from that is not really so 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.750
 bad if you then stop everything 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.669
 So always have to be bit careful 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.889
 and with the chalk markers I have 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.419
 because best of tralee fifteen on it 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.269
 it is written that way 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.799
 a memory sinha glass that means I have 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.599
 on a note simply the memory 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.120
 So far, they have described this to me 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.560
 the years have remained so in the memory 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.810
 are simple beautiful and then the me 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.189
 I like to remember and think back 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.280
 Of course you can do that too 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:25.169
 What like tickets or concert 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.810
 Bender ticket that always clean 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:29.040
 and thus things simple and at the end 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.049
 of the year you can because the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.310
 look at things again and you just 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.310
 remember again 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.450
 I liked the idea at Peaches 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.560
 and I found her so awesome and so once 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.970
 that I wanted to show 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.439
 and you just have to 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.569
 fill a bowl with water and 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.500
 then your favorite nail polish so you 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.540
 choose or a cool one 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.280
 color combination simple and always one 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.409
 little bit of the nail polish her that 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.689
 pour water and then we take you 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.010
 such a year creates silt or spit 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.329
 just like that in the wood plays or 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.489
 any back in front of the brush or 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.590
 so and could create such a pattern there 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.180
 you can become so creative and then 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.709
 It does not look like this or it does not look that way 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.939
 in other colors I think that's right 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.470
 nice just beautiful 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.329
 and then you just dive a glass 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.370
 or someday else there 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.870
 best he takes care of that she is 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.579
 not quite down to earth because then 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.289
 he goes quite magath again work ground 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.300
 and sticks there and not on the glass we 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.590
 have to be annoying and then you can go to 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.690
 For example, the Deko Steinheim rows 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.580
 fill and somehow as an artist 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.010
 use or as a pen holder for 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.510
 desk or something and that's what I think 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.370
 a really nice idea and there you can 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.349
 make really cool designs 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:42.830
 and yes that is now synonymous with me 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:44.660
 Spring table with me is very important 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.070
 also things that I like and the 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.080
 I also ask my room because 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.130
 I now do not just anything 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.169
 for such a video I find that somehow 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.669
 nonsense yes, so can something from the 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.139
 has after it makes you so liked 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.360
 then send me photos in any case 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.010
 on twitter on Instagram because I am 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.169
 always cool looking so what 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.060
 you think up something that is probably at home 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.389
 has and what he did with it 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.039
 is just so cool see more part 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.810
 want because I felt it was not so in 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.280
 Running in a redesign is that 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.900
 I'll do a few more things myself 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.300
 will try a few things and 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.220
 I want myself one then and 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.729
 the comments mature then you do 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.729
 me now too 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.800
 dm
