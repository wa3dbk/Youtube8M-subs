00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.140
 to the girls of good finger this 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.730
 final makeup I come to transform 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.740
 for halloween day and it's something very 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.030
 simple to perform so I hope that 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.769
 like it 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.320
 good friends, I'm just going to do 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.500
 this makeup on one side of my face 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.169
 in this case the left one and then I 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.750
 I'm applying a gum 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:26.220
 eyelashes and I'll put it in shape 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.220
 oval on my cheek 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.220
 then you girls the material that I'm going to 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.590
 use now is a clay that the 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.550
 I got in dyson ink and it's 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.460
 a product that children use 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.790
 so it does not cause absolutely nothing 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.220
 it's not toxic, so I'm going to 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.640
 put on my cheeks this material is 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.940
 super soft dry after a few 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.890
 hours so it's very easy to handle it 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.030
 I'm just pretending 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.030
 a few long strips and I'm hitting 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.710
 I have done all that way let's put 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.710
 also a bit in the center part 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.590
 This type of makeup is done with 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.510
 latex but girls I'm not going to spend 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.250
 money or we will not be money 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.440
 just to use it one day 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.480
 latex is very expensive and is very 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.490
 professional so let's do with what 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.830
 that we can have at home as 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.990
 in this case if you did not have this 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.590
 material at home can do it with 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.750
 toilet paper and some rubber 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.299
 and good as you see, let's go 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.310
 putting bit by bit and what 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.619
 let's go riding after that I 'm going to 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.960
 take my normal base the one that always 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.820
 applying the face and we will try to 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.950
 paint a bit that part 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.250
 as you see until you see if it's very 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.320
 manageable so there is no problem 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.140
 after that we are going to take what would be 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.050
 our shadows and the first to catch 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.790
 it will be a more or less dark brown color 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.790
 and we're going to put it around 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.830
 obviously not touching the outside 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.860
 because we're going to see the effect like that 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.050
 there was never a disunity and it's just 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.910
 Our skin 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.459
 now girls I'm going to take another kind of 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.770
 color that is this is a wine color very 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.940
 dark so we 're going to put it 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.940
 slowly 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.590
 this material girls is so soft 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.250
 that simply with the brush strokes that 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.280
 we are giving it goes like that joining more 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.650
 to the skin so it practically forms 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.170
 a hole after that we're going to take a 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.190
 red color and we're going to put it in the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.190
 part of the banks 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.819
 since it's almost painted we're going to take 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.410
 a matt black color and we're going to give it 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.410
 some little touches too 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.960
 and then we have almost everything painted 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.540
 let's take our rubber again 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.990
 eyelashes and we're going to apply little to 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.990
 little bit 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.520
 after having done that let's move on to 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.460
 take some false nails we are going to 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.130
 engineer us the girls this halloween 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.440
 so a false fingernail preferably 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.140
 that is white or this color that is 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.020
 beige you can cut it in two and 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.090
 let's go forming our teeth like this 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.090
 that we are going to paste one and the other 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.879
 successively we will go placing each 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.540
 tooth and this time we're going to put 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:14.000
 first some supposed older teeth 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.769
 in the beginning part and then in the 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.890
 part of the end we are decreasing the 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.890
 size 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.660
 to finish we will give a touch of 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.889
 realism by applying artificial blood 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.749
 around the teeth 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.909
 so this we 're going to do with a lot 

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:31.889
 Careful if you did not have this in your house 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:35.159
 you can just do it with a little 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.259
 of strawberry jelly with a little bit of 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:40.159
 water and so they can easily do their 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.159
 artificial blood 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.159
 and so ends girls our final look 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.650
 for halloween once again I hope that 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:52.699
 everyone like a kiss for all and we 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.699
 we see until the next
