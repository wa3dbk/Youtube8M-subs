around<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:22.330> fold<00:02:22.750> them<00:02:22.960> around<00:02:24.060> then<00:02:25.060> take

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
around and fold them around then take

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.100 
around and fold them around then take
that<00:02:25.630> piece<00:02:26.440> fold<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:26.890> up<00:02:27.040> take<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.300> front

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
that piece fold it up take the front

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.680 
that piece fold it up take the front
section<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.710> car<00:02:29.830> like<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.630> hold<00:02:31.630> that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
section of the car like that hold that

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.840 
section of the car like that hold that
up<00:02:31.990> and<00:02:32.110> out<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.380> way<00:02:32.500> take<00:02:33.070> these<00:02:33.280> fenders

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
up and out of the way take these fenders

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.470 
up and out of the way take these fenders
down<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:37.800> clip<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:38.830> piece<00:02:39.340> into<00:02:39.670> there<00:02:39.940> so

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
down and clip that piece into there so

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.430 
down and clip that piece into there so
then<00:02:40.630> now<00:02:40.930> it's<00:02:41.170> starting<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.560> look<00:02:41.650> like<00:02:41.770> that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
then now it's starting to look like that

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.900 
then now it's starting to look like that
take<00:02:44.440> these<00:02:44.590> pieces<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.010> fold<00:02:45.520> them<00:02:45.700> off<00:02:45.790> to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
take these pieces and fold them off to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.350 
take these pieces and fold them off to
the<00:02:45.970> side<00:02:46.000> fold<00:02:46.930> down<00:02:47.140> these<00:02:47.940> blade<00:02:48.940> pieces

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
the side fold down these blade pieces

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.070 
the side fold down these blade pieces
and<00:02:49.570> flip<00:02:49.810> out<00:02:49.930> his<00:02:50.050> hand<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.880> now<00:02:55.120> we<00:02:55.690> get<00:02:55.810> to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
and flip out his hand and now we get to

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.180 
and flip out his hand and now we get to
his<00:02:56.260> legs

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190

piece<00:03:13.420> right<00:03:13.630> here<00:03:14.170> being<00:03:14.590> nothing<00:03:15.040> there<00:03:16.049> and

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
piece right here being nothing there and

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.210 
piece right here being nothing there and
that<00:03:17.350> would<00:03:17.470> have<00:03:17.590> just<00:03:17.739> been<00:03:17.860> so<00:03:18.040> difficult

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
that would have just been so difficult

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.600 
that would have just been so difficult
trying<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.790> find<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.120> way<00:03:19.239> how<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.480> make<00:03:19.630> it

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
trying to find a way how to make it

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.280 
trying to find a way how to make it
actually<00:03:21.610> work<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:22.150> now<00:03:22.269> we<00:03:22.810> get<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.140> feet

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
actually work so now we get to the feet

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.170 
actually work so now we get to the feet
you<00:03:24.150> want<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.299> rotate<00:03:25.660> out<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.739> leg<00:03:27.150> like<00:03:28.150> that

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
you want to rotate out the leg like that

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.650 
you want to rotate out the leg like that
all<00:03:29.519> kind<00:03:30.519> of<00:03:30.610> at<00:03:30.700> once<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.120> then<00:03:31.239> straighten

so do the same over here fold I'll do it

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.420 
so do the same over here fold I'll do it
slower<00:03:40.000> fold<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.660> out<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.260> fender<00:03:41.620> fold<00:03:42.310> the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
get sideswipe to stand up because wheel

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.120 
get sideswipe to stand up because wheel
feeding<00:04:04.180> in<00:04:04.330> and<00:04:04.930> there<00:04:05.260> we<00:04:05.380> have<00:04:05.530> sideswipe

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
feeding in and there we have sideswipe

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.470 

just<00:04:19.299> as<00:04:20.299> a<00:04:20.450> comparison<00:04:20.980> there<00:04:21.980> is<00:04:22.100> a<00:04:22.130> road

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
just as a comparison there is a road

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.420 
just as a comparison there is a road
topspin<00:04:23.480> which<00:04:25.990> he's<00:04:26.990> actually<00:04:27.290> sizes<00:04:28.280> up<00:04:28.400> to

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
topspin which he's actually sizes up to

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.180 
topspin which he's actually sizes up to
him<00:04:28.700> pretty<00:04:29.120> well<00:04:29.390> actually<00:04:29.600> it's<00:04:30.080> not<00:04:30.260> that

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
him pretty well actually it's not that

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.280 
him pretty well actually it's not that
bad<00:04:31.490> like<00:04:33.040> mudflap<00:04:34.040> or<00:04:34.400> ratchet<00:04:35.390> that<00:04:35.540> really

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
bad like mudflap or ratchet that really

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.940 
bad like mudflap or ratchet that really
