00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
well I'm just making a basic thread base

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.390 
well I'm just making a basic thread base
nothing<00:00:12.419> important<00:00:12.809> just<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.830> cover<00:00:14.039> it<00:00:14.219> so

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
nothing important just to cover it so

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.920 
nothing important just to cover it so
the<00:00:14.900> material<00:00:15.900> sticks<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.439> the<00:00:17.390> epoxy<00:00:18.390> has

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
the material sticks and the epoxy has

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.710 
the material sticks and the epoxy has
something<00:00:19.349> to<00:00:19.380> stick<00:00:19.500> to

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
little bit of a base see I guess it'll

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.889 
little bit of a base see I guess it'll
help<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.480> stick<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.720> not<00:00:49.050> twist<00:00:53.570> if<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.719> don't

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
help it stick and not twist if I don't

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:11.960 
help it stick and not twist if I don't
stick<00:00:55.170> my<00:00:55.320> fingers

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.490 
good for us to fish probably don't care
and<00:01:27.100> then<00:01:27.670> this<00:01:27.910> front<00:01:28.270> part<00:01:28.509> gets<00:01:28.840> all<00:01:29.110> tied

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
and then this front part gets all tied

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:50.819 
and then this front part gets all tied
down<00:01:29.800> so<00:01:46.800> you<00:01:47.800> get<00:01:48.070> that

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.359 

do<00:01:51.369> your<00:01:51.460> hair<00:01:51.700> for<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:51.969> wind<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:53.409> only<00:01:54.340> I

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
do your hair for the wind and only I

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.399 
do your hair for the wind and only I
would<00:01:54.670> have<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.850> ruler<00:01:55.299> so<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.719> measure<00:01:55.990> lay

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
would have a ruler so you measure lay

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.410 
would have a ruler so you measure lay
from<00:01:56.890> here<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.579> here<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:58.060> here

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
from here to here to here

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.779 
from here to here to here
but<00:01:59.350> I'm<00:01:59.500> just<00:01:59.530> gonna<00:01:59.799> kind<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.159> eyeball<00:02:00.579> it<00:02:00.759> so

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
but I'm just gonna kind of eyeball it so

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.260 
but I'm just gonna kind of eyeball it so
that<00:02:01.090> would<00:02:01.240> be<00:02:01.450> from<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.170> end<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
that would be from the end and that

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.899 
that would be from the end and that
would<00:02:04.509> be<00:02:04.719> about<00:02:05.469> the<00:02:05.679> wing<00:02:05.859> size<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.850> I'm

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
would be about the wing size so I'm

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.729 
would be about the wing size so I'm
gonna<00:02:07.149> hold<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:07.569> and<00:02:07.929> trim<00:02:08.229> off<00:02:08.379> the<00:02:08.560> back

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
gonna hold that and trim off the back

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:16.860 
gonna hold that and trim off the back

take<00:03:29.160> this<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:30.180> fold<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.840> over<00:03:30.960> the<00:03:31.710> top<00:03:34.880> since

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
take this and fold it over the top since

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.940 
take this and fold it over the top since
you<00:03:36.030> down<00:03:36.210> to<00:03:36.540> hard<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.170> sent<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.560> down<00:03:37.710> too

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
you down to hard so I sent you down too

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.970 
you down to hard so I sent you down too
hard<00:03:37.980> it'll<00:03:38.310> flare<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:38.850> too<00:03:39.030> much<00:03:39.240> and<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.980> want

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
hard it'll flare it too much and I want

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.770 
hard it'll flare it too much and I want
to<00:03:41.040> bend<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.400> around<00:03:41.490> so<00:03:41.970> it's<00:03:42.120> even<00:03:42.540> all<00:03:42.690> the

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
to bend it around so it's even all the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.340 
to bend it around so it's even all the
way<00:03:42.930> around<00:03:43.320> like<00:03:44.750> that<00:03:48.110> forward<00:03:49.110> a<00:03:49.140> little

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
way around like that forward a little

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.910 
way around like that forward a little
bit<00:03:49.470> now<00:03:49.650> cinch<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.960> so<00:03:51.960> I<00:03:51.990> got<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.260> nice<00:03:52.530> flat

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
bit now cinch it so I got a nice flat

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:07.670 
bit now cinch it so I got a nice flat
platform<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.700> put<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:53.970> legs<00:03:54.180> on

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680
