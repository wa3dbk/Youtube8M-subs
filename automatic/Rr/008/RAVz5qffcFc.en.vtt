00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
excited it's so soft in my hands are

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.039 
excited it's so soft in my hands are
just<00:03:08.810> running<00:03:09.170> right<00:03:09.650> through<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:10.780> that<00:03:11.780> one

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
just running right through it that one

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.110 
just running right through it that one
strand<00:03:13.540> but<00:03:14.540> that's<00:03:14.690> nothing<00:03:14.900> because<00:03:16.120> when

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
strand but that's nothing because when

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.819 
strand but that's nothing because when
you<00:03:17.239> first<00:03:17.480> get<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.810> hair<00:03:18.019> just<00:03:18.049> running<00:03:18.709> your

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
you first get the hair just running your

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.170 
you first get the hair just running your
hand<00:03:19.070> store<00:03:19.280> it's<00:03:19.430> not<00:03:19.549> going<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.820> tell<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.000> if

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
hand store it's not going to tell you if

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.259 
hand store it's not going to tell you if
the<00:03:20.299> hair<00:03:20.480> shades<00:03:20.780> or<00:03:21.110> not<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:21.790> that's<00:03:22.790> nothing

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
the hair shades or not so that's nothing

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.560 
the hair shades or not so that's nothing
this<00:03:23.690> probably<00:03:23.930> is<00:03:24.110> just<00:03:24.170> excess<00:03:24.829> of<00:03:25.900> here

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
this probably is just excess of here

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.930 
this probably is just excess of here
it's<00:03:29.570> really<00:03:29.930> saw<00:03:30.320> feel<00:03:30.590> eyes<00:03:30.769> and<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.700> curl

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
it's really saw feel eyes and the curl

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.940 
it's really saw feel eyes and the curl
pattern<00:03:32.299> is<00:03:32.420> really<00:03:32.780> nice<00:03:32.959> I<00:03:35.500> wonder<00:03:36.500> how<00:03:36.650> long

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
pattern is really nice I wonder how long

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.020 
pattern is really nice I wonder how long
this<00:03:37.640> this<00:03:38.090> will<00:03:38.329> lose<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:39.739> looks<00:03:40.010> like<00:03:40.310> 22

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
this this will lose it looks like 22

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.770
