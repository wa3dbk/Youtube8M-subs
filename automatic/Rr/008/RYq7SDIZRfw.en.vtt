00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.170
 that this file makes it home that we are 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.750
 playing in a new part sky diktat 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.980
 wars on one of my favorite maps and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.779
 let's do the challenge of f1 yes sir I 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.730
 you have asked many to do challenges like this 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.099
 that then I do challenge of f1 by 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.380
 example here today today the most 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.960
 complicated of this is going to be that I'm going to 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.920
 have to 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.480
 for I see things is worth it 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.760
 complicated but I do not see I do not see the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.309
 blocks I see nothing but good but bad 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.370
 that I use the eastern keys and 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:50.870
 so I can try and I can 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.970
 I have no father, the good thing is that 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.309
 as I say the mouse keys then 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.079
 of the mouse from the keyboard collar and I give it 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.579
 to the student for example to put the 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.600
 sword and then I know that I am 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.370
 hitting with the sword right now 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.170
 so it's easy for me between 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.840
 quotes is worth it and I also know that 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.539
 I have them here in another block 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.119
 Another key is valid, so if you see that 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:14.630
 this is weird and all that I am 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.910
 too pro and those things is because their 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.890
 father is because I am using the keys 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.130
 of the keyboard okay I did not think I have anything 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.130
 rare 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.990
 how I've saved myself look I'm going to put this 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.960
 over here to see this is going to eat the food 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.399
 and the food is less bad than me from time to time 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.130
 when I saw him giving here to the air to see 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.140
 what I have here I have a steak here and 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.580
 it's going to be complicated as I say because 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.200
 but it is the first time I try and 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.540
 As you can see, I am little seen 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.810
 little bit more or less I stayed what you're worth 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.600
 I would have to take this and do so and in 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.900
 perfect theory yes perfect leave me in 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.890
 peace 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.500
 leave me alone children leave the stallion to 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.360
 see let's go mother of mine 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.000
 I have less I have you I have caught 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.000
 I him this one come on so you're going to do 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.420
 I do not have that that I do not have left 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.239
 blocks that you see for example here I 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.970
 I have all this there cycled the 5 s button 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.769
 the key that dad to be able to do it 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.450
 and good because now I challenge the challenges 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.390
 because you set out to do the challenges now 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.700
 well 3 simply because the sun is equal 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.440
 is seriously you have done that to me like a 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.100
 pig to see if you burn to see if you 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.100
 you burn your feet 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.880
 at first 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.650
 good in what is here we are in the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.260
 next game I will try to make 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.360
 the challenge of no armor worth this is the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.010
 second game our star starts 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.170
 here start for me the first thing that 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.550
 cost that armor you know here the touch 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.340
 from harvard what this helps me to 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.900
 make me a good arquito and nothing here 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.670
 we are in jungle this map that is 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.230
 quite complicated to play more than 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.610
 nothing because there is almost no chest you do not touch 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.260
 nothing like you are seeing me has not 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.810
 touched nothing at least I touch food 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.610
 that is something important and nothing because I have 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.650
 made the first challenge of f1 and 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.870
 now let's see if we get the challenge of 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.090
 the armor and heard but that's me 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.799
 same thing breaking something if I'm less bad 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.120
 try to make the challenge of playing without 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.620
 armor will complicate as I say but 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.720
 I trust my Polish pin and I will 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.370
 throw everyone to take for ass off the map 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.019
 I do not have arrows and it's something that touches me 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.490
 a little bit the balls because I could 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.060
 make me bow 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.710
 and it gives to kill people not only not 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.480
 just to do and nothing guys this what 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.150
 I do then in the comments say come 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.160
 my god leave me alone leave me alone 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.770
 life I shit in your life I shit on you 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.240
 life armand is let me peace I do not know why 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.270
 be sent if you have a brain face but 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.190
 Looks Looks Looks Colleague To Colleague Proof 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.900
 what I'm going to do is going to be legendary 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.900
 come on you die children 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.390
 I'm two challenges in a row to fail 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.490
 I tried to do this challenge a long time ago and 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.620
 it did not work out so I said enough 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.360
 give for ass and step to do but today 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.640
 I'm doing it and at the moment well 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.540
 It's okay, I never go, I'm going pretty well 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.490
 I can not help and this also what 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.170
 take to see if you have any 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.120
 to see if he throws any while they 're 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.340
 making the serial delay goes through the 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.769
 half of the two and I do not give them in any 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.750
 but it will hold could I throw away that day already 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.840
 only with the eggs are humanized and more 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.990
 valuable if I'm as bad as you can 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.330
 imagine and you can see why but good 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.950
 I am without armor I think I believe yes to see 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.240
 if now I'm playing with armor and not 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.280
 I realized but I'm not playing 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.930
 with armor the most complicated to be the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.790
 final because the colleague will be che 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.110
 just like I'm not going to like it and nothing 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.250
 anyway, if I do not get it either 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.900
 nothing happens because this video 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.520
 I just wanted to do it for 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.080
 do the challenge of f1 what happens is that 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.030
 I 've done it so fast at 2 minutes 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.800
 already the first one that dark you that I have not 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.270
 done no other game and then I have 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.919
 said then I 'm going to try it I'm going to 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.960
 make another challenge to see if to see if to see 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.409
 if it is worth two challenges on the same day 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.659
 followed 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.550
 because they are challenges followed, that is, this is 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:00.489
 the game I 'm playing after 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.529
 right after the other worth my mother 

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:04.689
 they still have not killed so we're going to 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:08.019
 try not to be like that and be able to 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:09.789
 get it and be able to do something epic goes 

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:12.759
 to be complicated as I say but everything 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.919
 you can achieve leave me in peace of said this 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:18.839

 I do not know where the colleague is where you are 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:45.190
 Christ can be epic with this colleague 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.820
 for this 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.760
 I'm afraid 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.380
 where is God sir gave me 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.270
 if mobility has gone to the middle 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.190
 because now he's going to touch me if he's gone 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.000
 the medium has gone to the middle as a 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.680
 Now, uncle, what am I doing? 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.220

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.220
 same place 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.279
 this is going to be complicated is guys if 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.869
 I do not get it good I will have arrived 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:10.520
 very far because look, look, it is 

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:13.729
 that is incredible everything as it arrives 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:18.349
 here and without armor is that everything I believe 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:20.330
 because it is the one that is the no no this is going to 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.240
 be complicated this is going to be very 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.149
 complicated because he's watching me 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.499
 he is seeing me and he knows that I am here and 

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:28.939
 What do I do now, guys, what do I do?

 finish this this is the first and second 

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:44.839

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:44.759
 challenges you receive the also if you want 

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:46.559
 that he does it with thief javier that he 

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:48.539
 that I want and put makes me the challenge of not 

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:50.879
 I know that with a thief, maybe I'll make a 

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:52.409
 a series that challenges ja thief or 

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:53.819
 I know what I'm going to do but good
