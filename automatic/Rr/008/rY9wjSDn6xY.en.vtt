another<00:01:43.290> idea<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.860> your<00:01:44.040> own<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.329> pretty

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
another idea of your own you can pretty

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.170 
another idea of your own you can pretty
much<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.770> same<00:01:47.009> thing<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.280> do<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.729> it'll

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
much do the same thing I do and it'll

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.420 
much do the same thing I do and it'll
come<00:01:48.450> out<00:01:48.570> right<00:01:48.810> looking<00:01:49.200> very<00:01:49.229> nice<00:01:49.439> so

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
come out right looking very nice so

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.190 
come out right looking very nice so
first<00:01:50.670> things<00:01:50.909> first<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.329> took<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.630> animated

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
first things first I took the animated

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.990 
first things first I took the animated
ones<00:01:52.409> where<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.649> actually<00:01:52.829> animate<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.610> bow

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
ones where you actually animate the bow

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.179 
ones where you actually animate the bow
and<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.960> made<00:01:55.170> there<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.829> make<00:01:55.950> sure<00:01:55.979> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
and I made there just to make sure it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.399 
and I made there just to make sure it
would<00:01:56.280> fit<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.759> then<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.329> draw<00:01:57.630> dragged<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.290> up

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
would fit and then I draw dragged it up

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.830 
would fit and then I draw dragged it up
to<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> drug<00:01:59.009> drag<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.549> up<00:01:59.640> i<00:01:59.790> don't<00:01:59.820> know<00:02:00.030> i<00:02:00.240> drag

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
to a drug drag it up i don't know i drag

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.200 
to a drug drag it up i don't know i drag
it<00:02:00.869> up<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:02.009> where<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.310> actual<00:02:02.670> bow<00:02:02.969> is

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
it up to the to where the actual bow is

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.030 
it up to the to where the actual bow is
and<00:02:03.540> then<00:02:03.630> i<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.719> took<00:02:04.020> out<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.560> bow<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.009> i

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
and then i just took out that bow that i

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.089 
and then i just took out that bow that i
had<00:02:05.219> there<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.759> i<00:02:06.750> basically<00:02:07.170> got<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.680> colors

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
had there and i basically got the colors

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.369 
had there and i basically got the colors
added<00:02:08.550> some<00:02:08.700> stuff<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.270> because<00:02:09.629> i<00:02:09.959> was

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
added some stuff to it because i was

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.270 
added some stuff to it because i was
testing<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.830> out

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
testing it out

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.040 
testing it out
craft<00:02:11.580> at<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> same<00:02:11.970> time<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.870> make<00:02:13.020> sure

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
craft at the same time to make sure

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.240 
craft at the same time to make sure
everything<00:02:13.500> looked<00:02:13.680> right<00:02:13.860> now<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.069> inner

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
everything looked right now the inner

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.580 
everything looked right now the inner
workings<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.000> we're<00:02:15.150> all<00:02:15.180> right<00:02:15.590> here's

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
workings of it we're all right here's

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.890 
workings of it we're all right here's
where<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:16.860> turn<00:02:17.150> change<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.360> actual<00:02:18.510> arrow

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
where I turn change the actual arrow

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.190 
where I turn change the actual arrow
into<00:02:19.590> like<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> plasma<00:02:21.209> blast<00:02:21.600> whatever<00:02:22.110> it

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
into like a plasma blast whatever it

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.420 
into like a plasma blast whatever it
looks<00:02:22.380> like<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.770> took<00:02:22.950> quite<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.250> while<00:02:23.310> for

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
looks like this took quite a while for

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.090 
looks like this took quite a while for
me<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.850> actually<00:02:23.970> do<00:02:24.560> just<00:02:25.560> because<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.890> wanted

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
me to actually do just because I wanted

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.270 
me to actually do just because I wanted
to<00:02:26.250> look<00:02:26.430> right<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.920> there's<00:02:28.920> actually<00:02:29.220> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
to look right but there's actually a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.520 
to look right but there's actually a
problem<00:02:29.730> they<00:02:29.970> will<00:02:30.120> look<00:02:30.300> like<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.959> your

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
problem they will look like that in your

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.809 
problem they will look like that in your
inventory<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:32.250> when<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.430> actually<00:02:32.520> shoot

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
inventory but when you actually shoot

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.910 
inventory but when you actually shoot
them<00:02:32.940> it'll<00:02:33.090> still<00:02:33.270> look<00:02:33.300> like<00:02:33.450> an<00:02:33.569> arrow

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
them it'll still look like an arrow

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.740 
them it'll still look like an arrow
that's<00:02:34.920> actually<00:02:35.160> will<00:02:35.550> actual<00:02:36.060> coding<00:02:36.390> that

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
that's actually will actual coding that

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.210 
that's actually will actual coding that
does<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.170> you're<00:02:37.500> not<00:02:37.650> going<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.890> be<00:02:37.950> able<00:02:37.980> to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
does that you're not going to be able to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.610 
does that you're not going to be able to
do<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.060> unless<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.780> change<00:02:40.020> some<00:02:40.230> code<00:02:40.410> and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
do that unless you change some code and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.210 
do that unless you change some code and
put<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.770> mod<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.310> um<00:02:42.050> but<00:02:43.050> for<00:02:43.560> now<00:02:43.709> that's

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
put a mod in it um but for now that's

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.830 
put a mod in it um but for now that's
going<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.610> have<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.820> do<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.300> going<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.570> have<00:02:45.690> to

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
going to have to do is going to have to

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.380 
going to have to do is going to have to
look<00:02:46.019> how<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.350> looks<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:46.830> other<00:02:47.730> than<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.030> I

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
look how it looks but other than that I

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.810 
look how it looks but other than that I
do<00:02:48.450> actually<00:02:49.110> make<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.830> plasma<00:02:50.220> pistol<00:02:50.519> able

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
do actually make the plasma pistol able

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.690 
do actually make the plasma pistol able
to<00:02:50.940> charge<00:02:51.209> up<00:02:51.450> with<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> animation<00:02:52.440> um<00:02:52.769> in

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
to charge up with the animation um in

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.670 
to charge up with the animation um in
actual<00:02:54.510> minecraft<00:02:54.900> game<00:02:55.050> so<00:02:55.080> you'll<00:02:55.410> see<00:02:55.560> that

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
actual minecraft game so you'll see that

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.920 
actual minecraft game so you'll see that
in<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.860> second<00:02:56.280> when<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.850> come<00:02:57.120> down<00:02:57.269> here<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.600> just

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
in a second when I come down here I just

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.630 
in a second when I come down here I just
copy<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.440> layers<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.890> what<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.069> already<00:02:59.340> made

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
copy the layers of what I already made

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.020 
copy the layers of what I already made
and<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.540> drag<00:03:00.900> them<00:03:01.080> right<00:03:01.410> down<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
and I drag them right down to the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.620 
and I drag them right down to the
appropriate<00:03:03.660> place<00:03:03.840> where<00:03:04.170> they<00:03:04.260> belong<00:03:04.590> on

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
appropriate place where they belong on

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.120 
appropriate place where they belong on
top<00:03:06.630> of<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.870> bow<00:03:07.050> just<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.500> know<00:03:07.650> where<00:03:08.010> my

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
top of the bow just so I know where my

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.960 
top of the bow just so I know where my
placement<00:03:08.489> is<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:10.489> take<00:03:11.489> out<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> bow<00:03:11.910> of

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
placement is and I take out the bow of

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.520 
placement is and I take out the bow of
course<00:03:12.360> in<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.600> background<00:03:12.989> or<00:03:13.080> look<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.319> it

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
course in the background or look is it

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.710 
course in the background or look is it
would<00:03:13.650> look<00:03:13.769> very<00:03:14.100> bad<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.580> then<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.819> add<00:03:15.000> how

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
would look very bad and then I add how

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.900 
would look very bad and then I add how
the<00:03:15.780> in<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.980> game<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.340> plasma<00:03:17.640> pistol

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
the in the game the plasma pistol

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.640 
the in the game the plasma pistol
actually<00:03:18.209> charges<00:03:18.630> up<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.049> I<00:03:19.079> start<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.500> add

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
actually charges up so I start to add

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.720 
actually charges up so I start to add
that<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.970> between<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.049> like<00:03:22.380> energy<00:03:23.190> receptor

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
that in between the like energy receptor

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.430 
that in between the like energy receptor
things<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.150> don't<00:03:24.209> know<00:03:24.299> what<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.690> but<00:03:24.870> you

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
things I don't know what it is but you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.990 
things I don't know what it is but you
know<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.739> game<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.100> lean<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.610> sideways

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
know in the game you lean it sideways

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.520 
know in the game you lean it sideways
and<00:03:27.180> charge<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.450> up<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:29.310> know<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.670> shoots<00:03:30.030> um

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
and charge it up you know that shoots um

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.680 
and charge it up you know that shoots um
the<00:03:31.530> sound<00:03:31.829> effects<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.940> sound<00:03:33.209> effects<00:03:33.480> of

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
the sound effects the sound effects of

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.050 
the sound effects the sound effects of
that<00:03:33.720> won't<00:03:34.350> come<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.980> just<00:03:35.519> be<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.730> look<00:03:35.910> of

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
that won't come is just be the look of

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.680 
that won't come is just be the look of
it'll<00:03:36.329> still<00:03:36.570> sound<00:03:36.780> like<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.930> bow<00:03:37.200> um<00:03:38.690> because

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
it'll still sound like a bow um because

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.900 
it'll still sound like a bow um because
you<00:03:40.440> need<00:03:40.769> a<00:03:40.799> magic<00:03:41.040> put<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.459> sound<00:03:41.700> and

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
you need a magic put the sound and

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.030 
you need a magic put the sound and
obviously<00:03:42.390> but<00:03:43.109> if<00:03:43.320> you're<00:03:43.470> just<00:03:43.560> going<00:03:43.799> for

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
obviously but if you're just going for

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.759 
obviously but if you're just going for
looks<00:03:44.310> um<00:03:44.760> this<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.959> how<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.170> do<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.590> and

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
looks um this is how to do it and

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.520 
looks um this is how to do it and
obviously<00:03:47.489> there<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.420> then<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.500> last

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
obviously there it is and then the last

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.990 
obviously there it is and then the last
thing<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.280> guys<00:03:50.400> going<00:03:50.579> to<00:03:50.609> have<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.850> do

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
thing you guys going to have to do

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.060 
thing you guys going to have to do
obviously<00:03:51.239> this<00:03:51.690> is<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.900> items<00:03:52.380> fire<00:03:52.590> file

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
obviously this is the items fire file

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.849 
obviously this is the items fire file
which<00:03:53.280> is<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.640> PIAA<00:03:53.880> are<00:03:54.209> in<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:55.140> GUI<00:03:55.470> in

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
which is in the PIAA are in the GUI in

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.560 
which is in the PIAA are in the GUI in
the<00:03:56.010> minecraft<00:03:56.400> bin<00:03:56.579> but<00:03:57.239> you're<00:03:57.420> going<00:03:57.510> to

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
the minecraft bin but you're going to

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.870 
the minecraft bin but you're going to
have<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.930> also<00:03:58.260> edit<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.769> particle<00:03:59.340> pack<00:03:59.579> and

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
have to also edit the particle pack and

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.699 
have to also edit the particle pack and
the<00:04:00.299> particle<00:04:00.690> pack<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:00.989> just<00:04:01.170> in<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.380> bin<00:04:01.560> you

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
the particle pack is just in the bin you

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:02.870 
the particle pack is just in the bin you
scroll<00:04:01.980> all<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.100> way<00:04:02.190> down<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.579> end<00:04:02.670> of

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
scroll all the way down to the end of

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.550 
scroll all the way down to the end of
the<00:04:02.940> bin<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.150> it'll<00:04:03.480> say<00:04:03.570> particles<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.200> P&amp;G

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
the bin and it'll say particles that P&amp;G

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.160 
the bin and it'll say particles that P&amp;G
and<00:04:04.980> this<00:04:05.700> is<00:04:05.880> how<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.060> actually<00:04:06.510> change<00:04:07.049> the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
and this is how you actually change the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.490 
and this is how you actually change the
way<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.590> looks<00:04:07.829> when<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.160> shoots<00:04:08.430> um<00:04:09.500> so

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
way it looks when it shoots um so

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.720 
way it looks when it shoots um so
basically<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.920> just<00:04:11.190> change<00:04:11.430> all<00:04:11.609> the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
basically I just change all the

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.340 
basically I just change all the
particles<00:04:12.000> into<00:04:12.390> it<00:04:12.510> green<00:04:12.750> I'm<00:04:13.079> not<00:04:13.290> sure

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
particles into it green I'm not sure

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.470 
particles into it green I'm not sure
which<00:04:14.010> ones<00:04:14.340> is<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.700> actual<00:04:15.090> ones<00:04:15.269> that<00:04:15.390> it

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
which ones is the actual ones that it

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.779 
which ones is the actual ones that it
shoots<00:04:15.859> some<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:16.950> these<00:04:17.039> particles<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:17.669> I'm

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
shoots some of these particles that I'm

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.219 
shoots some of these particles that I'm
actually<00:04:17.910> editing<00:04:18.450> are<00:04:18.660> when<00:04:18.840> you're<00:04:18.989> under

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
actually editing are when you're under

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.570 
actually editing are when you're under
the<00:04:19.349> ground<00:04:19.530> in<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.830> bedrock<00:04:20.159> and<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:20.459> see

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
the ground in the bedrock and you see

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.700 
the ground in the bedrock and you see
the<00:04:20.669> particles<00:04:21.260> that's<00:04:22.260> what<00:04:22.409> some<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.590> these

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
the particles that's what some of these

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.890 
the particles that's what some of these
are<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.610> accidentally<00:04:24.150> edited

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
are that I accidentally edited

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.870 
are that I accidentally edited
but<00:04:25.229> the<00:04:25.500> ones<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:26.009> think<00:04:26.040> you<00:04:26.370> actually<00:04:26.550> have

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
but the ones you think you actually have

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.610 
but the ones you think you actually have
to<00:04:27.030> edit<00:04:27.150> for<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.690> are<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.050> ones<00:04:28.199> all<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.560> way

to edit for it are the ones all the way

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.469 
to edit for it are the ones all the way
at<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.740> top<00:04:28.949> which<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.340> edit<00:04:29.580> last<00:04:29.850> just<00:04:30.270> to<00:04:30.389> be

I see it I'll put it into the
description<00:04:39.870> but<00:04:40.380> for<00:04:40.560> now<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.680> just<00:04:40.860> did<00:04:41.310> all

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
description but for now I just did all

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.180 
description but for now I just did all
of<00:04:41.490> them<00:04:41.759> just<00:04:41.789> to<00:04:42.090> make<00:04:42.210> sure<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:43.009> I<00:04:44.009> made

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
of them just to make sure and I made

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.189 
of them just to make sure and I made
them<00:04:44.280> that<00:04:44.460> nice<00:04:44.639> green<00:04:44.970> blue<00:04:45.240> color<00:04:45.539> so<00:04:45.930> I

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
them that nice green blue color so I

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:47.600 
them that nice green blue color so I
didn't<00:04:46.740> really<00:04:46.860> know<00:04:47.009> what<00:04:47.130> color<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.370> go<00:04:47.580> with

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
didn't really know what color to go with

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.330 
didn't really know what color to go with
for<00:04:48.030> it<00:04:48.150> either<00:04:48.360> green<00:04:48.810> blue<00:04:49.110> purple<00:04:49.470> all

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
those different colors on the actual
