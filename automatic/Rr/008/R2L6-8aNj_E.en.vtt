are benign growths that you see
throughout<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.940> colon<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.830> as<00:00:07.830> we<00:00:08.099> age<00:00:08.370> both

throughout the colon and as we age both

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.060 
throughout the colon and as we age both
men<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.570> women<00:00:09.900> we<00:00:10.050> develop<00:00:10.469> these<00:00:10.590> polyps

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
men and women we develop these polyps

men and women we develop these polyps
that<00:00:11.700> over<00:00:12.000> time<00:00:12.240> they<00:00:12.660> can<00:00:12.900> become<00:00:13.230> cancerous

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
that over time they can become cancerous

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:22.480 
that over time they can become cancerous
cancerous<00:00:14.730> if<00:00:15.000> they're<00:00:15.179> not<00:00:15.299> detected<00:00:15.900> early

bleeding for a while you get a condition
called<00:00:33.120> anemia<00:00:33.630> when<00:00:33.840> your<00:00:33.989> red<00:00:34.140> cells<00:00:34.410> a

little<00:00:34.710> bit<00:00:34.829> too<00:00:35.010> low<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.670> if<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.180> happens

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
little bit too low and if that happens

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.110 
little bit too low and if that happens

you have fatigue or shortness of breath

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.930 
you have fatigue or shortness of breath
also<00:00:39.750> if<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> colon<00:00:40.379> cancer<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.129> pretty

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
also if the colon cancer is pretty

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090 
also if the colon cancer is pretty
extensive<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:43.050> affect<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> quality<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.950> your

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
extensive can affect the quality of your

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.799 
extensive can affect the quality of your
stool<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.910> what's<00:00:45.149> called<00:00:45.329> pencil

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
stool you can get what's called pencil

stool you can get what's called pencil
shaped<00:00:46.079> stools<00:00:46.520> abdominal<00:00:47.520> pain<00:00:48.300> nausea

shaped stools abdominal pain nausea

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.200 
shaped stools abdominal pain nausea
vomiting<00:00:49.590> constipation<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.940> would<00:00:51.090> say

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
vomiting constipation so I would say

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.360 
vomiting constipation so I would say
overall<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.750> signs<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:52.320> very<00:00:52.710> nonspecific

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
overall the signs are very nonspecific

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.209 
overall the signs are very nonspecific
for<00:00:54.360> colon<00:00:54.750> cancer<00:00:54.949> therefore<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.039> very

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
for colon cancer therefore it's very

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.819 
for colon cancer therefore it's very
important<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.840> listen<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.289> your<00:00:58.379> doctor

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
important that you listen to your doctor

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.889 
important that you listen to your doctor
and<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.399> get<00:00:59.609> your<00:00:59.789> screening<00:01:00.239> test<00:01:00.539> done<00:01:00.780> at

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and you get your screening test done at

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.869 
and you get your screening test done at
the<00:01:01.020> early<00:01:01.410> stage<00:01:01.739> because<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.430> lot<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.609> times

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the early stage because a lot of times

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:17.430 
the early stage because a lot of times
it<00:01:03.030> could<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.239> asymptomatic

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.440 

Stage<00:01:18.440> one<00:01:18.740> is<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:18.890> very<00:01:19.159> early<00:01:19.430> stage<00:01:19.909> let's

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
Stage one is a very early stage let's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.660 
Stage one is a very early stage let's
say<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.600> polyp<00:01:21.049> that's<00:01:21.229> become<00:01:21.530> cancerous<00:01:22.040> but

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
say a polyp that's become cancerous but

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.160 
say a polyp that's become cancerous but
hasn't<00:01:22.850> gone<00:01:23.119> through<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.540> wall<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:24.020> the

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
hasn't gone through the wall of the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.700 
hasn't gone through the wall of the
colon

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
colon

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.649 
colon
Stage<00:01:25.250> two<00:01:25.280> has<00:01:25.610> gone<00:01:25.790> through<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.210> wall<00:01:26.420> but

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
Stage two has gone through the wall but

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.749 
Stage two has gone through the wall but
it<00:01:26.750> hasn't<00:01:26.930> involved<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.530> lymph<00:01:27.830> nodes<00:01:28.070> that

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
it hasn't involved the lymph nodes that

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.730 
it hasn't involved the lymph nodes that
would<00:01:28.909> make<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.090> stage<00:01:29.450> 2<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.869> then<00:01:29.960> stage<00:01:30.259> 3

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
would make a stage 2 and then stage 3

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.350 
would make a stage 2 and then stage 3
would<00:01:31.039> be<00:01:31.310> if<00:01:31.490> it's<00:01:31.640> gone<00:01:31.789> through<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.149> lymph

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
would be if it's gone through the lymph

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.630 
would be if it's gone through the lymph
nodes<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:33.229> then<00:01:33.380> stage<00:01:33.649> 4<00:01:34.009> is<00:01:34.159> if<00:01:34.310> it's<00:01:34.460> gone

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
nodes and then stage 4 is if it's gone

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.270 
nodes and then stage 4 is if it's gone
to<00:01:34.850> organs<00:01:35.509> like<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.869> liver<00:01:36.049> or<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.649> cover<00:01:37.039> of

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
to organs like the liver or the cover of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.889 
to organs like the liver or the cover of
the<00:01:37.399> abdomen<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:37.970> called<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.210> peritoneum<00:01:38.630> or

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
the abdomen and called the peritoneum or

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.440 
the abdomen and called the peritoneum or
lungs<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.100> treatments<00:01:40.580> for<00:01:40.610> colorectal

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
lungs so the treatments for colorectal

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.510 
lungs so the treatments for colorectal
cancer<00:01:42.409> is<00:01:42.560> depending<00:01:42.979> on<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.220> stage<00:01:43.490> of

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
cancer is depending on the stage of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.169 
cancer is depending on the stage of
stage<00:01:44.030> 1<00:01:44.360> 2<00:01:44.569> 3<00:01:44.869> &amp;<00:01:44.990> 4<00:01:45.050> so<00:01:45.860> for<00:01:46.100> any<00:01:46.250> stage<00:01:46.640> cancer

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
stage 1 2 3 &amp; 4 so for any stage cancer

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.430 
stage 1 2 3 &amp; 4 so for any stage cancer
there's<00:01:47.360> basically<00:01:47.659> three<00:01:47.750> kinds<00:01:48.380> of

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
there's basically three kinds of

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.010 
there's basically three kinds of
treatments<00:01:48.860> surgery<00:01:49.250> chemotherapy<00:01:50.179> or

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
treatments surgery chemotherapy or

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.779 
treatments surgery chemotherapy or
radiation<00:01:51.440> therapy<00:01:51.710> or<00:01:52.250> sometimes<00:01:52.670> a

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
radiation therapy or sometimes a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.419 
radiation therapy or sometimes a
combination<00:01:53.060> of<00:01:53.630> things<00:01:53.899> there's<00:01:54.619> stage<00:01:54.890> 1<00:01:55.190> 2

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
combination of things there's stage 1 2

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.300 
combination of things there's stage 1 2
&amp;<00:01:55.580> 3<00:01:55.640> we<00:01:56.149> usually<00:01:56.509> try<00:01:56.690> to<00:01:56.720> do<00:01:56.960> surgery<00:01:57.619> first

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
&amp; 3 we usually try to do surgery first

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.059 
&amp; 3 we usually try to do surgery first
where<00:01:59.210> you've<00:01:59.390> moved<00:01:59.679> the<00:02:00.679> part<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:01.009> the

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
where you've moved the part of the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.740 
where you've moved the part of the
intestine<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.610> diseased<00:02:02.060> with<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.360> colon

intestine the diseased with the colon

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.620 
intestine the diseased with the colon
and<00:02:02.840> then<00:02:02.929> also<00:02:03.229> removed<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.649> lymph<00:02:03.920> nodes<00:02:04.630> in

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
and then also removed the lymph nodes in

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.320 
and then also removed the lymph nodes in
terms<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.259> some<00:02:06.979> selected<00:02:07.520> stage<00:02:07.789> 2<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.269> stage

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
terms of some selected stage 2 and stage

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.080 
terms of some selected stage 2 and stage
3<00:02:08.509> patients<00:02:09.019> would<00:02:09.739> get<00:02:09.920> chemotherapy<00:02:10.369> which

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
3 patients would get chemotherapy which

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.780 
3 patients would get chemotherapy which
is<00:02:11.239> basically<00:02:11.630> food<00:02:11.870> pill<00:02:12.200> or<00:02:12.410> IV<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:13.400> decrease

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
is basically food pill or IV to decrease

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.280 
is basically food pill or IV to decrease
the<00:02:13.940> chances<00:02:14.329> of<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.570> cancer<00:02:14.600> coming<00:02:15.170> back

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
the chances of the cancer coming back

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.949 
the chances of the cancer coming back
and<00:02:15.829> then<00:02:16.280> stage<00:02:16.579> 4<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.360> most<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.840> those

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
and then stage 4 and most of those

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.289 
and then stage 4 and most of those
patients<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.590> would<00:02:18.769> not<00:02:18.920> do<00:02:19.130> surgery<00:02:19.670> or

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
patients you would not do surgery or

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.300 
patients you would not do surgery or
radiation<00:02:20.840> therapy<00:02:21.079> for<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.739> matter<00:02:21.980> but

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
radiation therapy for that matter but

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.069 
radiation therapy for that matter but
you<00:02:22.400> would<00:02:22.519> do<00:02:22.670> mostly<00:02:22.970> chemotherapy<00:02:23.900> to

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
you would do mostly chemotherapy to

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.810 
you would do mostly chemotherapy to
control<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.590> symptoms<00:02:24.799> and<00:02:25.220> make<00:02:25.370> patients

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
control the symptoms and make patients

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.640 
control the symptoms and make patients
live<00:02:26.030> longer

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.720 

I<00:02:36.019> would<00:02:37.019> strongly<00:02:37.650> encourage<00:02:37.920> everybody<00:02:38.489> to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
I would strongly encourage everybody to

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.640 
I would strongly encourage everybody to
go<00:02:39.420> ahead<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.689> get<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.930> screening<00:02:40.379> test

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
go ahead and get that screening test

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.940 
go ahead and get that screening test
it's<00:02:41.430> probably<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.900> best<00:02:43.200> treatment<00:02:43.739> for

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
it's probably the best treatment for

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.670 
it's probably the best treatment for
colon<00:02:44.489> cancer
