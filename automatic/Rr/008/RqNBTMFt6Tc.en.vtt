surprise<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.530> two<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:01.920> typically<00:01:02.399> that's

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
surprise or two but typically that's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.109 
surprise or two but typically that's
what<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.149> expect<00:01:03.510> from<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.049> list<00:01:05.119> he

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
what you can expect from the list he

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.940 
what you can expect from the list he
goes<00:01:06.270> ahead<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.570> uses<00:01:06.900> his<00:01:07.049> spell<00:01:07.500> bomb<00:01:07.680> there

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
goes ahead and uses his spell bomb there

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.740 
goes ahead and uses his spell bomb there
and<00:01:08.250> he's<00:01:08.460> got<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> slow<00:01:09.030> start<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.659> that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and he's got a slow start and that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.380 
and he's got a slow start and that
behemoth<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> cost<00:01:11.610> him<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.030> lot<00:01:12.060> to

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
behemoth is going to cost him a lot to

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.410 
behemoth is going to cost him a lot to
be<00:01:12.510> able<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.810> effectively<00:01:13.380> attack<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> block

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
be able to effectively attack and block

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.880 
be able to effectively attack and block
so<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.570> maybe<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.259> actually<00:01:16.380> win<00:01:16.770> this

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
so I think maybe I can actually win this

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.700 
so I think maybe I can actually win this
game<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.280> looks<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.790> terrible<00:01:18.259> but<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.580> just

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
game that looks so terrible but as just

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.730 
game that looks so terrible but as just
an<00:01:23.030> instinctual<00:01:24.030> reaction<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.170> blow<00:01:25.409> up<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
an instinctual reaction I blow up the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.850 
an instinctual reaction I blow up the
blue<00:01:25.920> source<00:01:26.220> against<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> affinity<00:01:27.180> deck

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
blue source against the affinity deck

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.920 
blue source against the affinity deck
forgetting<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:28.979> he's<00:01:29.130> played<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.790> some<00:01:29.930> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
forgetting that he's played on some and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.950 
forgetting that he's played on some and
spell<00:01:31.140> bomb<00:01:31.350> which<00:01:31.619> puts<00:01:31.979> him<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.810> ancient<00:01:33.810> den

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
spell bomb which puts him on ancient den

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.929 
spell bomb which puts him on ancient den
actually<00:01:34.560> being<00:01:34.770> able<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.100> cast<00:01:35.310> spells<00:01:35.549> in

actually being able to cast spells in

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.780 
actually being able to cast spells in
his<00:01:36.060> deck<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.630> when<00:01:37.140> he<00:01:37.200> has<00:01:37.350> double<00:01:38.250> blue<00:01:38.460> on

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
his deck and when he has double blue on

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.179 
his deck and when he has double blue on
the<00:01:38.909> board<00:01:39.180> eat<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.950> blow<00:01:41.070> up<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
the board eat you have to blow up the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.980 
the board eat you have to blow up the
ancient<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.850> there<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.509> poor<00:01:42.750> play

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
ancient in there it's just a poor play

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530 
ancient in there it's just a poor play
and<00:01:43.860> I'm<00:01:43.979> left<00:01:44.189> wondering<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.270> would<00:01:45.479> have

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and I'm left wondering if I would have

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.109 
and I'm left wondering if I would have
been<00:01:45.960> able<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.290> actually<00:01:46.470> win<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> game<00:01:47.490> if

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
been able to actually win this game if

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.499 
been able to actually win this game if
I'd<00:01:48.420> made<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> right<00:01:48.990> play<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:50.509> destroyed

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
I'd made the right play and destroyed

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.480 
I'd made the right play and destroyed
his<00:01:51.689> ancient<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.259> perhaps<00:01:53.040> he<00:01:53.159> had<00:01:53.250> another

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
his ancient in perhaps he had another

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.190 
his ancient in perhaps he had another
white<00:01:53.759> source<00:01:54.619> chromatic<00:01:55.619> star<00:01:55.979> sphere<00:01:56.610> but

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
white source chromatic star sphere but

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.620 
white source chromatic star sphere but
we'll<00:01:58.200> never<00:01:58.320> know

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.359 

I'm<00:02:03.630> hoping<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.320> turn<00:02:04.560> it'll<00:02:05.100> attack

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
I'm hoping on this turn it'll attack

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.990 
I'm hoping on this turn it'll attack
with<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.030> frog<00:02:06.539> mine<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.170> squire<00:02:07.530> and

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
with the frog mine and the squire and

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.990 
with the frog mine and the squire and
let<00:02:09.000> me<00:02:09.119> vines<00:02:09.410> with<00:02:10.410> kicker<00:02:10.739> which<00:02:11.640> he<00:02:11.819> does

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
let me vines with kicker which he does

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.210 
let me vines with kicker which he does
and<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.260> lets<00:02:13.560> me<00:02:13.650> kill<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.430> Frog<00:02:14.670> night

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
and so this lets me kill the Frog night

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.059 
and so this lets me kill the Frog night
and<00:02:17.930> once<00:02:18.930> again<00:02:19.080> we're<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> plan<00:02:19.830> of

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
and once again we're on the plan of

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.660 
and once again we're on the plan of
trying<00:02:20.430> as<00:02:20.700> best<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:21.000> can<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:22.430> keep<00:02:23.430> his

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
trying as best we can to keep his

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.229 
trying as best we can to keep his
artifact<00:02:24.090> count<00:02:24.360> low<00:02:24.660> his<00:02:24.959> lane<00:02:25.260> count<00:02:25.560> low

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
artifact count low his lane count low

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.150 
artifact count low his lane count low
which<00:02:27.239> keeps<00:02:27.690> them<00:02:27.810> off<00:02:27.989> rush<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.769> knowledge

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
which keeps them off rush of knowledge

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.550 
which keeps them off rush of knowledge
and<00:02:29.489> hopefully<00:02:30.450> things<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.959> sombre<00:02:31.349> hover

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
and hopefully things like sombre hover

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.360 
and hopefully things like sombre hover
guard<00:02:32.000> thought<00:02:33.000> cast<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:34.220> conjunction<00:02:35.220> with

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
guard thought cast in conjunction with

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.000 
guard thought cast in conjunction with
this<00:02:35.670> behemoth

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.580 

here<00:02:42.580> on<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:42.819> turn<00:02:43.090> you've<00:02:43.299> got<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.629> just

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
here on this turn you've got to just

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.569 
here on this turn you've got to just
hope<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:44.890> there's<00:02:45.280> no<00:02:46.530> more<00:02:47.530> lands<00:02:48.069> or

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
hope that there's no more lands or

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.839 
hope that there's no more lands or
thought<00:02:48.819> cast<00:02:49.150> or<00:02:49.420> anything<00:02:49.840> he<00:02:50.680> draws<00:02:50.950> plays

thought cast or anything he draws plays

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.369 
thought cast or anything he draws plays
another<00:02:52.060> ancient<00:02:52.329> den<00:02:52.689> you<00:02:52.870> wonder<00:02:53.200> if<00:02:53.290> you

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
another ancient den you wonder if you

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.110 
another ancient den you wonder if you
had<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.680> there<00:02:53.860> on<00:02:54.579> turn<00:02:55.329> four<00:02:55.629> but<00:02:56.909> I'll<00:02:57.909> never

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
had it there on turn four but I'll never

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.300 
had it there on turn four but I'll never
know<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.629> Huffer<00:02:59.440> guard<00:02:59.680> comes<00:02:59.950> down<00:03:00.159> and

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
know and Huffer guard comes down and

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.949 
know and Huffer guard comes down and
with<00:03:00.400> only<00:03:00.519> 12<00:03:00.849> life<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.360> no<00:03:01.480> way<00:03:01.629> to<00:03:01.659> block

with only 12 life and no way to block

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.869 
with only 12 life and no way to block
fliers<00:03:02.290> that's<00:03:02.940> really<00:03:03.940> problematic<00:03:04.480> for<00:03:05.230> me

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
fliers that's really problematic for me

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.099 
fliers that's really problematic for me
and<00:03:06.879> essentially<00:03:07.269> at<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.569> point<00:03:07.810> my<00:03:07.870> only

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
and essentially at this point my only

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.569 
and essentially at this point my only
hope<00:03:08.440> is<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:09.459> top<00:03:10.329> deck<00:03:10.629> like<00:03:11.530> running<00:03:12.310> timber

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
hope is to top deck like running timber

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.000 
hope is to top deck like running timber
watch<00:03:12.760> or<00:03:13.180> hunt<00:03:13.599> master<00:03:14.079> into<00:03:14.500> timber<00:03:14.829> watch

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
watch or hunt master into timber watch

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.180 
watch or hunt master into timber watch
and<00:03:15.599> hope<00:03:16.599> that<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:16.959> can<00:03:17.079> push<00:03:17.680> through<00:03:17.950> for

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
and hope that I can push through for

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.729 
and hope that I can push through for
enough<00:03:18.400> damage<00:03:18.879> buying<00:03:19.629> an<00:03:19.900> extra<00:03:20.200> turn<00:03:20.440> with

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
enough damage buying an extra turn with

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.069 
enough damage buying an extra turn with
drain<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.250> Wells<00:03:21.810> life<00:03:22.810> gain<00:03:23.139> effect<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:25.079> so

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
drain the Wells life gain effect and so

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.110 
drain the Wells life gain effect and so
here<00:03:26.440> you're<00:03:26.590> just<00:03:26.799> going<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:26.980> run<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.430> hunt

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
thought cast is pretty bad here frog

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.600 
thought cast is pretty bad here frog
lights<00:03:58.849> not<00:03:59.180> good<00:03:59.390> and<00:04:00.159> that<00:04:01.159> allows<00:04:01.400> them<00:04:01.430> to

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
lights not good and that allows them to

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.240 
lights not good and that allows them to
replay<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.390> behemoth<00:04:04.810> so<00:04:05.810> if<00:04:06.409> we<00:04:06.799> had<00:04:07.220> a

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
replay the behemoth so if we had a

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.309 
replay the behemoth so if we had a
chance<00:04:07.519> to<00:04:07.730> win<00:04:07.849> it's<00:04:08.150> all<00:04:08.299> but<00:04:08.450> over<00:04:08.540> now<00:04:09.760> and

chance to win it's all but over now and

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.520 
chance to win it's all but over now and
no<00:04:12.319> timber<00:04:12.620> watching<00:04:12.920> on<00:04:12.980> top<00:04:13.190> anyways<00:04:13.579> but

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
no timber watching on top anyways but

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:24.340 
no timber watching on top anyways but
you<00:04:15.530> always<00:04:15.739> gotta<00:04:15.950> hope<00:04:16.160> right

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.660

you<00:04:29.300> gotta<00:04:29.480> see<00:04:29.720> maybe<00:04:30.110> think<00:04:30.710> it'll<00:04:31.070> be<00:04:31.130> in

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
you gotta see maybe think it'll be in

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.310 
you gotta see maybe think it'll be in
this<00:04:31.370> play<00:04:31.580> in<00:04:32.000> here<00:04:32.210> somewhere<00:04:34.870> swing<00:04:35.870> in<00:04:36.080> and

this play in here somewhere swing in and

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.140 
this play in here somewhere swing in and
he<00:04:36.410> goes<00:04:36.590> ahead<00:04:36.710> and<00:04:36.890> trades<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.580> behemoth

he goes ahead and trades the behemoth

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.730 
he goes ahead and trades the behemoth
further<00:04:39.070> when<00:04:40.070> our<00:04:40.220> patrol<00:04:41.410> has<00:04:42.410> another

further when our patrol has another

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.510 
further when our patrol has another
ancient<00:04:43.010> in<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:45.530> a<00:04:46.040> drink<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:46.370> age<00:04:46.520> which<00:04:48.520> will

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
ancient in and a drink of age which will

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.500 
ancient in and a drink of age which will
most<00:04:49.730> certainly<00:04:49.910> sealed<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:50.750> deal<00:04:52.510> although

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
most certainly sealed the deal although

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.270 
most certainly sealed the deal although
it<00:04:53.630> is<00:04:53.720> interesting<00:04:54.320> in<00:04:54.470> times<00:04:54.890> like<00:04:55.040> this<00:04:55.220> you

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
it is interesting in times like this you

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.370 
it is interesting in times like this you
can<00:04:55.580> see<00:04:55.790> what<00:04:56.000> their<00:04:56.210> tendency<00:04:56.930> is<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.080> go

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
can see what their tendency is to go

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.110 
can see what their tendency is to go
fetch

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.510 

and<00:05:04.990> he<00:05:05.110> shows<00:05:05.320> me<00:05:05.350> pyrite<00:05:05.889> spell<00:05:06.160> mom<00:05:06.340> which

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
and he shows me pyrite spell mom which
