00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
in here they're got this complete so if

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.090 
in here they're got this complete so if
something<00:02:41.050> should<00:02:41.200> start<00:02:41.410> happening<00:02:41.710> on<00:02:41.890> the

something should start happening on the
iphone<00:02:42.460> now<00:02:42.670> yep<00:02:43.270> there<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.540> go<00:02:43.710> run<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:44.920> bunch

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
iphone now yep there you go run a bunch

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.350 
iphone now yep there you go run a bunch
of<00:02:45.430> code<00:02:47.460> after<00:02:48.460> this<00:02:48.520> complete<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.150> go<00:02:49.240> and

of code after this complete and go and
take<00:02:49.540> complete<00:02:49.870> I'm<00:02:50.050> guessing<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:50.470> probably

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
take complete I'm guessing it probably
