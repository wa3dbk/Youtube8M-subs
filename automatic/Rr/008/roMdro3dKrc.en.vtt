00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.179
 Ah 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.770
 scom 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:49.940
 Hello , I am a literate who plays the role 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:53.870
 So when I come to another one, it's always a great performance. 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.920
 There were not many opportunities to dance, 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.559
 I 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:06.010
 Dwaeseo so ridden with makchum nonsense seems too funny 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.010
 So I do not know how to submit it before . 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:17.760
 Thank you so far so far 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:23.610
 The Taeyoung a cart or a fine question to the love that had 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.270
 Such characters are all characters in the mind who had some sad memories 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.070
 It is. 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.720
 But here in the genie, I am so bright, 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:39.229
 Okay so the introduction, but the good feelings that are not well represented ludicrous 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.610
 Then it has a bright character did not try because so far, and 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:48.280
 This is a melodrama. 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:52.270
 I am now experiencing such an excitement that yesterday will not experience at this age 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.230
 I might like to try this too a good mood 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.380
 To be honest with you, 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:04.060
 You're really good. I can tell you something. 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:09.369
 But there was something that I felt when I looked at a member. 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:12.880
 Yes, we have a lot of scenes where five of us gather together. 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.320
 When throwing something called the day before so now gathered in the two movies we talk 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.590
 I'm talking to you while you're shooting. 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:24.760
 I think we had a talk. 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:30.850
 Yes, it's that passion to say that what zeal, let's practice 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:35.590
 It's a little bit like looking at it so hard. 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:41.300
 I was embarrassed by myself, or when I first loved 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:46.090
 It is washable bright pink and pink like this 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:51.320
 I feel sad and depressed and bigger. 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:55.580
 When I have my first love, the feeling is very happy and good. 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:03:01.520
 But at the end of the day, 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:06.380
 I thought I wanted inde really the first time I tried to do this kid a commercial film materials 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:11.120
 I feel like I was lucky to be here. 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:17.240
 It's a new experience to have an employee film, 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:23.650
 I also have a great opportunity as a living quartet 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.650
 It seems like I'm sending it, so it's really good.
