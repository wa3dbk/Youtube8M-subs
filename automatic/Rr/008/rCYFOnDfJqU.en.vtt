00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
my point in saying all this is that we

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.910 
my point in saying all this is that we
have<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.210> do<00:00:03.330> expeditions<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.230> Attic<00:00:04.529> amba

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
have to do expeditions to the Attic amba

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.909 
have to do expeditions to the Attic amba
we<00:00:05.520> have<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.970> do<00:00:06.180> probably<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.140> year<00:00:07.560> or<00:00:07.589> two<00:00:07.890> or

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
we have to do probably a year or two or

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.700 
we have to do probably a year or two or
three<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.639> research<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.599> i'll<00:00:09.870> remind<00:00:10.200> people

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
three of research and i'll remind people

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.740 
three of research and i'll remind people
that<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.280> human<00:00:11.429> genome<00:00:11.940> project<00:00:12.000> cost

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
that the human genome project cost

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.930 
that the human genome project cost
billions<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.530> dollars<00:00:13.860> into<00:00:14.070> ten<00:00:14.370> years<00:00:14.670> and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
billions of dollars into ten years and

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.970 
billions of dollars into ten years and
thousands<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.509> scientists<00:00:15.929> we're<00:00:16.619> just<00:00:16.770> going

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
thousands of scientists we're just going

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.769 
thousands of scientists we're just going
into<00:00:17.430> something<00:00:17.670> that's<00:00:17.940> basically<00:00:18.600> an

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
into something that's basically an

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.529 
into something that's basically an
unknown<00:00:19.460> so<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.490> have<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.910> be<00:00:21.000> very<00:00:21.210> careful

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
unknown so we have to be very careful

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.230 
unknown so we have to be very careful
I'm<00:00:21.869> not<00:00:22.140> saying<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:22.590> et<00:00:22.949> I'm<00:00:23.490> saying<00:00:23.850> we<00:00:24.119> don't

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
I'm not saying as et I'm saying we don't

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.529 
I'm not saying as et I'm saying we don't
know<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:25.789> looking<00:00:26.789> at<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> big<00:00:27.119> clinical

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
know but looking at the big clinical

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.810 
know but looking at the big clinical
picture<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.680> cannot<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> normal

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
picture it just cannot just be a normal

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.820 
picture it just cannot just be a normal
it<00:00:30.330> affected<00:00:30.869> him<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.529> lived<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> be

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
it affected him and if it lived to be

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.100 
it affected him and if it lived to be
six<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.250> eight<00:00:32.309> years<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.790> age<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.960> only

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
six to eight years of age and is only

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.250 
six to eight years of age and is only
six<00:00:34.350> inches<00:00:34.649> tall<00:00:35.149> moreover<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:37.110> gets

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
six inches tall moreover and this gets

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.619 
six inches tall moreover and this gets
into<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> little<00:00:37.950> more<00:00:38.629> controversial

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
into a little more controversial

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.930 
into a little more controversial
information<00:00:39.809> but<00:00:40.440> hey<00:00:40.559> why<00:00:40.770> not<00:00:40.800> MSO<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
information but hey why not MSO in and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.020 
information but hey why not MSO in and
for<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> diamond<00:00:42.840> for<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.230> dollar<00:00:43.940> there<00:00:44.940> have

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
for a diamond for a dollar there have

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000 
for a diamond for a dollar there have
been<00:00:45.059> teams<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.719> people<00:00:46.110> who<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.469> gone<00:00:46.770> into

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
been teams to people who have gone into

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.979 
been teams to people who have gone into
that<00:00:47.250> area<00:00:47.460> after<00:00:47.820> they<00:00:48.710> identified<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:50.989> who

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
that area after they identified this who

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.080 
that area after they identified this who
met<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.379> native<00:00:52.829> peoples<00:00:53.219> who<00:00:53.610> said<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
met with native peoples who said you

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.950 
met with native peoples who said you
know<00:00:56.059> there<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.210> been<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.600> these<00:00:57.750> that

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
know there have been more of these that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.540 
know there have been more of these that
have<00:00:57.989> been<00:00:58.140> seen<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.620> we've<00:00:58.920> seen<00:00:59.129> them<00:00:59.280> alive

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
have been seen and we've seen them alive

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.619 
have been seen and we've seen them alive
running<00:00:59.940> around<00:01:00.289> we've<00:01:01.289> also<00:01:01.500> seen<00:01:01.949> luminous

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
running around we've also seen luminous

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.539 
running around we've also seen luminous
sort<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.719> transdimensional<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.339> will

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
sort of transdimensional if you will

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.330 
sort of transdimensional if you will
energy<00:01:06.540> forms<00:01:06.960> look<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.350> basically<00:01:08.040> like

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
energy forms look like basically like

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.280 
energy forms look like basically like
eggs<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:08.939> circular<00:01:09.420> objects<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.140> come

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
eggs or circular objects that have come

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.730 
eggs or circular objects that have come
down<00:01:10.350> into<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.979> foothills<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.549> Andes<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
down into the foothills of the Andes and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.990 
down into the foothills of the Andes and
so<00:01:13.740> there's<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.979> great<00:01:14.189> deal<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> research<00:01:14.610> that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
so there's a great deal of research that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.020 
so there's a great deal of research that
has<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.299> done<00:01:15.979> an<00:01:16.979> expedition<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:17.850> this

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
has to be done an expedition to do this

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.969 
has to be done an expedition to do this
properly<00:01:18.299> would<00:01:18.600> cost<00:01:18.780> probably<00:01:19.770> ten<00:01:19.950> times

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
properly would cost probably ten times

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.850 
properly would cost probably ten times
what<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.580> cost<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.360> documentary<00:01:21.860> it's

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
what it cost to do this documentary it's

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.670 
what it cost to do this documentary it's
symmetrical<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.970> Epistle<00:01:27.600> plates<00:01:28.049> if

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
symmetrical and the Epistle plates if

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.730 
symmetrical and the Epistle plates if
you<00:01:28.920> look<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.220> x-ray

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
you look at the x-ray

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.590 
you look at the x-ray
which<00:01:31.340> is<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.640> gross<00:01:31.939> place<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:32.390> know<00:01:32.479> when

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
which is the gross place you know when

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.999 
which is the gross place you know when
you<00:01:32.689> have<00:01:32.869> you<00:01:33.049> know<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.320> growth<00:01:33.500> plates<00:01:33.799> and

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
you have you know the growth plates and

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.819 
you have you know the growth plates and
a<00:01:34.040> kid<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.490> they<00:01:34.549> hurt<00:01:35.119> their<00:01:35.270> leg<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:36.500> growth
