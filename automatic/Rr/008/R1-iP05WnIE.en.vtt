00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 so hello to everyone my name is sergey 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.270
 the store in the next video I was telling 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.620
 about bike backlighting 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.880
 which in the past video showed show 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.029
 everything is detailed how it works collected 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.619
 disassembled that's smooth 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.859
 it burns out smoothly goes out like this 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.609
 general show in detail but before that I want 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.189
 show you the channel interesting for the same 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.579
 topic about bikes I like recently 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.700
 started doing about what I found 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:45.180
 normal interesting channel 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:47.610
 autorota Andrei socks means well and also 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.430
 on the same topic to which I am the last 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.649
 time I shoot videos he has well here 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.559
 Bicycle light rollers about 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.850
 installation of different lamps here is not with 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.559
 turn not a committee some thing there 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.229
 column i saw it here column than 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.619
 put on all videos did not look at too 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.909
 watched well normal and interesting videos 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.770
 pax principle normal adequate 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.930
 sociable like well that is to all who 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.700
 interesting this topic subscribe to it 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.439
 channel link will be in the description 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.010
 and now directly about my 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.920
 I will tell the bike 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.140
 so today I will tell you about the structure 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.920
 backlight on the bike which is 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.920
 last video showed 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.050
 of beverage cans and the batteries 10 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:46.220
 penlight batteries more precise about 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.290
 12 volts of voltage give it a standard 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.120
 white LED strip they 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:56.210
 cheap now everywhere sold well where 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:05.690
 You can also buy inside the jar 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:08.540
 there is arduino nano and driver l298 n-well 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.520
 arduino basically any 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.910
 it is possible to use and generally in principle 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.800
 i use any microcontroller for here 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.980
 such a simple attenuation scheme and 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.250
 flare LED strip 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:29.420
 instead of the driver , you can also use 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.830
 almost any transistor if anyone in 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.440
 this understands who does not understand 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:38.200
 You can easily connect the driver and not 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.760
 soar in principle 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.459
 the simplest design can do 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.050
 every now show how 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.050
 disassembled, everything looks 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:58.500
 so tell you how the lights 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:03:03.030
 Bike is a button turn on 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.549
 change the brightness so here there is 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.840
 here is arduino nano 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:14.310
 no sketch is filled sketch is standard 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:19.269
 libraries sketch further language further faith 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:25.120
 the sketch is called faith as the ninth pin 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:30.250
 connected and power on the driver l298 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:34.299
 n stands there around 3 4 bucks on them 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:38.230
 100 rubles a cap from a can of us to files 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:45.129
 the bank itself is this whole system I am inside 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:52.269
 I will install there on so batteries here 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:56.489
 about 12 volts it turns out everything is 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.489
 In principle, there is nothing difficult 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:04.139
 collect it all very easily all quickly 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.609
 pretty simple 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:09.190
 thank you all for your attention 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.970
 who was helpful video like 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.970
 bye everyone
