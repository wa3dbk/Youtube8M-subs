a<00:03:40.150> lot<00:03:41.150> longer<00:03:41.299> to<00:03:41.540> get<00:03:41.629> unpackaged<00:03:42.819> John<00:03:43.819> told

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
a lot longer to get unpackaged John told

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.420 
a lot longer to get unpackaged John told
me<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.510> uh<00:03:46.180> those<00:03:47.180> things<00:03:47.980> they<00:03:48.980> package

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
me that uh those things they package

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.670 
me that uh those things they package
them<00:03:49.579> like<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:51.549> freight<00:03:52.549> train<00:03:52.579> I<00:03:53.590> think<00:03:54.590> he'd

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
them like a freight train I think he'd

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.170 
them like a freight train I think he'd
be<00:03:54.769> like<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:57.459> seriously<00:03:58.459> took<00:03:58.760> two<00:03:58.909> times

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
be like that seriously took two times

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.979 
be like that seriously took two times
longer<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.690> unpack<00:04:00.379> it<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:00.739> did<00:04:00.890> put<00:04:01.099> it<00:04:01.190> on<00:04:01.310> I

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
longer to unpack it and did put it on I

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.399 
longer to unpack it and did put it on I
did<00:04:02.989> have<00:04:03.859> him<00:04:04.099> put<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.840> white<00:04:05.840> tabs<00:04:06.200> on<00:04:06.560> mine

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
did have him put the white tabs on mine

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.809 
did have him put the white tabs on mine
I'll<00:04:09.409> eventually<00:04:09.680> put<00:04:10.010> some<00:04:10.190> probably<00:04:10.640> some

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
I'll eventually put some probably some

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:19.800 
I'll eventually put some probably some
worn<00:04:11.260> some<00:04:12.260> of<00:04:12.319> those<00:04:12.379> new<00:04:12.650> warn<00:04:12.950> lights<00:04:13.280> on<00:04:13.519> it

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.860 

so<00:04:20.810> anyway<00:04:22.360> that's<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.630> for<00:04:23.810> now

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
so anyway that's it for now

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.870 
so anyway that's it for now
next<00:04:26.530> thing<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.800> go<00:04:26.950> on<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.160> course<00:04:27.490> will<00:04:27.670> be<00:04:27.790> the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
next thing to go on a course will be the

next thing to go on a course will be the
winch<00:04:28.060> when<00:04:28.540> it<00:04:28.660> gets<00:04:28.810> here<00:04:29.280> actually<00:04:30.280> when

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
winch when it gets here actually when
