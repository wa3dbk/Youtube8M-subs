00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 andreas caminada from the chimneys 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.940
 also at the first swiss coop lowers 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.340
 been there 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.450
 and you have a premiere building 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.780
 namely celebrated my donation dishes 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.880
 we have created new dishes called 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.789
 to donate spenders RhaetoRomanic 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.279
 that means blood is so light 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:28.980
 brightness and we have a court 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.869
 the court presents sin with too 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.559
 still the spices with those with the picture 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:39.880
 run off with the aria trout and its 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.170
 the out of six dishes 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.420
 which you then feel I will then 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.980
 a tree show a menu is that 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.650
 imame is or was it out the back yet 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.090
 as a portraitist and then so with us 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.190
 also a bit of a relaxation 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.470
 but comes in the essential on the 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.440
 court is that's on an iphone with 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.910
 a visual installation will be here 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.910
 Exactly it is a cooperation with 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.400
 one runs and we have peter 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.170
 dm and with him that of the 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.410
 production to the court together 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.400
 devised and developed virtually and there 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.700
 we have defined different topics 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.220
 the second terror of spring is that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.500
 the end and others are still coming and that is 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.119
 really yes it is it's the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.259
 dishes or meals because from below 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.170
 that is lit with a 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.090
 installation and that thought 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.920
 normal others of the perception of the 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.780
 whole structures in the court that 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.979
 means we already have different ones 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.330
 a little bit looked that one also 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.680
 So things have a bit where 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.180
 shine through, for example , we put in 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.470
 jelly or very small chips looks then 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.890
 Also, flood this light 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.780
 to let 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.330
 there are completely new and different ones 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.619
 Perception there are many photographers and 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.450
 yes again pictures from below 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.860
 So let's light up now 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.300
 table 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.950
 I can also just one 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.660
 Maybe that's just white or color 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.119
 suspect money or whatever 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.679
 illuminate the dish completely 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.850
 different and I find that very exciting 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.340
 Do not you think the distraction is 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.710
 tasty dish in itself too strong 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.470
 I think that is so targeted again 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.000
 used that one relaxation 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.649
 Loosening up, I mean, that's mine 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.640
 said that it is very harmonious in 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.850
 Spain and I want that too 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.500
 break through a bit that something 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.030
 one in the grip we do not get 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.870
 to expect that a bit 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.050
 is loosened 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.550
 and I think that's my belly feeling 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.910
 says that will be a good change 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.910
 give 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.000
 It must indeed has done only the house itself 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.130
 you all if you believe in it but haye 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.010
 That's what I want to do then 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.660
 is it already good or the faith 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.450
 I definitely have a good time too 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.560
 thank you very much 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.840
 then believe one more here 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:52.090
 wonderful evening you want to be there 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:53.380
 thank you for the super-g 's too 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.239
 important that we started with that 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.080
 I think that's good exchange 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.989
 and perhaps should be a 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.360
 Continuation is the super platform in 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.180
 Great job and then fell 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.440
 enjoyed yes no it really needs 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.360
 Passionate people behind them 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.510
 stand and promote that as well 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.940
 otherwise you will first come as a church 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.800
 We were cooking in the kitchen and standing 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.260
 if you have people I am improvised 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.280
 such software to pose on 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.180
 contract 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.599
 has to do together 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.599
 rising
