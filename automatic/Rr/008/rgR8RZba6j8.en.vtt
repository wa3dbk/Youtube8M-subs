 hi here david hernandez and welcome to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.579
 my blog how to play acoustic guitar 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.519
 dot wordpress.com today we are going 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:13.949
 to be watching a lesson about 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.349
 rhythm that we will use at the rhythm 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.359
 right hand to apply the 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.810
 chords that we are seeing very well 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.689
 remember in the previous post where 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.730
 we have seen the major chord the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.609
 chord my greatest 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.790
 the remembered of major re and the chord of sun 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.550
 greater very well now let's make a 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.520
 exercise in which we will apply a 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.860
 rhythm a very basic rhythm that's why you 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.879
 I invite you to give me my right hand now 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.220
 same and we are going to perform this exercise 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.230
 this exercise or this rhythm is the most 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.960
 Basic to start power 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.220
 learn to play acoustic guitar and that 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.640
 is next we are going to place the hand of 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.630
 this way 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.510
 look 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:05.930
 and let's start 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:08.090
 down up down down up very well let's go 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.450
 to perform a small accent when 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.830
 let's touch it down we do more 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.010
 accent that up 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.250
 soft strong soft 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.870
 soft strong soft 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.640
 okay 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.980
 I hope you have your guitar there for 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:33.060
 that you can do with me once again 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:35.240
 strong soft strong strong soft strong 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.600
 strong 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.649
 very well very well that 's now we're going 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.899
 to put rhythm ready we will perform 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.909
 let's imitate the word a word 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.189
 have two syllables in this case I will 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:54.250
 use the word house to be able to 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.250
 perform in this way the house 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.700
 doing an accent when I do it more 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.670
 listen out 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.610
 home 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.060
 the symptoms in each track 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.730
 if you want to use other words pedro 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.730
 Pablo, tree, good, what do I know about his house? 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.720
 and now you can increase the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.720
 speed later 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.880
 that way very well now we're going to 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.180
 perform an exercise in which we are going to 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:43.760
 apply the corrections we are going to apply 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:47.480
 the greater then my greater then re greater 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.049
 my biggest that's the whole sequence I repeat 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.260
 the greater my greater re greater and my greater 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.939
 very well remember that to get there 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.890
 at this level of being able to play with rhythm and 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:00.200
 you must have practiced the chords 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.120
 learn hoops and changes 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.860
 true because then here we do not need 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.810
 quick changes besides that here already 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.750
 we started to accompany on the guitar 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.670
 to be able to play songs or that 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.240
 let us begin 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:17.190
 remember that it is 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:23.120
 this house ready house speed 12 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.120
 stories of 4 1 2 3 4 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.939
 very well over there I gave you an example of how 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.129
 start story up to 4 and we cover 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:34.159
 tell the house ready 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.890
 keep in mind this now I want to make you 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:40.900
 one caveat in each chord we're going to 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.900
 accent on the first strings 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.420
 I'm not playing the bass with all the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.420
 six full strings 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.890
 not if I'm not doing the hundred the 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.890
 first strings 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.410
 this is so that we can correspond 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.950
 cleaner and much better then she 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.110
 older listened to in my senior and the re 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.460
 higher 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.460
 seen no 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.880
 in your being chord ready let's start 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:21.560
 I'm going to change every four every four 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:26.570
 houses house house house house and change house 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:28.690
 cup mug house change house house house and 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:35.650
 house ready instead if simply 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.650
 let's start ok 1 2 3 and 4 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.430
 do not 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:12.829
 very well very well that's now we're going to 

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:12.829
 review in another exercise the following 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:21.440
 the 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:22.910
 sun the list of the sun the one that was 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.410
 other chords that we saw that were 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:30.390
 rest of the list 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.250
 to do the rhythm you have to handle the 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.490
 relaxed hand in this way as it 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.490
 note 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:42.009
 do not text anything the whole arm yes because it is 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.409
 a horrible 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:47.289
 we will also be the rarest 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.089
 taking all that time without touching as much 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.610
 possible relaxed and the hand of this 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:53.770
 way allowing more to have this 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.020
 movement of the circle ready of this 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.969
 part of the arm is very relaxed the 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.569
 part of the position that is fine very 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:04.050
 all right 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:04.050
 I start 1 2 3 and 4 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.860
 this very well I hope you're 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.180
 doing with me there on your guitar in 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.300
 the bottom part are the exercises 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.520
 written is all the encryption and is 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.800
 also the movement the direction of the 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.970
 rhythm movement ready remember that 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.800
 is with the word scarce or with a 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.380
 two syllable word that have 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.480
 seat the first one ready very well that's 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.310
