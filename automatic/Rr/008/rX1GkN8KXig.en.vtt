starting<00:00:03.240> our<00:00:03.330> beer<00:00:03.570> brewing<00:00:03.870> process<00:00:04.370> the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
starting our beer brewing process the

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.890 
starting our beer brewing process the
first<00:00:05.609> step<00:00:05.879> is<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.480> prepare<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.960> east<00:00:08.900> this

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
first step is to prepare the east this

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.780 
first step is to prepare the east this
is<00:00:10.050> like<00:00:10.230> growing<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.679> mini<00:00:10.920> batch<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.580> beer

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
is like growing a mini batch of beer

is like growing a mini batch of beer
we're<00:00:12.030> going<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.210> prove<00:00:12.420> three<00:00:13.349> cups<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:14.040> beer

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
we're going to prove three cups of beer

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.689 
we're going to prove three cups of beer
basically<00:00:15.030> really<00:00:15.540> concentrated<00:00:16.199> malt<00:00:16.699> and

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
basically really concentrated malt and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.370 
basically really concentrated malt and
we're<00:00:17.910> going<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> put<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> east<00:00:18.660> end<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.170> it's

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
we're going to put the east end and it's

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.960 
we're going to put the east end and it's
going<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.560> grow<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.390> Erlenmeyer<00:00:21.390> flask

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
going to grow in the Erlenmeyer flask

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.220 
going to grow in the Erlenmeyer flask
which<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.060> over<00:00:24.300> here<00:00:26.150> sanitizing<00:00:27.150> io2<00:00:27.990> for

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
which is over here sanitizing io2 for

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.130 
which is over here sanitizing io2 for
high<00:00:29.220> down<00:00:29.460> solution<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.359> probably<00:00:30.720> sanitized

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
high down solution is probably sanitized

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.139 
high down solution is probably sanitized
by<00:00:31.260> now<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.340> we'll<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.550> get<00:00:32.669> rid<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.030> root

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
by now so we'll just get rid of the root

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:42.720 
by now so we'll just get rid of the root
get<00:00:33.480> rid<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> IRS<00:00:33.840> for

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.910

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
and the rest of the malt so there's no

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
it's not bad and we'll try the heat back

has<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.710> boil<00:02:29.890> enough<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.460> sanitize<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.180> really

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
has to boil enough to sanitize it really

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.540 
has to boil enough to sanitize it really
make<00:02:32.980> sure<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.190> dissolves<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.970> sanitize<00:02:34.420> it

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
now we've got to put it in the sanitized

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.090 
now we've got to put it in the sanitized
Erlenmeyer<00:02:39.100> flask<00:02:40.230> now<00:02:41.230> this<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.830> part

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
Erlenmeyer flask now this is the part

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.930 
Erlenmeyer flask now this is the part
where<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.460> really<00:02:45.480> stand<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.660> have<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.780> funnel<00:02:47.230> so

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
where I really stand to have a funnel so

00:02:47.940 --> 00:03:03.840 
where I really stand to have a funnel so
of<00:02:48.940> course<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.300> always<00:02:49.450> forget<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.930> buy<00:02:50.050> one

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850

hope you enjoyed that now we've got a
chill<00:03:09.770> that<00:03:10.070> worked<00:03:11.500> pretty<00:03:12.500> quickly<00:03:17.020> so<00:03:18.020> we

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
chill that worked pretty quickly so we

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:37.780 
chill that worked pretty quickly so we
don't<00:03:18.140> want<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:19.240> cool<00:03:20.240> Sully<00:03:36.730> now<00:03:37.730> we

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
don't want it to cool Sully now we

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.090 
don't want it to cool Sully now we
didn't<00:03:38.060> lose<00:03:38.240> too<00:03:38.480> much<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.840> our<00:03:38.990> work<00:03:39.650> we<00:03:39.890> need

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
didn't lose too much of our work we need

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.340 
didn't lose too much of our work we need
about<00:03:40.190> 750<00:03:40.940> milliliters<00:03:41.360> and<00:03:41.570> we<00:03:41.990> still<00:03:42.200> have

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
about 750 milliliters and we still have

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.260 
about 750 milliliters and we still have
about<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:42.680> much<00:03:42.890> so<00:03:43.130> we're<00:03:43.430> fine

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.350 

chill<00:03:47.270> it<00:03:47.450> down<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:48.200> room<00:03:48.380> temperature<00:03:49.360> as

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
chill it down to room temperature as

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.060 
chill it down to room temperature as
quickly<00:03:50.750> as<00:03:50.990> we<00:03:51.110> can<00:03:51.290> really<00:03:52.390> because<00:03:54.070> the

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
quickly as we can really because the

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
quickly as we can really because the
more<00:03:55.280> it<00:03:55.400> linger<00:03:55.820> is<00:03:55.940> in<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.210> dangerous<00:03:58.090> range

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
more it linger is in the dangerous range

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.850 
more it linger is in the dangerous range

between 90 120 or so the more chance of
getting<00:04:03.950> a<00:04:04.160> bacterial<00:04:04.670> infection<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.210> we<00:04:05.240> want

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
getting a bacterial infection so we want

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.700 
getting a bacterial infection so we want
to<00:04:05.540> get<00:04:05.660> it<00:04:05.720> through<00:04:05.960> that<00:04:06.110> dangerous

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
to get it through that dangerous

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.170 
to get it through that dangerous
temperature<00:04:07.070> range<00:04:07.250> as<00:04:07.400> quickly<00:04:07.580> as<00:04:07.790> possible

and<00:04:08.630> where<00:04:08.810> I<00:04:08.840> spat<00:04:09.230> it<00:04:09.730> all<00:04:10.730> wait<00:04:10.970> on<00:04:11.120> that

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
and where I spat it all wait on that

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.920 
and where I spat it all wait on that
we'll<00:04:11.600> make<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:11.780> little<00:04:12.280> sanitizing<00:04:13.280> solution

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
we'll make a little sanitizing solution

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.720 
we'll make a little sanitizing solution
for<00:04:14.930> our<00:04:15.140> yeast<00:04:15.380> package<00:04:15.860> that's<00:04:16.160> too<00:04:16.280> much

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
for our yeast package that's too much

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.320 
for our yeast package that's too much
I<00:04:16.760> had<00:04:17.030> a<00:04:17.060> four

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.420 

you<00:04:22.840> generally<00:04:23.139> don't<00:04:23.319> have<00:04:23.379> to<00:04:23.710> measure<00:04:23.949> iota

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
you generally don't have to measure iota

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.129 
you generally don't have to measure iota
for<00:04:24.699> you<00:04:24.879> can<00:04:25.000> tell<00:04:25.240> by<00:04:25.419> this<00:04:25.479> color<00:04:25.870> whether

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
for you can tell by this color whether

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:35.459 
for you can tell by this color whether
it's<00:04:26.319> strong<00:04:26.560> enough<00:04:27.150> it's<00:04:28.150> way<00:04:28.330> too<00:04:28.389> strong

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:35.469 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:37.259 

our<00:04:36.009> thinking<00:04:36.309> ahead<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.610> want<00:04:36.849> to<00:04:36.939> just<00:04:37.089> reuse

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:37.269 
our thinking ahead I want to just reuse

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:40.679 
our thinking ahead I want to just reuse
that<00:04:37.599> out<00:04:37.719> of<00:04:37.779> the<00:04:37.869> port<00:04:38.110> from<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:38.259> flask<00:04:39.689> this

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:40.689 
that out of the port from the flask this

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:42.529 
that out of the port from the flask this
is<00:04:40.809> just<00:04:40.959> precaution<00:04:41.619> so<00:04:41.800> we<00:04:41.919> don't

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
is just precaution so we don't

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.139 
is just precaution so we don't
contaminate<00:04:43.539> anything<00:04:43.989> let<00:04:44.289> me<00:04:44.879> open<00:04:45.879> the
