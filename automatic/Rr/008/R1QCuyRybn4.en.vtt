00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.610
Do you already have everything you need
for your Halloween party? No? Then I

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.320
show you here a creepy eye.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.940
For the eyes, you need Fimo Classic in
white, blue and red. In addition, a black

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.850
lacquer pen, Fimo Liquid, a knife and
Dottingtool.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:57.110
Sculpt a white ball, take a pen and press
it into. The hollow must not be too deep.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.300
I used Fimo Classic blue for eye color.
The color is simply flattened and placed

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.410
in the hollow.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.600
With a black lacquer pen now you paint a
thick pupil in the eye.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.800
Now you roll out thin red polymer clay
and put it with a Dottingtool on the rim of

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.460
the eyes. Then there are the veins.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:32.180
Finally fill Fimo Liquid into the hollow.
Do not take too much. Cut out air bubbles

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.860
with a Dottingtool 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.850
Now your eye comes at 110 degrees for
30 minutes in the oven. Finish!
