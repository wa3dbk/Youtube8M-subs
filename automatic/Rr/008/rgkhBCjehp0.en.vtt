I

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.130 

so<00:00:03.850> we're<00:00:04.000> about<00:00:04.060> a<00:00:04.180> half<00:00:04.390> a<00:00:04.570> minute<00:00:04.720> into<00:00:04.990> the

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.140 
so we're about a half a minute into the

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.230 
so we're about a half a minute into the
brew<00:00:05.320> cycle<00:00:05.590> now<00:00:05.950> and<00:00:06.250> I<00:00:06.640> thought<00:00:06.820> it'd<00:00:06.940> be<00:00:06.970> fun

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240 
brew cycle now and I thought it'd be fun

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.790 
brew cycle now and I thought it'd be fun
just<00:00:07.270> to<00:00:07.650> get<00:00:08.650> a<00:00:08.679> shot<00:00:08.950> of<00:00:08.980> the<00:00:09.160> spray<00:00:09.490> head

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
just to get a shot of the spray head

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.420 
just to get a shot of the spray head
see<00:00:11.520> with<00:00:11.700> all<00:00:12.120> its<00:00:12.440> multiple<00:00:13.440> holes<00:00:13.650> that

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430 
see with all its multiple holes that

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.530 
see with all its multiple holes that
does<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> good<00:00:15.270> job<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.900> wetting<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.950> grinds

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540

into the brewing cycle you see there's

one<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.880> reasons<00:01:33.300> why<00:01:33.830> this<00:01:34.830> brewery

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
one of the reasons why this brewery

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.550 
one of the reasons why this brewery
achieve<00:01:35.520> such<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> hybrid<00:01:36.810> temperature<00:01:37.260> proper

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
achieve such a hybrid temperature proper

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.510 
achieve such a hybrid temperature proper
brewed<00:01:37.860> temperature<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.550> that<00:01:39.480> it<00:01:39.660> has<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.520> 1400

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
brewed temperature is that it has a 1400

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.480 
brewed temperature is that it has a 1400
watt<00:01:41.760> copper<00:01:42.630> heater<00:01:42.900> so<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.130> probably

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
watt copper heater so this is probably

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.060
