00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
kind of create three shapes and then to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.760 
kind of create three shapes and then to
underneath<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.510> two<00:00:37.200> more<00:00:37.410> underneath

underneath that and two more underneath
that<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.280> create<00:00:38.520> almost<00:00:38.820> kind<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
that to create almost kind of like a

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.040 
that to create almost kind of like a
puff<00:00:40.800> ball<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.399> guess<00:00:42.090> kind<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.660> shape<00:00:42.870> you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
puff ball I guess kind of shape you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.000 
puff ball I guess kind of shape you
really<00:00:43.260> can't<00:00:43.469> think<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.770> any<00:00:43.920> other

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
really can't think of it any other

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.740 
really can't think of it any other
better<00:00:44.340> way<00:00:44.550> then<00:00:45.210> I'm<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> kind<00:00:45.690> of

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
better way then I'm going to kind of

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.420 
better way then I'm going to kind of
wiggle<00:00:45.989> around<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.649> I'm<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.070> echo

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
wiggle around this and I'm going to echo

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.510 
wiggle around this and I'm going to echo
it<00:00:47.610> bringing<00:00:48.539> my<00:00:48.750> stitch<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.500> between<00:00:50.250> each

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it bringing my stitch in between each

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.330 
it bringing my stitch in between each
line<00:00:51.420> shape<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.320> way<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.739> creates<00:00:52.890> an

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
line shape so that way it creates an

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.189 
line shape so that way it creates an
effect<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.910> kind<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> looks<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.510> palm<00:00:54.840> tree

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
effect it kind of looks like a palm tree

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.099 
effect it kind of looks like a palm tree
I'm<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.309> travel<00:00:56.520> stitch<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.239> continue

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
I'm going to travel stitch and continue

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.250 
I'm going to travel stitch and continue
to<00:00:58.140> echo<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.649> multiple<00:00:59.250> times<00:01:00.109> expanding<00:01:01.109> it

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
to echo this multiple times expanding it

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.380 
to echo this multiple times expanding it
branching<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> out<00:01:02.160> making<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.850> bigger<00:01:03.059> so

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
branching it out making it bigger so

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.509 
branching it out making it bigger so
that<00:01:03.570> way<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.780> stands<00:01:04.140> out<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.890> surface<00:01:05.309> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
that way it stands out on the surface of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.690 
that way it stands out on the surface of
the<00:01:06.000> quilt<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:07.350> move<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.770> you're<00:01:08.070> simply<00:01:08.490> going

the quilt to move on you're simply going

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.210 
the quilt to move on you're simply going
to<00:01:08.820> branch<00:01:09.659> off<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.170> another<00:01:10.320> weekly<00:01:10.830> line

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
to branch off with another weekly line

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.660 
to branch off with another weekly line
and<00:01:11.630> more<00:01:12.630> kind<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.229> palm<00:01:13.500> fronds<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> best

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and more kind of palm fronds is the best

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.480 
and more kind of palm fronds is the best
way<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.880> could<00:01:15.090> think<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.860> play<00:01:16.860> with<00:01:17.100> how

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
way you could think of it play with how

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.060 
way you could think of it play with how
you<00:01:17.549> stitch<00:01:18.030> those<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.509> might<00:01:18.720> help<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.200> wiggle

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
you stitch those it might help to wiggle

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.609 
you stitch those it might help to wiggle
them<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:21.180> direction<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:22.080> might<00:01:22.290> help<00:01:22.530> to

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
them in one direction it might help to

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.249 
them in one direction it might help to
fill<00:01:22.950> one<00:01:23.159> side<00:01:23.490> than<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.880> other<00:01:24.000> or<00:01:24.479> you

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
fill one side than the other or you

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.469 
fill one side than the other or you
might<00:01:25.439> work<00:01:25.770> best<00:01:26.040> by<00:01:26.369> filling<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.360> know

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
might work best by filling you know

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.420 
might work best by filling you know
stitching<00:01:27.960> both<00:01:28.170> sides<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.680> both<00:01:28.920> fronds<00:01:29.340> at

stitching both sides of both fronds at
the<00:01:29.520> same<00:01:29.729> time<00:01:29.909> everybody's<00:01:30.630> different<00:01:30.920> you

a<00:01:36.210> little<00:01:36.450> bit<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.720> texture<00:01:37.140> there<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.540> really

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
a little bit of texture there and really

my quelled now it's kind of hard to tell
whether<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.840> an<00:01:49.200> echoing<00:01:49.590> design<00:01:49.979> or

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
whether this is an echoing design or

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.490 
whether this is an echoing design or
pivoting<00:01:50.610> design<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.149> those<00:01:51.360> designs<00:01:51.899> types

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
pivoting design and those designs types

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
pivoting design and those designs types
are<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.070> very<00:01:53.340> similar<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.180> honestly

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
are so very similar that it honestly

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.959 
are so very similar that it honestly
doesn't<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.320> matter<00:01:55.700> but<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.820> this

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
doesn't really matter but in this

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.609 
doesn't really matter but in this
situation<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.689> was<00:01:57.810> stitching<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:58.590> a

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
situation I was stitching this as a

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.010 
situation I was stitching this as a
pivoting<00:01:59.159> design<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.759> I'm<00:01:59.850> returning<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.869> my

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
pivoting design so I'm returning to my

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.719 
pivoting design so I'm returning to my
starting<00:02:01.560> point<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:02.100> echo<00:02:02.939> such<00:02:03.270> each<00:02:03.689> palm

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
starting point to echo such each palm

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.059 
starting point to echo such each palm
tree<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.259> is<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.530> build<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
tree and that is going to build up the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.589 
tree and that is going to build up the
texture<00:02:08.489> right<00:02:08.670> there<00:02:08.910> at<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.119> starting

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
texture right there at that starting

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.630 
texture right there at that starting
point<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.560> make<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.280> little

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
point it's going to make it a little

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.090 
point it's going to make it a little
darker

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
darker

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.100 
darker
and<00:02:13.190> it's<00:02:13.460> also<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:14.090> my<00:02:14.240> opinion<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.750> little

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
and it's also in my opinion a little

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.600 
and it's also in my opinion a little
easier<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.620> stitch<00:02:15.890> because<00:02:16.190> you're<00:02:16.520> not

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
easier to stitch because you're not

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.210 
easier to stitch because you're not
having<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:16.970> travel<00:02:17.360> stitch<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:18.170> order<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.710> come

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
having to travel stitch in order to come

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.040 
having to travel stitch in order to come
up<00:02:19.340> with<00:02:19.370> an<00:02:19.550> echo<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.180> can<00:02:20.300> see<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.480> go<00:02:20.870> back

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
up with an echo so you can see I go back

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.070 
up with an echo so you can see I go back
to<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.320> starting<00:02:21.710> point<00:02:21.770> pivot<00:02:22.660> echo<00:02:23.660> around

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
to that starting point pivot echo around

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.390 
to that starting point pivot echo around
that<00:02:24.380> palm<00:02:24.710> tree<00:02:25.330> come<00:02:26.330> back<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.220> hit<00:02:28.220> that

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
that palm tree come back and hit that

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.150 
that palm tree come back and hit that
point<00:02:28.640> again<00:02:29.620> everyone's<00:02:30.620> different<00:02:30.800> though

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
point again everyone's different though

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.980 
point again everyone's different though
if<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.490> want<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.820> stitch<00:02:32.030> this<00:02:32.270> as<00:02:32.480> an<00:02:32.630> echoing

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
if you want to stitch this as an echoing

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.680 
if you want to stitch this as an echoing
design<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.800> swirl<00:02:34.430> around<00:02:34.610> then<00:02:35.090> travel

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
design and swirl around then travel

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.270 
design and swirl around then travel
stitch<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.650> know<00:02:36.710> get<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:36.980> little

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
stitch and you know get a little

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.040 
stitch and you know get a little
different<00:02:37.430> distance<00:02:38.030> away<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.690> come<00:02:38.930> around

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
different distance away and come around

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.620 
different distance away and come around
it<00:02:39.320> that's<00:02:39.470> perfectly<00:02:39.920> fine<00:02:40.010> too<00:02:40.520> it's<00:02:40.850> really

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
it that's perfectly fine too it's really

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.460 
it that's perfectly fine too it's really
entirely<00:02:42.490> up<00:02:43.490> to<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.820> and<00:02:44.050> really<00:02:45.050> with<00:02:45.290> all

entirely up to you and really with all
of<00:02:45.620> these<00:02:45.740> designs<00:02:46.130> you've<00:02:46.370> kind<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.760> got<00:02:46.910> to

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
of these designs you've kind of got to

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.670 
of these designs you've kind of got to
just<00:02:47.180> figure<00:02:47.330> out<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.600> best<00:02:47.930> way<00:02:48.110> for<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.650> to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
just figure out the best way for you to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.100 
just figure out the best way for you to
stitch<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.460> then<00:02:50.300> everything<00:02:50.660> will<00:02:50.900> work

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
stitch it and then everything will work

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.750 
stitch it and then everything will work
out<00:02:51.260> great<00:02:51.320> on<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.770> surface<00:02:52.130> of<00:02:52.250> your<00:02:52.430> quilt

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
out great on the surface of your quilt

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.480 
out great on the surface of your quilt
you<00:02:53.720> can<00:02:53.870> see<00:02:54.050> that<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.350> generally<00:02:54.920> work<00:02:55.160> this

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
you can see that I generally work this

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.150 
you can see that I generally work this
in<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:56.360> row<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:57.200> I'm<00:02:57.290> kind<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:57.590> working<00:02:57.800> from

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
in a row so I'm kind of working from

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.820 
in a row so I'm kind of working from
left<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.550> right<00:02:58.640> first<00:02:59.110> across<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.170> quilt<00:03:00.620> I'm

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
left to right first across the quilt I'm

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.040 
left to right first across the quilt I'm
going<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.070> fill<00:03:01.280> in<00:03:01.490> this<00:03:01.670> corner<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.360> then

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
going to fill in this corner and then

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.690 
going to fill in this corner and then
whenever<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.470> fill<00:03:03.800> up<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.010> road<00:03:04.400> completely

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
whenever I fill up that road completely

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.970 
whenever I fill up that road completely
I'm<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.270> simply<00:03:05.480> going<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:06.110> rotate<00:03:06.620> my

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
I'm just simply going to rotate my

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.710 
I'm just simply going to rotate my
quilting<00:03:07.340> space<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.940> work<00:03:08.060> straight<00:03:08.420> down

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
quilting space and work straight down

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.470 
quilting space and work straight down
filling<00:03:09.320> in<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.650> rest<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.310> kind<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.210> palms

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
filling in the rest of the kind of palms

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.410 
filling in the rest of the kind of palms
going<00:03:12.320> in<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.980> downward<00:03:13.160> direction<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:14.030> this

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
going in a downward direction and this

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.080 
going in a downward direction and this
is<00:03:14.600> just<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.990> way<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.230> works<00:03:15.350> best<00:03:15.710> for<00:03:16.010> me<00:03:16.090> if

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
is just the way it works best for me if

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.090 
is just the way it works best for me if
it<00:03:17.240> works<00:03:17.420> best<00:03:17.690> for<00:03:17.960> you<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.500> work<00:03:18.650> from<00:03:18.860> right

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
it works best for you to work from right

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.730 
it works best for you to work from right
to<00:03:19.250> left<00:03:19.280> are<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:20.420> work<00:03:20.600> from<00:03:20.960> the<00:03:21.230> bottom<00:03:21.380> of

your quilting space straight up

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.110 
your quilting space straight up
definitely<00:03:24.380> try<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:24.800> try<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.280> variety<00:03:25.580> of

definitely try that try a variety of
different<00:03:26.360> directions<00:03:27.110> before<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:27.950> pick<00:03:28.130> the

different directions before you pick the

different directions before you pick the
direction<00:03:28.520> that<00:03:28.730> works<00:03:29.330> best<00:03:29.660> for<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:29.960> and

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
direction that works best for you and

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.560 
direction that works best for you and
you<00:03:30.680> know<00:03:30.950> what's<00:03:31.250> going<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.490> work<00:03:31.520> best<00:03:31.700> by

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
you know what's going to work best by

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.110 
you know what's going to work best by
how<00:03:33.110> natural<00:03:33.140> it<00:03:33.800> feels<00:03:33.860> if<00:03:34.370> it<00:03:34.610> feels<00:03:34.850> like
