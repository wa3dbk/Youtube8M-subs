00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello people on youtube I'm here more 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.019
 once this panel to record over 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.960
 that x 40 hours and some of its long 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.049
 today I will use it to show you 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.690
 here use super macro mode makro 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.600
 on the camera where that but I do not see a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.990
 Too bad that my little studio that I 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.990
 made 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.710
 You may have noticed that the camera 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:36.420
 is very close to our 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.370
 battery looks like brasilia then 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.899
 show that the original that I am 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.379
 using the camera works very well 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.910
 we have here a little further ahead 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.670
 then trained distance I think this 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:56.309
 type 35 centimeters 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.770
 I think to do one more show 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.289
 instead we will use the quality mode 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.820
 is one way I like it 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.710
 used to leave the second 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.439
 flat says many people were with 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.310
 difficulty making these photos 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.280
 in the group of those x 40 hours on facebook 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.689
 I'm here to show you that really. 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.560
 I do not have that much trouble doing 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.229
 this type of source 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.560
 but let's leave there priority of 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.930
 opening I to see the selected mode 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.509
 I'll leave it once again in the largest 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.700
 opening 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:35.850
 2.7 and using one more time I will 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.840
 put to use that way mode 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.310
 selection 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.280
 in the case of frame selection 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.070
 I will produce if I position professionals 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.829
 how to position for the battery well in 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.479
 center and click here is basically 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.130
 not only who, right? 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:59.399
 17 is already positioned in one 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.759
 point ahead and then how to take a photo 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.759
 Bush 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.250
 I particularly like to use 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.860
 manual form 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.500
 because you just select the take 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.440
 the lean function it will recognize low 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.000
 that is next but yours using the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.800
 manual focus you will have to complete aa 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.670
 is not really true. 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.830
 where aa distance lens and 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.090
 object to be focused on the case that 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.000
 find it close 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.560
 I use but manual focus because you 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.600
 have greater freedom to put a 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.060
 centimeter 10 centimeters really 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.570
 this is hot it is not very powerful 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.640
 you can focus on zero cents or 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.500
 be the object that you have work 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.230
 it is also to put it in the mind that it is a 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.580
 something that is not very good at making here 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.150
 I show you 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.010
 the average time distance of oz that three 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.620
 centimeters bursting 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.330
 even with what I'm using it here 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.330
 cpl filter that I'm going to do is this is me 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:13.150
 I'll take it to show you here. 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:17.400
 The photo showed better to be felt 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.400
 the disease but we show here quickly 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:34.900
 Ready took hold here I leave 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:41.049
 really closer is still one 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:46.450
 I'm done soon now. 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:50.319
 very short distance from the end of the 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.099
 battery will forward to the approach 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.769
 more 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.709
 here 's how it will be going 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.480
 put it over I think it's cool 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.090
 I'm seeing already aimed go with this 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:12.400
 is projecting shadows to stay so 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:18.820
 visible our movie ready everything ok 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.410
 The photo shows here for you and you. 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.229
 they see nothing but really what is here 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.510
 in the foreground is highly focused 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.650
 is in the background is focused and 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:32.950
 let's go there to select normal mode 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.120
 leave here the opening of the 17th in fashion 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.669
 manual focus 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.760
 come on with the spin button you guys 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.930
 You should know right to increase to 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.580
 left decreases 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:50.700
 I'm going to put here a distance less 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:53.710
 5 cm finding focus found focus 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.979
 I soon came back to almost 13 centimeters 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:01.949
 I think it should take this distance. 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.949
 I'll take the picture here in two seconds. 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:12.639
 ready now this is the photo I 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.639
 just did 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.520
 soon galÃ© 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.490
 This is my way of making macro photo. 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.030
 really was only a small explanation 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.130
 here but you can make skinny photos 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.990
 wonderful, much better than this 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.060
 here was a small demonstration only 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.539
 for you to have an idea, or 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.789
 using the manual focus mode you can 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.889
 you get I think the best result 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.870
 you actually determine to establish the 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.330
 best value of the distance between the object 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.900
 to focus on the case who will be well 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.250
 and near the camera lens 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:58.810
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.810
 video and thanks for the next and peace now
