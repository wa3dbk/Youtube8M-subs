into a trough it's maintaining our off
towards<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.760> west<00:03:01.910> now<00:03:02.420> what<00:03:02.660> we<00:03:02.780> have<00:03:02.810> to

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
towards the west now what we have to

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.869 
towards the west now what we have to
watch<00:03:03.200> happening<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.799> if<00:03:03.950> cold<00:03:04.280> air<00:03:04.430> gets<00:03:04.700> in

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
watch happening is if cold air gets in

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.569 
watch happening is if cold air gets in
there<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:06.590> is<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.799> period<00:03:07.010> from<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.340> 20

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
there and this is the period from the 20

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.400 
there and this is the period from the 20
actor<00:03:07.790> November<00:03:08.180> through<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.540> 3rd<00:03:08.810> December

actor November through to 3rd December

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.250 
actor November through to 3rd December
what<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.190> will<00:03:10.370> do<00:03:10.640> is<00:03:10.910> sharpen<00:03:11.599> this<00:03:11.989> trough

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
what it will do is sharpen this trough

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.009 
what it will do is sharpen this trough
here<00:03:12.319> so<00:03:13.129> to<00:03:13.190> continue<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.910> feed<00:03:14.209> in<00:03:14.420> cold<00:03:14.870> air

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
here so to continue to feed in cold air

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.110 
here so to continue to feed in cold air
all<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.290> time<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:16.040> will<00:03:16.250> sharpen<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.849> trough

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
all the time it will sharpen the trough

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.740 
all the time it will sharpen the trough
downwind<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.579> what<00:03:19.579> we<00:03:19.700> need<00:03:19.730> then<00:03:20.359> to<00:03:20.389> watch

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
downwind and what we need then to watch

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.580

back in sharpens the trough out here you

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.000 
back in sharpens the trough out here you
can't<00:03:41.180> get<00:03:41.480> compensation<00:03:42.200> ridge<00:03:42.590> going<00:03:42.919> in

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
can't get compensation ridge going in

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.470 
can't get compensation ridge going in
here<00:03:43.190> because<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.579> the<00:03:43.609> cold<00:03:43.790> air<00:03:44.030> that's

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
here because of the cold air that's

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.050 
here because of the cold air that's
coming<00:03:44.599> in<00:03:44.989> there<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.400> what<00:03:46.400> that's<00:03:46.669> leading

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
coming in there and what that's leading

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.770 
coming in there and what that's leading
to<00:03:47.299> is<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:48.680> hints<00:03:49.250> of<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.519> ridge<00:03:49.730> out<00:03:49.970> here<00:03:50.540> so

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
to is the hints of the ridge out here so

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.720 
to is the hints of the ridge out here so
that's<00:03:51.319> what<00:03:51.620> we<00:03:51.769> need<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.069> watch<00:03:52.220> for<00:03:52.430> now<00:03:52.549> by

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
that's what we need to watch for now by

that's what we need to watch for now by

to be seeing it but I want to stress so
the<00:03:59.840> forecast<00:04:00.260> things<00:04:00.859> can<00:04:01.099> still<00:04:01.310> change<00:04:01.639> but

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
the forecast things can still change but

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.789 
the forecast things can still change but
what<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:03.590> does<00:04:03.829> is<00:04:04.160> just<00:04:05.079> not<00:04:06.079> strengthens<00:04:06.680> I

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
what it does is just not strengthens I

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.949 
what it does is just not strengthens I
have<00:04:06.950> cold<00:04:07.459> weather<00:04:07.879> ideas<00:04:08.419> but<00:04:08.629> it's<00:04:08.780> just

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
have cold weather ideas but it's just

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.140 
have cold weather ideas but it's just
another<00:04:09.200> signal<00:04:09.829> of<00:04:09.980> cold<00:04:10.370> weather<00:04:10.549> there's

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
another signal of cold weather there's

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.000 
another signal of cold weather there's
so<00:04:11.449> much<00:04:11.510> that<00:04:11.660> has<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:12.079> come<00:04:12.169> into<00:04:12.319> play<00:04:12.530> to

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
so much that has to come into play to

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.250 
so much that has to come into play to
get<00:04:13.129> this<00:04:13.340> going<00:04:13.639> but<00:04:14.060> he<00:04:14.540> just<00:04:14.930> kind<00:04:15.199> of

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
get this going but he just kind of

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.289 
get this going but he just kind of
highlights<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:16.250> threat<00:04:16.579> there<00:04:16.789> this<00:04:17.060> is<00:04:17.269> the

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
highlights that threat there this is the

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.810 
highlights that threat there this is the
latest<00:04:17.570> um<00:04:18.109> strata<00:04:18.859> ferret<00:04:19.130> chant<00:04:19.400> for<00:04:19.579> 10

latest um strata ferret chant for 10
millibars<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:20.810> this<00:04:21.680> is<00:04:21.919> the<00:04:22.190> position<00:04:22.580> as<00:04:22.910> of

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
millibars and this is the position as of

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.469 
millibars and this is the position as of
today<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:24.490> notice<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.640> warming<00:04:25.969> again

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
today and notice the warming again

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.540 
today and notice the warming again
showing<00:04:27.380> in<00:04:27.710> here

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
showing in here

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.150 
showing in here
so<00:04:28.730> that's<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.090> forecast<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.930> 248<00:04:30.560> forecast

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
so that's the forecast the 248 forecast

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.890 
so that's the forecast the 248 forecast
for<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.820> 23rd<00:04:32.690> of<00:04:33.010> November<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:34.900> typically

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
for the 23rd of November and typically

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.950 
for the 23rd of November and typically
we<00:04:36.470> get<00:04:36.680> cold<00:04:37.010> hit<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:37.370> weather<00:04:37.670> if<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.570> arrives

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
we get cold hit of weather if it arrives

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.190 
we get cold hit of weather if it arrives
with<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:40.100> warm<00:04:40.400> event<00:04:40.760> within<00:04:41.540> about<00:04:41.870> two

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
with the warm event within about two

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.350 
with the warm event within about two
weeks<00:04:42.350> to<00:04:42.890> three<00:04:42.920> weeks<00:04:43.550> so<00:04:43.940> that<00:04:43.970> would<00:04:44.210> put

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
weeks to three weeks so that would put

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.470 
weeks to three weeks so that would put
us<00:04:44.420> at<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.930> early<00:04:45.110> part<00:04:45.320> December<00:04:46.210> CFS<00:04:47.210> not

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
us at the early part December CFS not

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.260 
us at the early part December CFS not
quite<00:04:47.870> so<00:04:48.050> cold<00:04:48.350> today<00:04:48.650> shown<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:49.820> falling

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
quite so cold today shown the falling

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.760 
quite so cold today shown the falling
temperatures<00:04:50.540> at<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.870> end<00:04:50.990> of<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.170> month<00:04:51.380> it

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
temperatures at the end of the month it

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.110 
temperatures at the end of the month it
shows<00:04:52.040> that<00:04:52.220> there's<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.460> battle<00:04:52.640> taking<00:04:52.970> place

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
shows that there's a battle taking place

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.730 
shows that there's a battle taking place
because<00:04:53.660> it<00:04:53.780> kind<00:04:53.990> of<00:04:54.020> picks<00:04:54.230> them<00:04:54.410> back<00:04:54.560> up

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
because it kind of picks them back up

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.920 
because it kind of picks them back up
again<00:04:54.860> but<00:04:55.370> generally<00:04:55.790> the<00:04:55.910> overall<00:04:56.300> trend<00:04:56.630> is

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
again but generally the overall trend is

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.080 
again but generally the overall trend is
down<00:04:57.110> into<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.160> early<00:04:58.340> part<00:04:58.580> December<00:04:59.030> and

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
down into the early part December and

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.210 
down into the early part December and
again<00:04:59.420> we<00:04:59.570> get<00:04:59.750> these<00:04:59.930> spikes<00:05:00.590> coming<00:05:00.830> in<00:05:01.070> but

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
again we get these spikes coming in but

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.580 
again we get these spikes coming in but
overall<00:05:01.640> we're<00:05:02.300> in<00:05:02.480> too<00:05:02.720> much<00:05:03.110> cooler

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
overall we're in too much cooler

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.030 
overall we're in too much cooler
temperatures<00:05:04.810> again<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:06.050> stress<00:05:06.440> this<00:05:06.710> is<00:05:06.860> by

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
temperatures again I stress this is by

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.430 
temperatures again I stress this is by
no<00:05:07.100> means<00:05:07.460> a<00:05:07.850> forecast<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.510> wintry<00:05:09.350> weather

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
no means a forecast of wintry weather

no means a forecast of wintry weather
