 I opened it and here, so here we go. 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.120
 is beginning the first part of our 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.490
 We are the first weapon we are 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.010
 making the homemade paper mark 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.679
 first sight making the paper marche 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.580
 then so is O you will blame the sheet 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:35.130
 sulfite bought two first times 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.260
 catch two seconds of you super bonder 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.090
 but got so many people because of the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.760
 Fifth file your finger on it, right? 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.260
 So you're going to do what you do here. 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.910
 have to make it straight 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.910
 then the first you macular 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.409
 Remembering always has to be good and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.269
 careful not to put your hand as 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:07.670
 you are seeing this right cheat sheet 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:10.340
 we do not stick to just hand as to whether the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:18.060
 pioneer in us 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:21.840
 sponsor are not I see you 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.580
 It needs to be very accurate, it just goes by 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.850
 only to cover even the sides of the sheet 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:35.429
 of paper mache here has a five leaves 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.149
 It's thicker with the card too. 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:46.560
 hard 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:49.580
 It's when you've just made the sides 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.039
 What are you going to do? 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:02:00.170
 so you can do what you want 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:08.390
 So I usually do 1 x is worse when 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:12.050
 Do you risk cohabitation enough? 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.050
