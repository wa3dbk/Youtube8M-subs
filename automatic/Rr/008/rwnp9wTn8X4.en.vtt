00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.130

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.579

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:23.290

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.590
 Never 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.790
 So folks coming back here, I could not. 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.220

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.930
 It was painted red and I'm going to get it. 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.080
 backyard of another color just to get in 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:50.440
 in the game and then see jesus even more 10 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:54.610
 the black does not go to the streets veda if it closes and 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:58.180
 click save here that you already have is a 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.800
 remember right which the 0 but I 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:06.250
 some here yes I do not remember which one 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.920
 Is any of this one I painted has 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.350
 death only have one or two textures that 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.540
 here are four or five you paint 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.030
 they know, of course you have to find 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.510
 Anyway, I 'll show you how 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.660
 think lets open that all of them look that 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.920
 there is an easier way to have to abide by the 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:31.300
 I remember I painted the achaque 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:37.989
 one that will paint here that apple 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:42.040
 good that the other what I think it was 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:49.480
 beat another here the stranger here I do not know 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:54.310
 What will she accept, everything ok? 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.459
 It's simple, it's not for you to find 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.110
 It's a little harder the canopy is a 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.989
 bit harder but I came here to open 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.610
 with a notepad here until you find 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.030
 all textures ne 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.590
 here will appear the textures of the mod ali 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.600

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:16.570

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.690
 simple enter here you see yard now 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.070
 so I came and so when I entered the 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.970
 game will be yes I think I will not even go 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.270
 to get into the game by action were very 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.450
 and you do not have to just do it or 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.160
 that moves not only if you want and 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.450

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.479

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.380

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.140
