methods of twirling drumstick

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.370 
methods of twirling drumstick
essentially<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.449> forward<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.869> do<00:00:19.020> two

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
essentially we forward to do two

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.290 
essentially we forward to do two
different<00:00:19.560> categories<00:00:19.890> there's<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
different categories there's the the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.750 
different categories there's the the
sort<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.570> twirl<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.080> actually<00:00:22.949> stick<00:00:23.400> feeds

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
sort of twirl that actually stick feeds

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.700 
sort of twirl that actually stick feeds
through<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.359> fingers<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.930> kind<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.470> kind

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
through the fingers I kind of do it kind

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.859 
through the fingers I kind of do it kind
of<00:00:25.769> gradually<00:00:25.980> like<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.660> stick

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
of gradually like this and and the stick

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:28.820 
of gradually like this and and the stick
feed<00:00:28.080> through<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> fingers<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.680> that's

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
feed through the fingers and that's

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.070 
feed through the fingers and that's
where<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> motions<00:00:29.670> coming<00:00:29.910> from<00:00:30.090> now

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
where that the motions coming from now

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.370 
where that the motions coming from now
some<00:00:31.349> people<00:00:31.410> call<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.399> real<00:00:32.730> twirl<00:00:33.390> and

like<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.250> stick<00:00:41.460> doesn't<00:00:41.670> really

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
like so and the stick doesn't really

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.760 
like so and the stick doesn't really
feed<00:00:42.120> through<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> fingers<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:43.379> rotates

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
feed through the fingers it just rotates

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.700

and some people refer to that as the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.920 
and some people refer to that as the
fake<00:00:49.620> tool<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.420> far<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:51.690> I'm<00:00:51.899> concerned

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
fake tool now as far as I'm concerned

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.790 
fake tool now as far as I'm concerned
that<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:53.340> not<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> fake<00:00:54.000> twirl<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:55.289> a

that is not really a fake twirl it's a

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.340 
that is not really a fake twirl it's a
proper<00:00:56.280> 12<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.969> other<00:00:57.000> sort<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.780> thing<00:00:58.170> where

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
proper 12 the other sort of thing where

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.869 
proper 12 the other sort of thing where
we're<00:00:58.500> feeding<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.980> stick<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.640> that

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
we're feeding the stick like that

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.090 
we're feeding the stick like that
through<00:01:00.210> those<00:01:00.390> fingers<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.620> more<00:01:01.859> properly

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
through those fingers is more properly

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.609 
through those fingers is more properly
referred<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> spin<00:01:03.449> spinning<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.559> are

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
referred to as a spin spinning there are

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.130 
referred to as a spin spinning there are
two<00:01:04.739> very<00:01:04.920> very<00:01:05.040> different<00:01:05.220> actions<00:01:05.760> now<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
two very very different actions now to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.740 
two very very different actions now to
be<00:01:07.229> honest<00:01:07.500> I've<00:01:07.619> never<00:01:07.820> really<00:01:08.820> worked<00:01:09.570> on

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
be honest I've never really worked on

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960 
be honest I've never really worked on
practicing<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.530> spinning<00:01:11.310> idea<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.790> kind

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
practicing this spinning idea I can kind

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.640 
practicing this spinning idea I can kind
of<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.780> that's<00:01:12.900> about<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.200> okay

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
of do but one and that's about it okay

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.679 
of do but one and that's about it okay
the<00:01:14.400> reason<00:01:14.700> I've<00:01:14.790> never<00:01:14.939> really<00:01:15.299> worked<00:01:15.479> on

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the reason I've never really worked on

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.420 
the reason I've never really worked on
it<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:16.770> pretty<00:01:16.979> much<00:01:17.100> useless

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
it is because it's pretty much useless

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.670 
it is because it's pretty much useless
in<00:01:17.850> terms<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.479> incorporating<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.229> into<00:01:19.259> your

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
in terms of incorporating it into your

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.190 
in terms of incorporating it into your
general<00:01:20.100> playing<00:01:20.369> okay<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.420> far<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:21.960> I'm

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
general playing okay as far as I'm

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.580 
general playing okay as far as I'm
concerned<00:01:22.229> any<00:01:23.189> sort<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.939> effect<00:01:24.630> or<00:01:24.930> visual

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
concerned any sort of effect or visual

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.219 
concerned any sort of effect or visual
thing<00:01:25.979> isn't<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:27.030> useful<00:01:27.090> unless<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.080> can

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
thing isn't very useful unless you can

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.600 
thing isn't very useful unless you can
incorporate<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.979> directly<00:01:29.310> into<00:01:29.549> your

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
incorporate it directly into your

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.910 
incorporate it directly into your
playing<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.810> see<00:01:30.990> guys<00:01:31.229> incorporate

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
playing you do you see guys incorporate

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.380 
playing you do you see guys incorporate
into<00:01:32.070> their<00:01:32.220> playing<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.579> little<00:01:32.700> bit<00:01:32.970> but

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
into their playing a little bit but

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.969 
into their playing a little bit but
usually<00:01:33.689> what<00:01:33.810> happens<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.320> because<00:01:34.710> they

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
usually what happens is because they

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.679 
usually what happens is because they
need<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.119> fingers<00:01:36.450> really

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
need to have the the fingers really

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.620 
need to have the the fingers really
feeding<00:01:37.680> their<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.520> stick<00:01:38.759> through<00:01:38.790> they

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
feeding their the stick through they

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.910 
feeding their the stick through they
sort<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.960> play<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.259> one<00:01:40.409> hand<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
sort of play with one hand to have a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.170 
sort of play with one hand to have a
break<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> other<00:01:41.520> hand<00:01:41.790> sort<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.090> off

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.260 
break in the other hand sort of off
doing<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.750> spin<00:01:43.790> but<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.880> course<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.149> not

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
doing the spin but of course it's not

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.940 
doing the spin but of course it's not
really<00:01:45.630> playing<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.140> same<00:01:46.350> time<00:01:46.649> or

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
really playing at the same time or

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.740 
really playing at the same time or
answering<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.820> know<00:01:47.909> there's<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.299> big<00:01:48.390> big

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
answering you know there's a big big

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.109 
answering you know there's a big big
time<00:01:49.049> lag<00:01:49.409> between<00:01:49.790> spinning<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> stick<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
time lag between spinning the stick and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.370 
time lag between spinning the stick and
then<00:01:51.210> getting<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.570> back<00:01:51.689> into<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.990> useful

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
then getting it back into a useful

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.310 
then getting it back into a useful
playing<00:01:52.799> position<00:01:53.009> with<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:53.970> twirl<00:01:54.420> okay<00:01:55.170> or

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
playing position with the twirl okay or

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.660 
playing position with the twirl okay or
what<00:01:55.409> some<00:01:55.590> people<00:01:55.799> call<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> fake<00:01:56.219> curl<00:01:56.490> this

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
what some people call the fake curl this

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.510 
what some people call the fake curl this
is<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> case<00:01:57.320> because<00:01:58.320> all<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.399> really

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
is not the case because all you really

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.039 
is not the case because all you really
need<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.820> do<00:01:59.939> is<00:01:59.969> put<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.450> finger<00:02:00.659> over<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
need to do is put that finger over the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.410 
need to do is put that finger over the
stick<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:02.009> fact<00:02:02.219> even<00:02:02.490> though<00:02:03.210> that's

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
stick and in fact even though that's

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.420 
stick and in fact even though that's
that's<00:02:04.049> not<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> great<00:02:04.590> grip<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.219> stick

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that's not a great grip for the stick

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.100 
that's not a great grip for the stick
it's<00:02:05.670> actually<00:02:06.299> not<00:02:06.420> bad<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:06.899> still<00:02:07.079> use

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
it's actually not bad you can still use

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.469 
it's actually not bad you can still use
your<00:02:07.259> fingers<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.829> same<00:02:08.039> way<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:09.209> I'll<00:02:09.420> use

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
your fingers in the same way so I'll use

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.420 
your fingers in the same way so I'll use
that<00:02:09.720> grip<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.170> both<00:02:10.319> hands

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.740 

you've<00:02:14.430> still<00:02:14.550> got<00:02:14.760> enough<00:02:15.000> control<00:02:15.390> over<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
you've still got enough control over the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.250 
you've still got enough control over the
stick<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.740> actually<00:02:17.040> play<00:02:17.310> pretty<00:02:17.550> well<00:02:17.640> and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
stick to actually play pretty well and

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.990 
stick to actually play pretty well and
and<00:02:19.260> that's<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.710> same<00:02:19.920> grip<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.670> hold

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
and that's the same grip that you hold

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.760 
and that's the same grip that you hold
the<00:02:21.180> stick<00:02:21.390> in<00:02:21.510> it's<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.690> very<00:02:21.840> strong<00:02:22.200> grip<00:02:22.380> to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
the stick in it's a very strong grip to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.700 
the stick in it's a very strong grip to
12<00:02:23.070> stick<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:24.270> can<00:02:24.420> do<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.690> twill<00:02:24.990> backwards

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
12 stick you can do that twill backwards

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.850 
12 stick you can do that twill backwards
and<00:02:26.270> forward<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:27.450> backwards<00:02:28.020> forwards<00:02:28.440> keep

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
and forward so backwards forwards keep

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.700 
and forward so backwards forwards keep
it<00:02:28.980> going<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.550> dropped<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.390> either<00:02:30.720> way<00:02:30.930> okay

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
it going it dropped it either way okay

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.050 
it going it dropped it either way okay
so<00:02:32.270> that's<00:02:33.270> what<00:02:33.630> we<00:02:33.720> call<00:02:34.460> the<00:02:35.460> 12<00:02:35.730> some

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
at the grip there I've just basically

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.090 
at the grip there I've just basically
got<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> stick<00:02:45.360> shoved<00:02:46.290> between<00:02:46.470> those<00:02:46.890> two

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
got the stick shoved between those two

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.730 
got the stick shoved between those two
fingers<00:02:47.490> just<00:02:47.850> like<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.090> normal<00:02:48.270> matched<00:02:48.990> grip

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
fingers just like a normal matched grip

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.350 
fingers just like a normal matched grip
there<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:50.100> I've<00:02:50.190> lifted<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:50.910> index<00:02:51.270> finger

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
there but I've lifted that index finger

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.300 
there but I've lifted that index finger
over<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.050> top<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.350> stick<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.709> i'm<00:02:53.130> now

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310

holding<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.700> stick<00:02:53.910> there<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.480> i<00:02:54.510> can<00:02:54.660> still

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840

use those fingers underneath the same
way<00:02:56.370> we<00:02:56.520> normally<00:02:56.940> would<00:02:57.300> only<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.810> can't<00:02:58.080> use

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230

way we normally would only I can't use
my<00:02:58.260> index<00:02:58.620> finger<00:02:58.770> because<00:02:59.070> that's<00:02:59.250> on<00:02:59.340> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400

here<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:21.390> pull<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.320> butt<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.650> stick<00:03:22.680> back

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
here to pull the butt of the stick back

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.070 
here to pull the butt of the stick back
so<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.880> stick<00:03:24.090> comes<00:03:24.450> tip<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.900> stick

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
so the stick comes tip of the stick

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.570 
so the stick comes tip of the stick
comes<00:03:25.260> up<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.620> then<00:03:26.130> like<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.459> that

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
comes up and then like it to that

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.729 
comes up and then like it to that
position<00:03:26.760> i<00:03:27.090> turn<00:03:27.450> my<00:03:27.630> wrist<00:03:27.870> background<00:03:28.320> so

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
position i turn my wrist background so

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.040 
position i turn my wrist background so
in<00:03:28.860> slow<00:03:29.100> motion<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.760> really<00:03:30.420> kind<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.870> am

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
in slow motion I really kind of am

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.259 
in slow motion I really kind of am
moving<00:03:31.920> my<00:03:31.950> wrist<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.459> fair<00:03:32.670> bit<00:03:32.880> as<00:03:33.090> well

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
moving my wrist a fair bit as well

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.210 
moving my wrist a fair bit as well
because<00:03:34.050> this<00:03:34.200> is<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.440> backwards<00:03:34.830> version<00:03:35.160> of

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
because this is the backwards version of

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.190 
because this is the backwards version of
the<00:03:35.340> 12<00:03:35.580> as<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:36.269> spared<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.630> up<00:03:36.900> the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
the 12 as you spared that up the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.170 
the 12 as you spared that up the
momentum<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.950> stick<00:03:38.250> tip<00:03:38.489> carries<00:03:39.060> it

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
momentum of the stick tip carries it

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.030 
momentum of the stick tip carries it
around<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.750> all<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.470> really<00:03:40.590> need<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.830> do<00:03:41.010> is

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
around and all you really need to do is

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.699 
around and all you really need to do is
get<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.400> tip<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:41.700> finger<00:03:42.590> pulling<00:03:43.590> on

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
get the tip of that finger pulling on

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.460 
get the tip of that finger pulling on
that<00:03:43.739> stick<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:45.239> keep<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:45.570> going<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:45.989> can<00:03:46.140> kind

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
that stick to keep it going you can kind

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.660 
that stick to keep it going you can kind
of<00:03:46.560> see<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.799> tip<00:03:46.950> of<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.070> finger<00:03:47.489> they're

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
of see the tip of that finger they're

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.470 
of see the tip of that finger they're
just<00:03:48.239> moving<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:49.070> that's<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.340> on<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:51.150> stick<00:03:51.360> to

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
just moving it that's it on the stick to

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.060 
just moving it that's it on the stick to
keep<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.750> going<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.170> keep<00:03:52.350> in<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.830> can<00:03:52.980> do

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
keep it going and keep in you can do

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.350 
keep it going and keep in you can do
that<00:03:53.190> forwards<00:03:53.549> as<00:03:53.610> well<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.030> tip<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.239> the

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
that forwards as well but the tip of the

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.750 
that forwards as well but the tip of the
stick<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:55.380> tip<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.680> finger<00:03:55.709> can't<00:03:56.250> really

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
stick the tip of the finger can't really

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.190 
stick the tip of the finger can't really
provide<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.269> string<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:57.720> it's<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.930> little<00:03:58.080> bit

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
provide that string so it's a little bit

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.740 
provide that string so it's a little bit
trickier<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.680> go<00:03:58.830> fast<00:03:59.160> forward<00:04:00.150> some<00:04:00.540> people

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
trickier to go fast forward some people

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.910 
trickier to go fast forward some people
refer<00:04:00.959> forwards<00:04:01.350> I've<00:04:01.620> never<00:04:01.769> understood

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
refer forwards I've never understood

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.590 
refer forwards I've never understood
that<00:04:02.280> hopefully<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.060> should<00:04:03.209> get<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.420> do<00:04:03.480> the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
that hopefully you should get to do the

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.810 
that hopefully you should get to do the
same<00:04:03.780> thing<00:04:04.019> in<00:04:04.170> both<00:04:04.650> hands<00:04:04.950> forwards<00:04:05.700> and

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
same thing in both hands forwards and

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.670 
same thing in both hands forwards and
backwards<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:07.049> great<00:04:07.260> thing<00:04:07.290> about<00:04:07.470> this

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
backwards the great thing about this

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.350 
backwards the great thing about this
trailers<00:04:08.130> you<00:04:08.220> can<00:04:08.340> incorporate<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:09.239> into

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
trailers you can incorporate it into

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.390 
trailers you can incorporate it into
your<00:04:09.480> playing<00:04:09.780> here<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.680> am<00:04:10.860> just<00:04:11.040> playing<00:04:11.250> some

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
your playing here I am just playing some

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.830 
your playing here I am just playing some
single<00:04:11.850> strikes<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.299> see<00:04:12.450> I'm<00:04:12.540> doing<00:04:12.690> a

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
single strikes and see I'm doing a

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.219 
single strikes and see I'm doing a
single<00:04:13.049> backwards<00:04:13.560> twirl<00:04:13.830> in<00:04:14.430> between<00:04:14.850> each

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:15.229 
single backwards twirl in between each

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.680 
single backwards twirl in between each
single<00:04:16.229> stroke<00:04:16.609> very<00:04:17.609> easy<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:17.970> do<00:04:18.150> because<00:04:18.359> as

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
single stroke very easy to do because as

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.029 
single stroke very easy to do because as
the<00:04:18.720> tip<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.289> stick<00:04:19.440> rebounds<00:04:19.919> off<00:04:20.010> the

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
the tip of the stick rebounds off the

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.770 
the tip of the stick rebounds off the
drum<00:04:20.340> is<00:04:20.459> already<00:04:20.729> moving<00:04:20.849> backwards<00:04:21.359> so<00:04:21.720> I

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
drum is already moving backwards so I

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.550 
drum is already moving backwards so I
can<00:04:21.989> in<00:04:22.080> slow<00:04:22.320> motion<00:04:22.560> here<00:04:22.890> as<00:04:23.010> a

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
can in slow motion here as a

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.460 
can in slow motion here as a
up<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:25.120> just<00:04:25.450> does<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:25.720> twirl<00:04:25.990> and<00:04:26.200> you're<00:04:26.350> ready

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
up it just does a twirl and you're ready

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.200 
up it just does a twirl and you're ready
for<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.680> next<00:04:26.830> note<00:04:27.040> you<00:04:27.430> can<00:04:27.460> also<00:04:27.669> 12

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
for the next note you can also 12

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.570 
for the next note you can also 12
forwards<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.290> end<00:04:29.500> of<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.770> trail<00:04:30.010> comes

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
forwards and the end of the trail comes

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.310 
forwards and the end of the trail comes
down<00:04:30.790> onto<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.150> drum<00:04:31.419> so<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:31.660> can<00:04:31.780> pull<00:04:32.139> off

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
down onto the drum so you can pull off

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.970 
down onto the drum so you can pull off
the<00:04:32.919> drum<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.250> forwards<00:04:33.820> under<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.300> drum

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
the drum and forwards under the drum

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.500 
the drum and forwards under the drum
tour<00:04:35.980> backwards<00:04:36.400> off<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.550> drum<00:04:36.820> forwards<00:04:37.300> on

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
tour backwards off the drum forwards on

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.930 
tour backwards off the drum forwards on
and<00:04:37.980> hit<00:04:38.980> that<00:04:39.130> forwards<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.639> backwards

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
and hit that forwards and backwards

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.360 
and hit that forwards and backwards
motion<00:04:40.570> going<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:41.169> think<00:04:41.860> it's<00:04:41.950> easiest<00:04:42.280> just

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
motion going I think it's easiest just

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.730 
motion going I think it's easiest just
to<00:04:42.490> tell<00:04:42.790> once<00:04:43.150> backwards<00:04:43.750> in<00:04:44.200> your<00:04:44.470> when

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
to tell once backwards in your when

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.930 
to tell once backwards in your when
you're<00:04:44.860> incorporating<00:04:45.190> into<00:04:45.550> your<00:04:45.700> playing

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
you're incorporating into your playing

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.379 
you're incorporating into your playing
and<00:04:46.169> basically<00:04:47.169> you<00:04:47.380> can<00:04:47.500> see<00:04:47.680> here<00:04:47.889> i<00:04:47.919> am<00:04:48.389> one

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
and basically you can see here i am one

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.060 
and basically you can see here i am one
backwards<00:04:50.050> twirled<00:04:50.290> in<00:04:50.410> between<00:04:50.680> each<00:04:50.800> tray

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
backwards twirled in between each tray

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.010 
backwards twirled in between each tray
or<00:04:51.400> using<00:04:51.880> double<00:04:52.120> strokes<00:04:54.990> obviously<00:04:55.990> a

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
or using double strokes obviously a

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.990 
or using double strokes obviously a
limited<00:04:56.410> about<00:04:56.620> how<00:04:56.770> far<00:04:56.979> you<00:04:57.310> go<00:04:57.460> because<00:04:57.910> you

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
limited about how far you go because you

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
for example so because you've got plenty

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.860 
for example so because you've got plenty
of<00:05:09.490> time<00:05:09.669> of<00:05:09.850> the<00:05:09.910> power<00:05:10.120> you've<00:05:10.450> got<00:05:10.479> a<00:05:10.570> double

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
of time of the power you've got a double

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.360 
of time of the power you've got a double
stroke<00:05:11.110> there<00:05:11.470> you<00:05:11.710> might<00:05:11.889> even<00:05:11.919> get<00:05:12.130> to<00:05:12.280> get

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
stroke there you might even get to get

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.100 
stroke there you might even get to get
two<00:05:12.669> twelves<00:05:13.180> in<00:05:13.300> if<00:05:13.690> you're<00:05:13.840> getting<00:05:13.990> a<00:05:14.020> bit

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
two twelves in if you're getting a bit

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.400 
two twelves in if you're getting a bit
faster<00:05:14.560> just<00:05:15.550> 112<00:05:16.270> like<00:05:17.139> so<00:05:18.540> and<00:05:19.540> the<00:05:20.200> tall

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
faster just 112 like so and the tall

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.990 
faster just 112 like so and the tall
sort<00:05:20.710> of<00:05:20.770> works<00:05:20.979> well<00:05:21.160> into<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.430> xn<00:05:21.729> as<00:05:21.850> well

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
sort of works well into the xn as well
