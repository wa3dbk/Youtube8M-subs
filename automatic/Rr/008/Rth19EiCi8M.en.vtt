landing gear I'm gonna stay mostly up
over<00:00:15.839> there<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.289> just<00:00:16.470> try<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.710> get<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.250> you

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
over there so just try to get it in you

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.220 
over there so just try to get it in you
don't<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.390> get<00:00:18.510> too<00:00:18.660> close<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.109> get

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
don't have to get too close to it get

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.870 
don't have to get too close to it get
close<00:00:19.380> enough<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.680> could<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.130> good<00:00:22.880> this

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
close enough you could see it good this

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.019 
close enough you could see it good this
is<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> full<00:00:24.720> throttle<00:00:25.400> gets<00:00:26.400> up<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.699> lot<00:00:26.849> better

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
is a full throttle gets up a lot better

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.519 
is a full throttle gets up a lot better
than<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> sukhoi<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:28.019> stock<00:00:28.349> setup<00:00:30.529> rolls

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
than the sukhoi with stock setup rolls

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.780 
than the sukhoi with stock setup rolls
pretty<00:00:31.830> quick<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:34.320> unlike<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> sukhoi<00:00:35.670> you

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
pretty quick and unlike the sukhoi you

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.030 
pretty quick and unlike the sukhoi you
can<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.180> backwards<00:00:36.899> loops<00:00:37.170> pretty<00:00:37.860> much

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
can do backwards loops pretty much

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.920 
can do backwards loops pretty much
non-stop

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.720 

rather<00:00:43.530> turns<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.250> work<00:00:44.400> pretty<00:00:44.640> good

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
rather turns with this work pretty good

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.600 
rather turns with this work pretty good
it<00:00:44.940> loses<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> little<00:00:45.450> altitude<00:00:45.990> as<00:00:46.980> left<00:00:47.400> this

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
it loses a little altitude as left this

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:59.040 
it loses a little altitude as left this
is<00:00:47.790> right

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:32.170 

we'll<00:00:59.590> fly<00:00:59.740> upside-down<00:01:00.100> pretty<00:01:00.640> good

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:40.340 

go<00:01:33.140> up<00:01:33.200> high<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.440> spin<00:01:33.830> down

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:54.359 

oh<00:01:40.380> yeah

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.740 

yeah<00:01:54.960> let's<00:01:55.960> bend<00:01:56.380> down

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.170 

all<00:02:02.230> right<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:02.620> I'm<00:02:03.340> gonna<00:02:03.490> land<00:02:03.700> pretty<00:02:03.880> soon

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
all right so I'm gonna land pretty soon

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.450 
all right so I'm gonna land pretty soon
but<00:02:04.450> as<00:02:04.690> you<00:02:04.990> can<00:02:05.110> see<00:02:05.320> this<00:02:05.470> plane<00:02:05.800> definitely

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
but as you can see this plane definitely

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.100 
but as you can see this plane definitely
it's<00:02:06.640> better<00:02:06.970> than<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.270> Sukhoi<00:02:07.630> stack<00:02:07.960> it

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
it's better than the Sukhoi stack it

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.690 
it's better than the Sukhoi stack it
gets<00:02:08.290> up<00:02:08.410> in<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.560> air<00:02:08.619> no<00:02:08.950> problem

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
gets up in the air no problem

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.330 
gets up in the air no problem
those<00:02:10.180> backward<00:02:10.630> loose<00:02:10.840> try<00:02:11.770> forward<00:02:12.190> loop

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
those backward loose try forward loop

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.480 
those backward loose try forward loop
the<00:02:12.490> Sukhoi<00:02:12.850> did<00:02:13.000> those<00:02:13.150> pretty<00:02:13.360> good<00:02:14.490> forward

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
the Sukhoi did those pretty good forward

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.980 
the Sukhoi did those pretty good forward
loops<00:02:15.670> not<00:02:15.940> very<00:02:16.120> good<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.540> kind<00:02:16.750> of<00:02:16.810> gets

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
loops not very good it kind of gets

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.340 
loops not very good it kind of gets
stuck<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.490> is<00:02:18.610> little<00:02:19.120> nose<00:02:20.020> time<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
stuck so it is little nose time the

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.530 
stuck so it is little nose time the
upside<00:02:20.650> down<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.250> backwards<00:02:21.730> loops<00:02:21.940> that's

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
upside down the backwards loops that's

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.180 
upside down the backwards loops that's
fine<00:02:22.840> which<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.050> kind<00:02:23.350> of<00:02:23.380> weird<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.800> have<00:02:24.070> that

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
fine which is kind of weird I have that

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.490 
fine which is kind of weird I have that
same<00:02:24.400> problem<00:02:24.820> on<00:02:24.880> my<00:02:25.030> p40<00:02:25.750> backwards<00:02:26.320> loops

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
same problem on my p40 backwards loops

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.960 
same problem on my p40 backwards loops
are<00:02:26.650> fine<00:02:26.860> but<00:02:27.070> forward<00:02:27.490> loops<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.850> has

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
are fine but forward loops it has

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.210 
are fine but forward loops it has
problems<00:02:28.390> with<00:02:31.680> I'm<00:02:32.680> going<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.890> bring<00:02:33.040> into

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
problems with I'm going to bring into

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.890 
problems with I'm going to bring into
land<00:02:33.430> I'll<00:02:33.640> show<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:33.850> it's<00:02:34.090> real<00:02:34.330> simple<00:02:34.690> with

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
land I'll show you it's real simple with

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.860 
land I'll show you it's real simple with
his<00:02:35.050> glides<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.970> landing<00:02:37.420> when<00:02:37.540> we<00:02:37.630> get<00:02:37.780> it

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
his glides the landing when we get it

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.600 
his glides the landing when we get it
out<00:02:37.990> membrane

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.360 

every<00:02:44.270> console<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.370> kind<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.490> like<00:02:46.790> 50%<00:02:47.240> auto

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
every console and kind of like 50% auto

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.740 
every console and kind of like 50% auto
down<00:02:49.370> there<00:02:49.520> like<00:02:49.610> a<00:02:49.670> quarter<00:02:50.240> throttle<00:02:50.480> now

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
down there like a quarter throttle now

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.150 
down there like a quarter throttle now
it's<00:02:50.900> off<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.380> it's<00:02:52.010> just<00:02:52.220> gonna<00:02:52.340> glide<00:02:52.670> a

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
it's off and it's just gonna glide a

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.710 
it's off and it's just gonna glide a
little<00:02:55.160> too<00:02:55.520> hard<00:02:55.880> but<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.180> doesn't<00:02:56.450> hurt<00:02:56.540> it

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
little too hard but it doesn't hurt it

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.850 
little too hard but it doesn't hurt it
if<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:56.930> crash<00:02:57.140> like<00:02:57.410> that<00:02:57.670> that's<00:02:58.670> it
