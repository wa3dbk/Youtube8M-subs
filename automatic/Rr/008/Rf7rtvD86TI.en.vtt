00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
actually thought I had a lot more but I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.250 
actually thought I had a lot more but I
don't<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.770> made<00:00:55.980> move<00:00:56.250> them<00:00:56.570> really<00:00:57.570> close<00:00:57.809> over

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
don't I made move them really close over

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.310 
don't I made move them really close over
here<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.829> maybe<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.100> could<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.850> better<00:01:03.320> okay

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
here so maybe I could see better okay

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.230 
here so maybe I could see better okay
here<00:01:04.619> too<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.010> these<00:01:05.159> are<00:01:05.220> available<00:01:05.580> I

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
here too so these are available I

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.330 
here too so these are available I
thought<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.780> haven't<00:01:07.049> more<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.530> i<00:01:07.770> guess<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.250> it

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
thought I haven't more but i guess as it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.130 
thought I haven't more but i guess as it
turns<00:01:08.580> out<00:01:08.729> i<00:01:08.790> don't<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> lot<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.810> yellow

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
turns out i don't have a lot of yellow

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.859 
turns out i don't have a lot of yellow
books<00:01:10.439> ok<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.799> now<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> next<00:01:12.090> question<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.720> to

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
books ok so now the next question is to

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.800 
books ok so now the next question is to
separate<00:01:13.350> um<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.670> books<00:01:14.909> are<00:01:15.090> selected<00:01:15.659> by

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
separate um the books are selected by

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:30.850 
separate um the books are selected by
read<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.890> unread<00:01:17.040> which<00:01:17.520> I'm<00:01:18.210> not

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.000 

this<00:01:31.310> is<00:01:31.490> turning<00:01:31.700> out<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:31.940> be<00:01:32.060> a<00:01:32.210> very<00:01:32.240> odd

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.470 

so

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
so

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.010 
so
I<00:01:37.630> have<00:01:38.110> separated<00:01:38.590> them<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:40.020> surprisingly

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
I have separated them and surprisingly

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.440 
I have separated them and surprisingly
enough<00:01:41.140> this<00:01:41.980> category<00:01:42.580> is<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.850> red<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.300> this

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
enough this category is the red and this

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.080 
enough this category is the red and this
is<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.750> unread<00:01:44.110> give<00:01:44.740> myself<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:45.370> nice<00:01:45.550> pat<00:01:45.880> on

serious<00:04:20.829> book<00:04:20.979> covers<00:04:21.280> I<00:04:21.400> get<00:04:21.579> that<00:04:21.729> it's

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
serious book covers I get that it's

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.430 
serious book covers I get that it's
units<00:04:22.270> about<00:04:22.419> pants<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:22.900> stuff<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.169> think<00:04:23.380> they

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
units about pants and stuff I think they

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.900 
units about pants and stuff I think they
could<00:04:23.590> have<00:04:23.620> went<00:04:23.830> with<00:04:23.949> it<00:04:24.009> and<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.729> much

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
could have went with it and a much

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.150 
could have went with it and a much
cooler<00:04:25.180> way<00:04:25.570> so<00:04:25.630> I<00:04:25.900> really<00:04:26.169> don't<00:04:26.289> like<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:26.770> and

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
cooler way so I really don't like it and

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.529 
cooler way so I really don't like it and
I<00:04:27.250> totally<00:04:27.430> redesigned<00:04:27.880> them<00:04:28.240> it's<00:04:28.479> about

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
I totally redesigned them it's about

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.029 
I totally redesigned them it's about
like<00:04:28.870> girls<00:04:29.139> having<00:04:29.410> fun<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.740> stuff<00:04:29.860> but<00:04:29.979> I

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
like girls having fun and stuff but I

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:30.870 
like girls having fun and stuff but I
really<00:04:30.250> think<00:04:30.280> they<00:04:30.520> could<00:04:30.639> have<00:04:30.699> done

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
really think they could have done

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.400 
really think they could have done
something<00:04:31.090> unique<00:04:31.660> even<00:04:31.960> more<00:04:32.139> than<00:04:32.289> that

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
something unique even more than that

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.719 
something unique even more than that
with<00:04:32.620> something<00:04:32.919> that<00:04:33.039> the<00:04:33.220> pants<00:04:33.610> or

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
with something that the pants or

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.310 
with something that the pants or
something<00:04:33.820> like<00:04:34.060> that<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.449> I<00:04:34.840> really<00:04:35.199> don't

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
something like that so I really don't

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.770 
something like that so I really don't
