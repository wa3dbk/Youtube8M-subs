that we can provide to a patient that is

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.230 
that we can provide to a patient that is
most<00:03:55.230> effective<00:03:55.830> for<00:03:55.890> them<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.520> is<00:03:56.970> most

effective for larger populations we

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.210 
effective for larger populations we

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
think of quality for an outcomes

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.880 
think of quality for an outcomes
perspective<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.180> outcomes<00:04:03.810> means<00:04:04.110> not<00:04:04.470> just

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
perspective and outcomes means not just

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.100 
perspective and outcomes means not just
you<00:04:05.580> know<00:04:05.700> thought<00:04:06.120> process<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.750> what<00:04:06.900> your

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
you know thought process of what your

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.710 
you know thought process of what your
outcomes<00:04:07.440> are<00:04:07.590> but<00:04:07.800> measured<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.490> so<00:04:09.150> within

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
outcomes are but measured and so within

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.600 
outcomes are but measured and so within
consent<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.320> we<00:04:10.440> actually<00:04:10.740> measure<00:04:11.010> outcomes

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
consent so we actually measure outcomes

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.300 
consent so we actually measure outcomes
and<00:04:11.790> have<00:04:11.970> measured<00:04:12.390> them<00:04:12.600> for<00:04:13.100> probably<00:04:14.100> now

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
and have measured them for probably now

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.690 
and have measured them for probably now
15<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.970> 16<00:04:15.390> years<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:16.020> so<00:04:16.650> our<00:04:17.010> outcomes

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
15 to 16 years and so our outcomes

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.909 
15 to 16 years and so our outcomes
approach<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.840> way<00:04:18.930> we<00:04:19.080> approach<00:04:19.200> medical

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
approach and the way we approach medical

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.860 
approach and the way we approach medical
practice<00:04:20.430> not<00:04:21.000> only<00:04:21.030> affects<00:04:21.660> those

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870
