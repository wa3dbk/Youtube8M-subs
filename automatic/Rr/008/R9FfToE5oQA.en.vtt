00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
brighter on one side and a little bit

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.760 
brighter on one side and a little bit
darker<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> other<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.619> look

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770

right now if Emily turns your head a
little<00:01:45.720> bit<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> right<00:01:46.610> until<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.729> just

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
little bit to the right until it's just

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.420 
little bit to the right until it's just
a<00:01:47.939> little<00:01:48.060> bit<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.860> broad

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
a little bit you can see that the broad

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.850 
a little bit you can see that the broad
face<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.479> bigger<00:01:51.780> portion<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.409> her<00:01:52.560> face<00:01:52.829> is

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
face the bigger portion of her face is

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.609 
face the bigger portion of her face is
lit<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.520> makes<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.939> thin<00:01:54.210> person<00:01:54.479> look<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
lit that makes a thin person look a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.709 
lit that makes a thin person look a
little<00:01:55.979> bit<00:01:56.310> more<00:01:56.640> full<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.000> give<00:01:57.299> them<00:01:57.450> some

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
little bit more full and give them some

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.510 
little bit more full and give them some
life<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.960> their<00:01:58.290> face<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.340> was<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
life to their face if this was a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.580 
life to their face if this was a
heavyset<00:02:00.030> person<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.689> lit<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.079> broad

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
heavyset person and you lit that broad

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.840 
heavyset person and you lit that broad
side<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.070> face<00:02:02.219> you'd<00:02:02.430> make<00:02:02.670> them

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
side of the face you'd make them

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.480 
side of the face you'd make them
actually<00:02:03.210> look<00:02:03.360> larger<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.740> idea<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.310> you

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
actually look larger so the idea is you

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.730 
actually look larger so the idea is you
want<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.820> nice<00:02:06.420> solid<00:02:06.990> light<00:02:07.200> here<00:02:07.590> you

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
want to have nice solid light here you

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.559 
want to have nice solid light here you
want<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.429> light<00:02:08.640> up<00:02:08.849> above<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.420> eyes

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
want to have the light up above the eyes

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.119 
want to have the light up above the eyes
so<00:02:09.959> there's<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.289> little<00:02:10.470> catch<00:02:10.649> light<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
so there's a little catch light in the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.040 
so there's a little catch light in the
eyes<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
eyes and

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.910 
eyes and
it<00:02:12.230> wraps<00:02:12.590> around<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.370> nice<00:02:13.610> shadow
