00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.760
 hello to all guys welcome to this one 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.240
 bet another episode versus 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.940
 however, concerning the 4,000 sj cameras 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.640
 it was without having 5,000 in this 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.739
 case we have everything set 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.509
 assortments fps and thirst 20p so that 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:28.390
 you may also have an idea concerning 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:32.590
 the video quality at 720 I hope anyway 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.649
 that this quality is not generic because 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.079
 see the same thing anyway as I have 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.410
 already said the previous episode la 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.949
 vdb 5,000 camera has virtually a 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:49.059
 wide-angle readily 120 degrees of 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:53.050
 sometimes I'm wrong and instead sg 4.000 to a 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.609
 180 degree wide angle 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.600
 I think the two cameras anyway 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:01.899
 they are good also concerning the factor 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:07.510
 price as you know the sg 4.000 this 88 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.250
 euro is instead the 5,000 vdb costs only 79 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.080
 EUR 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.450
 the only positive thing about a taboo 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.400
 dv5 milan who can command everything 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.950
 with wifi though it can be controlled 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.770
 remotely connecting the camera 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.080
 obviously the tablet or what though 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.920
 I must say that it is a great product 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.050
 in fact I have remained enough 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.680
 satisfied concerning the price though 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.510
 I was not very satisfied concerning 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.920
 upon arrival of the public camera that 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:42.160
 It aims fact there were problems 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.850
 concerning the arrival there had been some 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.180
 doran problem and I must say 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.690
 which was really beautiful at this 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.440
 point let's take a look at on 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.690
 courtyard 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.420
 I hope you read everything anyway 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.210
 perfectly also because the only thing 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.310
 bad thing about vice buti understand 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.450
 that you can't see the preview on the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.910
 screen 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.250
 however as you have seen there is an icon of a 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.580
 speaker that count to change choirs 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.870
 and when it is operated it is an o 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.200
 the other one 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.950
 images of the excuse the audio of the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.290
 crusade had this point I was you do 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.709
 so that he takes on the help he recognizes 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.360
 so much of camera I buy you 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.040
 thank you for viewing this 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.750
 video etc and the inside to the next 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.440
