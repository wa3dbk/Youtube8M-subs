be honest basically he's just saying no
we<00:01:33.570> don't<00:01:33.720> give<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> fuck<00:01:34.170> that's<00:01:34.799> what<00:01:34.950> he's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
we don't give a fuck that's what he's

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.530 
we don't give a fuck that's what he's
saying<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:36.000> because<00:01:36.150> he's<00:01:36.329> saying

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
saying but just because he's saying

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.969 
saying but just because he's saying
decision<00:01:36.990> no<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.470> they've<00:01:37.680> already<00:01:37.829> decided

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
decision no so they've already decided

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.880 
decision no so they've already decided
that<00:01:38.909> no<00:01:39.150> they're<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:40.020> gonna<00:01:40.200> take<00:01:40.500> weapon

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
that no they're not gonna take weapon

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.950 
that no they're not gonna take weapon
variants<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.030> advanced<00:01:42.329> warfare<00:01:42.720> because

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
variants out of advanced warfare because

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.569 
variants out of advanced warfare because
they're<00:01:43.140> saying<00:01:43.439> that's<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.070> heart<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
they're saying that's the heart of the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.670 
they're saying that's the heart of the
game<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.090> understand<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.350> makes<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.590> lot

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
game I understand that that makes a lot

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.200 
game I understand that that makes a lot
of<00:01:46.740> sense<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:47.040> pubs<00:01:47.369> obviously<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.090> know<00:01:48.180> I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
of sense for pubs obviously you know I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.550 
of sense for pubs obviously you know I
think<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.540> makes<00:01:48.630> pubs<00:01:48.899> were<00:01:49.049> enjoyable<00:01:49.409> it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
think it makes pubs were enjoyable it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.200 
think it makes pubs were enjoyable it
obviously<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.070> reduces<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> skill<00:01:50.790> gap<00:01:50.970> but

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
obviously it reduces the skill gap but

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.999 
obviously it reduces the skill gap but
you<00:01:51.689> know<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.930> fucking<00:01:52.200> pubs<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.649> know<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
you know it's fucking pubs you know it

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.440 
you know it's fucking pubs you know it
who<00:01:53.280> cares<00:01:53.430> about<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.759> skill<00:01:53.970> gap<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.270> pubs

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
who cares about the skill gap in pubs

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.609 
who cares about the skill gap in pubs
it's<00:01:54.600> not<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.869> serious<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.380> know<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.500> mean

you<00:02:07.500> know<00:02:07.619> rules<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.459> stuff<00:02:08.580> like<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.720> I

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
you know rules and stuff like that so I

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.969 
you know rules and stuff like that so I
don't<00:02:09.929> understand<00:02:10.289> why<00:02:10.349> they'd<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.709> like

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
don't understand why they'd have like

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.740 
don't understand why they'd have like
ninety<00:02:11.580> percent<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.120> roles<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.599> then

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
ninety percent of the roles and then

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.220 
ninety percent of the roles and then
just

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
just

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.619 
just
ignore<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.980> last<00:02:14.069> ten<00:02:14.400> percent<00:02:14.879> I<00:02:15.090> don't

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
ignore the last ten percent I don't

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:16.729 
ignore the last ten percent I don't
really<00:02:15.720> understand<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.349> doesn't<00:02:16.560> make<00:02:16.620> any

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
really understand that doesn't make any

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.220 
really understand that doesn't make any
sense<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.069> me<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.489> he<00:02:18.480> didn't<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:18.900> clarify

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
sense to me and he didn't really clarify

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.860 
sense to me and he didn't really clarify
why<00:02:19.860> they<00:02:20.640> refuse<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.269> mean<00:02:21.420> all<00:02:21.510> he's<00:02:21.659> saying

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
why they refuse I mean all he's saying

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.050 
why they refuse I mean all he's saying
is<00:02:22.110> weapon<00:02:22.860> variants<00:02:23.250> are<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.610> heart<00:02:23.879> of

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
is weapon variants are the heart of

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.000 
is weapon variants are the heart of
advanced<00:02:24.390> warfare<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.470> doesn't<00:02:25.739> that's<00:02:25.890> not

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
advanced warfare that doesn't that's not

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.160 
advanced warfare that doesn't that's not
really<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> reason<00:02:26.790> at<00:02:27.629> least<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.900> might<00:02:27.989> be

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
really a reason at least it might be

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.479 
really a reason at least it might be
that's<00:02:28.290> that's<00:02:28.620> not<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.799> good<00:02:28.950> reason<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.400> why

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
that's that's not a good reason to why

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.339 
that's that's not a good reason to why
they<00:02:29.640> won't<00:02:29.790> take<00:02:29.970> them<00:02:30.120> out<00:02:30.269> that's<00:02:30.629> pretty

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
they won't take them out that's pretty

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
competitive and I mean that pretty much

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.680 
competitive and I mean that pretty much
sums<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.560> up<00:02:49.650> correctly<00:02:50.010> right<00:02:50.700> weapon<00:02:51.450> elite

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
variants and she like that like they

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.349 
variants and she like that like they
really<00:02:53.370> don't<00:02:53.609> have<00:02:53.700> any<00:02:53.879> business<00:02:54.000> and

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
really don't have any business and

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.030 
really don't have any business and
competitive<00:02:54.569> because<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.769> point<00:02:55.980> of

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
competitive because the the point of

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.190 
competitive because the the point of
competitive<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.609> skill<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.299> prove<00:02:57.540> skill<00:02:57.690> and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
competitive is skill to prove skill and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.199 
competitive is skill to prove skill and
it<00:02:58.410> should<00:02:58.590> have<00:02:58.739> as<00:02:58.920> high<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.549> skill<00:02:59.849> gap<00:03:00.030> as

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
good players that's the whole point of

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.729

bad player a better weapon than a good
player<00:03:07.349> that<00:03:07.799> reduces<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.340> skill<00:03:08.609> gap

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
that the only reason they killed you is

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.479 
that the only reason they killed you is
because<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.200> know<00:03:40.290> they<00:03:40.410> have<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.560> elite<00:03:41.040> you
