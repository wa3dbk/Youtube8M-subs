00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
parties and it's been really wonderful

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.270 
parties and it's been really wonderful
to<00:02:35.950> see<00:02:36.460> that<00:02:36.670> people<00:02:36.820> react<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.900> their<00:02:38.050> music

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280

just<00:03:49.590> experimenting<00:03:50.460> and<00:03:50.610> I<00:03:50.760> think<00:03:51.030> it's

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
just experimenting and I think it's

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.290 
just experimenting and I think it's
important<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.960> be<00:03:51.990> open-minded<00:03:52.530> but<00:03:53.490> I<00:03:53.550> think

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
important to be open-minded but I think

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.180 
important to be open-minded but I think
most<00:03:54.480> importantly<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:55.050> to<00:03:55.260> make<00:03:55.470> good<00:03:56.010> music

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
most importantly is to make good music

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.700 
most importantly is to make good music
good<00:03:56.520> music<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.180> feel<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:58.380> gives<00:03:58.620> you
