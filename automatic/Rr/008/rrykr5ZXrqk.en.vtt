other pieces of British furniture but I

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.910 
other pieces of British furniture but I
think<00:02:01.809> I<00:02:01.929> was<00:02:02.109> too<00:02:02.349> avant-garde<00:02:02.709> for<00:02:03.279> him

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
think I was too avant-garde for him

so now I have evolved over the years

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.949 
so now I have evolved over the years
into<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.250> quirky<00:02:07.760> but<00:02:08.000> somewhat<00:02:08.479> risky

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
into this quirky but somewhat risky

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.320 
into this quirky but somewhat risky
chair<00:02:09.289> I<00:02:09.679> don't<00:02:09.950> even<00:02:10.250> know<00:02:10.520> if<00:02:10.550> I'll<00:02:10.850> land<00:02:11.120> up

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
in the wood-burning stove as I seem to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.550 
in the wood-burning stove as I seem to
have<00:02:13.700> made<00:02:13.880> life<00:02:14.180> very<00:02:14.209> difficult<00:02:15.170> for<00:02:15.380> myself

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
have made life very difficult for myself

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
angles and the number of times I've

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.900 
angles and the number of times I've
stood<00:02:21.290> back<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.620> looked<00:02:22.070> at<00:02:22.220> myself<00:02:22.640> from<00:02:22.850> a

different angle and asked am I pretty
enough<00:02:25.250> oh<00:02:27.040> how<00:02:28.040> much<00:02:28.220> easier<00:02:28.700> life<00:02:28.910> would<00:02:28.970> be
