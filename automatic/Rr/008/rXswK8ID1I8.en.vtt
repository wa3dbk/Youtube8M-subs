because it is extremely hard to grow in

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.790 
because it is extremely hard to grow in
long<00:00:14.940> lengths<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.900> when<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.170> does<00:00:16.350> grow<00:00:16.619> in

it with the block Sanders to get the
curve<00:02:16.450> most<00:02:17.450> likely<00:02:17.810> I'll<00:02:17.900> use<00:02:18.080> this<00:02:18.290> side<00:02:18.620> as

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
curve most likely I'll use this side as

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.080 
curve most likely I'll use this side as
the<00:02:20.290> face<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.680> this<00:02:22.010> side<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.370> glue<00:02:22.580> on<00:02:22.760> just

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
the face and this side to glue on just

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.210 
the face and this side to glue on just
because<00:02:23.239> it's<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.290> little<00:02:24.380> bit<00:02:24.500> darker<00:02:24.920> on<00:02:24.950> this

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
because it's a little bit darker on this

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.979 
because it's a little bit darker on this
side<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.580> there's<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.790> couple<00:02:25.970> knots<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.780> tear
