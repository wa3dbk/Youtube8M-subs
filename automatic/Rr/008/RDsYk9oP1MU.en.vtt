00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.930
 e 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.230
 new number 10 of games 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.150
 in this seventh episode we're going 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.350
 discover or at least rediscover three 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.660
 games passed into oblivion of the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.670
 portable playstation because it has 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.020
 unrecognized or unjustly received pearls 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.120
 the portable playstation 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.770
 ok ok from now on I say psp 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.870
 like everyone else and we start with 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.460
 a game that will be quickly treated nadene woman 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.110
 evening you dreamed of being able to find this 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.879
 kind of wargames with graphics - 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.949
 kawaii choupinou turn to the wires 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.780
 Commander is made for you it's a 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.150
 copy you will not regret it 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.480
 not go next what's that way it's not 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.850
 sufficient 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.989
 ok but honestly there is no 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.400
 much else to say son 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.440
 commands 1 takes over to the letter what 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.269
 does the success of apple night but adds 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.070
 some subtleties an air unit 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.260
 can overlap a land unit or 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.640
 marines on the same square for example if 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.290
 the interest of this action seems to you 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.940
 limited know that in some 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.920
 situations this can give scenes 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.360
 Funny an airplane over a time 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.010
 than position on a bridge under which 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.210
 parks a boat himself posted at 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.400
 under a submarine 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.960
 yes in his commander's son it is possible 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.280
 some actions like mines 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.420
 brings strategic opportunities 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.130
 additional 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.079
 but for the rest we really find 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.119
 the recipe that works but if that 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.710
 works why change we find 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.880
 so all the notions of ammunition 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.530
 power relationships between 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.000
 different units the fog of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.859
 war the weather or the powers 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 of different commanders brief if you 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.490
 have already touched on the series of 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.170
 intelligence systems on gba or ds you 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.789
 you will find quickly in known terrain 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 phil commanders also turns out very 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.520
 pleasant in his grip 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.229
 and the ergonomics of the display of 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.700
 the air of combat we regret, however 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.289
 the lack of interest of the party mode 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.820
 fast as the campaign is infinitely 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.130
 more pleasant if you play alone 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.840
 on the multiplayer side you 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.429
 will be served besides a mode allowing 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.719
 to confront a friend directly 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.700
 passing the console from hands to hands to 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.350
 every turn inherited the gba versions 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.479
 advance wars you can also opt 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.100
 for games in wifi but and that's where 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.630
 that phil commander has this little 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.520
 something that has never had advance 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.509
 wars you will also be able to face 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.729
 players online 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.560
 this small addition allows to have a duration 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.759
 of life almost unlimited finally 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.780
 virtually because at the time 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.660
 current you risk waiting 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.340
 long time long son commander 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.690
 remains an excellent war game 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.140
 inspired by a series that made its 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.220
 evidence 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.300
 just go dark yes mega man is 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.790
 far from what we could call 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.079
 forgotten 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.090
 every episode enjoys a great 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.989
 notoriety and the series is expected to 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.760
 every new opus 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.989
 yet there are some that they do not 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.689
 have not remained in the memories of 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.099
 players sting reminder 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.930
 megaman power adapter and the remake of the 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.310
 first installment of the saga and capcom 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.870
 Here we deliver a transformation 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.370
 full of the game yet that fight 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.280
 the general slogan during the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.750
 creation of this remake should be calm 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.760
 and therefore to the exact opposite of the son 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.829
 proposed commander just before exit so 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.329
 the seriousness and the cold of the robots we 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.909
 here are embedded in a colorful universe 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.650
 with characters in chemistry or in sd 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.000
 if you prefer but in addition to you 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.260
 to find all levels 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.599
 from the game originally with this update 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.400
 megaman powered graphic offers you 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.569
 a lot of novelties starting with 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.169
 new versions of all 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.760
 old levels 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.169
 so far these new world versions 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.150
 for some of inspiration in that 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.310
 regards the level design but the game has 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.659
 still much to offer to the 6 enemies 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.669
 and stages corresponding to the original game 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.919
 add new low end time 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.419
 man and holman you can 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.260
 play with any boss if you 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.209
 get to defeat him 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.220
 using the basic buster and cherry on 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.870
 the cake the game integrates a publisher of 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.609
 levels you can envy to create 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.900
 dreadful internships that made it into crisis 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.889
 and more than one thanks to the exchange mode 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.780
 online creations 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.129
 short mega manpower heads-up this is the 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.840
 mega man as we all have 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.099
 known on nes but with so much 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.940
 novelties that can not be done 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.680
 the impasse on 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.540
 and yet despite excellent revioo 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.040
 in magazines and on the net the game 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.959
 will not meet the success he 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.579
 deserves maybe because he came out 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.680
 just a month and a half after megaman 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.870
 mavs rick hunter x remake of the first 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.639
 mega man x also on psp 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.379
 knowing that the latter had had 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.849
 mixed returns the players have 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.949
 maybe not even give it a chance 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.109
 Power adopt us but never 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:56.209
 injustice is repaired if you like 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.879
 mega man o'war heads-up will convince you 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.319
 most definitely for a past game 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.970
 unnoticed we still hold here a 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.979
 sacred rare champion are those who 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.359
 know that this game exists despite 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.919
 the relative sum interest of 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.870
 players for young people ichi software 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:11.479
 we have here one of the contenders to 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.370
 title of king of the forgotten of the year 2009 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:15.079
 it's simple if you know the series 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.060
 you could have heard gaÃ¯a 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.909
 talk about this game if not 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.889
 it's worth lost prinny can i really 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:24.349
 be heroes is a platform game 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.060
 quite particular already because the 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.530
 heroes or rather the heroes of this game are 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.180
 the famous prices nor the penguins 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.729
 explosives from demonic plans 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.110
 often considered to be minions 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.120
 Brief Slave at the bottom of the ladder 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.409
 social of these worlds one wonders 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.430
 how prices can suddenly 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.529
 to become heroes 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.469
 the answer is simple to they can not 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:44.270
 not at least not alone is for 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.529
 that the player has 1000 prizes 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.150
 nor to complete the adventure 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:48.889
 and if the first levels are a 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.240
 health walk the last you 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.710
 will make you want to go to console you 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.589
 on some of the very easy golden 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.089
 ghost yes at this point because without counting 

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:56.719
 on the hordes of enemies the traps and 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:58.069
 other filth 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.599
 the developers had the idea 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.009
 totally assumed not to include 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.809
 price controls or during the 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.919
 jumps you remember I said flat 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:05.990
 action form 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.430
 well you will suffer as much from one 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.199
 than the other but all of this is 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.789
 assumed and it's ultimately the humor that 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.439
 spring from all situations and even 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.629
 of the obstinacy of the bonuses to accomplish 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:16.759
 their epic quest and that grows 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.469
 obviously the player went on if you 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.569
 know the crazy humor of disgaea 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:21.830
 you will not be out of place worse you 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.419
 you would surpass to try to 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.370
 keep a maximum of prigny envy to 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.949
 the end of the game prinny can i will be 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.360
 heroes is a game to take in the 30th degree 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:31.550
 the absurd of all situations 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.169
 the absurd of difficulty and the absurd 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.120
 even from the quest for his penguins gives 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.379
 as such an extraordinary charm and 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.879
 if you know the productions 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.959
 nippon ichi software you know that the 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.879
 game does not boil down to his quest 

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:42.080
 principal and there are quite a few others 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:44.180
 things to unlock in the game 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.709
 the latter meets a fairly good success 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.939
 to the press which led the 

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:48.560
 developers to offer us a suite 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:49.819
 unfortunately few are the times 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.289
 you can hear someone talking 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.389
 of these two games yet beautiful and 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.560
 to the crazy humor of the missing jewels 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.300
 cruelly grateful 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.749
 thankfully I'm here to fix 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.949
 these injustices and here they are giving game 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:02.659
 that's all for today 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.919
 the psp still contains very 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.569
 many unknown pearls of which 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.520
 some in the category of minis 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.319
 kind of category 1 before the time 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.879
 we will of course have the opportunity to 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:11.959
 return to other console games 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:13.219
