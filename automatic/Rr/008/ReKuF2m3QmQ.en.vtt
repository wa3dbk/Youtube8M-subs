00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:28.099
 the forms first I'm marking 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.829
 I'm doing it in a sense and 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.829
 logically in the perpendicular sense 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.379
 the first forgiveness rain knew me 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.739
 If you do not see my first ones, be careful 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.289
 fingers and it's a gouge that what we're 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.879
 unfairly marking the tip the 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.059
 separation between each of the 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.920
 beneficial one uvi in ​​the form of 'v' 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.440
 on a fibrofácil base that has been 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.780
 painted in this case this part of 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.659
 top with chemical base but white no 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.290
 like the other one that had white cut it 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.020
 we do in a sense 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.630
 I take out all 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.929
 tonight presented but let's go on the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.929
 other 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.740
 pin of water already as preparation paints 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.500
 thank you for everything that are fake 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.530
 finished and we're not going to paint city like 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.479
 that we leave we deposit the paint for 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.340
 that is as stain and everything that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.289
 They are perfectly painted oils not 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.810
 it's one thing that takes me too much 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.450
 weather 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.570
 because it seems that one by one takes his 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.000
 time that worries him when he does 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.950
 very big things and how much I get after 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.470
 the tables and well you have to make a 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.869
 fortune like this we use for example the color 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.420
 corn and we're doing it a little randomly 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.210
 at the beginning if it takes more or less 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.610
 idea of ​​what color I wanted one next to 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.369
 of the other that did not repeat too much 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.939
 but hey, I'm going to do it if 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.380
 you want to taste I do not have to 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.380
 forget orchid color 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.620
 and there are some touches to those left 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.290
 whites are also good at painting 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.300
 white and there are a few touches of black 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.790
 this is all the same, so he 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.530
 only one from here of the sauzal 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.110
 orchid 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.610
 The only thing I need is the color 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.160
 black what we go in one only 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.580
 quickly and we finished easily 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:44.130
 explained the black that is not so intense 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:46.620
 but it's very nice it 's fine once 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.260
 that this is done and finished one by 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.540
 one takes us so long warm white 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.580
 or if it's varnished as if by laughter 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.380
 that in your hand you move to the water so 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.310
 I can do the meeting without any 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.230
 problem if I step is already protected is 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.210
 to the board in warm white as the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.520
 rest of the drawers that are painted 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.820
 in warm white the edges of the furniture 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.820
 cited 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.170
 I need something I have created a ceramic 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.580
 see what I can do 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.700
 interspersed why be afraid to be 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.550
 superimpose and let me go one and up 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.100
 of the other one and already I cover the board that stops 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.680
 that just does not have to happen 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.810
 the three golds I already have everything then paint 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.310
 the letters when color orchids then 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.310
