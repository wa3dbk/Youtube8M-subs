 the subject of today, each one of the subjects 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.059
 I was going to talk a long time and since 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.870
 appeared opportunity I decided 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.910
 enjoy 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.100
 c'mon how do I divide 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.879
 my workouts during the week I do 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.100
 abc i do a bp do abcd is what is the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.510
 workout with the best kind of time to win 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.760
 muscle mass, how do I 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.570
 division to improve my portfolio 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.159
 muscular 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.040
 the answer to this kind of question 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.350
 which is quite simple there is no one type 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.170
 does not exist. 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.880
 that polio as well as dude like that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.810
 there is no specific training the law 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.540
 muscle mass 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.729
 that's exactly what the type of training proves 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.490
 you will have to do according to 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.990
 Your will and your turn is to win. 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.299
 It's no use putting a workout on 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.130
 pcdf for example if you are not going to put 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.960
 sufficient intensity nourishing that 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.570
 musician there who will make you need 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.590
 enough time for senad five to 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.630
 eight days 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.520
 not to do with the intensity with the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.750
 rest time you can give a 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.729
 rest time you are going to give 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.979
 that monster alice did not understand yet 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.380
 so come on let's say you do not 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.079
 Like what you know, do not train until 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.240
 to complete exhaustion in the muscle that is 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.399
 even though your workout is intense and not 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.409
 is enough to leave exhausted by 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.240
 complete you have not reached your limit 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.680
 on that day they will reach that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.030
 musician limit him 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.969
 So you have a workout there. 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.070
 intensity to the average and if you 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.480
 trains that effectively would be nice 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.520
 If you do abc 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.620
 a week because if you do not have the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.680
 express your muscle a lot if you do not 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.390
 He's fucking him on a very high level. 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.460
 you will not need much time 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.140
 to rest in two or three days and 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.700
 last will already be recovered 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.680
 This is a stimulus both to recover 70 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.650
 paulo again and how are you? 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.050
 whether the musician is already regenerated or 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.710
 no the guy has studies there that indicate 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.390
 that 48 to 72 hours later his musician already 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.450
 is fully regenerated, ie 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.490
 theoretically within two or three days 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.380
 You can already train that muscle . 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.660
 new, independent of intensity 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.670
 you applied on the last day as you dream and 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.890
 theory and in practice we know it is 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.510
 a little different you can not 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.330
 apply this concept for all types of 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.730
 tribute to training that is not the same or 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.100
 simply time you need seven 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.590
 eight days there does not tire a single 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.840
 muscle and this sensitivity and this 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.400
 The notion has to come with expensive time alone. 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.830
 with the training time you start to 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.750
 realize your body has already felt your body 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.090
 to start applying 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.950
 You do not have to get too attached. 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.840
 the type of workout you will do to 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.720
 gain muscle bridge must be 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.700
 best for fia twitter because the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.530
 two involved your diet blog your 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.280
 trailer just to direct your 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.380
 earnings 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.060
 so that's where you internalize you 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.310
 have experience you need 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.750
 choose the types of exercise very well 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.730
 What are you going to do that's a thing? 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.140
 different because let's say you are 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.900
 a guy who has a lot of a touch 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.370
 side you then you are in making a 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.980
 cash training but for doctors 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.810
 side would be a waste of time there you have 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.610
 very notorious lateral and has little 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.690
 You can not miss what you're going to do. 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.570
 you will be in the form of billboards 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.640
 side will not catch will take the 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.410
 intensity will increase the lateral and 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.110
 ghost intensity will catch three 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.300
 specific God who works much more 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.310
 from your front neckline I already 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.840
 I have simply tried almost everything 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.530
 kind of kaka training I 've heard of 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.989
 around 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.020
 I already tried the bp already tried abc 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.950
 coming down twice I've already tried the 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.590
 cd rest i 've already tried pcd 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.050
 consecutive and of all times that I 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.790
 I always made faces that I always 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.739
 I tried, I can say that what 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.639
 More is not more coconut was good 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.039
 to me what I most 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.129
 get results let's say so went 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.469
 in abcd and it's when I have a muscle 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:29.930
 per day with the service there the example in 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:32.629
 Monday and has only on Tuesday and 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.729
 Only Shore Wednesday will return only shoulder. 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.689
 the stone there on Thursday I have only 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.909
 legs 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:40.490
 on friday i do it now it's beautiful 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:42.409
 that the bisector so far has been the type of 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.719
 Train that I liked the most 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.069
 It does not mean that I'm going to use this 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:46.849
 training method for the rest of my 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.499
 life 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.349
 Let's see how it goes two years hence. 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:53.060
 in a month three months I do not feel 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.520
 The more difference I do not like to train anymore 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.319
 so I'm going to change my type of training 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.259
 break this stagnation and power 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:02.240
 to differentiate something new whose risk is 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.150
 same thing with the face biotypes you 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.889
 You know my kind you have you know the 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.110
 need you got what you want 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.330
 need and you will get a workout going 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.259
 play upon these needs and not 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.580
 the opposite 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.740
 if you think I 'm going to honor the shirt 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.770
 very fast and you will not be able to stay 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.919
 doing 67 world exercise with sweat 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.259
 ie abcd is no longer a good 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.110
 asked for you unless you like it 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:30.289
 a lot of exercise intensity 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.490
 short and a very fast time I think 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.050
