00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.810 
there and it would be like jewelry for
my<00:01:09.990> lower<00:01:10.170> back<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.100> started<00:01:11.460> looking<00:01:11.580> at

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
my lower back so I started looking at

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.399 
my lower back so I started looking at
all<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> department<00:01:12.510> stores<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.840> went<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> Saks

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
all the department stores I went to Saks

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.230 
all the department stores I went to Saks
and<00:01:13.710> Henry<00:01:13.979> Pindell<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.670> Nordstrom<00:01:15.210> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and Henry Pindell and Nordstrom and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.570 
and Henry Pindell and Nordstrom and
literally<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> department

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
literally like all of the department

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310 
literally like all of the department
stores<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.060> LA<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.450> no<00:01:18.659> one<00:01:18.840> had<00:01:19.020> him<00:01:19.170> I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
stores here in LA and no one had him I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.300 
stores here in LA and no one had him I
thought<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.680> sure<00:01:19.710> there'd<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.250> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
thought for sure there'd be like a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.460 
thought for sure there'd be like a
cocktail<00:01:20.700> crystal<00:01:21.509> brooch<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:22.080> nothing<00:01:22.350> too

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
cocktail crystal brooch like nothing too

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.590 
cocktail crystal brooch like nothing too
expensive<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.000> nothing<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.570> I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
expensive but there was nothing so I

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270 
expensive but there was nothing so I
ended<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.140> vintage<00:01:25.619> shopping<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
ended up going vintage shopping and I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.980 
ended up going vintage shopping and I
ended<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.700> finding<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.720> from<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
ended up finding this this is from the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.520 
ended up finding this this is from the
1940s<00:01:28.890> or<00:01:28.979> 50s<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:30.659> was<00:01:30.780> actually<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.500> my

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
1940s or 50s and it was actually in my

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.410 
1940s or 50s and it was actually in my
price<00:01:31.950> range<00:01:32.220> which<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.610> really<00:01:33.150> didn't<00:01:33.390> think

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
price range which I really didn't think

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.060 
price range which I really didn't think
it<00:01:33.570> would<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.439> was<00:01:34.590> about<00:01:34.860> what<00:01:35.040> I

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
it would be but it was about what I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.200 
it would be but it was about what I
would<00:01:35.250> expect<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> pay<00:01:35.790> at<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> department

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
would expect to pay at a department

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.090 
would expect to pay at a department
store<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.500> figured<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.070> I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
store for this and I figured that I

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.649 
store for this and I figured that I
wouldn't<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.670> use<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.240> dress<00:01:39.450> I

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
wouldn't just use it on this dress I

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.210 
wouldn't just use it on this dress I
could<00:01:39.810> use<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.170> any<00:01:40.380> little<00:01:40.650> black<00:01:40.950> dress

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
could use it on any little black dress

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.700 
could use it on any little black dress
as<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> back<00:01:42.210> adornment<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.290> thought

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
as like a back adornment so I thought

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.139 
as like a back adornment so I thought
that<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.890> was<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.490> pretty<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.820> bought

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
that that was really pretty I bought

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.120 
that that was really pretty I bought
this<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.720> ended<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.079> cinching<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> back<00:01:46.979> of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
this and I ended up cinching the back of

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.560 
this and I ended up cinching the back of
my<00:01:47.189> dress<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.060> had<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> get<00:01:48.450> my

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
my dress with it so I had to get my

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.880 
my dress with it so I had to get my
sister<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.899> help<00:01:49.049> me<00:01:49.229> because<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.470> couldn't<00:01:49.829> do

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
sister to help me because I couldn't do

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.260 
sister to help me because I couldn't do
it<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.100> my<00:01:50.220> own<00:01:50.250> because<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.729> was<00:01:50.850> wearing<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
it on my own because I was wearing the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.330 
it on my own because I was wearing the
dress<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> had<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.680> was<00:01:52.890> gather<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
dress but all I had to do was gather the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.160 
dress but all I had to do was gather the
fabric<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.880> back<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.360> then<00:01:54.540> pin<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.990> with

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
fabric in the back and then pin it with

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.420 
fabric in the back and then pin it with
this<00:01:55.290> brooch<00:01:55.560> which<00:01:55.829> was<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> little<00:01:56.310> bit

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
this brooch which was a little bit

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.830

difficult<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.149> particular<00:01:57.630> dress

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
difficult with this particular dress

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.749 
difficult with this particular dress
because<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.200> all<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> sequins<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> lot

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
because of all the sequins it was a lot
