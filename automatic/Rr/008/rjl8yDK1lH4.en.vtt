hey<00:00:07.390> guys<00:00:07.809> over<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.820> interplay<00:00:10.209> today<00:00:10.570> a<00:00:10.840> bit

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
hey guys over the interplay today a bit

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.379 
hey guys over the interplay today a bit
of<00:00:11.650> thing<00:00:11.860> to<00:00:11.980> do<00:00:12.099> and<00:00:12.700> I<00:00:12.849> thought<00:00:13.030> I'd<00:00:13.150> show<00:00:13.360> a

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
of thing to do and I thought I'd show a

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.780 
of thing to do and I thought I'd show a
simple<00:00:14.019> and<00:00:14.170> easy<00:00:14.290> way<00:00:14.469> of<00:00:14.549> throwing<00:00:15.549> to<00:00:15.639> a

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790 
simple and easy way of throwing to a

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.690 
simple and easy way of throwing to a
shoulder<00:00:16.150> without<00:00:16.840> the<00:00:17.050> run-out<00:00:17.529> groove<00:00:17.700> and

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
shoulder without the run-out groove and

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.139 
shoulder without the run-out groove and
without<00:00:19.689> any<00:00:19.950> chance<00:00:20.950> of<00:00:21.250> crashing<00:00:21.820> into<00:00:21.939> that

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:22.149 
without any chance of crashing into that

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:29.609 
without any chance of crashing into that
shoulder<00:00:23.910> actually<00:00:24.910> making<00:00:25.059> z14<00:00:26.050> pins<00:00:28.619> nearly

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
shoulder actually making z14 pins nearly

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.139 
shoulder actually making z14 pins nearly
finished<00:00:29.800> just<00:00:30.130> threading<00:00:30.430> them<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:33.250> I'll

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
finished just threading them so I'll

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.310 
finished just threading them so I'll
move<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.510> camera<00:00:34.719> around<00:00:34.780> to<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.020> lathe<00:00:35.170> and

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
move the camera around to the lathe and

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.640 
move the camera around to the lathe and
show<00:00:35.500> myself<00:00:35.879> and<00:00:36.879> you'll<00:00:37.360> see<00:00:37.540> how<00:00:37.810> how<00:00:38.410> I<00:00:38.440> can

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
show myself and you'll see how how I can

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.780 
show myself and you'll see how how I can
do<00:00:38.770> this<00:00:38.950> at<00:00:39.130> high<00:00:39.280> speed<00:00:39.610> without<00:00:40.600> a<00:00:41.790> CNC

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
do this at high speed without a CNC

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.819 
do this at high speed without a CNC
machine<00:00:43.050> without<00:00:44.050> any<00:00:44.350> chance

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
machine without any chance

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.090

crashing and without any run-out groove

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.840 
crashing and without any run-out groove
okay<00:00:48.100> so<00:00:48.160> here's<00:00:48.430> my<00:00:48.460> setup<00:00:48.730> I've<00:00:49.600> got<00:00:49.750> my

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
okay so here's my setup I've got my

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.330 
okay so here's my setup I've got my
piece<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.150> Colt<00:00:52.570> Chuck<00:00:52.890> I'm<00:00:53.890> using<00:00:54.100> an

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
piece and Colt Chuck I'm using an

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.930 
piece and Colt Chuck I'm using an
internal<00:00:55.290> threading<00:00:56.290> bar<00:00:56.530> I've<00:00:57.280> got<00:00:57.579> that<00:00:57.730> set

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
internal threading bar I've got that set

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.880 
internal threading bar I've got that set
out<00:00:58.090> from<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.390> tool<00:00:58.600> post<00:00:58.780> in<00:00:59.470> a<00:00:59.590> very<00:00:59.770> short

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
out from the tool post in a very short

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.630 
out from the tool post in a very short
distance<00:01:00.100> as<00:01:00.489> it<00:01:01.060> is<00:01:01.360> being<00:01:02.350> used<00:01:02.590> as<00:01:02.950> my<00:01:03.370> stop

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
distance as it is being used as my stop

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.719 
distance as it is being used as my stop
I<00:01:03.880> can<00:01:04.119> bring<00:01:04.299> the<00:01:04.420> side<00:01:04.720> of<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.460> tool<00:01:06.460> holder

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
I can bring the side of the tool holder

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.670 
I can bring the side of the tool holder
up<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.030> end<00:01:07.149> of<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.299> bar<00:01:07.479> and<00:01:08.229> that<00:01:08.290> gives

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
up to the end of the bar and that gives

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.399 
up to the end of the bar and that gives
me<00:01:08.829> my<00:01:09.009> distance<00:01:09.689> when<00:01:10.689> I'm<00:01:10.780> threading<00:01:10.990> is<00:01:11.229> I'm

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
me my distance when I'm threading is I'm

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.129 
me my distance when I'm threading is I'm
using<00:01:11.619> I'm<00:01:12.340> treating<00:01:12.639> this<00:01:12.700> in<00:01:12.819> Reverse<00:01:13.149> this

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:14.139 
using I'm treating this in Reverse this

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:16.039 
using I'm treating this in Reverse this
only<00:01:14.409> really<00:01:14.590> works<00:01:14.799> if<00:01:15.130> you're<00:01:15.369> using

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
only really works if you're using

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.969 
only really works if you're using
threading<00:01:17.049> a<00:01:17.109> pitch<00:01:17.289> that's<00:01:17.499> native<00:01:17.710> your

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
threading a pitch that's native your

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.770 
threading a pitch that's native your
lead<00:01:18.130> screw<00:01:18.399> you<00:01:18.939> really<00:01:19.240> need<00:01:19.389> to<00:01:19.479> be<00:01:19.569> able<00:01:19.689> to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
lead screw you really need to be able to

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.449 
lead screw you really need to be able to
disengage<00:01:20.259> engage<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.770> half<00:01:20.950> Mouse<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.340> do

00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:21.459 
disengage engage the half Mouse to do

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:26.789 
disengage engage the half Mouse to do
this<00:01:21.579> so<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:23.020> is<00:01:23.200> a<00:01:23.229> 20<00:01:24.069> 40<00:01:24.490> p<00:01:24.639> i<00:01:25.409> pol<00:01:26.409> thread<00:01:26.679> I

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
this so this is a 20 40 p i pol thread I

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.379 
this so this is a 20 40 p i pol thread I
put<00:01:27.280> an<00:01:27.369> imperial<00:01:27.670> lead<00:01:27.819> screw<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:28.179> I<00:01:28.209> can

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:28.389 
put an imperial lead screw so I can

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:30.270 
put an imperial lead screw so I can
engage<00:01:28.509> and<00:01:28.840> disengage<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.380> half<00:01:29.530> nuts<00:01:29.740> if

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
engage and disengage the half nuts if

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.620 
engage and disengage the half nuts if
you're<00:01:30.369> doing<00:01:30.490> metric<00:01:30.909> it<00:01:31.030> doesn't<00:01:31.299> work<00:01:31.450> so

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
you're doing metric it doesn't work so

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.709 
you're doing metric it doesn't work so
well<00:01:31.749> because<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.670> can't<00:01:33.939> position<00:01:34.569> your

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
well because you can't position your

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.379 
well because you can't position your
tool<00:01:34.929> back<00:01:35.469> in<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:35.709> right<00:01:35.859> spot<00:01:36.159> again<00:01:36.429> using

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:37.389 
tool back in the right spot again using

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:38.760 
tool back in the right spot again using
the<00:01:37.509> lead<00:01:37.689> screw<00:01:37.899> and<00:01:38.079> reversing<00:01:38.499> your<00:01:38.529> life

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
the lead screw and reversing your life

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.719 
the lead screw and reversing your life
so<00:01:38.979> you're<00:01:39.100> better<00:01:39.279> off<00:01:39.340> doing<00:01:39.429> your

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
so you're better off doing your

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.519 
so you're better off doing your
old-fashioned<00:01:40.630> way<00:01:40.719> I<00:01:40.749> guess<00:01:40.929> with<00:01:41.139> a<00:01:41.170> running

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:41.529 
old-fashioned way I guess with a running

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:45.510 
old-fashioned way I guess with a running
group<00:01:41.649> like<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.779> anyway<00:01:43.810> I'll<00:01:44.229> um<00:01:44.649> I'll<00:01:45.039> set

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
group like that anyway I'll um I'll set

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.219 
group like that anyway I'll um I'll set
up<00:01:45.609> and<00:01:45.759> do<00:01:45.819> this<00:01:45.939> one<00:01:46.119> from<00:01:46.749> this<00:01:46.840> angle<00:01:47.020> and

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
up and do this one from this angle and

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.139 
up and do this one from this angle and
I'll<00:01:47.380> do<00:01:47.499> another<00:01:47.649> one<00:01:47.770> from<00:01:48.039> another<00:01:48.849> camera

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
I'll do another one from another camera

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.730 
I'll do another one from another camera
angle<00:01:49.270> see<00:01:49.659> what<00:01:49.810> so<00:01:50.109> I'm<00:01:50.229> doing<00:01:50.349> I'm<00:01:50.560> plunging

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
angle see what so I'm doing I'm plunging

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.499 
angle see what so I'm doing I'm plunging
straight<00:01:50.920> in<00:01:51.249> with<00:01:51.340> this<00:01:51.429> it's<00:01:51.639> only<00:01:51.759> 24<00:01:52.209> TPI

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
straight in with this it's only 24 TPI

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.480 
straight in with this it's only 24 TPI
so<00:01:52.630> it's<00:01:52.810> not<00:01:52.899> a<00:01:52.959> big<00:01:53.109> um<00:01:53.259> not<00:01:54.219> a<00:01:54.249> big<00:01:54.429> cut<00:01:54.639> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
so it's not a big um not a big cut and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.779 
so it's not a big um not a big cut and
yeah<00:01:57.490> we'll<00:01:58.389> set<00:01:58.599> up<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.840> molar<00:01:59.079> or<00:01:59.439> cut<00:01:59.679> it<00:01:59.799> I'm

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
yeah we'll set up a molar or cut it I'm

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.330 
yeah we'll set up a molar or cut it I'm
doing<00:02:00.969> a<00:02:01.179> 400<00:02:01.630> rpm<00:02:01.749> probably<00:02:02.709> go<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.799> bit<00:02:02.950> faster

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
doing a 400 rpm probably go a bit faster

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.179 
doing a 400 rpm probably go a bit faster
but<00:02:03.520> some<00:02:03.840> quite<00:02:04.840> happy<00:02:05.049> with<00:02:05.139> that<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:05.499> once

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
but some quite happy with that so once

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.280 
but some quite happy with that so once
you<00:02:06.340> make<00:02:06.490> sure

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
you make sure

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.350 
you make sure
you<00:02:07.650> put<00:02:07.830> your<00:02:07.920> light<00:02:08.070> in<00:02:08.220> Reverse<00:02:08.490> trying<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
you put your light in Reverse trying to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.270 
you put your light in Reverse trying to
this<00:02:09.509> obviously<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.990> forwards<00:02:10.380> doesn't<00:02:11.160> work

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
this obviously in forwards doesn't work

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.970 
this obviously in forwards doesn't work
then<00:02:11.460> just<00:02:11.490> to<00:02:11.760> keep<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.060> mind<00:02:12.560> we<00:02:13.560> still<00:02:13.590> have

I went to a spring putt you're probably
enough<00:05:05.800> lumber<00:05:05.950> size<00:05:06.220> so<00:05:06.520> more<00:05:07.420> than<00:05:07.510> happy<00:05:07.780> to

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
enough lumber size so more than happy to

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.580 
enough lumber size so more than happy to
leave<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.050> like<00:05:08.230> that

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
leave it like that

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.830

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
the nice new insert in there so some

the nice new insert in there so some
it's<00:05:11.200> coming<00:05:11.380> really<00:05:11.470> nicely<00:05:11.710> there<00:05:12.010> you<00:05:12.070> go

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
it's coming really nicely there you go

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.420 
it's coming really nicely there you go

into<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:25.410> into<00:05:26.410> that<00:05:26.440> shoulder<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.430> it<00:05:27.520> just

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
into the into that shoulder and it just

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.830 
into the into that shoulder and it just
um<00:05:27.940> obviously<00:05:28.840> starts<00:05:29.320> with<00:05:29.470> a<00:05:29.700> groove<00:05:30.840> and

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
um obviously starts with a groove and

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.310 
um obviously starts with a groove and
then<00:05:32.050> runs<00:05:32.260> from<00:05:32.470> there<00:05:32.710> so<00:05:33.580> um<00:05:34.080> really<00:05:35.080> nice

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
then runs from there so um really nice

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.780 
then runs from there so um really nice
easy<00:05:35.530> way<00:05:35.710> of<00:05:35.770> threading<00:05:36.100> especially<00:05:36.730> if

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
easy way of threading especially if

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.160 
easy way of threading especially if
you've<00:05:36.880> got<00:05:36.970> multiple<00:05:37.120> parts<00:05:37.600> like<00:05:37.750> this<00:05:37.900> I

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
you've got multiple parts like this I

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.200 
you've got multiple parts like this I
could<00:05:38.950> probably<00:05:39.130> do<00:05:39.310> these<00:05:39.490> with<00:05:39.640> a<00:05:39.670> die<00:05:39.850> but<00:05:40.150> I

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
could probably do these with a die but I

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.550 
could probably do these with a die but I
don't<00:05:40.240> have<00:05:40.600> a<00:05:40.980> three<00:05:41.980> at<00:05:42.070> 24<00:05:42.490> die<00:05:42.640> so<00:05:42.990> I<00:05:43.990> figure

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
don't have a three at 24 die so I figure

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.290 
don't have a three at 24 die so I figure
a<00:05:44.590> single<00:05:45.160> point<00:05:45.340> um<00:05:45.400> I've<00:05:45.490> only<00:05:45.580> got<00:05:45.700> 24<00:05:46.060> to<00:05:46.150> do

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
a single point um I've only got 24 to do

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.500 
a single point um I've only got 24 to do
so

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
so

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.360 
so
makes<00:05:49.510> it<00:05:49.630> nice<00:05:49.780> and<00:05:49.810> easy<00:05:50.080> Naga<00:05:50.770> say<00:05:51.040> without

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
makes it nice and easy Naga say without

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.420 
makes it nice and easy Naga say without

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980

think<00:06:40.180> that's<00:06:40.300> a<00:06:40.390> really<00:06:40.630> good<00:06:40.720> way<00:06:40.900> of

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
think that's a really good way of

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.770 
think that's a really good way of

threading to a shoulder you're only

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.240 
threading to a shoulder you're only

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
doing one or two mine will be worth to

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.550 
doing one or two mine will be worth to
