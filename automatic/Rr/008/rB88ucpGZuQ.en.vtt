organic shelled hemp seeds and hemp

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.300 
organic shelled hemp seeds and hemp
seeds<00:06:24.910> are<00:06:25.030> so<00:06:25.270> good<00:06:25.449> for<00:06:25.630> vegans<00:06:26.050> for<00:06:27.039> so<00:06:27.190> many

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
seeds are so good for vegans for so many

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.370 
seeds are so good for vegans for so many
reasons<00:06:27.460> they're<00:06:28.150> really<00:06:28.479> good<00:06:28.690> digestible

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
reasons they're really good digestible

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.379 
reasons they're really good digestible
protein<00:06:29.410> and<00:06:30.070> they<00:06:30.550> have<00:06:30.729> that<00:06:30.880> healthy<00:06:31.180> fat

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 
protein and they have that healthy fat

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.719 
protein and they have that healthy fat
they're<00:06:31.600> one<00:06:31.720> of<00:06:31.750> the<00:06:31.840> highest<00:06:32.350> of<00:06:32.729> digestible

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
they're one of the highest of digestible

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:35.879 
they're one of the highest of digestible
proteins<00:06:34.270> for<00:06:34.600> vegans<00:06:35.020> so<00:06:35.470> I'm<00:06:35.530> going<00:06:35.680> to<00:06:35.710> take

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
proteins for vegans so I'm going to take

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.390

that<00:06:36.039> half<00:06:36.310> a<00:06:36.430> cup<00:06:37.470> sprinkle<00:06:38.470> it<00:06:38.560> end<00:06:38.740> I<00:06:39.039> look

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
that half a cup sprinkle it end I look

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.689 
that half a cup sprinkle it end I look
so<00:06:39.639> pretty<00:06:39.880> mm-hmm<00:06:40.919> doesn't<00:06:41.919> do<00:06:42.220> dog<00:06:42.370> two<00:06:42.669> dogs

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:42.699
