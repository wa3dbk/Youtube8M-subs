okay<00:00:04.049> this<00:00:04.319> is<00:00:04.470> phase<00:00:04.770> two<00:00:04.799> of<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.460> mini<00:00:06.120> bike

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
okay this is phase two of the mini bike

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.900 
okay this is phase two of the mini bike
project<00:00:07.429> as<00:00:08.809> you<00:00:09.809> can<00:00:09.870> see<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.580> put<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> chain

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
project as you can see I put the chain

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.379 
project as you can see I put the chain
on<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.150> jack<00:00:12.960> shaft<00:00:13.200> system<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.830> all<00:00:13.950> together

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
on it jack shaft system is all together

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.700 
on it jack shaft system is all together
put<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> different<00:00:15.570> handlebar<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.529> that's

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
put a different handlebar on it that's

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.150 
put a different handlebar on it that's
higher<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.609> will<00:00:17.670> clear<00:00:17.970> my<00:00:18.119> knees<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:19.130> put<00:00:20.130> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
higher it will clear my knees and put a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.349 
higher it will clear my knees and put a
cover<00:00:20.430> over<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.730> clutch<00:00:22.070> now<00:00:23.070> according<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
cover over the clutch now according to

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.939 
cover over the clutch now according to
my<00:00:25.199> calculations<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.070> far<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:27.500> rear<00:00:28.500> ratio

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
my calculations so far the rear ratio

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.389 
my calculations so far the rear ratio
from<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.580> clutch<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.679> rear<00:00:31.679> sprocket<00:00:32.279> is

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
from the clutch to the rear sprocket is

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.600 
from the clutch to the rear sprocket is
about<00:00:33.390> 4.9<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.750> prefer<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.559> six<00:00:38.340> or

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
about 4.9 to one I prefer to be six or

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.760 
about 4.9 to one I prefer to be six or
maybe<00:00:38.850> even<00:00:38.940> seven<00:00:39.390> make<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.230> easier<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
maybe even seven make it easier on the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.479 
maybe even seven make it easier on the
motor<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:42.840> only<00:00:43.079> way<00:00:43.230> i'll<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.739> able<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.309> do

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
motor the only way i'll be able to do

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.830 
motor the only way i'll be able to do
that<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:46.309> right<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:49.670> you<00:00:50.670> changing<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
that is right here you changing out that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.350 
that is right here you changing out that
sprocket<00:00:53.270> i'll<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.690> find<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.230> that's<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
sprocket i'll have to find one that's a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.430 
sprocket i'll have to find one that's a
bigger<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> will<00:00:58.590> lower<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> gear<00:00:59.100> ratio<00:00:59.309> I

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
bigger so will lower the gear ratio I

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.959 
bigger so will lower the gear ratio I
can't<00:01:01.440> change<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.800> ratio<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> tire<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.910> I

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
can't change the ratio on the tire and I

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.700 
can't change the ratio on the tire and I
can't<00:01:03.210> change<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> ratio<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> clutch

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
can't change the ratio on the clutch

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.010 
can't change the ratio on the clutch
which<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.309> behind<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.760> little<00:01:06.060> cover<00:01:06.750> right

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
which is behind that little cover right

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.469 
which is behind that little cover right
there<00:01:07.580> so<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> only<00:01:08.820> way<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.000> could<00:01:09.150> change

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
there so the only way I could change

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.780 
there so the only way I could change
that<00:01:09.720> one<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.590> will<00:01:11.280> probably<00:01:11.490> do

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
that one and that one will probably do

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.640 
that one and that one will probably do
it<00:01:12.260> but<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.470> now<00:01:13.619> I'll<00:01:15.259> got<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.320> finish<00:01:16.439> this

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
it but for now I'll got to finish this

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.480 
it but for now I'll got to finish this
thing<00:01:16.830> up<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.390> test<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.869> see<00:01:18.900> if<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:20.369> got

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
thing up and test it to see if it's got

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.200 
thing up and test it to see if it's got
enough<00:01:20.700> pull<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> low<00:01:21.540> end<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:23.210> stuff

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
enough pull on the low end and stuff

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.289 
enough pull on the low end and stuff
like<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.950> have<00:01:25.950> not<00:01:26.220> yet<00:01:26.580> installed<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
like that I have not yet installed the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.030 
like that I have not yet installed the
controls<00:01:30.200> that's<00:01:31.200> another<00:01:31.439> thing<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.829> got<00:01:32.009> to

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
controls that's another thing I got to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.280 
controls that's another thing I got to
get<00:01:32.250> brake<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.880> throttle<00:01:32.909> system<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.140> then

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
get brake and throttle system and then

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.670 
get brake and throttle system and then
you're<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.619> all<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.900> oil<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.170> gas<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.590> motor

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
you're it all up oil and gas and motor

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.990 
you're it all up oil and gas and motor
up<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:39.200> stuff<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
up and stuff like that that the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.929 
up and stuff like that that the
jackshaft<00:01:42.270> system<00:01:42.990> worked<00:01:43.200> out<00:01:43.380> pretty<00:01:43.560> good

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
jackshaft system worked out pretty good

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.109 
jackshaft system worked out pretty good
I'm<00:01:44.939> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.740> hope<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.950> holds<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.490> place<00:01:47.520> well

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
I'm going to hope it holds in place well

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.719 
I'm going to hope it holds in place well
I've<00:01:48.420> used<00:01:48.659> lock<00:01:49.020> nuts<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> everything<00:01:49.829> hold

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
I've used lock nuts and everything hold

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.490 
I've used lock nuts and everything hold
it<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:50.939> place<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.590> cover<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.920> use<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.549> off<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:54.500> an

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
it in place the cover I use is off a an

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.830 
it in place the cover I use is off a an
exhaust<00:01:55.890> manifold<00:01:56.460> cover<00:01:59.149> off<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.450> Briggs<00:02:00.659> &amp;

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.749 

I've<00:02:03.909> seen<00:02:04.179> that<00:02:04.299> on<00:02:04.359> some<00:02:05.429> mini<00:02:06.429> bikes<00:02:06.640> for

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
I've seen that on some mini bikes for

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.670 
I've seen that on some mini bikes for
sale<00:02:06.969> on<00:02:07.649> YouTube<00:02:08.649> no<00:02:09.099> not<00:02:09.310> YouTube<00:02:09.700> ebay<00:02:10.680> and

sale on YouTube no not YouTube ebay and

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.259 
sale on YouTube no not YouTube ebay and
I<00:02:11.950> thought<00:02:12.129> that's<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.430> neat<00:02:12.580> idea<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.150> I'll

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
I thought that's the neat idea so I'll

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.850 
I thought that's the neat idea so I'll
use<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.629> and<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.750> had<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.930> couple<00:02:14.170> extra<00:02:14.379> so<00:02:14.830> I

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
use it and I had a couple extra so I

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.030 
use it and I had a couple extra so I
decided<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.849> use<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:17.620> yesterday<00:02:17.800> I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
decided to use that but yesterday I

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.949 
decided to use that but yesterday I
spent<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.370> day<00:02:18.569> working<00:02:19.569> on<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:19.900> thing

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
spent a day working on this thing

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.309 
spent a day working on this thing
finishing<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.709> up<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:22.510> looks<00:02:22.660> pretty<00:02:22.780> good<00:02:23.049> I

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
finishing it up it looks pretty good I

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.479 
finishing it up it looks pretty good I
need<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:23.739> kickstand<00:02:24.370> for<00:02:24.489> it<00:02:24.760> also<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:26.489> some

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
need a kickstand for it also and some

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.500 
need a kickstand for it also and some
fenders<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.209> got<00:02:28.840> an<00:02:28.959> idea<00:02:29.049> for<00:02:29.319> some<00:02:29.709> fenders

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
fenders I got an idea for some fenders

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.370 
fenders I got an idea for some fenders
I'll<00:02:31.510> probably<00:02:32.410> take<00:02:32.680> some<00:02:32.950> aluminum<00:02:33.489> or

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
I'll probably take some aluminum or

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.699 
I'll probably take some aluminum or
steel<00:02:35.380> angle<00:02:36.040> iron<00:02:36.599> to<00:02:37.599> make<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.780> flat<00:02:38.110> spot<00:02:38.440> in

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
steel angle iron to make a flat spot in

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.210 
steel angle iron to make a flat spot in
here<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.569> can<00:02:40.660> mount<00:02:40.959> well<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.769> fly<00:02:41.920> spot

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
here so I can mount well the fly spot

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.860 
here so I can mount well the fly spot
right<00:02:42.370> here<00:02:42.400> actually<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.510> mount<00:02:43.810> the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
right here actually so I mount the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.259 
right here actually so I mount the
fender<00:02:44.829> right<00:02:45.130> there<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.640> same<00:02:45.910> on<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
fender right there and the same on the

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.080 
fender right there and the same on the
front<00:02:49.769> these<00:02:50.769> are<00:02:50.920> many<00:02:51.040> bikes<00:02:51.280> like<00:02:51.549> today

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
front these are many bikes like today

front these are many bikes like today
you<00:02:52.120> can<00:02:52.450> see<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.840> yard<00:02:53.079> is<00:02:53.349> just<00:02:53.620> covered<00:02:53.860> and

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
you can see the yard is just covered and

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.369 
you can see the yard is just covered and
do<00:02:54.340> if<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.480> don't<00:02:55.599> have<00:02:55.840> fenders<00:02:56.170> on<00:02:56.349> it

frame and tied it in with a piece angle
iron<00:03:12.819> and<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.870> did<00:03:14.049> that<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.380> I<00:03:14.410> can<00:03:14.530> get<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.739> the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
iron and I did that so I can get to the

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.039 
iron and I did that so I can get to the
gas<00:03:15.010> cap<00:03:15.340> these<00:03:16.060> new<00:03:16.329> motors<00:03:16.690> are<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> lot

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049

but<00:05:43.390> the<00:05:43.510> jackshaft<00:05:43.750> system<00:05:44.470> here<00:05:44.800> I<00:05:44.950> think<00:05:45.520> a

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
but the jackshaft system here I think a

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.420 
but the jackshaft system here I think a
work<00:05:45.790> good<00:05:46.000> like<00:05:46.300> i<00:05:46.330> said<00:05:47.010> if<00:05:48.010> you're<00:05:48.220> going<00:05:48.280> to

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
work good like i said if you're going to

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.630 
work good like i said if you're going to
change<00:05:48.730> the<00:05:48.880> ratio<00:05:49.060> to<00:05:49.990> up<00:05:50.200> to<00:05:51.040> get<00:05:51.220> the<00:05:51.460> gear

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
change the ratio to up to get the gear

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.600 
change the ratio to up to get the gear
ratio<00:05:52.080> it'll<00:05:53.080> have<00:05:53.200> to<00:05:53.350> be<00:05:53.470> this<00:05:53.800> pulley<00:05:54.340> right

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
ratio it'll have to be this pulley right

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.480 
ratio it'll have to be this pulley right
here<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.560> i'm<00:05:56.560> going<00:05:56.740> to<00:05:56.800> probably<00:05:57.070> look<00:05:57.370> at

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
here and i'm going to probably look at

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.250 
here and i'm going to probably look at
that<00:05:57.730> like<00:05:58.210> i<00:05:58.240> said<00:05:58.390> i<00:05:58.450> got<00:05:58.600> to<00:05:58.720> test<00:05:58.930> it<00:05:59.050> first

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
that like i said i got to test it first

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.370 
that like i said i got to test it first
see<00:05:59.620> how<00:05:59.770> it<00:05:59.890> pulls<00:06:00.750> this<00:06:01.750> will<00:06:01.960> probably<00:06:02.140> have

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
see how it pulls this will probably have

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.850 
see how it pulls this will probably have
an<00:06:02.470> awesome<00:06:02.800> top<00:06:03.040> end<00:06:03.280> right<00:06:03.490> now<00:06:03.960> but<00:06:04.960> with<00:06:05.830> a

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
an awesome top end right now but with a

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.830 
an awesome top end right now but with a
four<00:06:06.130> point<00:06:06.400> nine<00:06:06.460> to<00:06:06.730> one<00:06:06.820> ratio<00:06:07.030> i<00:06:07.270> need<00:06:07.570> i

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
four point nine to one ratio i need i

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
four point nine to one ratio i need i
need<00:06:07.990> closer<00:06:08.560> to<00:06:08.800> six<00:06:09.160> or<00:06:09.910> even<00:06:10.290> seven<00:06:12.510> and

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
need closer to six or even seven and

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.880 
need closer to six or even seven and
that'll<00:06:14.860> be<00:06:14.950> in<00:06:15.100> the<00:06:15.190> testing<00:06:15.580> phase<00:06:16.890> over

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
that'll be in the testing phase over

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.010 
that'll be in the testing phase over

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:29.209 
ability to be adjusted a little bit so I

00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:32.619 
ability to be adjusted a little bit so I
did<00:07:29.899> the<00:07:29.989> back<00:07:30.169> one<00:07:30.349> first<00:07:30.669> adjusted<00:07:31.669> it<00:07:31.789> try

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:32.629

to<00:07:32.689> get<00:07:32.869> this<00:07:33.019> on<00:07:33.409> an<00:07:33.830> even<00:07:34.099> plane<00:07:34.399> with<00:07:34.669> the

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:34.759 
to get this on an even plane with the

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:37.649 
to get this on an even plane with the
motor<00:07:34.969> and<00:07:35.319> the<00:07:36.319> wheel<00:07:36.499> and<00:07:36.709> everything<00:07:36.800> and

00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:37.659

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:42.769 
then I cut this chain and I cut this

00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:44.199 
then I cut this chain and I cut this
chain<00:07:43.069> and<00:07:43.189> then<00:07:43.279> I<00:07:43.339> had<00:07:43.459> the<00:07:43.610> adjustment<00:07:44.089> for

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:44.209 
chain and then I had the adjustment for

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:46.199 
chain and then I had the adjustment for
the<00:07:44.239> motor<00:07:44.479> and<00:07:44.719> i<00:07:45.259> jested<00:07:45.649> it<00:07:45.800> right<00:07:45.919> there

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:46.209 
the motor and i jested it right there

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:52.540 
the motor and i jested it right there
still<00:07:47.209> keeping<00:07:47.389> everything<00:07:47.749> in<00:07:47.959> line<00:07:51.550> so

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:52.550 
still keeping everything in line so

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.699 
still keeping everything in line so
that's<00:07:52.789> what<00:07:52.999> she<00:07:53.149> looks<00:07:53.360> like<00:07:53.479> my<00:07:54.169> pin<00:07:54.469> back

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:54.709 
that's what she looks like my pin back

00:07:54.709 --> 00:08:01.360 
that's what she looks like my pin back
and<00:07:57.339> close<00:07:58.339> out<00:07:58.610> on<00:07:58.909> that
