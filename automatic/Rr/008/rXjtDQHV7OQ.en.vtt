00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.070
 during the presentation of the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.410
 pubenza carnivals 2015 the winner of 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.719
 the call made by corpus to 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.119
 enmanuel for the nurseries that he presented 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.039
 the image reviving traditions speaks 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.710
 about the creation of it and the 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.690
 slogan of this great good event 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.820
 we rely on a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.250
 research that we did starting with 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.070
 the culture of popay치n in that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.810
 We put the name to revive traditions 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.390
 so we left a long time ago 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.329
 in which the carnivals made them in 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.339
 slabs that are chivas and they 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.699
 they remove the back and there they rode 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:40.829
 the floats then we drive from 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.559
 there it started as the initial idea for the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.510
 design and there we were composing with 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.359
 certain characteristic elements of the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.789
 popay치n city that are like the cathedral 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.100
 the tower the clock the nose and that the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.170
 they also added that this idea 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.059
 comes from rescuing and highlighting 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.399
 different traditions of the city 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.499
 white from colombia and make a great 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.080
 representation of the carnivals that year 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:06.630
 after a year they have been making themselves known 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.960
 the slogan also that we take it for 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.720
 what 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.750
 the reference to the image as it is a 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.460
 popular touch the image then also 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.940
 we thought a slogan that would agree 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.790
 to this then and the slogan rumba 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.320
 culture and pipi치n hints at more than 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.180
 everything in the rumba that was seen in the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.280
 carnivals the culture that this 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.830
 represents in the image and the pipi치n that 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.690
 it is one of the typical foods here of 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.850
 same way he expressed his nonconformity 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.890
 due to a series of misunderstandings that 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.930
 according to him it was generated in the last days 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.909
 after announcing the name of the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.610
 winner since the Payanese community 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.440
 speculates about a similarity with the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.660
 image of the manizales fair 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.750
 well then after we 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.210
 we present the proposal and that already 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.070
 we were like winners raised the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.490
 image to the page 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.369
 of the mayor's office and there another 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.500
 image of the carnales de manizales in 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.240
 those who said supposedly 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.819
 we had plagiarized yes 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.740
 we did not know about the 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.679
 existence of the image of the carnal 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.090
 of manizales and when we saw then for 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.860
 surprise we have many 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.930
 similarities the images 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.880
 we have many arguments in 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.160
 those who show who is not a plagiarist 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.080
 yes because we handle a 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.510
 very thorough research on the other hand 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.250
 this image and slogan manage to capture everything 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.020
 what represents us to us 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.540
 payaneses and that through different 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.470
 events such as the carnivals we give 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.470
 to know our culture
