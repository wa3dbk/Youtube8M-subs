00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.130
 Hello, how are you all? 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.930
 find very well in this video 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.330
 tutorial we will learn to take advantage of 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.270
 maximum the screen of our engine or the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.520
 moto g or any other device that 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.680
 have the virtual buttons on what is 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.809
 the screen for it will occupy two 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.570
 applications which are the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.600
 installer sposer and what is gravity 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.520
 box and good both applications will be 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.500
 in the description of the video so that the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.809
 you can download a very requirement 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.420
 important to do all this is to be 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.949
 root user so the first way to 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.989
 take advantage of what is the most of the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.390
 Our gp motorcycle's screen is 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.159
 reducing these virtual buttons like 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.710
 observe here I have it the way that 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.159
 I came 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.710
 by factory ie the buttons 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.200
 they are a little big and we are going to 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.080
 reduce in order to take full advantage of what 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.909
 which is the screen of our motorcycle gp and 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.180
 well first we have to install 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.960
 what is the spot set 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.940
 and we will give him in April once here 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.400
 in installers possesses we are going to 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.350
 direct where it says framework in its 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.570
 then they will give you here to install 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.700
 update and once you have given 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.830
 there then we're going to go to where 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.470
 it says restart and it will restart 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.360
 what your terminal is important the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.180
 reset the terminal so they can be 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.810
 execute what are the most changes 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.270
 Later we will give back and now we 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.670
 to install what is the gravity box in 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.610
 my case because I already have it installed and not 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.960
 we are going to open it, we are going to direct 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.300
 where it says we're going to direct 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.070
 again to what is the spot set and we 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.580
 let's direct where it says modules 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.680
 here it will come unmarked and what 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.780
 we have to mark and here it tells us that 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.180
 the list of modules has been updated 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.190
 and for the changes to be made 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.230
 we must restart again what is 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.180
 the terminal so it's sum 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.700
 importance to restart what is 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.450
 the android phone to run 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.819
 now yes what are the changes once 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.739
 and restarted what is the terminal already 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.140
 I had commented it is very important to return 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.480
 to restart the terminal once 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.600
 rebooted then now we are going to 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.150
 our gravity box 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.550
 and we're going to go to what is the adjustment 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.130
 navigation bar 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.170
 here they will come from marking and what 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.900
 The only thing we have to do is mark it 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.450
 give it yes and enable the bar 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.520
 navigation with the popcorn and we're going to 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.370
 direct down 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.990
 where it says dimensions here as it observes 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.270
 is one hundred percent that is like 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.020
 It comes from the factory and we will reduce it 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.540
 up to 65% we will observe 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.200
 we have to reduce what these are 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.050
 three bars up to 65% we are going to 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.010
 reduce it here already observe it we are going to 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.170
 reduce the other 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.689
 to 65 and we're going to reduce the last one to 65% 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.000
 here we will see and they will be 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.709
 applying what the changes are and we see 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.170
 that by reducing what the buttons are 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.060
 we will be taking advantage of what 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.579
 which is to the maximum the screen of our 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.890
 engine and well this has been the first 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.690
 way to take advantage of it let's see the 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.599
 second way to take advantage of what it is to 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.370
 maximum the screen of our motorcycle gp and 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.470
 well we are going to go from noon again to 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.329
 what is gravity box and we are going to 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.720
 direct now what is control in 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:46.450
 spiteful and good control let's give it here 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.400
 in activate control spice and we're going to 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.590
 give in when the expanded writer 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.200
 hide the navigation bar and good 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.780
 Once here here they will appear - 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.579
 let's give it what it is 15 and 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.730
 let's reduce what is the size of the 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.739
 navigation button to this and good of 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.470
 this is not going to move anything else and 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.230
 now let's go back and let's go 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.790
 where it says display settings and 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.459
 we're going to go to desktop mode 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.350
 expanded and we will give in hide 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.230
 navigation bar 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.240
 and once done good because we will 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.220
 restart what is the terminal so that 

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.170
 we are executed in what are the changes 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.750
 in my case I'm going to cut what is the 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.260
 video while restarting the terminal 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.150
 android 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.250
 good friends you can be returned 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.530
 after restarting the terminal to 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.480
 that the changes that can be applied 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.550
 we have done previously with what is 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.110
 the gravity box and well let's leave 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.020
 pressed what is the screen of 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.290
 blockade and we see that we get the 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.460
 expanded writer that if we squeeze it 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.530
 so we expand to what is the 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.720
 desk and taking advantage of what is the 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.150
 maximum the screen of our engine or the 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.420
 motorcycle that and good you will wonder where 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.890
 there are the virtual buttons of 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.230
 our engine and well I have 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.940
 configured so that when you slide the 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.760
 Fingertip on the left side 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.010
 lower then I get what are the 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.690
 Virtual buttons already notice that here 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.790
 there is the return button what is the 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.830
 home button and what is the button 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.870
 recent applications that would be our 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.850
 multitasking and good in my case I'm going to 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.610
 give back and I'll teach them to 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.260
 set where where they want it to go 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.540
 if on the left or on the part 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.200
 right let's go again what is 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.120
 the gravity box 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.820
 and once in here we're going to 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.210
 go to control spies and we're going to direct 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.710
 in actuator positions and well here 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.900
 I have configured it to distract me in 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.700
 the left edge of the screen and in 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.250
 the right edge as you see it 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.990
 I have marked with a popcorn and if you 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.810
 they want them to make the bottom edge 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.240
 of the screen ie down or in the 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.220
 top of the screen in my case 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.830
 I do not feel like leaving it like that so what 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.570
 I leave as it was and we see that if also 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.230
 slid what is the fingertip 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.060
 in the lower right, it's the same 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.910
 I get what are the buttons we are going to 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.250
 give it back and let's give it back and 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.350
 well in my opinion it is very uncomfortable 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.090
 work with this second option though 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.720
 we take full advantage of what is 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.640
 screen of our motorcycle that but fine 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.950
 this is the opinion of each one is to say 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.140
 many people are better to work 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.970
 in this way since they take advantage of what 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.040
 is the maximum screen or 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.950
 reducing nothing more what are the 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.140
 buttons of what is our motorcycle that 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.290
 now to return to what is 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.100
 this the virtual buttons we are going to leave 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.860
 what is squeezed 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.080
 to the screen the lock button sorry 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.330
 and we're going to give you an expanded desk 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.790
 and in this way we will see what 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.650
 will appear again what are the 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.050
 virtual buttons on what is the 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.660
 screen as already mentioned to me is 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.120
 more satisfying to work with one 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.340
 reducing what are the buttons since 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.050
 Wherever you are from, they are 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.210
 little ones and well well I can go back 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.910
 quickly and I do not have to walk 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.560
 sliding what is the finger either the 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.920
 left part with the right part 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.960
 but as I mentioned it is each one's option 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.910
 and well we have reached the end of this 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.740
 tutorial and if you liked it do not forget that 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.630
 give me what is a good light and 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.020
 share it with all your friends who 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:18.540
 have a terminal of this range and good 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.400
 and if you are new watching our videos 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.530
 we invite you to go to the section 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.390
 of our videos and observe one of 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.490
 they will surely be of great 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:31.250
 interest and if you liked it do not forget about
