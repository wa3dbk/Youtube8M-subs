there and this time actually overwater

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.170 
there and this time actually overwater
it<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.870> that's<00:00:55.050> why<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.230> am<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> ziplock

open<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.840> heir<00:00:58.739> rating<00:01:00.289> so<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.649> would<00:01:01.829> dry<00:01:02.070> out

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
open and heir rating so it would dry out

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.570

you know and they I clearly left them in
here<00:02:19.400> this<00:02:20.400> batch<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.030> did<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:22.620> batch

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
here this batch I just did this batch

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.950 
here this batch I just did this batch
here<00:02:23.340> they<00:02:23.730> have<00:02:23.880> been<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.330> ziplock<00:02:24.750> bag

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
here they have been in the ziplock bag

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.950 
here they have been in the ziplock bag
for<00:02:25.200> over<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> year<00:02:25.590> now<00:02:26.750> controlling<00:02:27.750> their

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
for over a year now controlling their

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.200 
for over a year now controlling their
growth<00:02:28.260> pattern<00:02:28.770> limiting<00:02:29.400> lights<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:30.060> mean

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
growth pattern limiting lights I mean

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.460 
growth pattern limiting lights I mean
sometimes<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.780> actually<00:02:30.930> put<00:02:31.230> them<00:02:31.320> in<00:02:31.410> the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
sometimes I actually put them in the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.740 
sometimes I actually put them in the
dark<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:31.890> they're<00:02:31.980> still<00:02:32.250> growing<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.510> they

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
dark and they're still growing so they

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.580 
dark and they're still growing so they
are<00:02:33.810> doing<00:02:34.140> extremely<00:02:34.800> well<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:36.140> as<00:02:37.140> soon<00:02:37.470> as

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
are doing extremely well and as soon as

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.260 
are doing extremely well and as soon as
I<00:02:37.650> get<00:02:37.710> my<00:02:37.830> grounds<00:02:38.280> done<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.760> will<00:02:38.880> go<00:02:39.120> outside

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
I get my grounds done I will go outside

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.210 
I get my grounds done I will go outside
and<00:02:39.750> transplant<00:02:40.410> some<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.710> these<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
and transplant some of these and the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.350 
and transplant some of these and the
rest<00:02:41.340> will<00:02:41.490> probably<00:02:41.790> go<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.060> farmers

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
rest will probably go to the farmers

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.050 
rest will probably go to the farmers
market<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.750> sell<00:02:42.990> them<00:02:43.280> but<00:02:44.280> I'll<00:02:44.730> show<00:02:45.000> you

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
market and sell them but I'll show you

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.700 
market and sell them but I'll show you
what<00:02:45.300> they<00:02:45.480> look<00:02:45.510> like<00:02:45.750> at<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.260> end<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.620> you

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
what they look like at the end and you

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.520 
what they look like at the end and you
might<00:02:46.890> recognize<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.670> pictures<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:49.050> that's

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
might recognize the pictures so that's

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.850 
might recognize the pictures so that's
it<00:02:49.770> thanks<00:02:50.460> bye
