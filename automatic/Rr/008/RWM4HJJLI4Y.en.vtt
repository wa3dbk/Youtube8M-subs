00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello here's how to make a tapas 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.140
 zucchini 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.740
 to start you need 100 g of 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:16.440
 zucchini a teaspoon of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:20.160
 basil mashed 100g goat 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:25.680
 snags a tablespoon of cream 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.189
 fresh 10 g tomatoes confit with salt 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.500
 and pepper 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.300
 with the help of a thrifty I start with 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.820
 take thin slices of 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:44.250
 zucchini frozen on a plate 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.930
 I add cros it is frozen but 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.329
 leave in the refrigerator 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.520
 that way they will soften 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.610
 during that time I prepare my cream 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.120
 with basil so for that I mix my 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:07.519
 fresh cream with fresh basil 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.519
 puree of salt and pepper 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:27.509
 I mix everything well I cut the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.630
 goat cheese and tomatoes confit in small 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.420
 pieces and I'll be able to start the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.689
 dressage 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:41.430
 I start by taking a slice of 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:47.540
 zucchini and genappe mass with crÃ©mants 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.540
 with basil on it 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:58.720
 I add a small piece of goat a 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:03.180
 small piece of confit tomatoes and I 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.180
 rolls everything like a pancake 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:21.140
 I sting with a small toothpick and I 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:23.540
 reserve on a plate he these loans 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.060
 but zucchini tapas are finished 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.100
 I just have to feast on a 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.740
 recipe that I recommend because she 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.890
 is simple to perform 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.050
 original full of flavors very greedy 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.290
 and cool 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.290
 good tasting
