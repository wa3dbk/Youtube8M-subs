00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.260
 Elif! 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.220
 Pelin! I was looking for your office. 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.540
 It seems to belong to Omer. 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.800
 Could you pass it to him? 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.460
 I will give, but ... He is in the office, you can give it yourself. 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.040
 I'll be in the yard. 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.440
 I would be glad if you keep me informed. 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.240
 I will, of course ... It's very cold outside, maybe you can wait here 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.780
 Have some tea or coffee. You are very tired. 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.780
 Thank you so much! I'm fine. 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.820
 You look like. 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.020
 Sorry? 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.960
 I'm talking about Omer ... 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.200
 and about you, you are like. 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.600
 If you begin to stubbornly, then for all comes a difficult time. 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.740
 Your mind becomes silent and your stubbornness begins to speak. 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.060
 Pelin, this is not stubbornness ,. 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.240
 Of course... 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.080
 Elif, you are hurt by the Omer. 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.640
 He tried to keep his promise. 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.640
 But not kept. 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.060
 He could not hold back. 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.520
 That is, when we listened to the recording of Asla's conversation with his father, our boss was with us. 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.820
 The case was transferred to the prosecutor. 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.360
 Omer was not even there. 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.360
 He was in a meeting with the chief. 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.640
 Conjuncture. 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.760
 Do not think that Omer does not care about you. 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.360
 Omer always keeps promises, no matter how difficult it is. Even if it costs him his life. 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.320
 Only ... life does not help him. 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.060
 Believe me, he is as upset as you are. 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.660
 I... 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.500
 I thought that... 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.220
 It will be better if you give yourself. 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.420
 Omer in the room. 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.580
 Omer transferred to us. 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.020
 Come in. 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.400
 Thank you very much! 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.500
 It's my pleasure. 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.500
 Elif, you will get sick. Go home. 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.000
 Omer ... 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.040
 Asly didn't do it, right? 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.340
 She did not kill the father. 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.160
 You're tired, go home. 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.620
 I am sure that Asly cannot do anything wrong. 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.700
 But it's important for me to hear from you. 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.360
 Asly's not a killer, is she? 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.360
 Is not it? 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.160
 Not a killer! 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.120
 Well, will you help Asla? 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.280
 Elif ... 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.640
 The evidence against Asly is very serious ... 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.020
 My goal is to disprove them. 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.820
 If she told us where she was that night ... 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.160
 That would solve everything, but she does not want to talk. 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.840
 If Asly doesn't want to talk, then no one will make her. 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.860
 Okay... 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.520
 I will not bother you.
