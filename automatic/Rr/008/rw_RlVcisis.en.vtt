to<00:01:42.649> make<00:01:42.920> this<00:01:43.130> into<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.550> puree<00:01:43.940> we're<00:01:44.300> going<00:01:44.509> to

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
to make this into a puree we're going to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.710 
to make this into a puree we're going to
have<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.990> cut<00:01:45.319> it<00:01:45.440> up<00:01:45.590> into<00:01:45.860> some<00:01:46.640> chunks<00:01:47.210> so

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
have to cut it up into some chunks so

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.650 
have to cut it up into some chunks so
what<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:47.990> do<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.350> I<00:01:48.619> cut<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.159> into<00:01:49.369> some<00:01:50.210> slices

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
what I do is I cut it into some slices

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.219 
what I do is I cut it into some slices
like<00:01:51.349> this<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.310> then<00:01:52.670> i'll<00:01:52.880> take<00:01:53.239> the<00:01:53.479> slices

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
like this and then i'll take the slices

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.499 
like this and then i'll take the slices
in<00:01:54.380> with<00:01:54.590> my<00:01:54.830> knife<00:01:55.099> i'll<00:01:55.429> run<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.060> along<00:01:56.270> the

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
in with my knife i'll run it along the

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.169 
in with my knife i'll run it along the
bottom<00:01:56.929> about<00:01:57.739> half<00:01:58.099> way<00:01:58.750> turn<00:01:59.750> it<00:01:59.899> around<00:02:00.020> and

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
bottom about half way turn it around and

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.430 
bottom about half way turn it around and
do<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.330> same<00:02:02.599> thing<00:02:02.899> on<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.140> other<00:02:03.170> side

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
do the same thing on the other side

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.979 
do the same thing on the other side
because<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.190> rind<00:02:04.459> we<00:02:04.970> throw<00:02:05.300> away<00:02:05.420> we<00:02:05.750> can't

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:05.989 
because the rind we throw away we can't

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:09.729 
because the rind we throw away we can't
eat<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.220> is<00:02:07.429> all<00:02:07.759> just<00:02:08.660> melon<00:02:09.319> flesh

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
eat that so this is all just melon flesh

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.410 
eat that so this is all just melon flesh
and<00:02:09.979> i'm<00:02:10.069> going<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.369> cut<00:02:10.610> this<00:02:10.819> into<00:02:11.090> some

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
and i'm going to cut this into some

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.180 
and i'm going to cut this into some
chunks<00:02:12.050> because<00:02:12.470> we're<00:02:12.680> going<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:12.860> put<00:02:12.980> that

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
chunks because we're going to put that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.300 
chunks because we're going to put that
in<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.520> food<00:02:13.760> processor<00:02:14.690> now<00:02:15.590> I've<00:02:15.770> cut<00:02:16.099> up

need to get more cut up so now what I'm
going<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:27.950> do<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.280> I'm<00:02:28.430> going<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.610> turn<00:02:28.819> this

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
going to do is I'm going to turn this

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.199 
going to do is I'm going to turn this
into<00:02:29.269> a<00:02:29.540> puree<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.319> in<00:02:30.620> my<00:02:31.129> food<00:02:31.310> processor<00:02:31.370> i'm

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
into a puree so in my food processor i'm

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.229 
into a puree so in my food processor i'm
using<00:02:32.599> my<00:02:32.629> metal<00:02:33.590> blade<00:02:33.920> now<00:02:34.340> if<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.060> don't

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
using my metal blade now if you don't

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.820 
using my metal blade now if you don't
have<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.480> food<00:02:35.720> processor<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:36.650> could

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
have a food processor you could

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.650 
have a food processor you could
certainly<00:02:37.160> use<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.550> blender<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.480> would

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
certainly use a blender and that would

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.869 
certainly use a blender and that would
work<00:02:38.690> too<00:02:39.050> i'm<00:02:39.890> going<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.129> start<00:02:40.430> by<00:02:40.640> putting

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
work too i'm going to start by putting

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.720 
work too i'm going to start by putting
all<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.269> these<00:02:41.629> chunks<00:02:42.319> in<00:02:42.530> then<00:02:43.459> i'm<00:02:43.519> going<00:02:43.640> to

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
all of these chunks in then i'm going to

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.300 
all of these chunks in then i'm going to
put<00:02:43.879> the<00:02:44.030> lid<00:02:44.300> on<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.800> i'm<00:02:45.800> going<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.010> start

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
put the lid on and i'm going to start

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.100 
put the lid on and i'm going to start
this<00:02:46.489> just<00:02:46.760> on<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:46.940> pulse<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:49.629> then<00:02:50.629> once<00:02:50.959> it

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
this just on a pulse and then once it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.930 
this just on a pulse and then once it
grinds<00:02:51.410> up<00:02:51.709> just<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.069> little<00:02:52.250> bit<00:02:52.400> i'm<00:02:52.670> going<00:02:52.849> to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
grinds up just a little bit i'm going to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.030 
grinds up just a little bit i'm going to
hit<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.060> on<00:02:53.300> button<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:54.140> let<00:02:54.469> it<00:02:54.499> puree<00:02:54.859> until

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
hit the on button and let it puree until

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.320 
really left with is this really thick
melon<00:04:21.320> pace<00:04:21.680> so<00:04:22.280> I<00:04:22.310> was<00:04:22.460> able<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.850> use<00:04:22.880> just

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
melon pace so I was able to use just

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.320 
melon pace so I was able to use just
half<00:04:23.720> of<00:04:23.960> a<00:04:24.110> melon<00:04:24.500> today<00:04:24.830> now<00:04:25.580> next<00:04:26.000> we're

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
half of a melon today now next we're

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.270 
half of a melon today now next we're
going<00:04:26.419> to<00:04:26.479> add<00:04:26.540> our<00:04:26.690> sweetness<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:27.710> that's<00:04:27.890> two

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
going to add our sweetness so that's two

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.450 
going to add our sweetness so that's two
thirds<00:04:28.700> of<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:29.000> cup<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.360> sugar<00:04:30.040> now<00:04:31.040> remember

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
thirds of a cup of sugar now remember

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.300 
thirds of a cup of sugar now remember
with<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.820> sorbet<00:04:32.540> it's<00:04:32.900> really<00:04:33.500> important<00:04:34.100> that

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
with a sorbet it's really important that

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.060 
with a sorbet it's really important that
we<00:04:34.820> get<00:04:35.060> that<00:04:35.330> sugar<00:04:35.960> dissolved<00:04:36.620> because<00:04:36.890> this

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
we get that sugar dissolved because this

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.340 
we get that sugar dissolved because this
doesn't<00:04:37.250> get<00:04:37.669> cooked<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.450> if<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.080> sugar

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
doesn't get cooked and if the sugar

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.409 
doesn't get cooked and if the sugar
doesn't<00:04:39.620> dissolve<00:04:40.130> in<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.460> puree<00:04:40.910> then<00:04:41.240> it's

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
doesn't dissolve in the puree then it's

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.300 
doesn't dissolve in the puree then it's
going<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.630> be<00:04:41.810> kind<00:04:41.990> of<00:04:42.110> a<00:04:42.380> gritty<00:04:42.830> sorbet

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
going to be kind of a gritty sorbet

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.219
