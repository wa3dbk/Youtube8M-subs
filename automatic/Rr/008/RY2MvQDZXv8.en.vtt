 for you guys like kicking out of the

 fifa 15 a very efficient kick that 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.410
 usually between 70 and 80% of the time 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.230
 You'll be able to score the goal. 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.399
 good first of all staff 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.870
 I recommend you to meet the team that 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.620
 Are you going to be playing with those? 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.200
 players that you can do this kick 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.820
 need to have a statistic and more or 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.760
 less than 80 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.239
 in the player's statistics 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.100
 long-distance gift Quixote is very 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.289
 easy to do 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.120
 You're controlling the player here. 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.480
 analogue 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.350
 you're going to make room out there 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.820
 out of the half moon between 40 and 30 meters 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.490
 more or less 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.110
 if you're running over there coming from 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.630
 right to left on the run 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.189
 diagonal up the street up to the top 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.759
 You'll be running here runners. 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.500
 tight before kicking 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.070
 op when you have made room for yourselves 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 release both the directional and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.490
 Running are you going on here? 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.710
 if you are going to press the r 1 button 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.340
 that it causes the player to kick 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.909
 placed and will press the kick 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.549
 until more or less two 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.420
 three bars of strength depending on the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.759
 player 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.220
 there is a case of training against 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.450
 machine mainly in easy mode 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.450
 How I doing here in the video is more 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.409
 easy for you to learn the strength of 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.079
 every player did this guys it's not a box 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.759
 There are no people, there's no way 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.619
 Of course online is more difficult to do 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.990
 because it's harder for you to sort 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.020
 this space but then in the end I go 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.110
 leave and some little sips that I did 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.930
 online that is essential and 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.220
 to're winning in my opponents so 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.920
 the people are running here r2 tight 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:27.120
 analog before kicking it's all 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.800
 remember all loose grip r1 and tighten 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.500
 kick until two to three 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.860
 bars of strength 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.780
 and then personal hug is personal box goes 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.680
 that you admit that you use the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.550
 but if you learn to do this, 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.990
 You kick normal, do not do this then. 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.760
 Way you're going to do it 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.340
 there are many people who use that glitch 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.360
 the corridors there running out of 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.680
 even a crazy messi cristiano ronaldo 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.330
 neymar go out and dribble everybody 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.580
 passing through their players 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.630
 does good because they do not make that goal 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.450
 outside the area 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.650

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.370

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.250
 We know he gets well decorated. 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.250
 of the area 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:30.779
 this force of those who are beaten from the outside 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.779
 ah 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.170

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.020
 thanked the goalkeeper can of the gross of 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.120
 defense because it is well-deserved can not 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.320
 make room and hit from outside the area and 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:49.400
 How cool is a singayuda street show necklace ? 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.400

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.629
 the boy would be on the other team, I'm just going 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.629

 the defense continues today and not silva 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:33.530
 to blame is that was the manchester 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.530
 united bayern arrived and hit put 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:50.150

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.150
 of famous respect 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.860
