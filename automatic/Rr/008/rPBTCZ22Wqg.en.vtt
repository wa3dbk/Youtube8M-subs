00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.379
 hello and with you channel game world and 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.960
 in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.440
 optimize windows 8.1 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.350
 well, not the system itself the whole computer necid 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.359
 but precisely through that through this 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.029
 pension system 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.320
 there are three ways but while you I two 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.359
 though 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.380
 I can use all three new ways 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.730
 as if 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.130
 but I donâ€™t really like the third way 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:37.170
 for this we go here click on 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:41.760
 program mouse command line wrong 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:47.059
 such a command line is also not 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:51.530
 you need to hold down the windows + button 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.530
 there is such a command line 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:05.610
 write m configuration and here I do not know about you 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.869
 see here it is with config but also 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.000
 I will write a description 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:15.869
 You can copy it from there 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.700
 but so here we press ok and we 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.280
 run firms as Simcoe radio system 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.820
 this is where the launch takes place but to us 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.320
 Need to load advanced options 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.939
 and 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.590
 and action optional parameters 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.380
 downloads so choose the maximum 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.280
 memory but more precisely put a tick on 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.280
 memory maximum 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.360
 stop oh well here and should 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.450
 stop just tick the number 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.720
 processes number of processors and maximum 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.720
 memory the number of processes has that two 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.750
 You can also change the speed here. 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.590
 the internet 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:12.060
 this is here to press laying and set 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.390
 maximum press ok 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.390
 click apply and there you have to 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.540
 suggest restarting the computer 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.540
 but I do not need it, I have already done everything 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:32.400
 there is also a second way to press it 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:33.890
 here the search and the will of those as nippon 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:44.270
 called 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:46.800
 reef shorter she here she 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.720
 drive optimization is only called but 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.380
 although you can write optimization there 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.980
 drives so called fragment 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.630
 damn something like this and defragmentation and 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.970
 optimization of your disks 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:06.800
 select here it starts 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:09.480
 window and execute this as what we 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.190
 fix or there but all in different ways 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.070
 I do not know the assembly such here, but I already have 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.440
 performed but it seemed to me because 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.370
 I have carried out a lot of things there at the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.290
 I have now installed the program 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.820
 just gonna do a screensaver now on 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:33.239
 video since i hacked already vegas pro 13 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:38.760
 in 64 bit system so the new version 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:42.069
 my vegas pro is good 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.120
 this disk fragmentation is very 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:48.489
 such a slow moment comes he can 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.019
 take all the time 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.709
 depends on the characteristics of your 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.969
 computer 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.900
 if your computer is weak then this 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:04:00.129
 May take 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.569
 maximum day is already clear if you 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.549
 computer is so average 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.849
 it takes it well, the maximum number of hours 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.569
 an hour or two 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:13.359
 like this somewhere if the power on the computer 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.609
 there you have it all quickly becomes well 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.470
 unless of course you have any 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.650
 software is not there they are running and 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.900
 therefore it interferes with the optimization work 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.449
 drives 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.320
 can also choose 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:32.800
 wedge master that is 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.320
 nir loop because oh loop is not because 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.669
 what if master 4 said no 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:45.669
 writes on the phone 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:48.720
 and select the registry and there is something for me 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:54.330
 doesn't come down on you a lot of things are running 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.330
 Now let's wait a little again open 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:07.400
 I just do not eat because there already 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:11.440
 overheated probably 20 times as well, of course 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.440
 Gukov need a dream cottage 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:21.370
 now understand why my optimization is not 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:24.320
 coming because I'm so strong 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.530
 it takes me but just optimization 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.910
 disks and they work both 2 they both 2 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.140
 occupy the system and shorter happens 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.910
 very big fist 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:40.640
 he they even completely processor 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:44.930
 uses won't interfere don't speak 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.790
 the third way I will not succeed well you can 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.100
 use two methods at once 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.700
 very such a good way 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:55.940
 well it is in only one way which 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.960
 you showed it in my opinion like that 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.980
 called 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.360
 but where you can increase the number of processes 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.500
 this 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.720
 and this is all standard is not necessary 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.710
 nothing rock it you have everything and so is 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.530
 on windows7 everything is different there 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.890
 windows 8 is also there a little bit different 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:19.970
 she windows 81 such on me i'm here myself 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:22.220
 all understand how could the more odd to 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.720
 channel and very filmed but at least some 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:29.450
 useful thing and filmed also 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:33.910
 what else is there next video rather 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:36.650
 just for take off how to hack vegas pro 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:39.200
 because most people don't know 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:44.320
 how to do it just hack new 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:51.140
 version of bandicam is my version of 2036 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:53.600
 74 confused at all but it's just like that 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:57.280
 good luck to you all 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.280
 sign up and put huskies
