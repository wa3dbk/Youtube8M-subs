that those influences without something

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.250 
that those influences without something
you<00:00:47.400> set<00:00:47.640> out<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:48.330> or<00:00:48.630> if<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:48.960> sort<00:00:49.170> of

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
you set out to do or if it's sort of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.400 
you set out to do or if it's sort of
sort<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.770> happen<00:00:50.040> grassroots<00:00:50.930> I<00:00:51.930> mean<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.230> vote

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
sort of happen grassroots I mean I vote

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.930 
sort of happen grassroots I mean I vote
I<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.680> both<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.890> those<00:00:53.160> artists<00:00:53.580> very<00:00:53.760> much

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
I like both of those artists very much

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.240 
I like both of those artists very much
so<00:00:54.240> I<00:00:54.270> think<00:00:54.890> naturally<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> kind<00:00:56.160> of

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
so I think naturally a kind of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.950 
so I think naturally a kind of
influences<00:00:57.150> but<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:57.420> at<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.630> same<00:00:57.690> time

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
influences but then at the same time

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.840 
influences but then at the same time
that<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.380> all<00:00:58.470> is<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.920> really<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.550> lot<00:00:59.640> of

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
that we all is like really a lot of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.610 
that we all is like really a lot of
different<00:01:00.120> stuff<00:01:00.150> your<00:01:00.510> boys<00:01:00.720> obviously<00:01:01.530> her

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
different stuff your boys obviously her

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.100 
different stuff your boys obviously her
voice<00:01:01.800> sounds<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> ton<00:01:02.580> like<00:01:02.910> Florence<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
voice sounds a ton like Florence so the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.150 
voice sounds a ton like Florence so the
thing<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.589> don't<00:01:04.770> like<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.070> be

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
thing is that we don't like to be

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.040
