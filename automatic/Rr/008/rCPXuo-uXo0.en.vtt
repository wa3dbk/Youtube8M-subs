club<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:54.500> walls<00:02:55.340> do<00:02:55.610> not<00:02:55.640> have<00:02:56.000> texture

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
club and the walls do not have texture

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.000 
club and the walls do not have texture
so<00:02:56.569> don't<00:02:56.750> get<00:02:56.840> too<00:02:56.900> close<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.350> them<00:02:57.440> but

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
so don't get too close to them but

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.220 
so don't get too close to them but
overall<00:02:58.340> it's<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.730> very<00:02:58.760> very<00:02:59.330> cool<00:02:59.660> look<00:02:59.900> at

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
overall it's a very very cool look at

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.130 
overall it's a very very cool look at
what<00:03:00.650> isn't<00:03:00.920> side<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.730> this<00:03:02.239> area<00:03:02.750> now<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:02.930> don't

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
what isn't side of this area now I don't

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.830 
what isn't side of this area now I don't
know<00:03:03.230> why<00:03:03.410> this<00:03:03.470> has<00:03:03.890> not<00:03:04.069> been<00:03:04.130> used<00:03:04.489> or<00:03:04.840> rocks

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
know why this has not been used or rocks

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.990 
know why this has not been used or rocks
I<00:03:06.170> did<00:03:06.319> not<00:03:06.440> use<00:03:06.650> this<00:03:06.830> texture<00:03:07.250> but<00:03:07.670> there<00:03:07.819> are

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
I did not use this texture but there are

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.809 
I did not use this texture but there are
a<00:03:08.030> lot<00:03:08.299> of<00:03:08.330> areas<00:03:08.840> in<00:03:08.989> GTA<00:03:09.560> 5<00:03:09.799> single<00:03:10.670> player

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
a lot of areas in GTA 5 single player

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.180 
a lot of areas in GTA 5 single player
and<00:03:10.850> in<00:03:11.150> GTA<00:03:11.480> 5<00:03:11.660> online<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.500> aren't<00:03:12.950> being

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
and in GTA 5 online that aren't being

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.590 
and in GTA 5 online that aren't being
used<00:03:13.610> there's<00:03:13.850> textures<00:03:14.180> like<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.420> all

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
used there's textures like this all

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.599 
used there's textures like this all
across<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.230> map<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.590> if<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:16.010> go<00:03:16.160> down<00:03:16.549> I

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
across the map and if you go down I

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.670 
across the map and if you go down I
believe<00:03:17.000> even<00:03:17.390> more<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:18.079> better<00:03:18.260> get<00:03:18.470> into

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
believe even more you better get into

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.130 
believe even more you better get into
the<00:03:18.769> police<00:03:19.040> station<00:03:19.100> or<00:03:19.609> sorry<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.959> guess

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
the police station or sorry the I guess

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.330 
the police station or sorry the I guess
police<00:03:21.500> area<00:03:21.739> where<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:21.950> create<00:03:22.190> your

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
police area where you create your

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.759 
police area where you create your
character<00:03:22.579> at<00:03:22.880> first<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.390> overall<00:03:24.230> there's<00:03:24.680> a

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
character at first and overall there's a

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.620 
character at first and overall there's a
lot<00:03:24.799> of<00:03:25.070> things<00:03:25.310> like<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.850> Bahama<00:03:26.180> mamas<00:03:26.540> is

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
lot of things like the Bahama mamas is

the<00:03:26.720> same<00:03:26.930> way<00:03:27.140> where<00:03:27.350> there's<00:03:27.530> like

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
the same way where there's like

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.949 
the same way where there's like
untextured<00:03:28.459> areas<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.420> i'm<00:03:29.510> not<00:03:29.660> sure<00:03:29.840> why

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
untextured areas and i'm not sure why

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.960 
untextured areas and i'm not sure why
roger<00:03:30.230> has<00:03:30.410> not<00:03:30.530> used<00:03:30.980> them<00:03:31.220> yet<00:03:31.250> hopefully<00:03:31.880> in

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
roger has not used them yet hopefully in

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.670 
roger has not used them yet hopefully in
the<00:03:32.000> near<00:03:32.150> future<00:03:32.209> we<00:03:32.930> might<00:03:33.140> see<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.410> patch

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
the near future we might see a patch

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.930 
the near future we might see a patch
that<00:03:33.709> allows<00:03:34.160> us<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.430> go<00:03:34.579> into<00:03:34.790> these

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
that allows us to go into these

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.849 
that allows us to go into these
untextured<00:03:35.359> areas<00:03:35.780> maybe<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.410> comedy<00:03:36.769> club

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
untextured areas maybe the comedy club

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.740 
untextured areas maybe the comedy club
might<00:03:37.160> open<00:03:37.459> up<00:03:37.549> one<00:03:37.760> day<00:03:37.880> maybe<00:03:38.359> we<00:03:38.570> might

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
might open up one day maybe we might

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.970 
might open up one day maybe we might
have<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:38.989> burger<00:03:39.230> shot<00:03:39.530> that<00:03:39.680> we<00:03:39.739> might<00:03:39.859> be<00:03:39.920> able

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
have a burger shot that we might be able

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.470 
have a burger shot that we might be able
to<00:03:40.100> go<00:03:40.190> into<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.609> up<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:40.820> Adam<00:03:41.090> maybe<00:03:41.209> even

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
to go into and up and Adam maybe even

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.330 
to go into and up and Adam maybe even
open<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.930> Bahama<00:03:42.530> mamas<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:43.070> would<00:03:43.220> be

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
open the Bahama mamas that would be

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.400 
open the Bahama mamas that would be
ideal<00:03:43.519> if<00:03:44.000> Rockstar<00:03:44.600> went<00:03:44.720> ahead<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:44.989> open<00:03:45.350> up

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
ideal if Rockstar went ahead and open up

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.229 
ideal if Rockstar went ahead and open up
all<00:03:45.650> these<00:03:45.890> locations<00:03:46.489> and<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.940> think<00:03:47.150> that

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
all these locations and I think that

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.060 
all these locations and I think that
would<00:03:47.299> be<00:03:47.359> an<00:03:47.540> amazing<00:03:47.870> DLC<00:03:48.620> I<00:03:48.650> think<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:48.920> lot<00:03:48.950> of

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
would be an amazing DLC I think a lot of

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.560 
would be an amazing DLC I think a lot of
you<00:03:49.130> guys<00:03:49.190> would<00:03:49.459> agree<00:03:49.700> with<00:03:49.730> in<00:03:49.910> here<00:03:50.090> where

you guys would agree with in here where

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.690 
you guys would agree with in here where
