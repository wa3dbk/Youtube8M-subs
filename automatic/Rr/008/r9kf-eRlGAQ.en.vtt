00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:16.070
 Today I want to give you a short sony 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:19.160
 Introducing xperia here in the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.070
 version with two sim cards slots that 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.199
 unfortunately is still a sad 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.210
 history at least the German 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.019
 In the market there are far too few duals 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.359
 sim devices 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.199
 although she has a huge advantage 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.059
 but unfortunately this is more likely 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.040
 confined to the Asian space and 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.489
 here only very rarely all devices 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.850
 in terms of the xperia m in the dual 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.649
 version is one of them 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.710
 but that too is more like that 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.930
 middle class model if not even on 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.629
 but entry-level model still offers 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.239
 one way two sim cards too 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.780
 use and also a dual standby too 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.730
 to have 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.039
 that means you can on both cards 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.469
 also be called one of them 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.550
 cards but only for the 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.800
 corresponding data connection used 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.170
 will be which or which should be 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.119
 that will be one can then each 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.619
 can always select the menu with so 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.110
 to assign the card accordingly and 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.130
 can also tell in what style slot 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.840
 then the corresponding card is located 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.920
 But let's have a look at the money 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.319
 very short to the back is relative 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.940
 made for this is such a small soft 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:33.259
 touch can be found on the side and here 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.479
 the housing right side has one 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.830
 the classic xperia button 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.420
 meanwhile the on and off switch 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.580
 man had volume rocker and one has 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.399
 a dedicated camera button otherwise 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.289
 There is a lot to see on top of it ever 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.090
 after how the light falls on it here 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.429
 you can see it is the 3.5 mm 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.709
 jack connection on the other over 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.270
 houses outside is then the 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.039
 micro usb connection 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.009
 There is really nothing on the bottom of the device 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.550
 more only a small possibility around 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.140
 to intervene and mount a loop 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.470
 let's see if we know that in 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.390
 the focus on getting down here 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.569
 would that then the law looks like 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.420
 it would be from a cast or unibody 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.030
 Housing is together that quasi 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.520
 the complete part into the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.530
 is sunk in the back here 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.630
 you can see the backside what you get here 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.240
 looks is the connection for the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.980
 corresponding nfc contact and here 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.319
 then we have that what that 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.360
 device, namely two sim cards 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.370
 Slots and the possibility with a 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.020
 micro sd card still the memory 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.150
 expand 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.610
 that is also necessary at this point 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.610
 because the device itself has hardly any internal 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.870
 memory means we have four here 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.090
 gb flash memory 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.590
 rather that is not the case 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.930
 processor itself is a dual core 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.950
 Processor more we can because of the 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.630
 do not put it out 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.480
 the clock is clocked with a gigahertz 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.610
 the variant m in dual sim design 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.220
 comes with android 4.2 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.950
 ergo itself has 1750 milliamp hours 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.100
 the camera on the back solves with 5 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.870
 megapixel on that makes more bad 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.730
 as a pretty good light like the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.200
 Most cameras are the pictures 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.440
 acceptable because we can not do anything against 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.450
 say you can be nice with touch 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.530
 focus then also choose on what 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.070
 should be focused 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.930
 otherwise she can enjoy videos in 720p 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:29.010
 dissolve and the front camera only does 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.350
 vga network otherwise follows sony what 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.000
 the xperia models matter you have 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.760
 have your own adjustments on it 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.560
 your own surfaces on it 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.709
 Overall, the system works very well 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.420
 nice it works and it has 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.209
 pleasant feeling but it is nunmal 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.810
 just a device with the hardware of 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.019
 yesterday 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.019
 But it is in the dual sim device of therefore 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.299
 it would be absolutely necessary or it 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.640
 I would like to have him here 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.440
 these devices are not set 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.540
 much more why we see here 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.430
 we have two sim cards we can 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.370
 say which should be activated 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.890
 luckily that can be done in the gsm network 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.680
 both enabled by default 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.019
 we can still show the cards 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.549
 what names you want to get with it 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.320
 they are easier to recognize for us 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.390
 and you can choose which one as well 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.690
 card responsible for data transmission 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.880
 is 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.890
 besides, we can say there is one 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.600
 constant accessibility permanent 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.480
 Accessibility means here at the place 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.000
 you can say that one 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.590
 she should not be available for 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.310
 for example because where you are right now 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.170
 is 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.740
 the corresponding network provider no 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.940
 can network has no network availability 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.660
 we will automatically send it to the other card 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.120
 forward otherwise there is absolutely 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.920
 nothing great of others 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.650
 differentiates systems you see 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.580
 nevertheless core processor works that 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.550
 relatively nice here 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.240
 the surface is known that is whole 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.600
 normal 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:00.920
 the sony surface they over it 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.170
 lay down and with it the device works 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.130
 there is a lot that we supplied 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.360
 we already know that from here 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.950
 other xperia models 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.960
 We can go back to the camera 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.430
 watch version or look function 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.680
 they start like the others 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.970
 Models also by a short press 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.050
 on the appropriate camera key and 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.290
 if we are here now 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.760
 We are going there if we are here now 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.190
 you can see the whole look 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:31.990
 you have the possibility of the camera too 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:35.420
 use there is the shadow of the 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.310
 Video camera then already in the way otherwise 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.960
 normal camera functions 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.760
 we have the possibilities here 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.490
 to set different functions 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.780
 gives a hdr function if we have now 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.950
 give it a try 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:53.120
 that means we solve from this 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.740
 keep still and then he builds us a hdr 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.900
 image that he pictures two outside 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.460
 superimposed by the corresponding one 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.410
 get here 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.690
 and then we already have that 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.940
 we want to see you see the touch 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:08.450
 Keys are on screen break is not 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.980
 the bottom of the housing with recessed so so 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.380
 otherwise to the device yet to say 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.480
 the display you see is a 4 inch 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.740
 display the size you do not see 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.110
 but you see that 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.960
 relatively small device is when 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.730
 we now here namely the nexus four 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.010
 Next to it you can see the 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.870
 size difference, we start here 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.420
 sometimes even high then we see that 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.640
 also with activated screen and then 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.330
 we already see the display size 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.510
 differs in any case 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.890
 noticeable 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.720
 This 4 inch display has a resolution 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.630
 from 854x480 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.390
 Pixels are so far away from 720p 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.790
 or even from a full hd resolution 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:51.060
 but the tft-display view is relative 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:54.150
 easy to read solves with 16 8 million 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:58.470
 Colors on has a mineral glass display 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.550
 that should be scratch-resistant and as I said 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.620
 the processor itself is one 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.980
 we still have a look at the qualcomm processor 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.930
 let's just go into the system so we can 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:12.120
 See the software version here too 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:14.460
 you can see android 4.2.2011 us 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.900
 also overcome quite normal in 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.860
 google it like we do it from others 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.750
 know devices 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.790
 if it is set up works 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.370
 that is wonderful and otherwise 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:26.880
 that makes it too that was the xperia 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:29.990
 in the dual I am from awd say thank you for 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.990
 see you and see you next time
