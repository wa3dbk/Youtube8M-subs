00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.059
 hello that as they are is the carlos and 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.850
 let's continue with this maya course 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.459
 in its 2015 version in this chapter 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.860
 let's see how to create a new project 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.840
 how to configure it let's go first 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.130
 that nothing here afai in the part below 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.349
 we have a whole section that 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.509
 project windows or project as if 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.730
 this is not where it says project window and 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.560
 here what we are going to do is locate 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.130
 the files or the different folders 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.690
 that we are going to create by 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.790
 we see that here gives us this 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.310
 address where are we say in the 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.810
 project or project folder that is 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.120
 where we are going to create all 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.080
 the projects that we believe by 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.170
 default will not always give you 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.020
 Maya documents projects what is recommended 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.630
 is that you work with a disk 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.400
 external hard and in such a way that there 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.830
 keep all these folders why 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.540
 reason and this not only in maya in 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.060
 reality in any program that is 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.509
 work in 3d or video editing 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.350
 how can it be premiere pro this sony 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.630
 vegas 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.549
 after effects in any of them 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.030
 always recommended by the amount 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.840
 and the volume of files that we have 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.280
 linear that make a hard drive 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.860
 external in first in second also 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.049
 by anabel for aspects of speed in 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.000
 regarding information and thirdly 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.890
 security in the sense that it does not 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.110
 only backs up but also 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.970
 these files for example here a single 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.009
 project has me creates different 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.930
 folders as we see here we have a 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.270
 amount of folders quite broad 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.700
 let's see we have a lot of folders 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.840
 depending on the nature and in the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.819
 extent of the project we are going to create 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.740
 many folders I can not in a first 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.640
 moment simply delete all of them and 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.420
 stay nothing else 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.830
 let's say with these four the scenes 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.810
 templates images and shorts and more 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.640
 any with these four I could 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.080
 start a project in some in one of 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.520
 they bani the images other the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.520
 templates in other scenes and us 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.930
 this what I know of the images grams and 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.690
 final 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.250
 but well I'm going to create them with all 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.470
 basically to show you how it is that 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.450
 all these folders are created 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.770
 I was commenting on this about security in 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.920
 sense of how good we create 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.110
 all these folders and if for some 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.700
 reason by mistake as you want to 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.170
 moment to copy let's think we want 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.810
 for copying project and copying only 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.180
 some are addressed then 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.070
 all when one let's say when one in 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.740
 a project seeks to direct the 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.170
 others then this may be that then 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.430
 the leagues are broken by the links and 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.930
 simple simple meters will give some 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.190
 error and it will not allow us to open the 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.830
 project that we have already been working 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.930
 with some time then the ideal is 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.840
 From the beginning it's good to work 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.989
 an external hard drive and from there then 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.270
 see us this being managing what 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.070
 now we here have a project 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.580
 let's create a new one here by 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.640
 default 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.230
 the default that they can here again and not 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.380
 ok could you create the first one we are not going to 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.900
 put exercise and a low one our 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.690
 recommendations that in maya as well 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.030
 many 3d editing programs work 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.410
 not only let's say at design level but 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.170
 also to language level 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.780
 code language specifically here 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.060
 what is mail or faith on is handled and 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.890
 some of them let's say generate 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.360
 conflicts the spaces because a 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.100
 space has a value then 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.590
 normally the names have to have 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.810
 they should not have spaces then when 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.790
 you want for example if you exemplify 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.300
 a space you have to put a script under 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.130
 in such a way that there is not that space 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.080
 since we have it then we 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.970
 let's give it to accept again here 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.130
 I'm going to keep the route he gives me 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.870
 fowler as I tell you, I recommend you 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.830
 do it on an external hard drive this 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.510
 as they can do if they WANT 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.310
 direct it create a folder of 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.380
 projects elsewhere go here you 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.000
 click to where this folder is and they will 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.310
 direct here I have it for example 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.710
 May dry the documents in projects of 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.810
 I can change it, I can go 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.360
 here to stop 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.980
 and look for the external hard drive that I 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.450
 have that and let's give cancel let's 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.100
 to leave it at the moment where it is 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.830
 let's say for me you of example by 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.860
 default when it comes out accept and set aside 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.940
 this moment I have a first project 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.830
 you will say good because really not 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.660
 you have done nothing because if what I did 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.740
 was to create the folders where they are going to 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.600
 send everything 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.400
 the images everything I am 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.260
 working here code language everything 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.330
 that I am working is going to 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.580
 those folders and how do you do we're going to 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.290
 go here to maya I'm in documents 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.420
 maya here is projects that here is 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.560
 where I am going to have to remember them I repeat 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.690
 again, the ideal is that what 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.190
 have an external hard drive and here I 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.420
 I have for example the default and I have the 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.460
 Exercise 1 that was the one that ended 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.190
 create me when I believe that exercise 1 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.930
 we see that you created all these folders and 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.990
 in these folders is where we 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.960
 let's find the different scenes and 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.570
 very good movies pictures we have 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.460
 created in the project here if I move 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.780
 any of these folders I can 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.970
 generate or I have the possibility of 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.500
 make a mistake and send me to 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.020
 moment to execute the project of 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.340
 open it errors for lack of address 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.570
 in one of them why is that 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.860
 recommend that it be on a hard drive 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.230
 externally in such a way that they are not 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.240
 moving in the same way I can go and 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.249
 create another project again I'm going 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.009
 here to project windows 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:12.039
 and I can create a new project we are going to 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.199
 put for example the co2 or example 2 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:18.959
 I will give to accept I will leave here I 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.959
 I'm going to erase all these many green 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.320
 and we are going to leave these we are going to give to 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.930
 accept now well let's go let's see 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.930
 that for example me as I believe 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.850
 normally delete here project in 2 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.080
 if I believe in the links for example 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.620
 for those folders when I go 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.580
 creating the new sets or the new ones 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.080
 new folders directories and or 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.160
 you can go assigning in a good name is 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.540
 say I do not have to do it from a 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.530
 principle although it is recommended that 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.700
 be from the beginning in such a way 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.120
 that we have knowledge of the 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.980
 project structure also I can 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.680
 manage the project sets and I'm leaving 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.510
 to go here set on the set what I 'm going to 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.860
 to do is that unlike a project 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.230
 that is , you can have several projects 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.640
 but for example an image is to say a 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.590
 small is part of a video about 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.570
 five seconds I want it for the 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.430
 project 1 that I selected the set here 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.320
 of indicated what is the project that I want 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.480
 and I say set and from that moment 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.170
 this set is going to send the images to me 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.000
 project 2 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.860
 if I for example later I want 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.620
 change it to another set I'm going for example 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.330
 to set 1 the set is already from 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.250
 moment the animations that I do in 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.720
 this is going to go to project 1 ie 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.020
 in this way I will go distributing 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.319
 towards what project I keep 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.060
 there are images that I create here 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:32.550
 I hope it was clear I invite you 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.699
 to keep watching this course and until the 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.699
 next
