00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
series but it's just you know it's

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.380 
series but it's just you know it's
really<00:00:23.130> growing<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.580> me<00:00:23.730> I've<00:00:23.910> been<00:00:24.029> using<00:00:24.240> it

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
really growing on me I've been using it

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.700 
really growing on me I've been using it
a<00:00:24.449> lot<00:00:24.660> lately<00:00:24.810> as<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.140> can<00:00:25.260> see<00:00:25.410> we're<00:00:25.590> using

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
a lot lately as you can see we're using

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.070 
a lot lately as you can see we're using
the<00:00:25.890> F<00:00:25.980> ad<00:00:26.310> here<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.029> honestly<00:00:27.539> think<00:00:27.840> that

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the F ad here and I honestly think that

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.650 
the F ad here and I honestly think that
it's<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.680> most<00:00:28.859> underrated<00:00:29.609> gun<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> game

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
it's the most underrated gun in the game

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.540 
it's the most underrated gun in the game
like<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.990> never<00:00:31.260> really<00:00:31.679> see<00:00:31.859> anybody<00:00:32.130> using

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
like I never really see anybody using

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.790 
like I never really see anybody using
this<00:00:32.640> thing<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.480> an<00:00:33.630> absolute<00:00:34.350> monster

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
this thing but it's an absolute monster

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.729 
this thing but it's an absolute monster
if<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.910> use<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.510> right<00:00:36.899> maps<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.559> in

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
if you use it on the right maps and in

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.100 
if you use it on the right maps and in
the<00:00:37.920> right<00:00:38.100> situations<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.149> let's<00:00:39.780> get<00:00:39.930> into

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
the right situations so let's get into

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.580 
the right situations so let's get into
this<00:00:40.230> now

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
this now

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.920 
this now
why<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.430> weapon<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.059> good<00:00:42.360> where<00:00:42.629> does<00:00:42.809> it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
why is this weapon so good where does it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.840 
why is this weapon so good where does it
stand<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:43.290> well<00:00:43.770> first<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.250> foremost<00:00:44.309> it's

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
stand out well first and foremost it's

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.000 
stand out well first and foremost it's
got<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> fastest<00:00:45.809> fire<00:00:46.020> rate<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
got the fastest fire rate of all the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.619 
got the fastest fire rate of all the
assault<00:00:47.280> rifles<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.059> fire<00:00:48.329> rate<00:00:48.600> is

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
assault rifles and that fire rate is

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.860 
assault rifles and that fire rate is
even<00:00:49.110> faster<00:00:49.680> than<00:00:50.100> most<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.940> smg's<00:00:51.570> it's

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
even faster than most of the smg's it's

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.630 
even faster than most of the smg's it's
quicker<00:00:52.140> than<00:00:52.350> half<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.710> them<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.489> know

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
quicker than half of them so you know

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.220 
quicker than half of them so you know
obviously<00:00:54.090> that's<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.360> pretty<00:00:54.570> big<00:00:54.780> deal<00:00:54.989> and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
obviously that's a pretty big deal and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.990 
obviously that's a pretty big deal and
it<00:00:55.530> kind<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.800> turns<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.190> into<00:00:56.309> almost<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.879> an

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
it kind of turns it into almost like an

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.630 
it kind of turns it into almost like an
assault<00:00:57.300> rifle<00:00:57.420> SMG<00:00:57.809> hybrid<00:00:58.800> weapon<00:00:59.190> that

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
assault rifle SMG hybrid weapon that

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.240 
assault rifle SMG hybrid weapon that
absolutely<00:01:00.239> destroys<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.590> close<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.949> medium

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
absolutely destroys at close to medium

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.789 
absolutely destroys at close to medium
range<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.940> then<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.420> top<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.589> an

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
range and then on top of that it's an

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.649 
range and then on top of that it's an
assault<00:01:05.189> rifle<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.880> has<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.270> assault

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
assault rifle so it has like assault

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.020 
assault rifle so it has like assault
rifle<00:01:07.140> range<00:01:07.500> properties<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.549> damage

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
rifle range properties so it's damage

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.840 
rifle range properties so it's damage
doesn't<00:01:09.689> drop<00:01:10.110> off<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.619> quickly<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.310> an<00:01:11.490> SMG

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
doesn't drop off as quickly as an SMG

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.780 
doesn't drop off as quickly as an SMG
damage<00:01:12.450> does<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:14.100> paired<00:01:14.610> with

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
damage does so you know that paired with

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.730 
damage does so you know that paired with
the<00:01:14.909> fact<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.420> fires<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.930> quickly<00:01:16.350> it's

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the fact that it fires so quickly it's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.670 
the fact that it fires so quickly it's
literally<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:18.030> competes<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.630> smg's<00:01:19.409> up

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
literally like it competes with smg's up

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.800 
literally like it competes with smg's up
close<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.250> super<00:01:20.520> close<00:01:20.700> range<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.509> then<00:01:21.689> it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
close it's super close range but then it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.620 
close it's super close range but then it
outperforms<00:01:22.560> SMGs<00:01:23.189> at<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.880> medium<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.420> longer

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
outperforms SMGs at the medium to longer

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.390 
outperforms SMGs at the medium to longer
distances<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.680> compete<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.009> some<00:01:26.310> of

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
distances and can compete with some of

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.980 
distances and can compete with some of
the<00:01:26.460> assault<00:01:26.759> rifles<00:01:27.090> at<00:01:27.180> those<00:01:27.330> distances<00:01:27.720> so

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the assault rifles at those distances so

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.630 
the assault rifles at those distances so
it's<00:01:28.110> kind<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.829> jack-of-all-trades

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
it's kind of like a a jack-of-all-trades

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.080 
it's kind of like a a jack-of-all-trades
gun<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.840> sense<00:01:31.140> now<00:01:31.409> Avett<00:01:31.979> being<00:01:32.189> said<00:01:32.460> it's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
gun in a sense now Avett being said it's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.450 
gun in a sense now Avett being said it's
not<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> god-like<00:01:33.869> weapon<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.920> does<00:01:35.159> have

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
not a god-like weapon like it does have

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.670 
not a god-like weapon like it does have
its<00:01:35.640> faults<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> biggest<00:01:36.750> fault<00:01:37.170> would

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
its faults the biggest fault would

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.830 
its faults the biggest fault would
probably<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.759> its<00:01:39.000> damage<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.720> least

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
probably have to be its damage at least

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.510 
probably have to be its damage at least
when<00:01:40.079> you're<00:01:40.140> comparing<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.710> other<00:01:40.799> ARS

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
when you're comparing it to other ARS

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
when you're comparing it to other ARS
because<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.659> weaker<00:01:43.020> assault

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
because it is one of the weaker assault

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.800 
because it is one of the weaker assault
rifles<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.100> game<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:44.790> up<00:01:45.149> close<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
rifles in the game you know up close it

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.149 
rifles in the game you know up close it
doesn't<00:01:46.110> even<00:01:46.170> compare<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
doesn't even compare to like the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.889 
doesn't even compare to like the
Remington<00:01:47.670> or<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> ak-12<00:01:48.270> or<00:01:48.600> something<00:01:48.840> like

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
Remington or the ak-12 or something like

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.319 
Remington or the ak-12 or something like
that<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.380> also<00:01:49.560> its<00:01:50.340> damage<00:01:50.850> starts<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
that and then also its damage starts to

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.330 
that and then also its damage starts to
drop<00:01:51.600> off<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> little<00:01:52.170> bit<00:01:52.350> quicker<00:01:52.619> than<00:01:52.920> most

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
drop off a little bit quicker than most

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.520 
drop off a little bit quicker than most
of<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.610> other<00:01:53.790> ARS<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:55.140> when<00:01:55.409> you're

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
of the other ARS so you know when you're

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.069 
of the other ARS so you know when you're
in<00:01:55.560> those<00:01:56.009> longer<00:01:56.729> range<00:01:56.969> gunfights<00:01:57.329> if<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
in those longer range gunfights if the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.630 
in those longer range gunfights if the
other<00:01:58.259> guy<00:01:58.439> has<00:01:58.710> ne'er<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.219> he's<00:01:59.310> got<00:01:59.460> Dee's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
other guy has ne'er and he's got Dee's

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.609 
other guy has ne'er and he's got Dee's
name<00:01:59.909> usually<00:02:00.630> you're<00:02:00.750> gonna<00:02:00.840> lose<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
name usually you're gonna lose with the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.050 
name usually you're gonna lose with the
F<00:02:01.740> ad<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.340> thing<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.700> more<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
F ad this thing is more of a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.209 
F ad this thing is more of a
jack-of-all-trades<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:04.110> really<00:02:04.469> excels<00:02:04.860> in

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
jack-of-all-trades it really excels in

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.370 
jack-of-all-trades it really excels in
those<00:02:05.610> close<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:05.969> medium<00:02:06.299> gunfights<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.229> I

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
those close to medium gunfights like I

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.230 
those close to medium gunfights like I
said<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:07.890> yeah<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.580> thing<00:02:08.759> is

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
said so yeah this thing is

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.600 
said so yeah this thing is
it's<00:02:09.570> absolutely<00:02:10.290> beast<00:02:10.680> when<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.040> use<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.430> in

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
it's absolutely beast when you use it in

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.100 
it's absolutely beast when you use it in
the<00:02:11.640> right<00:02:11.940> scenarios<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.540> know<00:02:12.630> maps<00:02:12.900> like

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the right scenarios you know maps like

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.920 
the right scenarios you know maps like
strike<00:02:13.530> zone<00:02:13.830> great<00:02:14.250> sovereign<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:15.240> trimmer

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
strike zone great sovereign a trimmer

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.810 
strike zone great sovereign a trimmer
you<00:02:16.320> know<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.920> one<00:02:17.070> right<00:02:17.160> here<00:02:17.370> war<00:02:17.610> hawk

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
you know this one right here war hawk

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.210 
you know this one right here war hawk
the<00:02:18.240> ones<00:02:18.510> were<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:19.230> kind<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.620> mix<00:02:19.980> to

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
the ones were it's kind of a mix to

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.890 
the ones were it's kind of a mix to
where<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.670> can't<00:02:20.970> have<00:02:21.180> those<00:02:21.360> medium<00:02:21.750> to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
where you can't have those medium to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.570 
where you can't have those medium to
longer<00:02:22.110> range<00:02:22.440> fights<00:02:22.770> but<00:02:23.160> then<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.370> also

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
longer range fights but then you also

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.010 
longer range fights but then you also
have<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.850> lot<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.180> close-range<00:02:24.870> engagements

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
have a lot of close-range engagements

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.160 
have a lot of close-range engagements
those<00:02:26.010> maps<00:02:26.430> are<00:02:26.610> where<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.330> thing<00:02:27.630> excels

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
those maps are where this thing excels

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.020 
those maps are where this thing excels
and<00:02:28.440> nothing<00:02:28.920> can<00:02:29.130> really<00:02:29.340> compete<00:02:29.760> with<00:02:29.940> it

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
and nothing can really compete with it

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.060 
and nothing can really compete with it
because<00:02:30.270> again<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.870> know<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.380> can<00:02:31.590> beat<00:02:31.830> out<00:02:32.010> a

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
because again you know it can beat out a

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.790 
because again you know it can beat out a
lot<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.640> smg's<00:02:33.210> up<00:02:33.450> really<00:02:33.780> close<00:02:34.050> but<00:02:34.530> then<00:02:34.680> it

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
lot of smg's up really close but then it

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.340 
lot of smg's up really close but then it
can<00:02:34.950> also<00:02:35.540> absolutely<00:02:36.540> destroy<00:02:36.990> them<00:02:37.230> at

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
can also absolutely destroy them at

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.080 
can also absolutely destroy them at
medium<00:02:37.680> range<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.130> compete<00:02:38.760> with<00:02:38.880> some<00:02:39.060> of

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
medium range and compete with some of

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.030 
medium range and compete with some of
the<00:02:39.210> ARS<00:02:39.720> at<00:02:39.840> medium<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.260> long<00:02:40.380> range<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.860> it's

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
the ARS at medium to long range so it's

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.020 
the ARS at medium to long range so it's
a<00:02:41.190> it's<00:02:41.460> kind<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.730> jack-of-all-trades

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
a it's kind of a jack-of-all-trades

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.690 
a it's kind of a jack-of-all-trades
weapon<00:02:42.690> it's<00:02:42.840> pretty<00:02:43.050> good<00:02:43.230> now<00:02:43.410> as<00:02:44.250> for<00:02:44.580> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
weapon it's pretty good now as for the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.040 
weapon it's pretty good now as for the
class<00:02:44.940> setup<00:02:45.210> that<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.480> like<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.720> use<00:02:45.810> with<00:02:45.930> this

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
class setup that I like to use with this

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.550 
class setup that I like to use with this
thing

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560

fan of recoil which nobody really is I
would<00:03:03.060> not<00:03:03.330> suggest<00:03:03.720> running<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.410> suppressor

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
would not suggest running a suppressor

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.260 
would not suggest running a suppressor
on<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.160> thing<00:03:05.370> maybe<00:03:05.700> if<00:03:05.910> you're<00:03:06.060> playing

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
on this thing maybe if you're playing

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.120 
on this thing maybe if you're playing
search-and-destroy<00:03:06.720> but<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:07.860> it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
search-and-destroy but it just it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.770 
search-and-destroy but it just it
absolutely<00:03:08.580> destroys<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.210> weapon<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.720> it

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
absolutely destroys the weapon and it

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.060 
absolutely destroys the weapon and it
makes<00:03:09.960> it<00:03:10.080> way<00:03:10.260> too<00:03:10.320> weak<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:10.890> don't

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
makes it way too weak so I don't

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.130 
makes it way too weak so I don't
recommend<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.460> as<00:03:12.060> for<00:03:12.420> Perks<00:03:12.630> you've<00:03:12.930> got<00:03:13.110> a
