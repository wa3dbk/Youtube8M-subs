00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 my ladies and gentlemen see them now 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.440
 a new episode of iaa audi news it 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.360
 sincerely welcome stefan gÃ¶dde 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.540
 welcome here on the iaa in frankfurt 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.010
 to a new edition of audi news like 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.740
 Maybe you know we are looking for you 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.050
 the many innovations of audi always 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.400
 an exciting highlight from us 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.529
 very interested 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.980
 this issue is all about 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.109
 the audi matrix led spotlight as well 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.510
 you come in the new a8 used 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.309
 surely you know that you drive 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.960
 in the evening on a country road and her 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.270
 eyes have already attached to the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.860
 darkness comes used to it all at once 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.920
 Give them another vehicle 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.039
 whose driver forgets to diminish them 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.570
 instinctively look to the side of such 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.520
 Situations quickly end in the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.020
 ditch and that's why 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.000
 the light developers are audi 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.500
 thought made how to do such 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.309
 situations can prevent 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.570
 out came the audi matrix 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.120
 LED headlights this clever light 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.430
 ensures not only exemplary 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.100
 brightness but protects others 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.630
 road user blind 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.450
 automatically controlled activate the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.100
 headlights the high beam 50 single 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.409
 diodes provide the electronic 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.780
 controlled matrix light for a always 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.340
 well lit street without the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.619
 to dazzle against traffic 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.110
 unlike mechanical systems 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.330
 With automatic high beam the audi dazzle 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.409
 matrix led spotlight not only 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.390
 just from no 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.250
 Here are all the light-emitting diodes 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.860
 individually controlled and only those 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.329
 turned off the preceding or 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.930
 dazzle oncoming vehicles 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.030
 can 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.100
 the rest of the lane area in particular 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.049
 also between two vehicles 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.119
 still lit with high beam 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.549
 this absolute world novelty comes 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.899
 for the first time in the new a8 for use 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.270
 they are probably wondering now 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.310
 where this matrix spotlight because 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.259
 know which areas illuminate 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.909
 and what he should save out of it 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.780
 Let's have a look at a model 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.330
 in detail 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.850
 behind the front loader of the headlamp 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.920
 are the 25 for television 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.140
 competent light-emitting diodes 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.539
 Navigation device registers whether the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.520
 vehicle inside or outside one 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.860
 located in a closed village and 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.200
 gives this information to the matrix 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.230
 light system continues one in the interior mirror 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.910
 foot built-in camera registered 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.170
 driving ahead and oncoming 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.780
 vehicles and transmits them 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.370
 Information to the lighting system optional 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.010
 can install a thermal imaging camera 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.739
 become pedestrians and wildlife 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.780
 Recognizes pedestrians in the danger area 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.870
 The vehicle will be from the light system 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.110
 three times precisely with a led segment 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.640
 Illuminated this spotlight is on 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.370
 new milestone in terms of safety 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.100
 so audi has once again proved how 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.110
 great is the advantage of technology 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.400
 Thank you for your interest. I would 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.250
 Looking forward to see you next time 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:01.229
 be back with it
