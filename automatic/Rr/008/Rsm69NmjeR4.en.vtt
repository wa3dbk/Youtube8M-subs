at<00:01:28.320> lean<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:29.340> leaning<00:01:29.820> past<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.659> a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
at lean like leaning past like it as a

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.550 
at lean like leaning past like it as a
bad<00:01:30.900> example<00:01:33.079> then<00:01:34.079> we're<00:01:34.200> sorting<00:01:34.500> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
bad example then we're sorting that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.260 
bad example then we're sorting that
building<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.280> bit<00:01:35.490> cautious<00:01:35.729> because

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
building there is a bit cautious because

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.580
