 Superstation condition brought us 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.529
 to reach the maximum limit already 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.800
 however allowed by law 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.750
 you can also listen to it online on the radio 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.370

 exactly with the exact same 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.519
 radio number music programming 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.920
 one 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.920
 this also happens on radio number one 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.230

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.010
 who knows maybe one day we will also have a 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.109
 channel totally dedicated to 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.800
 technology just to bore us talking 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.239
 of microchips 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.719
 let's talk about an interesting product myself 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.800
 I would immediately francesco close to me for 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:09.409
 already show you the box nokia lumia 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.620
 925 opens immediately because this 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.620
 box 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.160
 let's say it contains a product that 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.570
 perhaps the best in the history of lumia 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.020
 they supported for a moment to see that 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.700
 what's inside the long piripacchio 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.740
 also called pistoli that all home ho 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.600
 also called that romoli which serves as a 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.080
 open the sim 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:35.060
 then inside the cable with micro usb the 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.440
 always very stylish and charger 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.230
 then the earphones that are included 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.800
 he obviously always forgets that 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:49.400
 there is this extraordinary set of 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.980
 instructions regarding the 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.230
 phone without which obviously the 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.830
 world would change 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:01.190
 so what can we say about nokia 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.250
 lumia 925 meanwhile there are some 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.380
 novelties like the nokia glance you have seen 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.250
 what I just did that is this 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.230
 this screen that in stand by b from la 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.239
 telephone condition time la 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.129
 battery condition and also in the 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:21.140
 if there is a ringtone deactivated 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:23.330
 that you have chosen to remain 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.720
 silent tapping 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.000
 in this way you have practically the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.840
 ability to unlock the screen is of 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.580
 see this 4.5-inch display 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.740
 amoled with the most emotion hd technology 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.540
 plus there are acronyms that make you 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:48.290
 go crazy with this kind of products 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.270
 and above all with the new appearance 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.830
 look at this is really a product 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.280
 very nice aesthetically but let's go for 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.940
 order 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.540
 upper part with the attachment for le 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.900
 3 mm headphones and half micro usb and then 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:07.400
 entry for the sim in the part 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.920
 side a completely clean side 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.540
 also the lower part you see 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.690
 extremely clean really very much 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.700
 beautiful from the impact point of view 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.530
 this product on the side 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.200
 you have the power button to 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.260
 camera the power button of the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.450
 phone and then the infamous fools a 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:35.570
 rocker volume control on the back 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:37.280
 the phone is talking and these 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.780
 they are attacks I can talk about 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.630
 long because you have to apply in 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.900
 practice an additional cover which you then need 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:49.610
 for wireless charging and the camera 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.700
 8.7 megapixel plus and view with a yield 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.070
 really impressive photo and here 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.050
 there are signs of the fact that he has it yesterday 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.010
 put high by the pockets but they are not 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.879
 final signs 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.530
 they are only signs of the color of the 3 of the 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.959
 jeans for the screen 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.989
 nokia glance we said that gives the 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.819
 possibility to unlock yours 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.939
 phone with a double tap on the screen 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.780
 then with the vertical slide as in the 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:20.699
 you can usually do whatever you want 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.610
 on board the phone, wait for these 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.260
 the metro tiles interface typical of 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.930
 windows phone 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.840
 inside the application menu a 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:35.340
 which we are now used to robots too 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.850
 francesco to defeat all the others 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.280
 reflections of this study then 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.010
 what are the main features 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.610
 of the phone one of these surely is 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.610
 smart camera is that allows you to do 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.090
 a billion photos in practice and 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.150
 then subsequently choose which one 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.490
 of the photographs you want to keep what is 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.900
 best this applies especially to the 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:07.020
 moving photos or even to generate 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.520
 this kind of effect later 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.030
 you can also deal with a series of 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.220
 photographs perfect in practice 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.830
 the best image by taking all the 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:21.030
 faces with open eyes or if there is 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.729
 some pistols entering your set 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.800
 photographic and ruin your photography 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.090
 you can take it and delete it not 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.280
 you can erase it from the earth 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.550
 definitely but at least from 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.950
 your 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.200
 photography here is this then I am not there 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.910
 sees the smart cameras now being shown 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.190
 but there is another important thing you see 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.790
 once you have taken your 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.440
 photography 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.270
 there is a whole series of filters that 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.630
 filters can be called 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.280
 which can be applied to 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.050
 camera or a series of 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.710
 third party extensions for 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:56.470
 shares 9 the visa I for example or 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:59.170
 twitter or this goes to the clans that is one 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.820
 very pretty thing a little difficult to 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.350
 use but this is the application 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.830
 funny if you want to take a picture 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.380
 shot a video and upload to 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.940
 server the server automatically takes 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.160
 the photos of all those who are in the 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.350
 your surroundings and creates a kind of 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.130
 filmed by putting together the various 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:21.690
 photographs on very very nice systems 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:24.580
 but the fundamental thing about this 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.440
 phone is you will not understand it 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.790
 now 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.010
 not because you are not able but 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:34.060
 because we do n't have a level 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:36.250
 sufficient low light 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.100
 you can't really understand the level 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:43.030
 quality with which they are taken 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:45.850
 look at photos from this phone 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.200
 surrender as captured in 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.390
 difficult to see perhaps from 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.840
 camcorder tried how to say captured 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:55.300
 even the detail of the 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.640
 ginning of the box in the moment 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.790
 where the photograph is taken ho 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:04.120
 posted yesterday on twitter of the examples 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:07.600
 really remarkable photographs for what 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.120
 regards this nokia lumia to 925 that 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.860
 then see from the point of view also 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.650
 aesthetic is really really really 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:18.040
 aluminum is finally very pleasant 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:20.440
 finally a very thin format for 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.060
 the phone is really a product from 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.930
 aesthetic point of view according to me is 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.200
 very beautifull 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:28.870
 arrives on June 14th then between 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:32.410
 very little at 599 euros 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.910
 these are just a preview of what 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.340
 this phone can do then 

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.520
 next days we will also start with the 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:42.070
 nokia lumia 925 enter more into the 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:44.860
 detail but at first glance I assure you 

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:47.560
 which is really a wonderful product then 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:50.320
 we know that windows phone maybe is not 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:53.140
 still at the level of other products 

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.370
 regarding the availability of 

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.290
 applications 

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.960
 however we say that it is growing a lot since 

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:01.120
 own hardware point of view and this 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.190
 is a very competitive product in the 

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.260
 in the next few days we will enter the theme again 

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.150
 if you want we also discuss it via 

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:12.450
 twitter my account and luca viscardi 

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:12.450
 or on the blog www.masterviaggi.it
