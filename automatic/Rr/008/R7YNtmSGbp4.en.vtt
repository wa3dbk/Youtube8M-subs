00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.010
 I'll show you how to do yours 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.660
 nail polish with the lion the top coat 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.509
 to fight something 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.029
 I first painted the nails red 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.610
 and then I take the first one over 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.440
 with a smokie effect and wear 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:37.559
 directly on the color is important 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.899
 that the nail polish you down 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.840
 drunter has applied correctly 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.910
 dried and then really the top 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.880
 coat completely over the paint number 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.890
 give it over and how to sow seeds 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.350
 just really a smoky effect 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.960
 it gets a bit darker in the pages 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.460
 the middle stays a little brighter so the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.350
 effect comes even more to the validity 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.350
 if you are almost dry right now 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.460
 It is important that you really up to the 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.270
 completely correct color pages 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.270
 fills 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.650
 You can do that more 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.100
 bit the more you influence of 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.110
 the overpainting becomes darker and darker 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.140
 the less one carries on our hand 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.700
 the paint stays and you can go down to 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.030
 example also in the pages 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.750
 A little more will apply the effect 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.390
 even more amplified even if you 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.980
 has applied a lot that is 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.010
 no problem just take care of that 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.869
 brush over it again and go 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:57.240
 excess was again with 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:59.280
 Slimming as you can see has the top coat 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.619
 a really nice effect on the red 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.830
 conjured that works well with 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.660
 every other driver around the look yet 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.490
 I still give something exciting 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.200
 a second overpaint on the 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:16.440
 ring finger on this one has 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.940
 fancy confetti effect like her 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.800
 you can see with this top shortly 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.680
 Really great effects in yours 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.570
 design, there are no limits 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.220
 the one hand we have finished now and 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:31.470
 on the other hand, I'll show you yet 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.410
 two more top codes first namely 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.769
 the milk top coat and wear over it 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.769
 red on 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.430
 As you can see, the effect is here 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.560
 not quite as extreme as the smokie but 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.560
 The varnish will be really milky 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.960
 depending on where you have the paint exactly 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.540
 you can really do such a thing 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.650
 easy to achieve turning technique by 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.840
 you might be at the top 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.670
 a bit more orders than an approach 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.380
 the nail but also gives me the 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.860
 effect not quite yet i still give 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.620
 additionally the lurex top coat over it 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.480
 that's just fine 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:31.120
 Particles that I over the needle point 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:33.070
 As you can see, you can join us 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.080
 colorful nail polishes and the top codes 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.980
 really let off steam creatively 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.980
 have lots of fun with it
