00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
originally gave the N 94 1 out of 5 but

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.370 
originally gave the N 94 1 out of 5 but
I<00:01:50.880> regretted<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.420> follow-up<00:01:51.780> review<00:01:51.959> to<00:01:52.259> give

I regretted a follow-up review to give

I regretted a follow-up review to give
it<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> 4<00:01:52.709> to<00:01:52.800> 5<00:01:52.830> and<00:01:53.250> even<00:01:53.459> now<00:01:53.550> I<00:01:53.580> think<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.879> a

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
it a 4 to 5 and even now I think it's a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
5 and 5 but I digress what stands out

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.889 
5 and 5 but I digress what stands out
most<00:01:56.340> about<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.819> m4<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.179> that<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:57.420> jams<00:01:57.629> very

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
most about the m4 is that it jams very

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.020 
most about the m4 is that it jams very
easily<00:01:58.140> fire<00:01:58.979> too<00:01:59.160> fast<00:01:59.399> with<00:01:59.580> any<00:01:59.759> burst

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
easily fire too fast with any burst

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.550 
easily fire too fast with any burst
gonna<00:02:00.300> benefit<00:02:00.690> 3<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.259> will<00:02:01.379> end<00:02:01.500> up

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
gonna benefit 3 and you will end up

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.529 
gonna benefit 3 and you will end up
having<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.950> jam<00:02:02.160> on<00:02:02.340> some<00:02:02.759> guns<00:02:03.300> are<00:02:03.450> more

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
having it jam on some guns are more

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.719 
having it jam on some guns are more
forgiving<00:02:04.020> than<00:02:04.110> others<00:02:04.349> like<00:02:04.379> the<00:02:04.739> an-94<00:02:05.429> but

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
forgiving than others like the an-94 but

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.550 
forgiving than others like the an-94 but
the<00:02:05.849> m4<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.149> incredibly<00:02:06.899> bad<00:02:07.080> when<00:02:07.319> it<00:02:07.410> comes

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the m4 is incredibly bad when it comes

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.619 
the m4 is incredibly bad when it comes
to<00:02:07.679> jamming<00:02:08.009> mid<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> long<00:02:09.179> range<00:02:09.420> with<00:02:09.569> a

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
to jamming mid to long range with a

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.210 
to jamming mid to long range with a
heavy<00:02:09.780> barrel<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.289> m4<00:02:10.590> performs<00:02:10.979> really<00:02:11.129> well

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
heavy barrel the m4 performs really well

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.070 
heavy barrel the m4 performs really well
it<00:02:11.940> has<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> quick<00:02:12.360> reload<00:02:12.629> time<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
it has a quick reload time and the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.350 
it has a quick reload time and the
recoil<00:02:13.349> is<00:02:13.500> manageable<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.430> slow<00:02:14.730> measured

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
recoil is manageable so slow measured

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.210 
recoil is manageable so slow measured
high<00:02:15.629> accuracy<00:02:16.140> shots<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:16.590> really<00:02:16.980> what<00:02:17.129> you

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
high accuracy shots is really what you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.069 
high accuracy shots is really what you
want<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.489> do<00:02:17.640> then<00:02:18.359> what<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.569> start<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.840> rush

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
want to do then what you start to rush

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.929 
want to do then what you start to rush
your<00:02:19.200> shots<00:02:19.439> say<00:02:19.769> like<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:19.980> close<00:02:20.250> range<00:02:20.489> target

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
your shots say like a close range target

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.520 
your shots say like a close range target
then<00:02:21.510> you'll<00:02:21.599> find<00:02:21.870> yourself<00:02:22.200> wishing<00:02:22.349> you

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
then you'll find yourself wishing you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.020 
then you'll find yourself wishing you
had<00:02:22.650> use<00:02:22.799> that<00:02:23.010> guard<00:02:23.189> done<00:02:23.340> instead

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
had use that guard done instead

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.670 
had use that guard done instead
maybe<00:02:24.210> slower<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.840> less<00:02:25.080> powerful<00:02:25.350> but<00:02:25.590> at

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
maybe slower and less powerful but at

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.740 
maybe slower and less powerful but at
least<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.920> won't<00:02:26.010> jam<00:02:26.310> on<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.580> all-in-all<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
least it won't jam on you all-in-all the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.690 
least it won't jam on you all-in-all the
m4<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.290> any<00:02:28.530> other<00:02:28.620> burst<00:02:28.980> gun<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:29.580> a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
m4 is like any other burst gun just a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.670 
m4 is like any other burst gun just a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
lot less forgiving personally I don't

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.230 
lot less forgiving personally I don't
see<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.190> point<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.460> using<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.850> at<00:02:32.940> all<00:02:33.030> when

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
see the point in using it at all when

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.150 
see the point in using it at all when
you<00:02:33.330> can<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:33.570> use<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.870> m4a1<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.710> burst<00:02:34.920> that

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
you can just use the m4a1 and burst that

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.010 
you can just use the m4a1 and burst that
but<00:02:35.760> never<00:02:35.940> have<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.210> worry<00:02:36.360> about<00:02:36.450> jamming<00:02:36.930> on

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
but never have to worry about jamming on

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.650 
but never have to worry about jamming on
you<00:02:37.140> I'm<00:02:37.950> gonna<00:02:38.160> give<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.430> m4<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:39.000> 3<00:02:39.330> out<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.480> 5

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
you I'm gonna give the m4 a 3 out of 5
