00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.209
 something that simply encompasses everything the hair starts 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.910
 and started the fair to start 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.270
 and good percent once it was cut and nod two steps to follow 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.870
 They are simple 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.710
 the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.820
 the fusion kamelamos 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.970
 to light 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.830
 of what once we have changed this we have merged 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.430
 let's rush the key combination 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.430
 control there was little evil more punk

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.710
 let's go up the saturation a bit 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.100
 they leave it 60 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.100
 novartis 55ta they see 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.120
 I should leave the luminosity 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.120
 and now what we're going to do next is purple 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.940
 this indicator here 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.980
 what input in this case is indicating the tone 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.370
 of color 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.370
 pil that we p 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.520
 what to define 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.230
 so burned the resource we can not get different shades 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 in this case the color for the hair 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.170
 I'm going to stop one and another before for example 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.320
 the red 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.980
 proof of what there is 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.180
 what I'm going to do for example jk can see that there are several 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.450
 imperfections 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.730
 this can be easily fixed beder herrera mask and cape and with a brush 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.059
 more or less so 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:18.989
 size of 325 ticket to lose image you have to adopt to whom 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.889
 the hardness of 0% 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.479
 pil tan 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.479
 mazzone of success with the board of the brush 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:30.679
 what should the tips do 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.549
 the tips and some parts of the roots 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.609
 and she would basically be done this 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.579
 of ponce will do the odd thing more for example psoe has doubled that 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:45.939
 stage now 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.379
 perfect the stage today the congressman a structural strike is not 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.679
 something strong 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:57.489
