number one slot is not something that

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.959 
number one slot is not something that
belongs<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.200> someone<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.980> know<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.190> come<00:00:11.790> to

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
belongs to someone you know you come to

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.030 
belongs to someone you know you come to
that<00:00:12.120> position<00:00:12.330> because<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.500> consistent

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
that position because of the consistent

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.530 
that position because of the consistent
cricket<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.700> played<00:00:15.269> over<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
cricket that you have played over a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.210 
cricket that you have played over a
period<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.990> time<00:00:16.170> maybe<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.830> half<00:00:16.859> two

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
period of time maybe one and a half two

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.160 
period of time maybe one and a half two
years<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.730> at<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.510> same<00:00:18.690> time<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:19.109> know

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
years and at the same time you know

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.620 
years and at the same time you know
there<00:00:19.320> others<00:00:19.619> who<00:00:19.800> are<00:00:19.890> pushing<00:00:20.070> their<00:00:21.029> side

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
there others who are pushing their side

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.439 
there others who are pushing their side
who's<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> number<00:00:22.199> one<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.560> know<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.330> to<00:00:24.330> get

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
who's the number one you know to to get

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.509 
who's the number one you know to to get
a<00:00:24.510> place<00:00:24.779> over<00:00:25.170> there<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.859> think<00:00:26.220> that's

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
a place over there so I think that's

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.040 
a place over there so I think that's
what<00:00:26.670> makes<00:00:26.849> forget<00:00:27.240> interesting<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.930> know

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
what makes forget interesting you know

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.450 
what makes forget interesting you know
you<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> keep<00:00:28.680> playing<00:00:28.949> consistent

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
you have to keep playing consistent

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.950 
you have to keep playing consistent
critical<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.880> these<00:00:30.029> two<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.300> number<00:00:30.599> one<00:00:30.779> and

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
critical to these two the number one and

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.720 
critical to these two the number one and
from<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.679> point<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:32.130> know<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.309> have<00:00:32.550> to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
from that point you know you have to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.400 
from that point you know you have to
stabilize<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.450> keep<00:00:33.600> doing<00:00:33.899> what<00:00:34.290> you're

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
stabilize and keep doing what you're

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.250 
stabilize and keep doing what you're
doing<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.969> tough<00:00:36.120> job<00:00:36.149> if<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.870> see

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
doing so it's a tough job if you see

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.220 
doing so it's a tough job if you see
everything<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.100> know<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:39.239> injuries<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
everything you know the injuries the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.530 
everything you know the injuries the
fitness<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> form<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.640> everything<00:00:42.030> but

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
fitness and the form and everything but

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.790 
fitness and the form and everything but
we<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:42.780> quite<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> few<00:00:43.110> things<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.620> worry

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
we have quite a few things to worry

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.520 
we have quite a few things to worry
about<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.700> say<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.030> among<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.539> most

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
about so you can say it's among the most

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.619 
about so you can say it's among the most
difficult<00:00:47.070> tours<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.789> course<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.180> difficult

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
difficult tours of course it's difficult

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.110 
difficult tours of course it's difficult
to<00:00:48.809> exactly<00:00:49.230> recall<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.800> know<00:00:49.950> how<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.879> are

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
to exactly recall you know how you are

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.209 
to exactly recall you know how you are
feeling<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.629> when<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.020> were<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:53.160> know

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
feeling you when you were in you know

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.760 
feeling you when you were in you know
maybe<00:00:53.489> New<00:00:53.820> Zealand<00:00:54.180> or<00:00:54.449> west<00:00:55.050> indies<00:00:55.469> South

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
maybe New Zealand or west indies South

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.979 
maybe New Zealand or west indies South
Africa<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.550> Australia<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.750> quite<00:00:57.930> a

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
Africa or Australia so it's quite a

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.139 
Africa or Australia so it's quite a
difficult<00:00:58.199> one<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.649> course<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.309> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
difficult one of course you know the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.029 
difficult one of course you know the
closest<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:00.960> faced<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.890> thing

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
closest that you have faced is the thing

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.340 
closest that you have faced is the thing
that<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.280> remember<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.820> most<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.629> think

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
that you remember the most so I think

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.840 
that you remember the most so I think
it's<00:01:04.559> among<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> toughest<00:01:05.280> stores<00:01:05.549> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
it's among the toughest stores and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.160 
it's among the toughest stores and
that's<00:01:06.060> what<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.330> expect<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:06.930> when<00:01:07.110> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that's what you expect you know when you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.080 
that's what you expect you know when you
play<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> top<00:01:07.740> level<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.610> said<00:01:08.909> that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
play at the top level I have said that

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.850 
play at the top level I have said that
in<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> last<00:01:09.540> two<00:01:09.810> years<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> ratings<00:01:10.710> is

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
in the last two years in the ratings is

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.859 
in the last two years in the ratings is
not<00:01:11.010> what's<00:01:11.280> important<00:01:11.790> for<00:01:11.909> us<00:01:12.090> what<00:01:12.689> we

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
not what's important for us what we

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.289 
not what's important for us what we
concentrate<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.040> know<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.939> kind<00:01:15.090> of

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
concentrate on is you know the kind of

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.700 
concentrate on is you know the kind of
cricket<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.840> playing<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.500> try<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
cricket we are playing so we try to

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.310 
cricket we are playing so we try to
break<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.159> sessions<00:01:17.549> into<00:01:17.850> smaller<00:01:18.840> sessions

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
break the sessions into smaller sessions

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.320 
break the sessions into smaller sessions
you<00:01:19.470> know<00:01:19.560> not<00:01:19.740> look<00:01:20.280> five<00:01:20.549> days<00:01:20.790> ahead<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.180> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you know not look five days ahead as to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.969 
you know not look five days ahead as to
what<00:01:21.509> may<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.140> result<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.710> know<00:01:22.799> what's

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
what may be the result you know what's

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.620 
what may be the result you know what's
important<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:23.580> us<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.790> once<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.210> go<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
important for us is once you go on the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.630 
important for us is once you go on the
field<00:01:24.840> when<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.470> first<00:01:25.740> how<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.340> go<00:01:26.610> about

doing stuff on the first hour and then
by<00:01:29.220> lunch<00:01:29.460> session<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.060> we<00:01:30.150> try<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.360> break<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
by lunch session so we try to break the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.710 
by lunch session so we try to break the
sessions<00:01:31.770> into<00:01:32.070> smaller<00:01:32.880> sections<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.540> try

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
sessions into smaller sections and try

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.539 
sessions into smaller sections and try
to<00:01:33.780> win<00:01:34.049> those<00:01:34.290> again<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.890> know<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.100> helps<00:01:35.250> you

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
to win those again you know it helps you

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.950 
to win those again you know it helps you
when<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.790> are<00:01:35.850> sticking<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> basics<00:01:36.509> so

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.569 
now it's not ratings that's very
important<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:38.970> us<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:40.470> know<00:01:40.619> we<00:01:41.189> know

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
important for us and you know we know

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.010 
important for us and you know we know
all<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.790> small<00:01:42.150> small<00:01:42.420> things<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.810> know<00:01:42.869> that

all the small small things you know that

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.990 
all the small small things you know that
really<00:01:43.200> matter<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.829> we'll<00:01:44.009> look<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.640> stick<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
really matter so we'll look to stick to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.940 
really matter so we'll look to stick to
that<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> last<00:01:45.930> two<00:01:46.140> test<00:01:46.380> matches<00:01:46.470> we

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that in the last two test matches we

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.440 
that in the last two test matches we
were<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.220> position<00:01:47.520> where<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:48.000> could<00:01:48.180> dominate

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
were in position where we could dominate

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.319 
were in position where we could dominate
the<00:01:48.960> both<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.770> games<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.460> what's<00:01:50.759> important

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the both the games so what's important

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.090 
the both the games so what's important
is<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.659> know<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.840> get<00:01:52.380> into<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.710> similar

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
is you know to get into that similar

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.069 
is you know to get into that similar
situation<00:01:53.700> again<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> third<00:01:54.390> Test<00:01:54.840> match

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
situation again in the third Test match

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.889 
situation again in the third Test match
and<00:01:55.409> what<00:01:55.770> will<00:01:55.950> be<00:01:56.070> important<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:57.780> know

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and what will be important is you know

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.440 
and what will be important is you know
to<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.890> know<00:01:58.950> from<00:01:59.159> there<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.149> know<00:02:00.180> go

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
to you know from there to you know go

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.499 
to you know from there to you know go
ahead<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.960> put<00:02:01.110> further<00:02:01.409> pressure<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.939> on

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
ahead and put further pressure on the on

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.120 
ahead and put further pressure on the on
the<00:02:03.540> batting<00:02:04.020> order<00:02:04.320> which<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.649> think<00:02:04.890> will<00:02:04.979> be

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the batting order which I think will be

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.770 
the batting order which I think will be
very<00:02:05.159> important<00:02:05.729> because<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.540> know<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:06.689> you

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
very important because you know if you

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.479 
very important because you know if you
see<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> batting<00:02:07.380> line<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> bat<00:02:07.890> quite<00:02:08.220> deep

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
see the batting line the bat quite deep

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.820 
see the batting line the bat quite deep
you<00:02:08.700> know<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> battle<00:02:09.360> maybe<00:02:09.929> nine<00:02:10.200> or<00:02:10.229> ten<00:02:10.560> so

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
you know the battle maybe nine or ten so

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.610 
you know the battle maybe nine or ten so
you<00:02:11.340> know<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.730> very<00:02:12.540> important<00:02:13.020> that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
you know it is very important that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.160 
you know it is very important that
no<00:02:13.769> how<00:02:14.010> we<00:02:14.269> bowl<00:02:15.269> with<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.540> ball<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.049> gets

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
no how we bowl with a ball that gets

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.259 
no how we bowl with a ball that gets
slightly<00:02:16.500> old<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.069> know<00:02:17.099> maybe<00:02:17.370> from<00:02:17.640> 45<00:02:18.090> or

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
slightly old you know maybe from 45 or

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.050 
slightly old you know maybe from 45 or
50<00:02:18.599> 50th<00:02:19.379> /<00:02:19.680> onwards<00:02:20.099> till<00:02:20.280> we<00:02:20.430> get<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.700> second

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
50 50th / onwards till we get the second

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.660 
50 50th / onwards till we get the second
new<00:02:21.150> ball<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.659> I<00:02:21.900> think<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.590> know<00:02:22.739> first<00:02:23.549> what

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
new ball so I think you know first what

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.640 
new ball so I think you know first what
we<00:02:23.940> need<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.239> do<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:25.349> know<00:02:25.470> getting

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
we need to do is you know getting

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.369 
we need to do is you know getting
exactly<00:02:26.489> into<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.760> same<00:02:27.030> scenario<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.750> then

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
exactly into the same scenario and then

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.330 
exactly into the same scenario and then
finish<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.709> off<00:02:28.920> well

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.970 

well<00:02:32.120> he's<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.330> is<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> very<00:02:32.959> dynamic<00:02:33.200> player<00:02:33.769> you

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
know you know he backs his instinct to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.740 
know you know he backs his instinct to
play<00:02:36.290> short<00:02:36.590> irrespective<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.459> which<00:02:38.420> bowler

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
play short irrespective of which bowler

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.140

he is facing you know you more believes
in<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:42.110> know<00:02:42.260> having<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.220> look<00:02:43.430> at<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.760> wall

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
in you know having a look at the wall

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.940 
in you know having a look at the wall
and<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.900> know<00:02:44.989> giving<00:02:45.379> it<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.650> kind<00:02:45.800> of

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
and you know giving it the kind of

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.190 
and you know giving it the kind of
treatment<00:02:46.489> at<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.760> deserves<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.780> backs<00:02:48.019> his

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
treatment at it deserves so it backs his

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.089 
treatment at it deserves so it backs his
instinct<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.799> we<00:02:49.790> all<00:02:49.940> know<00:02:50.560> then<00:02:51.560> aggressive

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
instinct and we all know then aggressive

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.030 
instinct and we all know then aggressive
opener<00:02:52.610> can<00:02:52.900> have<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.930> very<00:02:54.170> big<00:02:54.349> impact<00:02:54.500> on<00:02:54.890> the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
opener can have a very big impact on the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.369 
opener can have a very big impact on the
opposition<00:02:55.519> bowling<00:02:55.819> attack<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:56.450> I<00:02:56.690> think<00:02:57.110> is

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
opposition bowling attack so I think is

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.050 
opposition bowling attack so I think is
a<00:02:57.410> very<00:02:57.560> good<00:02:57.890> player<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.489> have<00:02:58.610> in<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.849> side

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
a very good player to have in the side

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.000 
a very good player to have in the side
the<00:02:59.510> wickets<00:02:59.870> they<00:03:00.019> are<00:03:00.080> not<00:03:00.230> really<00:03:00.590> assisted

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
the wickets they are not really assisted

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.500 
the wickets they are not really assisted
the<00:03:01.129> spinners<00:03:01.489> in<00:03:01.610> any<00:03:01.760> way<00:03:02.000> there<00:03:02.180> has<00:03:02.299> not

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
the spinners in any way there has not

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.130 
the spinners in any way there has not
been<00:03:02.680> much<00:03:03.680> done<00:03:04.069> for<00:03:04.400> them<00:03:04.549> which<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:05.690> know

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
been much done for them which you know

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.800 
been much done for them which you know
which<00:03:07.040> pushes<00:03:07.610> us<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:08.030> think<00:03:08.239> whether<00:03:08.390> we<00:03:08.599> can

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
which pushes us to think whether we can

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.259 
which pushes us to think whether we can
play<00:03:09.110> with<00:03:09.290> both<00:03:09.470> for<00:03:10.069> fast<00:03:10.340> bowlers<00:03:10.790> or<00:03:11.030> not

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
play with both for fast bowlers or not

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.150 
play with both for fast bowlers or not
opposed<00:03:11.630> over<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.049> will<00:03:12.230> be<00:03:12.380> important<00:03:12.769> but<00:03:12.950> I

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
opposed over it will be important but I

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.860 
opposed over it will be important but I
think<00:03:13.640> your<00:03:13.790> first<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.269> foremost<00:03:14.660> thing

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
think your first and foremost thing

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.800 
think your first and foremost thing
that's<00:03:15.709> most<00:03:15.980> important<00:03:16.549> is<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:17.390> know<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.540> do

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
that's most important is you know to do

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.780 
that's most important is you know to do
well<00:03:18.079> and<00:03:18.319> I<00:03:18.799> think<00:03:18.920> you<00:03:19.160> know<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.340> over<00:03:19.610> it

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
doesn't really bother at us when it

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.740 
doesn't really bother at us when it
