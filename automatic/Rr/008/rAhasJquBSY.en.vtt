 but after a fortune from Maria's own branched out during the recent coniferous district in Needle 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.600
 0 8 2 0 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.269
 I am sending atp 8 7 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.749
 8 is that with a number of unique features including a 3G module for 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:13.650
 mobile Internet 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.570
 cps courageous woman katie payments navigation and times his module for it 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.249
 make phone calls 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:23.590
 provided a 1024 by 768 resolution during the debate 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.580
 but a short-lived cortex a9 yoko processor in Dubai's work area 8 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.980
 gigabyte of storage space 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.160
 It is also clear that the plan is being celebrated with a 2010 point 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.030
 look at those of the Temple Mount have made significant improvements over the years 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.370
 compared to last year she is provided with a tablet in lay on the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.000
 reverse side made of plastic waste 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.670
 and has a kind of chrome appearance it gives it just that 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.090
 three new look and it wasn't too bad 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.690
 on those in action but also the logo and descriptions of the connections 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.890
 back at the top and camera two tons of anbeek lid why they are the and 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.390
 spyker difference 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.400
 we can see the connection on the sides 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.610
 below that a micro sd portman percent rose feature headphone jack 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.120
 and behind a flap a micro sd card and in Sint cathrien 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.230
 in that sense card that uses knowledge according to mobile internet and the cover 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.140
 I can tidy myself 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.460
 then be stopped so that yellow is shielded 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.920
 if you look at the front and see me a complete schwagten front 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.760
 with what thicker other than normal because the players look like a pop song 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.960
 dexter 3 behind 0 Verkerk sienot 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.000
 he is all a bit wider, the situation is therefore a difficult one 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.200
 hold your hand 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.160
 front safe complete slaughter nuon chea camera on top 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.390
 the rest that is a good hand-in-hand barrel against the swisser that the on 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.300
 is perhaps a bit heavier and fat March ended two points that time 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.150
 does not really matter 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.990
 The SP is of course an important part of the time that there is a year 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.180
 finds features a backlog in sweden playing with a 1024 7 behind 60 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.520
 pixel resolution 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.900
 this edition is not a big deal it is a bit less but when you look at it 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.999
 temse recently launched could have been somewhat larger 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:00.729
 but they work fine with it 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.860
 you see it was really when you read texts or in his top texts 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.200
 websites 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.209
 that the standard lcd display is a bigger problem than once by a piece 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.219
 color reproduction on the moderate side 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:15.249
 Viewing angle is very poor and the brightness cannot be adjusted and weighted 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.819
 and that is that it has been developed to be especially on the outdoors with mobile 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:19.590
 internet 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.599
 to use 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.370
 sit further when talking about a 4 by three aspect ratio of just about different 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.979
 then with most other tablets they see stimulating sixteen meeting 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:29.980
 Android interface handles that well 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.199
 only some ebs may appear less comfortably less optimally 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.519
 diarra still 8 2 left and while out of the tent four points becomes circle tent 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.019
 second session one of the most recent and ever versions we know, however 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.359
 of course and that the ship already has a two and four points 3 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.309
 and brush up to five years extra adjusted or added we see only on the 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.500
 bottom of it in the taskbar 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.010
 a number of new items 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.020
 in rich order come quickly at a few minutes and two oaks us to the volume 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:03.359
 Furthermore, you get a number of I hate that comes standard with Oberhofen 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.710
 viejo first falic traces and the beer earlier 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.609
 and manual 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.619
 and some standard google erpse 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:12.529
 of course it is also necessary to read about the language of applications 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.909
 cor software still put a limitation to the calling premier division discussed 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.520
 specially for the ensures that you have a limited 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.140
 part of the storage memory for ajax but use the 8 gigabyte them 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.000
 make use of the chip card 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.909
 That is a limitation that does not mean that every time production 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.100
 that must even be up to the end user 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.260
 how much erp software on storage memory 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.039
 where used in the past 8 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:38.620
 As said, it has 3G and a CSM module and GPS 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.040
 so i leave them for that you can not be missing 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.230
 for example, there is a telephone application with which you can use the soft numbers 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.209
 influence now for the contacts can manage christine's view 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.469
 etcetera you can therefore make telephone calls 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.639
 although the size of the tablet is not ideal for that and then you can 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.719
 of course a bluetooth headset connection 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.459
 in terms of performance that always that dollar twice an absolutely no high flyer 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.219
 the processor in combination with the gpd and thirdly due to working memory 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:08.599
 make sure you are inside and sometime in the usa and the standard one 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.089
 Above average good and smoothly ahead crash had the run and runs 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:17.109
 marije doing more intensive tasks for several external bodies seems to be running time 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.840
 or play intensive games then you will notice that you get less it 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.270
 specifications 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.599
 so playing games that are free intensive is reasonable to do but you 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.530
 clearly sees that the image of shocked certainly when there was a bit more excited in the image 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.700
 appear and the price goes up 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.980
 then you will see it less 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.400
 shop example 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.290
 for the rest 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.349
 as a brittle and sometimes during the half year through the interface 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.560
 sometimes you come across a small leak of less than a second reluctantly 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.840
 means you can put your finger on the screen with a move and just a little later 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.540
 your movements are performed on the screen it will cost kids the 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.289
 smooth temporary relocation 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.449
 All in all, the year has been disguised by 8 2 0 and with both 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.430
 important plus points like minus points 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.320
 important mentis display in moderation color rendering moderate clear ends 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.610
 moderate look too 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.909
 also the processor that can free intensive care from participation can sometimes index 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.210
 shows import on time 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.099
 must be seen as a downside 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.350
 plus points are of course the 3js gsm module and of course the gps walls 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.600
 this is already 3 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.210
 work great outdoors while taking into account loot would be the stone 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.370
 non-buildable party member 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.030
 But you often are sidelined and affordable at the same time that we participate 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.539
 get to mobile internet 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:29.889
 then to make a call 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.650
 then those accents 8 7 are certainly an option 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.750
 provided you settle for the aforementioned negatives
