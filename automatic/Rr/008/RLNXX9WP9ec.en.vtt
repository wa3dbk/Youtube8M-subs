 surely many will have already noticed that 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.590
 I've been very suspicious and plotting something 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.990
 in those last days that I say day 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.420
 weeks it is a new project 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.100
 to live a new series that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.320
 will mark the end of a cycle and the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.020

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.730
 words a new season of videos and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.400

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.289

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.810

 arcani has made a video introducing us 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.489
 its channel and all its series which 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.160
 they are tremendous I do not tell you more and I 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.520

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.230
 demons or 24 of the channel arcades 94 and 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.539
 first of all I would like to give a lot 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.250
 thank the king webmaster for giving us 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.989
 this opportunity to be able to teach them in 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.510
 your channel if you have fixed 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.760
 I'm speaking in the plural and I'm not 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.219
 I'm not crazy dual personality that is 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.800
 I do not have it, only the channel 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.629
 We take two people one is black vile and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.399
 another one is me although black vil is not going to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.559
 have the pleasure of accompanying us to the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.360
 time to make this video our channel 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.810
 It is mainly characterized by being 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.670
 the league 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.530
 and it's all though from time to time 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.470
 we usually have some video that is in parity 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.040
 so pale, so pale that if not 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.590
 we publish 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.539
 does not burst something inside like everyone 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.630
 today's channels of them 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:24.479
 we have days the jce in 2.0 live magnet a 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.979
 game though other streaming but that's not 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.600
 is what I like to stand out from our 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.250
 channel what I like to highlight most of 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.110
 our channel is that we are crazy about 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.090
 auction and we consider ourselves at least 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.770
 pretty funny from time to time to me 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.549
 At least as a child, friends told me 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.649
 of my mother 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.080
 hey island dawson boy and you have to 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.299
 salty that went down under another section that 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.250
 we have is the bookbus that is that when 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.039
 people suffer a bug or I suffer it 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.740
 as soon as I have 5 books that seem to me 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.270
 curious or highlight these upload it in 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.459
 a video told us and we took some 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.869
 laughs the truth is that it is very curious what 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:58.020
 what can I do in league of legends 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.209
 when you see it we also have another 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.709
 section that is the lucky plays 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:05.250
 which is that if you have an extreme case of 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:07.319
 xurde you can send it to me and if I like it 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.420
 I'll upload it in a video next to three others 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.039
 lucky plays good together with others 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.440
 two in a video of three plays 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.420
 fortunate commenting on and so 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.160
 we can send messages saying that 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.070
 I hope you play the lottery that is going to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.500
 play fixed and if you like humor 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.390
 absurd without meaning and random os 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.370
 I recommend that you see the sef movies the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.650
 league of legends and when you play 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.480
 ranked the counter picks that we have 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.730
 still two videos but it's a section 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.860
 let's start right away to 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.710
 take videos like loaves in which 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.380
 we commented that champions with a theme to 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.090
 others and because you look like rogues the ones 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.310
 remember why because it's a 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.710
 counter pick does not always win the line 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.410
 and if they will tell you to play 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.240
 defensive that you do not be rambo besides yes 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.130
 you do not like to see the league of legends 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.320
 As everyone sees, we have videos 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.240
 to modify the client and for example 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.670
 instead of leaving you think that you 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.340
 come out more flattering things is more penta 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.810
 kills leagues good today they will fall 50 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.030
 kilos to leave me Message to 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.280
 I put five times and change the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.110
 recommended objects to say that the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.060
 best build for garen is one of 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.610
 archangel canes although riot does not 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.710
 I recommend it, you can put it, I hope 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.450
