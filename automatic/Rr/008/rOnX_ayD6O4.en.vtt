you<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.460> just<00:01:59.909> said<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.540> show<00:02:00.719> has

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
you like just said that the show has

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.450 
you like just said that the show has
been<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.469> 50<00:02:02.009> years

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
been on for like 50 years

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.310 
been on for like 50 years
so<00:02:02.909> how<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.270> they<00:02:03.360> had<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.689> same<00:02:03.869> actor

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
so how have they had the same actor

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.609 
so how have they had the same actor
playing<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.829> doctor<00:02:05.009> for<00:02:05.460> 50<00:02:06.000> years<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:07.350> is

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
playing the doctor for 50 years this is

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.529 
playing the doctor for 50 years this is
where<00:02:07.770> something<00:02:08.129> called<00:02:08.640> regeneration

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
where something called regeneration

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.300 
where something called regeneration
comes<00:02:10.080> into<00:02:10.379> play<00:02:10.590> basically<00:02:11.520> as<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> Time

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
comes into play basically as a Time

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.640 
comes into play basically as a Time

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
energy and changing itself completely so

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.020 
energy and changing itself completely so
that<00:02:20.140> they<00:02:20.380> look<00:02:20.590> like<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> new<00:02:21.130> person<00:02:21.430> which
