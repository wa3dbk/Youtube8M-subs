00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.290
 I know what you think now and you 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.440
 are right there is better weather around 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.450
 to test a bmw m 4 cabriolet but so is 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.670
 Well, August 2014 in Germany 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.970
 and bmw claims that anyway 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.110
 car coupe and convertible in one we are 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.759
 But we still want the 20 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.399
 take seconds for so long 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.050
 it takes up to the tin dress 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.060
 is folded back and us around the top 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.050
 it's really an open issue to take care of 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.090
 the extra charge if you only fast 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.679
 enough wind would have the wind yes 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.679
 sweep over the pastor 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.920
 and can sweep it 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.920
 the three-liter six-cylinder has with 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.600
 a double turbo and the 431 ps enough 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.910
 power in all life situations 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.040
 especially the 550 newtonmeter torque 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.020
 also open the m4 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.300
 breathtakingly fast 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.190
 Although top speed is 250 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.530
 km h limits but that can also be 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.190
 with the m driver's package on 280 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.960
 raise 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.090
 the decisive advantage of the new 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.160
 six-cylinder is through in the consumption 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.710
 the downsizing could rim 4 loud bmw with 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.170
 8 7 liters out of the gas pedal 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.850
 Carefully stroke this number 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.110
 nobody will be the future m4 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.700
 owner ever reach 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.840
 behind the tax one concentrates oneself 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.840
 on other things 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.630
 we have a little rain break and that 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.790
 Let's have a chance 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.799
 cameraman with time to get into the boat 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.720
 he actually received it from the inside 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.610
 Not at all like something special that 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.530
 was at the coupe already so ultimately 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.200
 is that 1 3 years with yes a few m 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.220
 symbols and a bit of leather though 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.170
 so that he becomes really special then 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.300
 you would probably have to at the m gmbh 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.100
 ask for a few carbon parts 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.380
 otherwise you have to say he drives 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.479
 casual but not as sporty as 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.690
 the coupe simply because of the fact 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.940
 that weighs more here but he has 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.489
 an advantage because he has the free 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.800
 access to the sound and please me 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.840
 forgive me many know mourn that 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.610
 eight cylinders behind but the sound 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.019
 from this six-cylinder is terrific 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.730
 right now the wind is sounding 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.350
 four-cylinder that is in the city 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.040
 is not missing at all but if you are 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.040
 appear around 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.480
 is enough to lessen the latency 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.790
 of course, also brings the m version of the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.410
 Convertible all the amenities of the four 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.390
 this includes, for example, too 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.950
 raising the rear hatch all 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.860
 assistant systems and of course that 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.680
 steel folding roof that makes the m4 convertible 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.840
 Although 250 kilos heavier than a coupe 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.880
 but brother has undoubted advantages 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.490
 in comfort and everyday life 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.050
 there is something special in this m 4 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.090
 Convertible that is best on the 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.930
 presenting the motorway is not about 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.860
 the noise was just barely 170 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.020
 to follow in a convertible 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.520
 admittedly that works out quite well 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.670
 something quieter than a fabric hood per se 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.110
 but still it is amazingly quiet 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.090
 here in here and on this point 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.980
 then one understands also the bavaria say 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.920
 You actually buy with this car 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.130
 two cars inside namely convertible and 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.760
 coupÃ© the convertible has tradition at the m 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.530
 GmbH 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.470
 and that's exactly why it will be 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.370
 Variant again find the returns 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.470
 Traditionally, the coupÃ© is ours 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.380
 strongest derivative in the last model 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.720
 generation with a good 60 percent share 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.730
 the entire three sales every fourth 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.790
 Customer in the m3 opted for one 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.500
 convertible ca 15% for a limousine the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.450
 However, had a shorter term 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.459
 like that with the new model generation 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.310
 is going to be exciting, of course 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.380
 ask the m4 convertible brings anyway 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.170
 a lot of arguments with in the future 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.760
 to be sold more often 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.530
 just as I had imagined 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.760
 I have to return this beautiful car 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.200
 deliver and on time for this 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.750
 time the sun comes out 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.000
 whole class the extra for worthwhile 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.010
 the mtk a year or no i would 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.330
 answer with a very clear no 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.650
 then i want my m4 on the 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.700
 hijack race track and I need 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.410
 maybe a little space for 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.660
 the golf equipment then I have to 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.280
 I would like to take the coupe a coupe 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.810
 and in good weather but I would like 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.460
 actually like to fold the roof down 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.500
 I also want to have a lot of fun and 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.720
 my m4 sees the race track completely and 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.210
 not at all then this mp convertible 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.520
 just right because that's a whole 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.630
 the year's car and that had that day 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.630
 impressively proved 

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:53.699
 the only thing to buy a m 4 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:56.759
 Convertible is in the way of the price is ours 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.219
 test car costs 82,000 100 in the base 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.860
 euro in our equipment travels the 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.419
 loose the 100,000 mark but this one 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.529
 Price relativizes itself when you see 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.719
 what you get for it 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.459
 because this m4 is also openly a sin 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:11.479
 is and surprisingly unagitated 

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:11.479
 in everyday life
