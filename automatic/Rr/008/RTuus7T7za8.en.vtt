I'll<00:00:39.500> go<00:00:39.770> into<00:00:39.890> more<00:00:39.980> detail<00:00:40.460> on<00:00:40.490> what<00:00:40.790> each<00:00:40.970> of

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
I'll go into more detail on what each of

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.780 
I'll go into more detail on what each of
those<00:00:41.360> actually<00:00:42.020> do<00:00:42.230> for<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.530> bat<00:00:42.710> during<00:00:43.340> the

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
those actually do for the bat during the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.889 
those actually do for the bat during the
unboxing<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:44.630> that<00:00:44.840> being<00:00:45.020> said<00:00:45.110> let's<00:00:45.770> start

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.090 

I'm<00:00:50.899> going<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:51.110> start<00:00:51.260> off<00:00:51.350> with<00:00:51.560> Mizuno's

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
I'm going to start off with Mizuno's

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.000 
I'm going to start off with Mizuno's
generation<00:00:52.700> but<00:00:52.910> I<00:00:53.090> got<00:00:53.480> it<00:00:53.630> in<00:00:53.720> a<00:00:53.810> 33-30<00:00:54.590> it's

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
generation but I got it in a 33-30 it's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.120 
generation but I got it in a 33-30 it's
all<00:00:55.310> one<00:00:55.760> piece<00:00:56.090> alloy<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.899> so<00:00:57.829> first

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
all one piece alloy and so first

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.270 
all one piece alloy and so first
thoughts<00:00:58.430> are<00:00:58.760> it's<00:00:59.510> very<00:00:59.570> balanced<00:01:00.470> now<00:01:00.890> this

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
thoughts are it's very balanced now this

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.090 
thoughts are it's very balanced now this
is<00:01:01.430> due<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:01.579> mizunos<00:01:02.360> pentad<00:01:03.290> technology<00:01:03.980> that

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
is due to mizunos pentad technology that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.160 
is due to mizunos pentad technology that
i<00:01:04.159> just<00:01:04.519> talked<00:01:04.759> about<00:01:04.879> so<00:01:05.600> basically<00:01:05.930> what<00:01:06.140> it

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
i just talked about so basically what it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.050 
i just talked about so basically what it
does<00:01:06.259> is<00:01:06.530> it<00:01:06.560> buries<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.250> wall<00:01:07.490> thickness

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
does is it buries the wall thickness

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.940 
does is it buries the wall thickness
throughout<00:01:08.329> the<00:01:08.630> bat<00:01:08.840> evenly<00:01:09.320> distributing

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
throughout the bat evenly distributing

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.460 
throughout the bat evenly distributing
the<00:01:10.159> weight<00:01:10.190> while<00:01:10.880> increasing<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:12.080> barrel

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
the weight while increasing the barrel

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.920 
the weight while increasing the barrel
pop<00:01:12.740> on<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.070> bat<00:01:13.610> it's<00:01:14.330> got<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:14.510> really<00:01:14.720> cool

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
pop on the bat it's got a really cool

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.680 
pop on the bat it's got a really cool
generation<00:01:15.590> graphic<00:01:16.370> here<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.060> then<00:01:17.180> on<00:01:17.360> the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
generation graphic here and then on the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.500 
generation graphic here and then on the
handle<00:01:18.080> it's<00:01:18.320> got<00:01:18.620> kind<00:01:19.280> of<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.640> composite

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
handle it's got kind of the composite

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.789 
handle it's got kind of the composite
look<00:01:21.430> design<00:01:22.430> on<00:01:22.729> each<00:01:23.030> side<00:01:23.390> there<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.530> grip

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
look design on each side there the grip

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.830 
look design on each side there the grip
feels<00:01:25.010> pretty<00:01:25.310> good<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:26.210> end<00:01:26.390> cap<00:01:26.630> is

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
feels pretty good the end cap is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.859 
feels pretty good the end cap is
slightly<00:01:27.409> cupped<00:01:27.860> nothing<00:01:28.820> crazy<00:01:29.240> now<00:01:29.690> I'm

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
slightly cupped nothing crazy now I'm

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.750 
slightly cupped nothing crazy now I'm
personally<00:01:30.409> excited<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.920> try<00:01:31.100> this<00:01:31.159> bad<00:01:31.490> just

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
personally excited to try this bad just

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.859 
personally excited to try this bad just
because<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.150> fact<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.540> I've<00:01:32.690> never

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
because of the fact that I've never

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.539 
because of the fact that I've never
actually<00:01:33.080> tried<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:33.439> one-piece<00:01:33.890> alloy<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:34.460> I'm

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
actually tried a one-piece alloy so I'm

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:35.950 
actually tried a one-piece alloy so I'm
kind<00:01:34.760> of<00:01:34.850> curious<00:01:35.090> on<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.570> difference

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
kind of curious on the difference

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.740 
kind of curious on the difference
between<00:01:36.080> one<00:01:36.530> piece<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.040> two<00:01:37.700> piece<00:01:37.939> but

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
between one piece and two piece but

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.450 
between one piece and two piece but
that's<00:01:39.229> basically<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.740> unboxing<00:01:40.220> of<00:01:40.340> the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
that's basically the unboxing of the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.399 
that's basically the unboxing of the
mizuno<00:01:40.939> generation<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:41.930> now<00:01:42.080> we're<00:01:42.229> going<00:01:42.350> to

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
mizuno generation so now we're going to

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.950 
mizuno generation so now we're going to
jump<00:01:42.619> into<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:43.010> max<00:01:43.610> cord<00:01:43.970> so<00:01:44.299> here's<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.750> max

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
jump into the max cord so here's the max

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.480 
jump into the max cord so here's the max
score<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.409> first<00:01:45.680> thing<00:01:45.830> that<00:01:45.979> jumps<00:01:46.220> out<00:01:46.310> to

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
score and first thing that jumps out to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.359 
score and first thing that jumps out to
me<00:01:46.520> is<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.880> barrel<00:01:47.540> size<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:48.020> barrel<00:01:48.409> is<00:01:48.590> huge

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
me is the barrel size the barrel is huge

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.310 
me is the barrel size the barrel is huge
it<00:01:49.580> almost<00:01:49.790> looks<00:01:50.000> like<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.180> fungo<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:50.900> as<00:01:51.140> far

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
it almost looks like a fungo and as far

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.929 
it almost looks like a fungo and as far
as<00:01:51.470> weight<00:01:51.680> distribution<00:01:52.430> goes<00:01:52.640> it's<00:01:52.880> a

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
as weight distribution goes it's a

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.090 
as weight distribution goes it's a
little<00:01:53.180> more<00:01:53.299> unloaded<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.080> that's<00:01:54.710> mostly

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
little more unloaded and that's mostly

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.550 
little more unloaded and that's mostly
in<00:01:55.250> part<00:01:55.490> due<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.119> VP<00:01:56.810> sleeve<00:01:57.170> and

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
in part due to the VP sleeve and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.230 
in part due to the VP sleeve and
basically<00:01:57.890> what<00:01:58.159> it<00:01:58.189> does<00:01:58.310> is<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:58.820> creates

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
basically what it does is it creates

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.080 
basically what it does is it creates
more<00:01:59.659> friction<00:01:59.720> off<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.680> barrel<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.250> create

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
more friction off the barrel to create

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.660 
more friction off the barrel to create
more<00:02:02.390> spin<00:02:02.900> and<00:02:03.140> create<00:02:03.710> more<00:02:03.890> backspin<00:02:04.430> which

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
more spin and create more backspin which

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.420 
more spin and create more backspin which
creates<00:02:05.000> more<00:02:05.150> lift<00:02:05.479> now<00:02:06.020> like<00:02:06.259> I<00:02:06.380> said<00:02:06.409> it<00:02:07.009> is

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
creates more lift now like I said it is

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.190 
creates more lift now like I said it is
more<00:02:07.460> unloaded<00:02:08.269> so<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:08.569> more<00:02:08.750> for<00:02:08.989> power

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
more unloaded so it's more for power

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.380 
more unloaded so it's more for power
hitters<00:02:09.739> that's<00:02:10.159> why<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.429> features<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.819> VP

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
hitters that's why it features the VP

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.690 
hitters that's why it features the VP
sleeve<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:11.989> also<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.860> end<00:02:13.069> piece<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.550> not

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
sleeve and also the end piece is not

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.460 
sleeve and also the end piece is not
cupped<00:02:13.970> at<00:02:14.120> all<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.599> as<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:14.989> can<00:02:15.110> see<00:02:15.140> it

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
cupped at all and as you can see it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.309 
cupped at all and as you can see it
features<00:02:15.860> silver<00:02:16.790> black<00:02:17.300> and

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
features silver black and

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.410 
features silver black and
lou<00:02:18.439> and<00:02:18.859> features<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.310> really<00:02:19.640> cool<00:02:19.849> chinese

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
lou and features a really cool chinese

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.470 
lou and features a really cool chinese
type<00:02:21.319> design<00:02:21.980> going<00:02:22.370> through<00:02:22.579> the<00:02:22.700> entire<00:02:23.090> bat

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
type design going through the entire bat

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.349 
type design going through the entire bat
you<00:02:23.989> see<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.319> here<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.310> both<00:02:25.519> sides<00:02:25.849> of<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
you see it here and on both sides of the

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.420 
you see it here and on both sides of the
barrel<00:02:26.719> that's<00:02:26.959> where<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.319> blue<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.950> grip

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
barrel that's where the blue is the grip

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.640 
barrel that's where the blue is the grip
is<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:28.700> same<00:02:28.909> thing<00:02:28.939> as<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.299> generation<00:02:30.049> and<00:02:30.469> so

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
is the same thing as a generation and so

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.470 
is the same thing as a generation and so
yeah<00:02:30.920> that's<00:02:31.219> the<00:02:31.489> unboxing<00:02:31.939> of<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.239> max

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
yeah that's the unboxing of the max

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.449 
yeah that's the unboxing of the max
corbat<00:02:32.959> so<00:02:33.409> I'm<00:02:33.469> really<00:02:33.620> excited<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.129> use<00:02:34.219> both

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
corbat so I'm really excited to use both

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.339 
corbat so I'm really excited to use both
the<00:02:34.670> max<00:02:34.909> score<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.359> the<00:02:35.629> generation<00:02:35.989> bat

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
the max score and the generation bat

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.199 
the max score and the generation bat
