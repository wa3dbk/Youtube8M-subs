00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.670
 of course 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.599
 nice to all guys well found on 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.669
 lost in game 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.609
 I'm cyber shot and of course and there 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:31.689
 made liquor procured two thousand 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.949
 attempts to do good work 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.260
 we hope so tonight really 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.829
 we are experiencing quite a bit of 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.239
 problems a lot of difficulty 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.100
 thoughts we immediately want to rent for 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.360
 ask for a moment's apology for the absence 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.250
 that there was in the last period on the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.430
 Channel but it has increased very 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.979
 committed to the university we say 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.960
 so it's a little more difficult and get yourself 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.589
 guys it's not as easy as it can 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.019
 to seem 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.939
 and so we decided that to go to 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.070
 plug these holes where there is no holes in them 

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:03.860
 which, in short, we can't catch 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.360
 we will also play series in 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.369
 single addition that this comment 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.170
 lindu all 1 and we see ebook is said 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.360
 also just as we can not do 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.700
 more video is true a little more channel 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.229
 I still live by the air anyway afterwards 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.659
 this game but not first time 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.840
 it's mine is yes it's my first gameplay on 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.700
 this new channel is nothing but 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.189
 watching the game 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.710
 oh well it is a 20 50 calculating anyway 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.039
 on a deathmatch team it's not bad 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.719
 anyway 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:37.609
 but natural absolutely yes boy 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.740
 we are not talking about home classes 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.569
 page decisions because time is short 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.069
 we put description however with dates 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.740
 which in this case server was a bit in 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.469
 testing time then appears 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.060
 very good the weapon was a little so so 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:54.560
 okay I was proving that we talk 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.999
 immediately important things 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.939
 the main topic as you will have 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:01.249
 understood the sum from the name of the video is the 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.249
 connection on this game la 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:06.590
 connection is almost done right is everything 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:09.530
 because the guys that if you want pinga 300 e 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.209
 the beast routinely 50 half of the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.350
 time before then there was half of the 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.420
 time before 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.280
 so it's good 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.160
 a good connection to play and 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.920
 guys with the appliance is very burning 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.510
 a lot because i don't echo guys if 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.190
 you have a good connection as if you 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.930
 see in the future site magatti 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.220
 connection as my veto in the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.750
 past 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.930
 here they go from grade to grade what it is 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.310
 success on 10 noticed that he wasn't there 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.380
 smooth cyber and server you are not 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.120
 noticed the same by his parents for useless 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.239
 that you try to cover me I wanted to give a 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.310
 package to those I don't see it that way 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.640
 will talk about important thing to pass the 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.110
 king dye then with let's say let's start with 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.989
 basic advice should be based 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.519
 ask all the short ones 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.069
 internet pages all small ones 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.890
 dino g applications that can steal 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.110
 connection so guys do more 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.209
 bourne for strength detached when 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.060
 playing or even utorrent we succeed in 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.120
 unplug it there is little to do I'm sorry 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.799
 as for a little we tell you the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.140
 a little more complex procedures I do 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.920
 I propose one that is to enlarge 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.810
 nat and five main ports 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.670
 advantages we say the first is what i 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.130
 your companions will be able to ruin 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.230
 more easily in your visa group 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.900
 that two, however, there are several 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.700
 problems of this kind is the second is 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.650
 that in any case you will be able to enter first 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.070
 in fact in this match 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.989
 within 40 seconds of delay maybe 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.720
 an oscar will be done and a little better 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.130
 no stain but on average guys like that 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.959
 let's get domain together he arrives 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.239
 when the banks are already conquered there 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.100
 closes the game first time by going to 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.989
 Positano no but begin 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.239
 this is the starting point or you do the kill 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.100
 neither me nor forever from that there then 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.200
 boys still open milk is good 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.329
 nor is it so difficult was so 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.830
 ago here I didn't already have the menton anymore 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.020
 considered sample 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.290
 it is very simple, just to know a moment 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.270
 how to access your options 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.030
 router and then from there it's all a game of 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.830
 guys in short, we put it all in 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.050
 description if you have any problems 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.890
 there is contact years we provide 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.470
 support 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.570
 the second boys and I beat of 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.700
 different that just lowers the GDP 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.600
 global about 5 10 points more or less e 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.520
 you need to make registry keys 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.710
 right in the registry in the 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.090
 computer is a system that I have tried 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.350
 long ago we also put them this 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.080
 description because for a little more 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.250
 complicated to tell but there is the 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.660
 network works on other games that 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.150
 it worked better like a battlefield 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.040
 stuff like that on cordoba less but 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.750
 however it is really good 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.210
 if you go looking on the internet 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.070
 no agent says these methods there 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.630
 they work I can assure you that 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.600
 are methods that work because 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.280
 anyway inserting these keys in the 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.200
 register actually go 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.710
 Bring features to windows 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.900
 that steal connection then then in 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.150
 general it is impossible to lower the 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.100
 feeling of 20 30 multi by means of 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.980
