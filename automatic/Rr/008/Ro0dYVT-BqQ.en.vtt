00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.919 

alright<00:00:01.740> hey<00:00:01.920> y'all<00:00:02.129> this<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:03.060> inferior

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
alright hey y'all this is the inferior

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.299 
alright hey y'all this is the inferior
view<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:05.279> brain<00:00:06.170> so<00:00:07.170> firstly<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.890> have<00:00:08.069> the

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
view of the brain so firstly we have the

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.240 
view of the brain so firstly we have the
longitudinal<00:00:09.150> fissure<00:00:09.860> here<00:00:12.710> next<00:00:13.710> we<00:00:14.040> have

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
longitudinal fissure here next we have

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.070 
longitudinal fissure here next we have
the<00:00:14.400> optic<00:00:14.820> nerve<00:00:15.059> here<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:16.250> here<00:00:17.900> then<00:00:18.900> we

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
the optic nerve here in here then we

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.700 
the optic nerve here in here then we
have<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.590> optic<00:00:20.369> chiasm<00:00:21.230> it's<00:00:22.230> kind<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.529> hard

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
have the optic chiasm it's kind of hard

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.800 
have the optic chiasm it's kind of hard
to<00:00:22.740> tell<00:00:22.949> because<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.760> brain<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.150> split<00:00:24.480> but

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
to tell because the brain is split but

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.460 
to tell because the brain is split but
it<00:00:25.380> would<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.859> middle<00:00:26.310> point<00:00:26.490> here<00:00:27.470> next

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
it would be this middle point here next

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.460 
it would be this middle point here next
you<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> optic<00:00:29.369> tract<00:00:30.560> here

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
you have the optic tract here

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.770 
you have the optic tract here
it's<00:00:33.680> going<00:00:33.980> down<00:00:34.160> like<00:00:34.340> that<00:00:34.400> and<00:00:34.940> then

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
it's going down like that and then

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.800 
it's going down like that and then
there's<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.200> other<00:00:36.260> side<00:00:36.440> going<00:00:36.800> down

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
there's the other side going down

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.250 
there's the other side going down
the<00:00:38.810> next<00:00:39.170> you<00:00:39.290> have<00:00:39.500> tuber<00:00:40.450> scenario<00:00:41.450> which

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
the next you have tuber scenario which

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.180 
the next you have tuber scenario which
is<00:00:42.290> this<00:00:42.560> area<00:00:42.920> here<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:45.530> it's<00:00:45.680> like<00:00:45.740> an<00:00:45.920> eggs

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
is this area here so it's like an eggs

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.630 
is this area here so it's like an eggs
here's<00:00:46.790> here's<00:00:47.320> 1/4<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.380> X<00:00:48.560> here's<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.460> next

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
here's here's 1/4 the X here's the next

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.870 
here's here's 1/4 the X here's the next
one

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
one

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.820 
one
so<00:00:50.660> at<00:00:50.720> the<00:00:50.780> top<00:00:50.960> of<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.170> X<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.560> have<00:00:51.620> the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
so at the top of the X you have the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.549 
so at the top of the X you have the
optic<00:00:52.220> nerve<00:00:52.480> then<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.660> bottom<00:00:54.020> parts<00:00:54.290> of<00:00:54.470> the

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
optic nerve then the bottom parts of the

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.790 
optic nerve then the bottom parts of the
X<00:00:54.770> are<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:55.580> optic<00:00:56.030> tract<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:57.470> middle

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
X are the optic tract in the middle

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.060 
X are the optic tract in the middle
point<00:00:58.010> of<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.160> X<00:00:58.400> is<00:00:58.700> the<00:00:59.140> optic<00:01:00.140> chiasm<00:01:00.710> and

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
point of the X is the optic chiasm and

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.670 
point of the X is the optic chiasm and
in<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.059> area<00:01:02.390> between<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.930> bottom<00:01:03.230> pieces<00:01:03.440> of

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
in the area between the bottom pieces of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.110 
in the area between the bottom pieces of
the<00:01:03.770> X<00:01:03.950> is<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.610> tour<00:01:05.000> scenario<00:01:06.700> then<00:01:07.700> next<00:01:07.880> you

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
the X is the tour scenario then next you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.480 
the X is the tour scenario then next you
have<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.390> infundibulum<00:01:08.840> which<00:01:09.650> is<00:01:09.890> this

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
have the infundibulum which is this

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.700 
have the infundibulum which is this
piece<00:01:10.880> here<00:01:11.680> and<00:01:13.750> let's<00:01:14.750> see<00:01:14.930> mammillary

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
piece here and let's see mammillary

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.120 
piece here and let's see mammillary
bodies<00:01:16.150> here's<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:17.450> left<00:01:17.690> one<00:01:18.009> here's<00:01:19.009> the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
bodies here's the left one here's the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.620 
bodies here's the left one here's the
right<00:01:19.460> one

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
right one

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.490 
right one
so<00:01:21.260> there's<00:01:21.439> those<00:01:21.650> two<00:01:21.830> little<00:01:21.950> bumps

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
so there's those two little bumps

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.469 
so there's those two little bumps
cerebral<00:01:24.500> peduncles<00:01:25.009> are<00:01:25.850> these<00:01:26.439> nice<00:01:27.439> beak

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
cerebral peduncles are these nice beak

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.200 
cerebral peduncles are these nice beak
things<00:01:29.479> here

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
things here

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.300 
things here
so<00:01:31.750> that's<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.050> cerebral<00:01:32.470> peduncles<00:01:32.620> and<00:01:33.250> on

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
so that's the cerebral peduncles and on

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.960 
so that's the cerebral peduncles and on
the<00:01:33.430> side<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.730> that<00:01:33.940> you<00:01:34.330> have<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.260> cruise

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
the side of that you have the cruise

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.420 
the side of that you have the cruise
cerebri<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.350> it's<00:01:38.530> just<00:01:38.650> on<00:01:38.800> the<00:01:38.890> side<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.310> it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
cerebri so it's just on the side of it

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.090 
cerebri so it's just on the side of it
and<00:01:39.610> here's<00:01:40.510> about<00:01:40.720> them

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
and here's about them

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.740 
and here's about them
um<00:01:43.170> next<00:01:44.170> we<00:01:44.380> have<00:01:44.590> gyrus<00:01:45.490> rectus<00:01:45.759> which<00:01:46.600> is

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
um next we have gyrus rectus which is

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.609 
um next we have gyrus rectus which is
medial<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.159> olfactory<00:01:48.400> tract<00:01:49.440> so<00:01:50.440> here's

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
medial to the olfactory tract so here's

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.990 
medial to the olfactory tract so here's
gyrus<00:01:51.100> rectus

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.440 

and<00:01:55.220> let's<00:01:56.220> see<00:01:56.460> lateral<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.060> gyrus<00:01:57.420> rectus

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and let's see lateral to gyrus rectus

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.070 
and let's see lateral to gyrus rectus
you<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.170> orbital<00:01:58.940> gyri<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.490> two<00:02:03.080> so

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
you have orbital gyri so this is two so

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.370 
you have orbital gyri so this is two so
the<00:02:04.260> orbital<00:02:04.650> gyri<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.960> rectus<00:02:06.960> gyri

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
the orbital gyri in the rectus gyri

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.220 
the orbital gyri in the rectus gyri
you<00:02:10.010> have<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.370> olfactory<00:02:11.360> tract<00:02:12.020> in<00:02:12.350> bold<00:02:12.710> and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
you have the olfactory tract in bold and

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.010 
you have the olfactory tract in bold and
you<00:02:15.230> have<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.620> olfactory<00:02:16.010> sulcus<00:02:16.850> now<00:02:17.120> this

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
you have the olfactory sulcus now this

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.900 
you have the olfactory sulcus now this
brain<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.620> bootleg<00:02:18.920> brain<00:02:19.130> doesn't<00:02:19.460> have<00:02:19.670> one

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
brain the bootleg brain doesn't have one

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.870 
brain the bootleg brain doesn't have one
on<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.240> I<00:02:20.690> kind<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.930> drew<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:22.520> that<00:02:22.670> just

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
on it I kind of drew it in so that just

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.330 
on it I kind of drew it in so that just
be<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:24.020> know<00:02:24.140> coming<00:02:24.680> off<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.010> olfactory

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
be you know coming off the olfactory

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.840 
be you know coming off the olfactory
bulb<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:27.620> orbital<00:02:28.190> frontal<00:02:28.940> cortex<00:02:29.320> I

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
bulb and the orbital frontal cortex I

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.090 
bulb and the orbital frontal cortex I
really<00:02:31.850> don't<00:02:32.000> know<00:02:32.060> what<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.330> is<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:33.100> I'm

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
really don't know what that is so I'm

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.470 
really don't know what that is so I'm
just<00:02:34.280> gonna<00:02:34.490> go<00:02:34.640> out<00:02:34.700> on<00:02:34.850> a<00:02:34.940> limb<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.150> say<00:02:35.330> it's

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
just gonna go out on a limb and say it's

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.410 
just gonna go out on a limb and say it's
this<00:02:35.810> area<00:02:36.200> here<00:02:36.500> only<00:02:36.830> because<00:02:37.270> here's<00:02:38.270> where

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
this area here only because here's where
