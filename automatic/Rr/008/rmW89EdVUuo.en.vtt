00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.749
 hello friends in this video I'll show you 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.059
 how to unlock or how to release a 

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:09.550
 plant recipe 10 to be able to use with 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.650
 any chip from any part of the 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.190
 world the process is quite safe 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.810
 pretty simple and it's very fast when 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.120
 we block them we will be able to use it with 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.520
 any SIM card anywhere 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:26.570
 of the world including team or vao orange 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.580
 vodafone clear telcel all ok 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.180
 I'm going to show you how to do it 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.430
 step but before we start them 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.650
 I want to mention that this process does not 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.559
 it's free unfortunately and not in a way 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.170
 unlock a blackberry z10 without paying 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.050
 You have to pay but believe me it's worth it 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.269
 have your phone unlocked good 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.460
 as having said this let's start 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.980
 with the process we're just going to 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.089
 need the phone the computer and 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.780
 Internet connection 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.690
 ok we open the menu 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.100
 and let's say nothing towards the application of 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.019
 phone like if we were to do 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.610
 a call we're going down here we do 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.550
 click here 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.250
 and then we open the 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.380
 the keyboard to dial a number and we're going 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.780
 to mark the next command that I'm going to 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:20.140
 zoom the camera a bit asterisk 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:22.510
 numeral 0 6 numeral as you can see the 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.040
 imei number appears on the screen that 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.820
 It is a very 15-digit number 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.350
 important which I have based on this 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.560
 number we are going to generate the code of 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.880
 unlocking your blackberry then 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.000
 Leave it in a nearby place because we're going 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.150
 to need soon and make sure it's 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.910
 of 15 digits and must be correct to the 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.950
 time to enter it later and for now 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.500
 let's move it 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.810
 let's leave it here and we're going to 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.300
 change the camera to the computer 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.150
 because the rest of the process takes place 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.450
 Here in the computer 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.840
 and we're going to fine tune the camera a 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.840
 second 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.650
 and there we are and then we go to the page 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.600
 a lock river dotcom ok on this page 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.690
 let's generate the unlock code 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.880
 of the blackberry 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.010
 that we must fill the form here 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.050
 to the right and here we fill the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.690
 phone information and with that 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.190
 we generate the unlock code 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.560
 mainly we are going to select the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.870
 original company of your blackberry in 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.630
 this case mine is bought in canada 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.940
 in the rogers company, we're going to 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.100
 select this is the original 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.780
 not remember who wants to use it 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.990
 the original then we selected 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.940
 blackberry or the phone brand 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.890
 and then we select the exact model 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.150
 of your blackberry as you can see in this 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.780
 it's a blackberry it's about them we're going 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.930
 here below and we select click here 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.300
 z diaz and then here in the next step 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.820
 it's very important here is where you should 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.370
 enter the 15-digit email number 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.950
 which we acquired at the beginning of the video 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.290
 make sure it is 100% correct what 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.720
 let's compare I already have it saved 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.370
 then I'm just going to copy it and I'm going to 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.370
 paste there but make sure it's 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.590
 it must be copied exactly 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.060
 same as it is on your 15 phone 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.400
 digits and then the next step is 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.650
 click where it says email and here 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.130

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.800
 everything for each good group we're going to 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.800

 enter this code in the blackberry ok 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.020
 let's change the camera

 and we're going to grab the blackberry I'm just going 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:52.490
 to adjust the camera a second 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:56.500
 we are and then we open the blackberry the 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.500
 menu we go to the main screen 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:01.719
 and let's slide the part menu 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.729
 above 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.960
 ok for this we just slide it to 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.539
 down 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.020
 and we click where it says settings or 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.020
 settings 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:17.790
 in English then 6 then we click 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.980

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.370
 and then we click where it says 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:26.400

 ok down here we press the button of a 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.160
 dock network 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:35.010
 then we click here 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.310
 and as you can see this one has only two 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.650
 attempts available here below 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.780
 normally they have 10 attempts but if 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.910
 have 2 I recommend contacting a 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.620
 block weaver so I put them in another 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.290

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.270

 we received in the mail and now 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.320
 enter it the phone will be 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.129
 completely unlocked then what 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.669
 I'm going to enter 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:05.189

 88 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.870
 29 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.370
 6 and make sure it is correct 

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:19.789
 exactly as you receive it in your 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.710

 unlocked is as simple as this 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.580
