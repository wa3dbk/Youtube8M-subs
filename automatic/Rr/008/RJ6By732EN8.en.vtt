domain company Hagen has decided come up
to<00:00:18.690> combine<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.080> two<00:00:19.230> brands<00:00:19.529> for<00:00:19.920> some

to combine the two brands for some

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.840 
to combine the two brands for some
whatever<00:00:20.820> reason<00:00:21.949> and<00:00:22.949> west<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.400> with<00:00:23.699> the

whatever reason and west on with the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.800 
whatever reason and west on with the
pros<00:00:24.060> pros<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.769> filter<00:00:26.539> is<00:00:27.539> very

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
pros pros is that this filter is very

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.109 
pros pros is that this filter is very
large<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.859> sponge<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.640> main

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
large so the sponge is the main

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.299 
large so the sponge is the main
mechanical<00:00:30.689> sponge<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.050> very<00:00:31.260> very<00:00:31.439> large<00:00:31.590> so

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
mechanical sponge is very very large so

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.860 
mechanical sponge is very very large so
you<00:00:32.369> wanted<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.880> clean<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.510> couple<00:00:33.809> of

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
you wanted to clean it for a couple of

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.600 
you wanted to clean it for a couple of
months<00:00:34.880> dependent<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.059> quote<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.890> another

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
months dependent in quote and another

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.770 
months dependent in quote and another
thing<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.820> liked<00:00:38.969> about<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.480> keeps<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
thing I liked about it is it keeps the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.290 
thing I liked about it is it keeps the
water<00:00:40.170> really<00:00:40.860> really<00:00:41.129> clear<00:00:41.460> which<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:41.940> you

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
water really really clear which is you

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.819 
water really really clear which is you
know<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.660> good<00:00:43.140> thing<00:00:43.379> about<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:45.829> also

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
know and a good thing about it and also

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.860 
know and a good thing about it and also
that<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.489> know<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> give<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> pretty<00:00:48.719> nice

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that you know to give you a pretty nice

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.660 
that you know to give you a pretty nice
bag<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.410> cement<00:00:50.309> ceramic<00:00:50.910> rings<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.829> mean<00:00:52.829> as

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
bag of cement ceramic rings I mean as

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.400 
bag of cement ceramic rings I mean as
you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.239> pretty<00:00:54.390> much<00:00:54.570> along<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you can see it's pretty much along the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.430 
you can see it's pretty much along the
whole<00:00:55.559> coat<00:00:55.800> purpose<00:00:56.610> that's<00:00:56.789> pretty<00:00:57.059> large

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
whole coat purpose that's pretty large

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.270 
whole coat purpose that's pretty large
so<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.329> okay<00:01:00.329> now<00:01:00.359> dump<00:01:00.930> time<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.289> pose<00:01:01.590> I'm

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
so and okay now dump time to pose I'm

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.910 
so and okay now dump time to pose I'm
gonna<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.969> cons<00:01:03.409> which<00:01:04.409> there<00:01:04.799> are<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
gonna go to the cons which there are a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.670 
gonna go to the cons which there are a
lot<00:01:05.159> more<00:01:05.189> cons<00:01:05.700> than<00:01:06.030> pros<00:01:07.549> um<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:10.409> main

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
lot more cons than pros um the main

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.240 
lot more cons than pros um the main
major<00:01:11.310> con<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
major con I have with this is that the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.130 
major con I have with this is that the
fact<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.939> some<00:01:15.210> defined<00:01:15.600> debris<00:01:15.960> because

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
fact like some defined debris because

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.520 
fact like some defined debris because
this<00:01:17.210> sponge<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.350> is

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
this sponge is like as you can see is

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.780 
this sponge is like as you can see is
not<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.979> finest<00:01:20.490> bunch<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:23.250> like

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
not the finest bunch you can get so like

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.840 
not the finest bunch you can get so like
the<00:01:24.060> carbon<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.009> fun<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.340> base<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the carbon it's like the fun to base a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.760 
the carbon it's like the fun to base a
lot<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.150> fun<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.689> breathe<00:01:27.900> gonna<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.560> caught

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
lot of fun to breathe gonna get caught

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.819 
lot of fun to breathe gonna get caught
by<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:28.950> carbon<00:01:30.079> instead<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.290> know<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:31.680> by

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
by the carbon instead you know but by

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.600 
by the carbon instead you know but by
the<00:01:31.890> main<00:01:32.130> mechanical<00:01:33.380> portion<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.250> you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the main mechanical portion of it so you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.789 
the main mechanical portion of it so you
go<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> coughing<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:36.930> quick<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.409> I

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
go to coughing really really quick and I

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.149 
go to coughing really really quick and I
well<00:01:38.369> my<00:01:39.299> thing<00:01:39.540> sparsely-populated<00:01:40.159> like

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
well my thing sparsely-populated like

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.490 
well my thing sparsely-populated like
you<00:01:41.430> know<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.850> fission<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.299> 40<00:01:42.600> gallons<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
you know for fission of 40 gallons so a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.469 
you know for fission of 40 gallons so a
deal<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:45.329> went<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.710> bag<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.369> carbon<00:01:47.850> per

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
deal and I went to a bag of carbon per

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.719 
deal and I went to a bag of carbon per
about<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:49.110> three<00:01:50.040> weeks<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.430> like

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
about like three weeks so that was like

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.999 
about like three weeks so that was like
the<00:01:53.790> main<00:01:54.329> major<00:01:54.689> Koerner<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.799> it

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the main major Koerner I have of it

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.870 
the main major Koerner I have of it
another<00:01:57.000> con<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.659> love<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.770> from<00:01:59.729> I

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
another con I love it is that from I

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.030 
another con I love it is that from I
think<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.299> least<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.869> filter<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:01.979> too

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
think at least this filter was way too

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.969 
think at least this filter was way too
heavy<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.790> mean<00:02:03.450> yeah<00:02:03.810> yes<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:04.530> aware<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.920> is

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
heavy I mean yeah yes I'm aware this is

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.859 
heavy I mean yeah yes I'm aware this is
large<00:02:05.369> filter<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.060> once<00:02:06.210> were<00:02:06.450> filled<00:02:06.780> with

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
large filter but once were filled with

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.290 
large filter but once were filled with
all<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.380> media<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.280> water

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
all the media and water

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.850 
all the media and water
this<00:02:09.599> filter<00:02:10.440> weighs<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.920> lot

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
this filter weighs a lot

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.790 
this filter weighs a lot
in<00:02:13.450> fact<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.630> way<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:14.840> much<00:02:15.320> that<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.710> was

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
in fact a way so much that it was

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.560 
in fact a way so much that it was
actually<00:02:15.980> bending<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.670> frame<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.450> my<00:02:18.080> tank

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
actually bending the frame of my tank

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.800 
actually bending the frame of my tank
and<00:02:20.570> I'm<00:02:20.960> using<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.770> 40<00:02:22.280> gallon<00:02:22.430> tank<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.150> it's

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
and I'm using a 40 gallon tank and it's

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.300 
and I'm using a 40 gallon tank and it's
just<00:02:24.080> I've<00:02:24.230> been<00:02:24.260> on<00:02:24.560> top<00:02:24.710> for<00:02:24.770> him<00:02:25.040> really

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
just I've been on top for him really

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.950 
just I've been on top for him really
like<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.000> lot<00:02:26.360> like<00:02:26.890> about<00:02:27.890> half<00:02:28.100> inch<00:02:28.370> or<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:28.960> so

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
like a lot like about half inch or so so

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.170 
like a lot like about half inch or so so
you<00:02:30.410> know<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:31.270> I'm<00:02:32.270> down<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:32.720> filter<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.560> mean

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
you know I I'm down this filter I mean

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.940 
you know I I'm down this filter I mean
so<00:02:35.180> just<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.630> word<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.780> caution<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:36.440> filter<00:02:36.770> is

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
so just a word of caution this filter is

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.450 
so just a word of caution this filter is
heavy<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:39.470> know<00:02:39.590> unless<00:02:39.830> it's<00:02:40.040> at<00:02:40.220> you

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
heavy and you know unless it's at you

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.640 
heavy and you know unless it's at you
know<00:02:40.520> cone<00:02:41.330> filter<00:02:41.630> Foster<00:02:42.230> fell<00:02:42.410> right<00:02:42.530> on

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
know cone filter Foster fell right on

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.810 
know cone filter Foster fell right on
top<00:02:42.860> of<00:02:42.890> here<00:02:44.710> that's<00:02:45.710> come<00:02:46.010> like<00:02:46.430> unless<00:02:46.700> you

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
top of here that's come like unless you

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.270 
top of here that's come like unless you
do<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.150> this<00:02:48.050> filter<00:02:48.440> is<00:02:48.620> going<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.920> burn

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
do that this filter is going to burn

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.870 
do that this filter is going to burn
through<00:02:49.550> carbon<00:02:50.200> really<00:02:51.200> very<00:02:51.380> quick<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:52.850> uh

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
through carbon really very quick so uh

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.100 
through carbon really very quick so uh
oh<00:02:54.130> yeah<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.490> one<00:02:55.790> myth<00:02:56.060> them<00:02:56.510> I'm<00:02:56.780> going<00:02:57.020> to

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
oh yeah and one myth them I'm going to

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.760 
oh yeah and one myth them I'm going to
pump<00:02:58.010> out<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.460> that<00:02:58.820> they<00:02:59.510> say<00:02:59.750> that<00:03:00.020> water<00:03:00.290> can

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
pump out is that they say that water can

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.400 
pump out is that they say that water can
bypass<00:03:01.430> through<00:03:02.000> here<00:03:02.270> like<00:03:02.510> directly<00:03:02.900> into

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
bypass through here like directly into

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.530 
bypass through here like directly into
to<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.250> rest<00:03:04.460> of<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.670> chamber<00:03:05.030> without<00:03:05.150> going

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
to the rest of the chamber without going

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.080 
to the rest of the chamber without going
to<00:03:05.630> mechanical<00:03:06.290> um<00:03:06.890> that's<00:03:07.580> actually<00:03:07.940> not

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
to mechanical um that's actually not

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.440 
to mechanical um that's actually not
true<00:03:08.770> because<00:03:09.770> if<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.370> looked<00:03:10.640> it's<00:03:11.060> really

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
true because if you looked it's really

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.960 
true because if you looked it's really
no<00:03:11.540> Iroquois<00:03:11.990> to<00:03:12.170> bypass<00:03:12.620> like<00:03:13.430> what<00:03:13.610> happens

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
no Iroquois to bypass like what happens

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.350 
no Iroquois to bypass like what happens
it<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.180> one<00:03:14.420> gets<00:03:14.660> drawn<00:03:14.960> into<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.380> tube<00:03:15.710> and

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
it is the one gets drawn into a tube and

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.650 
it is the one gets drawn into a tube and
go<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.840> turns<00:03:18.739> around<00:03:18.860> goes<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.459> bottom<00:03:19.910> and

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
go and turns around goes the bottom and

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.100 
go and turns around goes the bottom and
it's<00:03:20.900> forced<00:03:21.170> up<00:03:21.410> doing<00:03:22.070> mechanical<00:03:23.110> but

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
it's forced up doing mechanical but

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.150 
it's forced up doing mechanical but
after<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:25.150> as<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.360> can<00:03:26.450> see<00:03:26.510> this<00:03:27.160> slotted

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
after that as you can see this slotted

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.030 
after that as you can see this slotted
areas<00:03:28.280> in<00:03:28.820> a<00:03:29.000> media<00:03:29.239> tray<00:03:29.450> over<00:03:29.570> there

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
areas in a media tray over there

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.550 
areas in a media tray over there
the<00:03:31.700> watch<00:03:31.880> will<00:03:32.239> actually<00:03:32.570> call<00:03:32.690> Pat<00:03:32.989> past

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
the watch will actually call Pat past

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.150 
the watch will actually call Pat past
the<00:03:34.720> foam<00:03:35.720> here<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:36.320> it's<00:03:36.650> not<00:03:36.830> really

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
the foam here so it's not really

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.300 
the foam here so it's not really
bypassing<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:37.910> mechanical<00:03:38.840> part<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:40.130> main

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
bypassing the mechanical part the main

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.660 
bypassing the mechanical part the main
mechanic<00:03:40.760> or<00:03:40.850> at<00:03:40.910> least<00:03:41.200> in<00:03:42.200> my<00:03:42.440> bypass<00:03:43.130> like

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
mechanic or at least in my bypass like

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.520 
mechanic or at least in my bypass like
another<00:03:44.150> secretary<00:03:44.540> mechanical<00:03:45.200> if<00:03:45.290> you<00:03:45.350> have

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
another secretary mechanical if you have

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.949 
another secretary mechanical if you have
like<00:03:45.800> if<00:03:46.070> you<00:03:46.190> save<00:03:46.400> decide<00:03:46.820> to<00:03:46.940> cut<00:03:47.570> off<00:03:47.660> go<00:03:47.930> to

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
like if you save decide to cut off go to

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.250 
like if you save decide to cut off go to
floss<00:03:48.459> do<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.489> go<00:03:50.000> past<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.390> in<00:03:50.510> my<00:03:50.720> bypassed

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
floss do a go past it in my bypassed

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.220 
floss do a go past it in my bypassed
that<00:03:51.550> so<00:03:52.550> that's<00:03:53.060> another<00:03:53.570> caution<00:03:53.959> thing<00:03:54.110> all

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
that so that's another caution thing all

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
that so that's another caution thing all
heavy<00:03:54.800> about<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:56.030> once<00:03:56.540> again<00:03:56.720> pros<00:03:57.350> gets<00:03:58.130> the

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
heavy about so once again pros gets the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.570 
heavy about so once again pros gets the
water<00:03:58.430> really<00:03:59.270> really<00:03:59.480> clear<00:03:59.950> but<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.280> cons

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
water really really clear but the cons

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.020 
water really really clear but the cons
are<00:04:01.850> this<00:04:02.120> thing<00:04:02.330> is<00:04:02.450> heavy

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
are this thing is heavy

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.900 
are this thing is heavy
it<00:04:05.030> burns<00:04:05.330> did<00:04:05.570> carbon<00:04:06.020> really<00:04:06.320> really<00:04:06.530> quick

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
it burns did carbon really really quick

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.030 
it burns did carbon really really quick
and<00:04:07.910> if<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:08.510> plan<00:04:08.780> on<00:04:08.810> putting<00:04:09.110> like<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.590> fine

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
and if you plan on putting like a fine

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.550 
and if you plan on putting like a fine
filter<00:04:10.459> floss<00:04:10.550> right<00:04:10.820> here<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.300> love<00:04:12.170> is<00:04:12.350> going

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
filter floss right here a love is going

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.340 
filter floss right here a love is going
bypassed<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.250> as<00:04:13.340> well

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
bypassed that as well

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.140 
bypassed that as well
but<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.530> simple<00:04:15.860> fix<00:04:16.040> for<00:04:16.190> bypassing<00:04:16.880> is<00:04:17.000> you

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
but the simple fix for bypassing is you

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.219 
but the simple fix for bypassing is you
know<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.330> guess<00:04:17.720> try<00:04:18.470> some<00:04:20.020> some<00:04:21.020> foam<00:04:21.200> tape

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
know I guess try some some foam tape

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.710 
know I guess try some some foam tape
that's<00:04:21.710> non<00:04:22.039> toxic<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.550> fish<00:04:22.700> and<00:04:23.120> just<00:04:23.300> line

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
that's non toxic to fish and just line

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.480 
that's non toxic to fish and just line
that<00:04:23.750> up<00:04:23.930> over<00:04:24.289> there<00:04:24.440> so<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.680> way<00:04:25.010> army<00:04:25.400> it

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
that up over there so that way army it

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.960 
that up over there so that way army it
does

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
does

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.830 
does
go<00:04:26.120> dude<00:04:26.560> so<00:04:27.560> um<00:04:27.970> yeah<00:04:28.970> I<00:04:29.000> guess<00:04:29.150> that'd<00:04:29.510> be<00:04:29.780> the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
go dude so um yeah I guess that'd be the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.520 
go dude so um yeah I guess that'd be the
conclusion<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.410> my<00:04:30.530> very<00:04:30.800> first<00:04:31.010> video
