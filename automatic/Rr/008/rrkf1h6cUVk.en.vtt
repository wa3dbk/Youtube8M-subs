 the university on the internet 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.309
 two university keywords on the internet we will try to explain the 

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:29.270

 min the university is not an entity without body 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.740
 the university is a space a space for debate 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.740
 for reasoned discussion for reflection 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.380
 a space in which different words spoken by diverse people 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.240
 they make up culture creativity research 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.690
 the teacher's task is key proposes issues in few issues 80 discussions 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.650
 the degrees and masters offered by the unit are official and valid throughout 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.750
 the European Union its structure, organization and functioning have been 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.580
 designed in accordance with the parameters and requirements of the European 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.900
 higher education 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.020
 the university is a community that teachers and students 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.650
 but how can this be done in the 21st century how this community is formed 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.280
 Thanks to the new technologies, the student is accompanied with an efficiency 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.640
 new 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.170
 the university on the internet offers a space to train professionals and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.720
 competent researchers and is committed to the success of the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.770
 student 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.190
 here is that space for the analysis of texts and facts a 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.700
 reflection space 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.610
 for the debate between teachers and students to build the 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.510
 knowledge 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.510
 and what is more important the intellectual habits 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.860
 they remember what the website of the olympics of barcelona was like 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.479
 you know why 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:15.149
 because he did not have 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:17.489
 the times advance very fast 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.720
 and the internet puts at our disposal unsuspected instruments only 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:22.560
 some years 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.540
 the question we ask ourselves now is how do you do this in practice where 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.029
 is the campus of the university 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:32.049
 in the university on the internet there are no gardens or buildings of the faculties 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.049
 no sports facilities 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.200
 there is a virtual campus 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.589
 and all the members of this university move for him 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:42.090
 from lab the virtual 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.090
 students have access to all the necessary teaching material 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.029
 each subject 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:52.169
 recommended documentation information of interest for understanding the 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.169
 Signature accounts for evaluation and follow-up 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.319
 the student advances in the study of each subject 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.249
 students also go to class but in the union to various types of 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.089
 lessons 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:09.169
 First of all, virtual classroom sessions directly with the students 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:13.059
 each one from where you can find current real examples are barcelona 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.729
 kazakhstan argamasilla oval 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:17.000
 attend class 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.690
 and there to the teacher 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.819
 and you can ask your questions 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.569
 télam 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.280
 everything that is taught 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.310
 milan can be understood without the air music there that the augured 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.049
 compliance to all 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.629
 we also need ivan ljubicic to constantly the sea and the 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.439
 constant dynamics 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.620
 what just happened 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.119
 It is an educational vehicle of the first order 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.510
 teachers explain and share a digital whiteboard 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.909
 in which they can even put auditions and three lessons 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.620
 but above all, a high level of student participation 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.230
 talking to the teacher and asking him questions while he clarifies 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.939
 all kinds of questions 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.540
 these classes are recorded in such a way that any student can return 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.349
 to see them in deferred 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.509
 the second type of classes are the so-called master classes 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.169
 that is to say 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.550
 those excavated by the professors of the subjects 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.029
 the student can see when he wants 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:18.209
 I teach you other examples illustrate the possibilities of this type of classes 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.569
 télam 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:22.470
 art missions 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.470
 category great masterpieces of art 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:27.809
 let's see an example 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.809
 in which in the attempted downtown bombing 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:37.389
 before the characters we say that it has a correlation coefficient 1 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.319
 by last 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.749
 students also have seminars recorded by teachers 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:45.389
 guests who delve into the more interesting others 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.379
 bm 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:48.870
 we are by lenin 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.800
 of a man 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.039
 It's fundamental 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.389
 that a composer 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.479
 silva luján and they change and he had an intention to say we do not have a thing 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.180
 different the environment the students find themselves with a complete network of 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.340
 service stations I like to highlight two things one the weekly organization 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.150
 of work 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.599
 but above all I like to talk about the figure of professor dr 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.709
 each student is assigned a tutor to accompany him in 

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:17.499
 Your learning process 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:22.059
 his job is not to teach a subject but to guide each 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:23.020
 student 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.720
 be your usual interlocutor throughout the course and provide support and help 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.849
 need 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.439
 support it in the elaboration of the work plan according to the personal profile 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.259
 answer queries about the operation of the virtual classroom and others 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.740
 administrative procedures inform you about all the events scheduled in 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.290
 the subjects and carry out an individual follow-up during the 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:46.699
 learning process 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.370
 making use of the virtual classroom communication tools and 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.860
 through telephone contact we contacted the students 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.210
 and we asked them to send us a greeting so they too would be present 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.409
 in the video of his university 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.669
 immediately began to arrive recordings made with the mobile and 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.169
 others with a mini-camera 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.580
 I leave you with them who are the real protagonists because their success is 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.580
 our commitment 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.159
 leaving aside the reality 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:21.499
 everything was taken out 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.499
 the second issue of the n-ii 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:28.219
 how does he work and the golden ball 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.300
 the detail of the interviewee 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.249
 so your project came 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:38.599
 in this house 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.599
 specifically in this bridge the desk 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.110
 Kings Villa Bisonó 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.979
 the poster of no entries 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.979
 the writing of

 on Sunday showing that having eliminated 

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:59.789
 after a few days 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:01.460
 current wood 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.460
 but 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:08.039
 in action of the Rioja because I 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:12.379
 in this team but you have to have temporary measures 

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:30.559
 hedegaard is a need to restructure 

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:33.559
 theater of material 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.409
 will be in total impunity in a talk with him 

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:45.309

 leandro n 

00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:49.029
 my life 

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:50.599
 as well 

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:56.629
 ine through which the client in Castilla y León and adds 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.779
 the only thing that takes away 

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.550
 an agile way indepaz opinion
