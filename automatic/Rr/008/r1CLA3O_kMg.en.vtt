white<00:00:38.969> storyline<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.250> two<00:00:41.489> previous

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
white storyline because the two previous

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.299 
white storyline because the two previous
tournaments<00:00:42.329> both<00:00:42.540> had<00:00:42.809> her<00:00:43.100> starting<00:00:44.100> out<00:00:44.190> of

tournaments both had her starting out of
the<00:00:44.370> Queen<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:44.940> transforming<00:00:45.539> into<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the Queen and then transforming into the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.319 
the Queen and then transforming into the
hag<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.070> focus<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> hag<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
hag so here I just focus on the hag and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.660 
hag so here I just focus on the hag and
her<00:00:48.600> Queen<00:00:48.840> form<00:00:49.170> would<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.440> focused<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.010> when

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
her Queen form would be focused on when

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.350 
her Queen form would be focused on when
she<00:00:50.879> gets<00:00:51.210> resurrected<00:00:51.899> later<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.620> around<00:00:52.829> six

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
she gets resurrected later on around six

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.700 
she gets resurrected later on around six
now<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.390> set<00:00:54.660> her<00:00:54.719> up<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.870> fight<00:00:55.079> with<00:00:55.230> electro

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
now I set her up to fight with electro

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380 
now I set her up to fight with electro
mainly<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> whole<00:00:56.789> bolt<00:00:57.210> of

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
mainly because of the whole bolt of

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.599 
mainly because of the whole bolt of
lightning<00:00:57.899> thing<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:59.219> don't<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.550> a

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
lightning thing so they don't have a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.979 
lightning thing so they don't have a
connecting<00:00:59.969> factor<00:01:00.180> or<00:01:00.480> anything<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.899> was

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
connecting factor or anything it was

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.889 
connecting factor or anything it was
just<00:01:01.020> footage<00:01:02.010> worked<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.579> was<00:01:03.420> actually

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
just footage worked I was actually

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.420 
just footage worked I was actually
originally<00:01:04.170> thinking<00:01:04.619> about<00:01:05.040> having<00:01:05.189> her

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
originally thinking about having her

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.580 
originally thinking about having her
squish<00:01:05.850> electro<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> boulder<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
squish electro with the boulder just to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.890 
squish electro with the boulder just to
be<00:01:07.680> kind<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.010> funny<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.850> ironic<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.840> know

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
be kind of funny and ironic but you know

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.870 
be kind of funny and ironic but you know
it<00:01:10.110> was<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.380> too<00:01:10.500> much<00:01:10.650> work<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.369> figured

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it was just too much work and I figured

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.060 
it was just too much work and I figured
what<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> heck<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.530> get<00:01:13.619> more<00:01:13.740> use<00:01:13.950> out

what the heck up I can get more use out
of<00:01:14.130> electro<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:16.080> electro<00:01:16.830> plummets

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
of electro and so on electro plummets

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.880 
of electro and so on electro plummets
her<00:01:17.460> knocked<00:01:18.390> her<00:01:18.509> off<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> cliff<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.799> her

her knocked her off the cliff to to her

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.719 
her knocked her off the cliff to to her
do<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> next<00:01:21.720> why<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
do so the next why we have here is

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.749

enchantress versus Maleficent this fight

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.200 
enchantress versus Maleficent this fight
was<00:01:27.060> um<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.250> round<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.150> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
was um going to be in round one but I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.660 
was um going to be in round one but I
pushed<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.600> back<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.840> round<00:01:31.020> two<00:01:31.369> just<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.490> kind

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
pushed it back to round two just to kind

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
pushed it back to round two just to kind
of<00:01:32.729> save<00:01:32.970> Maleficent<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.689> round<00:01:33.810> two<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.290> fact

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
of save Maleficent for round two in fact

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.319 
of save Maleficent for round two in fact
um<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.860> think<00:01:34.920> that's<00:01:35.430> kind<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.729> trend<00:01:36.030> with

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
um I think that's kind of a trend with

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.300 
um I think that's kind of a trend with
the<00:01:36.450> series<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.930> Maleficent's<00:01:37.560> fight<00:01:37.740> starts

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the series is Maleficent's fight starts

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.030 
the series is Maleficent's fight starts
at<00:01:38.520> round<00:01:39.180> two<00:01:39.450> instead<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.810> round<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.350> but

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
at round two instead of round one but

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.350 
at round two instead of round one but
just<00:01:41.220> something<00:01:41.490> interesting<00:01:41.970> i've<00:01:42.030> noted

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
just something interesting i've noted

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.340 
just something interesting i've noted
and<00:01:43.880> these<00:01:44.880> two<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.149> thought<00:01:45.600> really<00:01:45.899> went<00:01:46.229> well

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
and these two I thought really went well

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.539 
and these two I thought really went well
together<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:46.770> they're<00:01:47.130> both<00:01:47.310> like

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
together because they're both like

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.240 
together because they're both like
witches<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.149> sorceresses<00:01:48.659> maybe<00:01:49.439> sort<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.130> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
witches and sorceresses maybe sort of a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.819 
witches and sorceresses maybe sort of a
rematch<00:01:50.610> later<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.720> two<00:01:51.960> occasions<00:01:52.259> but

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
rematch later on on two occasions but

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.410 
rematch later on on two occasions but
not<00:01:53.159> really<00:01:53.399> because<00:01:53.579> enchantress<00:01:54.270> would

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
not really because enchantress would

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.749 
not really because enchantress would
have<00:01:54.540> helped<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.380> did<00:01:55.500> Maleficent<00:01:56.070> so

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
have helped and so did Maleficent so

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.600 
have helped and so did Maleficent so
anyways<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.960> Diablo<00:01:58.860> gets<00:01:59.040> turned<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.369> stone

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
anyways and Diablo gets turned to stone

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.700 
anyways and Diablo gets turned to stone
in<00:01:59.820> this<00:01:59.939> fight<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.869> pretty<00:02:01.140> much<00:02:01.229> ignore

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
in this fight but I pretty much ignore

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.530 
in this fight but I pretty much ignore
that<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> rest<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> series<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.479> I

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
that for the rest of the series so I

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.060 
that for the rest of the series so I
think<00:02:03.719> my<00:02:03.810> explanation<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.770> is

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
think my explanation for that is

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.240 
think my explanation for that is
Maleficent<00:02:05.790> either<00:02:06.000> revived<00:02:06.780> Diablo<00:02:07.439> or<00:02:07.680> just

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
Maleficent either revived Diablo or just

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.540 
Maleficent either revived Diablo or just
got<00:02:08.459> herself<00:02:08.580> another<00:02:08.970> Raven<00:02:09.479> that's

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
got herself another Raven that's

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.100 
got herself another Raven that's
whatever<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.879> take<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.150> as<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:15.110> so

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
whatever just take it as it is and so

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.190 
whatever just take it as it is and so
yeah<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.890> have<00:02:17.629> execution<00:02:18.629> or<00:02:18.720> save<00:02:18.989> in

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
yeah I have execution or save in

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.600 
yeah I have execution or save in

hyenas<00:03:37.560> goose-stepping<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.670> doing<00:03:38.909> that

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
hyenas goose-stepping and doing that

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.979 
hyenas goose-stepping and doing that
sort<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.209> thing<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.599> he's<00:03:39.720> kind<00:03:39.930> of

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
sort of thing and he's kind of

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.059 
sort of thing and he's kind of
reminiscent<00:03:40.319> of<00:03:40.440> Hitler<00:03:40.680> so<00:03:40.799> I<00:03:40.830> thought<00:03:40.950> it

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
reminiscent of Hitler so I thought it

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.420 
reminiscent of Hitler so I thought it
kind<00:03:41.159> of<00:03:41.250> worked<00:03:41.430> out<00:03:41.549> um<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.840> haven't<00:03:43.680> really

hint at him working for Maleficent with

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.560 
hint at him working for Maleficent with
the<00:04:18.150> whole<00:04:18.299> eye<00:04:18.329> thing<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:19.759> Jafar<00:04:20.759> fights<00:04:21.239> in

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
every round up to Round four

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.800 
every round up to Round four
mainly<00:04:24.610> because<00:04:24.730> I<00:04:24.910> wanted<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.180> get<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.510> whole

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
mainly because I wanted to get a whole

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.780 
mainly because I wanted to get a whole
lot<00:04:25.840> of<00:04:26.140> use<00:04:26.290> out<00:04:26.530> of<00:04:26.590> Jafar's<00:04:27.340> footage

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
lot of use out of Jafar's footage

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.790 
lot of use out of Jafar's footage
because<00:04:27.910> Jafar<00:04:28.360> does<00:04:28.690> have<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.230> much<00:04:29.440> footage

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
because Jafar does have so much footage

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.730 
because Jafar does have so much footage
because<00:04:30.070> he's<00:04:30.430> he<00:04:31.240> was<00:04:31.360> in<00:04:31.480> three<00:04:31.870> movies<00:04:32.410> and

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
because he's he was in three movies and

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.910 
because he's he was in three movies and
a<00:04:33.550> cheap<00:04:34.060> an<00:04:34.210> episode<00:04:34.660> of<00:04:34.690> a<00:04:34.810> TV<00:04:34.960> show<00:04:35.350> so<00:04:35.680> he

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
a cheap an episode of a TV show so he

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.220 
a cheap an episode of a TV show so he
had<00:04:36.040> a<00:04:36.070> lot<00:04:36.250> of<00:04:36.280> footage<00:04:36.520> on<00:04:36.730> hand<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.230> I

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
had a lot of footage on hand and I

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.600 
had a lot of footage on hand and I
thought<00:04:38.950> it<00:04:39.040> worked<00:04:39.250> out<00:04:39.370> really<00:04:39.430> well

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
thought it worked out really well

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.320 
thought it worked out really well
Nicholas<00:04:40.600> scratch<00:04:40.900> is<00:04:41.170> a<00:04:41.200> very<00:04:41.740> very<00:04:42.550> not

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
Nicholas scratch is a very very not

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.180 
Nicholas scratch is a very very not
well-known<00:04:43.570> character<00:04:44.470> that<00:04:44.950> with<00:04:45.100> the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
well-known character that with the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.600 
well-known character that with the
proper<00:04:45.280> grammar<00:04:45.640> whatever<00:04:46.210> um<00:04:46.960> so<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:47.950> kind<00:04:48.580> of

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
proper grammar whatever um so I kind of

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.370 
proper grammar whatever um so I kind of
went<00:04:48.730> to<00:04:48.820> introduce<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.480> few<00:04:49.870> people<00:04:50.200> to

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
went to introduce a few people to

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.470 
went to introduce a few people to
Nicholas<00:04:50.800> scratch<00:04:51.040> here<00:04:51.340> because<00:04:51.640> he's<00:04:52.270> so

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
Nicholas scratch here because he's so

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.350 
Nicholas scratch here because he's so
obscure<00:04:53.080> um<00:04:53.350> and<00:04:54.220> his<00:04:54.730> footage<00:04:55.000> worked<00:04:55.240> really

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
obscure um and his footage worked really

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.740 
obscure um and his footage worked really
well<00:04:55.500> off<00:04:56.500> too<00:04:56.830> far<00:04:57.010> I<00:04:57.070> think<00:04:57.330> both<00:04:58.330> them<00:04:58.570> being

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
well off too far I think both them being

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.960 
well off too far I think both them being
sorcerers<00:04:59.230> and<00:04:59.470> plus<00:04:59.860> Marvel<00:05:00.550> doesn't<00:05:00.850> do

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
sorcerers and plus Marvel doesn't do

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.030 
sorcerers and plus Marvel doesn't do
many<00:05:01.180> sorcerer<00:05:01.660> characters<00:05:02.110> so<00:05:02.620> I<00:05:02.650> had<00:05:02.860> you

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
many sorcerer characters so I had you

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.120 
many sorcerer characters so I had you
know<00:05:03.300> get<00:05:04.300> when<00:05:04.450> I<00:05:04.480> got<00:05:04.780> what<00:05:05.380> I<00:05:05.410> had<00:05:05.650> on<00:05:05.680> hand

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
know get when I got what I had on hand

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.020 
know get when I got what I had on hand
and<00:05:06.420> this<00:05:07.420> bike<00:05:07.660> came<00:05:07.870> off<00:05:08.050> really<00:05:08.260> similar<00:05:08.680> to

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
and this bike came off really similar to

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.790 
and this bike came off really similar to
Jafar's<00:05:10.030> fight<00:05:10.270> with<00:05:10.420> Claudius<00:05:10.990> in<00:05:11.200> Disney

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
versus non Disney Villains but I

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.820 
versus non Disney Villains but I

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
actually edited the fight together

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.750 
actually edited the fight together
before<00:05:15.610> that<00:05:16.420> fight<00:05:16.780> aired<00:05:17.470> on<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:17.860> YouTube<00:05:18.220> so

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
before that fight aired on to YouTube so

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.610 
before that fight aired on to YouTube so
it<00:05:18.820> was<00:05:18.940> more<00:05:19.090> of<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.300> sick<00:05:19.690> coincidence<00:05:20.350> and<00:05:20.590> I

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
it was more of a sick coincidence and I

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.310 
it was more of a sick coincidence and I
recall<00:05:20.980> beating<00:05:21.430> my<00:05:21.550> head<00:05:21.760> on<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.030> table

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
recall beating my head on the table

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.840 
recall beating my head on the table
repeatedly<00:05:23.320> at<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.980> similarities<00:05:24.700> because

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
repeatedly at the similarities because

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.140 
repeatedly at the similarities because
it<00:05:25.060> irritated<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.840> heck<00:05:26.050> out<00:05:26.200> of<00:05:26.230> me<00:05:26.910> not<00:05:27.910> I

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
it irritated the heck out of me not I
