00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.810
 welcome again we are here 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:11.570
 we are here again in this case 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.570
 as I said in other videos 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.290
 and we're going to have several sections one 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.800
 will be in recipe I am another will be both 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.769
 little ones 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.320
 little tricks then the first 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.340
 what I'm going to bring is these to our eyes 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.290
 from Orchard 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.020
 we have left small this year but 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.660
 they are extremely tasty and the truth 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.730
 is that they have a spectacular perfume 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.650
 but in addition they have left small because 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.390
 there has been little water but because we have 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.190
 watered little we have watering by 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.280
 drip who is interested in seeing the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.860
 videos of the garden as you know 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.220
 you enter another section of the channel and 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.220
 see them 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.489
 What I am going to explain is how to peel 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.840
 garlic in an easy way without then 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.240
 you two are absorbing the fingers 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.910
 we take out the garlic cloves is very 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.170
 simple we stick our teeth underneath like 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.410
 is commented on other videos I always 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.840
 he used a knife the truth that I 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.700
 I have very few tools in the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.280
 cook because I do not think 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.520
 they need to have 50,000 stories in 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.260
 machines and for cooking of thermomix 3 and 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.810
 running is one that has had and cook for 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.049
 everything and then if not everything 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.030
 as you will see in a way one way 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:38.100
 normal then in the way of peeling a garlic 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.619
 I hope that with a small knife shed 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.399
 in fruits oil which is the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.399
 garlic oil 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:53.540
 the garlic oil we have left 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.550
 in the hands and then then we're 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.070
 living for a lot of thanks 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.080
 then the simple way we choose the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.479
 the garlic we take that the knife onion 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.960
 over as an illusion for all we hit 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.970
 a blow and then we cut off the tip 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.220
 of this and throwing 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.030
 we cut the other without finishing 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.750
 cut it and throwing racks as we see the 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.480
 Garlic skin comes off the skin 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.000
 underneath it is detached from the eyes 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.940
 dating skins 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.680
 we put them with another simple what 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.230
 important is the blow by blow 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.900
 and the skin separates a blow 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.720
 shorten without finishing cutting like this 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.650
 we investigated and he has already stayed there 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.019
 we cut on the other side 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.439
 and we do the same thing you see a 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.170
 little to be seen unravel and has 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:53.629
 the whole stone was left out but 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.269
 we have seen how to cut the garlic and then 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.860
 does not fly us then here will be left 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.420
 some oil and on the fingers something of 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.250
 oil because we have obviously touched 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.140
 in the eyes then without rubbing us 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.450
 because being an oil is absorbed by 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.189
 the skin just like a cream us that 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.189
 we take a cream and cut ourselves 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.120
 we are favoring the absorption of 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.579
 oil in this case what needs to be done 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.769
 is now if we rubbed where he touched 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.030
 the oil would stay and the same in the 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.099
 knife is simply what we do 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.560
 we open the tap we put our hands 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.530
 below and when passing the jet takes to the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.859
 oil we put told 30 seconds 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.769
 we take the pocket 30 seconds and 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.659
 we have totally clean hands and 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.069
 without any now they smell me 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.519
 because obviously I have not done it yet 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.859
 more courses on how to cut without 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.749
 that then has then flies to the 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:48.530
 time to explain because I also stung the 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:49.999
 garlic with the knife with this 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.170
 knife with the knife be great if 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:54.950
 a big knife we can 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.019
 support beige so you give your fingers that much 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.370
 that we want to cut does not work for us 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.319
 let's hurt the finger be 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.700
 hidden here is normality and if it is 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.829
 here is the bottom finger because these 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.620
 knives cut and cut really in 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.010
 another video I'll talk about knives 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.530
 if I do not roll too much in another video 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.829
 then like peak for example we do 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.829
 A) Yes 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:26.290
 now we count in half and as I have 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.640
 said with fingers 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.640
 backwards then 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:39.160
 we are withdrawing 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:42.310
 we turn over now we have left as we have 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.050
 explained the garlic recipe 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.660
 well they want to grate me more and do not forget 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.130
 the videos then I get very long 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.130
 you see and now 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.300
 I would be ready to place a sauce 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.000
 or in any 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.449
 recipe then all this now that it 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.919
 we have been here fully provided 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:13.840
 the oil fingers of garlic oil 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.180
 Well, simply what we will do now 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.479
 will probably be another part this for 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.590
 what for you to see then 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.970
 just now under the tap 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.210
 is that of course we are studying 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.350
 television I do not have to go in plan 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.880
 simply what we will do is let 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.220
 run water 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.730
 without rubbing without rubbing what is important is 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.730
 do not rub 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.270
 because that way the oil is gone and 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.270
 of the knife the same 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.789
 without cutting 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:51.580
 when water has already fallen, we can already 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:51.580
 the pam pam 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.789
 we ran our fingers and you can not put 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.789
 but I can assure 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.760
 no odor drop 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:08.420
 very well we already know one little thing more about 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.420
 the eyes come back here to the eyes 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.700
 it does not load to the sea 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.800
 another thing if we wanted 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.630
 the garlic repeats the young woman and the young woman who 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.690
 many people say that it came down repeated if 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.120
 we cut the bass in half 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.190
 we see that in the middle this garlic that is 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.260
 well, it has almost no reason why they do not repeat 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.990
 nothing but there are some here from 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.690
 the germ 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.340
 I'm almost do not have but normally 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.830
 here in the middle you take it out I'm here in 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.300
 medium and this is the germ the germ that 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.770
 is where then the 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.870
 plant with its with a clove of garlic and two 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:45.430
 plants are obviously a plant 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:47.470
 garlic normal children if we placed all 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.660
 the head what would come out is a jewel if 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.860
 we place a single tooth we will have a 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.860
 plant that will give heads 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.800
 if we remove the germ the garlic does not 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:01.870
 repeat the truth is that I do not take it away 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.250
 the germ because neither my baby my family 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.889
 does not repeat the disgust but if any of 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.360
 you repeat already you feel screaming 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:11.509
 Forgive him 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:14.350
 of origin I did very well we already know more 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:18.960
 things I hope you liked 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:22.430
 and we will include more tricks 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.430
 sauces more things 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.530
 when we open the recipes section 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.060
 obviously we will be doing 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.950
 recipes in it because simply 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.500
 get to the page the inaugurate good 

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.360
 I hope you liked it I hope that you 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.310
 I have served, I hope you have learned 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.250
 one thing that I did not know because I already 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.460
 I knew I already knew it and I did not because today 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.750
 it will be shortened knowing one more thing 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.920
 thank you very much for everything and as 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.600
 I always tell you in all 

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.080
 videos but please if you liked 

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.680
 it does not cost you anything like little fingers up 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.590
 clicks 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:57.040
 you subscribe and especially comments 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:58.720
 because I upload videos to youtube and if the 

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.670
 people do not tell me things and do not tell me 

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.080
 well wrong but what else does it is that I 

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.370
 you do it because you do not make it longer 

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.410
 because you do not do this because you do not do what 

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.910
 another one that happens that I'm lost the 

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.110
 truth is that we are and millions of 

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.580
 people in many but I do not know 

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.560
 exactly what you like to the possible 

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.210
 public that I'm going to have many 

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.880
 thanks for everything 

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:18.400
 or keeps telling a lot more things a 

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.729
 greeting and with and again thank you very much 

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.729
 for having
