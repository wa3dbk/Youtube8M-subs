00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.819
 good kids how are you going after a couple 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:06.350
 of days after the beta runs out 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:07.549
 we have a video about the patch that 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.619
 he applied the last day in which 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.180
 it worked but before I tell you to ask for forgiveness 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:12.590
 for something that is evident and is that yesterday 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.940
 would not have been direct as announced by 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.740
 twitter since I came up with several 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.599
 unforeseen and in the end it was impossible 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.609
 doing so I ask for your forgiveness as is evident 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.289
 I was really sorry I could not do it at 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.480
 final but things came up that I could not 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.650
 control but good as I tell you and we 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.150
 We will focus on the patch that 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.039
 applied to the beta during his last 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.570
 hours not only for what was changed but 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.400
 for one thing I will tell you something that 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.870
 I really do not know why I try 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.480
 hide since you have seen it in the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.830
 title but obviously we do not follow 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.330
 I'm going to say everything that was done as 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.650
 whenever I make a video of a patch 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.840
 I'm going to leave a link in the description 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.400
 to the team players post and there you have it 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.480
 all well detailed but said this 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.920
 let's start with something that I think 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.960
 quite curious since it is a change 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.370
 quite drastic I did not expect that 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.440
 they will change several weapons on the side of the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.270
 beta in this case the m-45 which is the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.980
 submachine gun of the Second World War and 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.020
 lage 36 that have been transferred from 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.880
 side of the criminals to the police already 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.700
 change the cops have lost the vp and 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.020
 the 416 in a curious change I guess that 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.519
 they thought that one of the two sides 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.749
 it was a bit unbalanced although the 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.999
 truth is that it was not my impression 

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:08.360
 while playing a change that seemed to me 

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:09.800
 very 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.360
 Caesar I was the one with the shotguns at 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.130
 that the reduction has been reduced 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.360
 reach the truth is that I like them 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.430
 the shotguns because it has a great 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.350
 handicap that is to short bushes but to 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.150
 not long and if that breaks I do not think that 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.380
 I still liked clear that if 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.420
 we talk about necessary changes too 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.580
 we could comment on how I tell you very 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.729
 necessary increase of the recoil of the 16th 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.140
 the 416 since they almost did not move apart 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.880
 from that it seems that they have also been lowered 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.229
 the damage I do not see so necessary this 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.000
 second part of the change at least in the 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.950
 416 the truth is that the 16 had a 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.450
 incredible damage model but in short 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.979
 they needed a Mercedes they have already given it 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.570
 we will see if they have passed when it leaves 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.700
 the full game but well let's hope 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.229
 that not in its same class there have been other 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.420
 changes in particular would also be 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.890
 well highlight that of the air in a lot 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.630
 people have complained that they have a lot 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.860
 recoil and while this is something that I 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.630
 I like it a lot because it gives 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.860
 personality to it I think that the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.869
 change is good to make it more 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.070
 viable and much more the damage that 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.410
 is the second part of this modification 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.240
 maybe for the final game it will be 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.560
 more viable medium and long distances 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.050
 which is where he really needed 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.520
 an improvement other than that there has been a 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.140
 pair of changes related to several 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.700
 weapons and other related 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.380
 first aid kits and ammunition boxes 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.239
 that now luckily they will take less in 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.230
 to be able to deploy and less badly because 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.879
 it took a lot 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.739
 throw another and although now we have the 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.629
 resource to take life or ammunition 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.430
 the companions it was not reasonable to have 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.930
 to wait so much talking about that 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.310
 Unfortunately we have had to go back to 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.930
 arrangement of the six seconds of 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.400
 battlefield 4 but I enjoyed 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.799
 enough to have for a few days 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.030
 of a kit that heals according to what you throw and 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.500
 The truth is that it seemed very 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.269
 amazing what visceral has done 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.950
 with this beta apart from running 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.330
 quite well in addition from the beginning 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.920
 I think your effort is praise for 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.690
 our part and more if we take into account 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.670
 that they have not changed what they have given 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.680
 the one thing I've always won 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.819
 complaint with dais as they often change 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.319
 things that we have not asked for and 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.120
 obviously they are the designers 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.220
 the game they know what they do well 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.019
 that are in their right but the truth 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.760
 is that the one that will work at least in the 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.129
 most times it would increase 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.569
 my trust in them besides something else 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.010
 that I did not like it is that many times 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.109
 They refused to listen to us on things 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.609
 stupid as for example in one thing 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.650
 as simple to change as raising the 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.569
 cadence of lage 36 which is something that a 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.099
 a lot of people for a lot of people is not 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.269
 significant but that bothered me 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.400
 quite because we knew perfectly 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.720
 that was not going to be unbalanced as well 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.430
 he has shown it in battlefield 3 and 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.530
 now in fact in heart lane where it has 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.690
 gone back to those wonderful 750 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.040
 decadence and simply to me what I 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.049
 it made me wonder this is because 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.579
 you are so reluctant to change something 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.129
 that you have already proven that you know that 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.109
 to work and if it does not work then it 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.670
 You can change again but we 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.650
 give that vote of confidence because there would be 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.519
 been pretty good or at least a 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.010
 detail that I would have liked 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.390
 quite what I want to tell you with this 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.799
 is that by making this series of changes 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.209
 that we have requested in a period of time 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.829
 so short combined with this 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.689
 so many feature accessibility 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.310
 of its developers may be 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.810
 taking a necessary step to recover 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.150
 the trust of the community after 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.379
 battlefield 4 in short what is going 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.389
 used for this video as the 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.819
 visceral attitude is working at 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.230
 least for me and I hope it lasts a lot and 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.549
 good kids that would be all for the 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.290
 Today's video I hope you liked it 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.049
 leave me of course what you think of 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.709
 the changes and the visceral attitude 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.150
 obviously during this month that 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.859
 we will spend in the garden we will go back to 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.970
 battlefield 4 with what we expect about 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.919
 few videos on Shanghai 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.180
 night between that month and also some 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:15.049
 that another news about the highly anticipated 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.940
 sixth d lc so nothing said this I 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.940
 goodbye goodbye kids
