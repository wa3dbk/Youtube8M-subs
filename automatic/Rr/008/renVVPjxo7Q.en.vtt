00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.680
 in that, I'm all art and what we do here 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.290
 in a new video where I'm going to 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.570
 teach you how to build a wheelbarrow and 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.150
 is that if we go back with these little ones 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.490
 building tutorials of very things 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.500
 simple and good to tell you before 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.050
 start that this wheelbarrow has created it 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.990
 magma news in you will have a link to your 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.210
 channel down in the description so already 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.609
 you know once said that we are going to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.470
 start building this construction 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.260
 It really is the simplest 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.100
 we will only need two tractors 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.610
 a gate of these from the fences and a 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.590
 boat with a slap is already that's it 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.440
 I have the red carpet here but it's for 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.879
 another thing that we will see later like this 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.649
 how good are we going to build it before 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.579
 we all need a block of help to 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.890
 place the slap 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.930
 so floating is worth you can just 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.730
 use anything you could even 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.730
 use a block of these place them and 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.410
 remove it and that's enough and once 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.420
 we have it that way you see that we can place 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.220
 here our after two of these 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.350
 tractors will serve us as 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.600
 wheels as you can see how 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.520
 would be the result we will miss placing 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.920
 here the door that we will place it 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.980
 this way and to finish we will punch 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.230
 the boat and we'll place it like that looking at 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.930
 front and pressing in the middle of the blockade 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.180
 click and we have it as you see here 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.070
 we have our wheelbarrow the truth is 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.410
 which gives a special touch in 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.000
 constructions like that of the west and such and such 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.830
 you have planned to make a house for you 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.480
 desert or just a map of 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.910
 adventures that occur in the far west 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.260
 I think it's a very good way of 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.830
 decoration you see that with the cactus 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.810
 it even looks great so good yo 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.000
 I think it looks great but just in case 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.650
 if someone says there is art and I want 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.320
 a little modification because this 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.869
 it seems very small because of course here 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.600
 Well, if this were real, you put a 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.850
 horse and such and he throws it and I do not know what very 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.440
 well but if you do not want to continue on top of 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.540
 horse and wants to continue riding in the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.850
 Wheelbarrow you do it easy 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.460
 look in a moment I explain it to you only 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.290
 we will need one more slap and one of 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.030
 folder whatever you want the color that more 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.729
 you like it and I in my case I used the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.140
 red but could also have used 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.970
 example of the blue indeed we are going to 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.530
 do it in blue come on let's catch 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.030
 the blue and the only thing he has is 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.280
 closed to mount here a small 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.220
 seat is simply remove this 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.620
 door and remove the boat we will place here 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.530
 another slap with this right over 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.230
 we will place the door here and from 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.299
 Here we put the boat again and already 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.000
 we have as you see here we can sit 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.680
 and until we were perfectly the truth 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.099
 that of course I would need to be able to sit 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.230
 but here I can not but basically this 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.940
 As you know, they are decorative things 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.129
 they are not designed to work 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.780
 true but good as you see here the 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.060
 it's really pretty cool 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.370
 I love the style of this guy 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.560
 of decoration are so simple but 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.260
 that are so effective and so useful to the 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.239
 time and the truth is that this is one of 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.859
 them so well this has been all 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.269
 for today's video remember to give me 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.500
 like to subscribe you are these and 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.750
 share it with your friends 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.849
 this joint acid and we'll go back to 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.849
 see before what you think
