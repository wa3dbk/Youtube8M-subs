00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
the day we we probably felt as if we

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.169 
the day we we probably felt as if we
could<00:00:07.919> have<00:00:08.069> come<00:00:08.189> away<00:00:08.309> with<00:00:08.580> three<00:00:08.820> points

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
could have come away with three points

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.030 
could have come away with three points
but<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.719> know<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.260> go<00:00:10.440> over<00:00:10.620> there<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:10.920> get<00:00:10.980> a

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
but you know to go over there and get a

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.220 
but you know to go over there and get a
draw<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.639> come<00:00:12.269> back<00:00:12.450> from<00:00:12.630> one<00:00:12.809> kneel<00:00:12.990> down<00:00:13.170> I

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
draw and come back from one kneel down I

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.230 
draw and come back from one kneel down I
think<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.309> conditions<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.940> think<00:00:14.969> we

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
think and in the conditions I think we

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.330 
think and in the conditions I think we
did<00:00:15.389> quite<00:00:15.570> well<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.320> honest<00:00:16.619> even<00:00:16.770> at<00:00:17.010> all

weeks<00:00:27.689> now<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.109> was<00:00:28.199> sending<00:00:28.890> off<00:00:29.150> in

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
weeks now but was sending off in

weeks now but was sending off in
Brisbane<00:00:30.900> ah<00:00:32.930> for<00:00:33.930> me<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.079> definitely<00:00:34.500> think<00:00:34.980> it

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
Brisbane ah for me I definitely think it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.170 
Brisbane ah for me I definitely think it
was<00:00:35.809> you<00:00:36.809> know<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> guess<00:00:37.590> for<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.670> angle<00:00:39.090> of

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
was you know I guess for the angle of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.030 
was you know I guess for the angle of
the<00:00:39.270> referee<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.930> things<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.920> was

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the referee and things like that it was

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.910 
the referee and things like that it was
it<00:00:41.250> was<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> tough<00:00:41.610> angle<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:42.120> him<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.360> see<00:00:42.570> but

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
it was a tough angle for him to see but

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.220 
it was a tough angle for him to see but
in<00:00:43.920> my<00:00:44.129> mind<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.640> dropped<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.210> ball<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.660> only

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
in my mind I dropped the ball and only

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.819 
in my mind I dropped the ball and only
the<00:00:46.350> ball<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.399> with<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> second<00:00:48.420> yellow<00:00:48.829> it

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
the ball and with the second yellow it

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.069 
the ball and with the second yellow it
was<00:00:49.950> actually<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.210> little<00:00:51.870> bit<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
was actually just for a little bit of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.600 
was actually just for a little bit of
push<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.440> shove<00:00:52.469> before<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> corner<00:00:53.460> kick

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
push and shove before a corner kick

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.580 
push and shove before a corner kick
which<00:00:54.239> normally<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> don't<00:00:55.170> see<00:00:55.260> too<00:00:55.500> many

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
which normally you don't see too many

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.500 
which normally you don't see too many
yellows<00:00:55.949> fall<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.460> if<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.000> didn't<00:00:57.270> try<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
yellows fall but if I didn't try and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.970 
yellows fall but if I didn't try and
make<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.809> tackle<00:00:58.050> he<00:00:58.379> was<00:00:58.530> he<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:58.859> of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
make that tackle he was he was of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.700 
make that tackle he was he was of
one-on-one<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.550> goal<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.140> defender

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
one-on-one on goal so as a defender

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.410 
one-on-one on goal so as a defender

initial squad you get an injury and

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.120 
initial squad you get an injury and

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
yeah but I think this depends also

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.310 
yeah but I think this depends also

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
because it was one of those games are

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.040 
because it was one of those games are
you<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.970> know<00:02:55.120> when<00:02:55.300> they<00:02:55.510> have<00:02:55.540> been<00:02:55.690> lost<00:02:55.900> at

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
something tactical to hopefully change

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.030 
something tactical to hopefully change
that<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.060> I<00:03:01.090> think<00:03:01.150> overall<00:03:02.019> we<00:03:02.290> did<00:03:02.319> as<00:03:02.860> it

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
that and I think overall we did as it

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.400 
that and I think overall we did as it
seemed<00:03:03.220> really<00:03:03.430> well<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:05.019> position

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
seemed really well and the position

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.960 
seemed really well and the position
radiant<00:03:05.800> coming<00:03:06.040> came<00:03:06.340> into<00:03:06.489> play<00:03:06.760> he'd

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
radiant coming came into play he'd

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:20.569 
radiant coming came into play he'd
fulfilled<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.319> did<00:03:08.500> very<00:03:08.739> well<00:03:08.769> for

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.870 

the<00:03:21.579> pleasing<00:03:22.060> things<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:23.380> far<00:03:23.760> certainly<00:03:24.760> has

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
the pleasing things so far certainly has

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.600 
the pleasing things so far certainly has
been<00:03:25.079> dhabi<00:03:26.079> wind<00:03:26.290> it's<00:03:26.530> not<00:03:26.709> another<00:03:27.340> game

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
been dhabi wind it's not another game

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.069 
been dhabi wind it's not another game
but<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.910> was<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:28.030> special<00:03:28.180> game<00:03:28.630> with<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.870> full

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
but it was a special game with the full

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.949 
but it was a special game with the full
full<00:03:29.799> house<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.510> reaction<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.780> team

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
full house and the reaction of the team

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.600 
full house and the reaction of the team
was<00:03:32.140> fantastic<00:03:32.680> but<00:03:32.829> more<00:03:33.010> pleasingly<00:03:33.489> I

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
was fantastic but more pleasingly I

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.729 
was fantastic but more pleasingly I
think<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.180> we<00:03:34.299> actually<00:03:34.420> we<00:03:35.140> deserved<00:03:35.530> to

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
think is that we actually we deserved to

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.039 
think is that we actually we deserved to
win<00:03:35.769> so<00:03:36.340> we<00:03:36.700> didn't<00:03:37.060> come<00:03:37.540> away<00:03:37.660> from<00:03:37.900> that

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
win so we didn't come away from that

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.199 
win so we didn't come away from that
game<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.440> people<00:03:38.680> say<00:03:38.769> oh<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:39.670> was<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:39.820> lucky

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
game and people say oh it was a lucky

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.880 
game and people say oh it was a lucky
win<00:03:40.359> and<00:03:40.480> all<00:03:40.570> that<00:03:40.750> we<00:03:40.840> deserved<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.560> in

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
win and all that we deserved it and in
