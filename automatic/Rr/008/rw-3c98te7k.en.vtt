00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.990
 Welcome to the guitar learning 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.690
 in five minutes it is really possible 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.250
 this daring statement really 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.810
 you will not live up to it 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.460
 Do not think your buddies will 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.950
 Think your family will be off the chair 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.990
 fall when you play the guitar 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.490
 learn to hear and you even learn before 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.040
 Maybe nothing has to do 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.870
 even totally unmusical at least 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.250
 did not designate and now up 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.100
 once it somehow realizes that 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.690
 worked this video is for you 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.239
 If you have a guitar somewhere 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.859
 have found and you're wondering if you're up 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.350
 who can play at all 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:52.079
 and I would like to convince you 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.210
 and show you how easy it is 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.609
 can be guitar to play with this 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.829
 Method really works 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.809
 I do a simple trick and that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.089
 I leave the left hand by the way 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.220
 play the hardest on is that I 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.080
 completely free that means you can already 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.150
 so a bit freehand with the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.880
 playing left hand up guitar 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.040
 and it sounds really good 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.600
 I played once before and then show 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.619
 I walked you step by step as we did 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.619
 whole will be implemented 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.380
 you probably already know the title 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.320
 is it after finger matters of the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.390
 world famous band metallica and the 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.679
 The beginning is so easy that you get yours 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.450
 Do not use your left hand anymore 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.700
 must and just with the right one 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.890
 You can start playing immediately 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.250
 we start with the thumb up here 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.990
 the deep e string how to pluck these 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.039
 deepest side only thumb acting once 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.149
 very light and make them sound 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.429
 important is that we have a little space 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.929
 have the pages also nice free 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.270
 swing as soon as you get here with the 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.280
 a sweater or a shirt on it 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.550
 Of course, nothing more rauszuholen 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.160
 the instrument 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.540
 this beautiful sounding guitar sound 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.729
 we get generated when we are whole 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.320
 evenly with your right hand 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.240
 pluck the following pattern what I you 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.100
 will show in detail now 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.740
 we catch here at the deepest side 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.470
 with the thumb and pluck the once 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.300
 then turn on with show and 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.370
 continue with the ring finger in connection 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.640
 on the following three pages on the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.470
 bottom 3 yes so after we now with 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.030
 have the thumb played the e page 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.440
 the deep here is with the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.810
 index finger then continue with the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.370
 middle finger with the ring finger and 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.990
 then it goes back that's it and we 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.800
 start here playing from the beginning again 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:49.960
 with the thumb the deep side to show 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:53.560
 with the center of the ring show the sixth page 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.080
 third page 2 of the page first page 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.800
 second page third page 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.130
 and you take care that it is so 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.740
 even as possible 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.850
 So that sounds in quite even 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.850
 decency come 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.650
 thumb pointing medium- 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.370
 ring medium 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.080
 the finger 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.750
 sixth his third second first 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.330
 second 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.400
 and here is important that you with the 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.770
 fingering if they played that you 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.180
 then in the air from the sides 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.890
 little bit off the pages 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.540
 can swing freely as soon as you 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.890
 here again on it belong the 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.890
 sounding on the pages is clear 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.010
 It may be that I might do it that way 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.500
 sounds like you're fingering too 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.090
 Stay tuned here if you like her 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.470
 have done work then we send them 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.470
 in the evening, so to speak 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.530
 If so, we'll pick you up from the party 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.440
 back out in the game and play 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.390
 here again and the beautiful on the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.940
 this pattern is provided on the plan, the 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.920
 the sounds are so close together 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.160
 swing up and harmonize that 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.200
 really nice sounds there and if you 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.700
 that is not audible to anyone 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.410
 know that you have something to do with guitar 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.910
 it could happen that it already did 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.709
