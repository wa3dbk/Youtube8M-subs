very nice long shot from work is that
his<00:01:51.000> shots<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.570> dip<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.200> well<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.860> keepers

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
his shots just dip so well the keepers

his shots just dip so well the keepers
just<00:01:53.640> don't<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.000> chance<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.450> along<00:01:54.630> with

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
just don't have a chance and along with

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.660 
just don't have a chance and along with
being<00:01:54.899> able<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.200> score<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.799> his<00:01:55.950> feet<00:01:56.189> from

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
being able to score with his feet from

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.819 
being able to score with his feet from
range<00:01:56.939> I'm<00:01:57.240> inside<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.719> box<00:01:57.990> he<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.469> also<00:01:58.590> had

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
range I'm inside the box he can also had

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.200 
range I'm inside the box he can also had
a<00:01:58.860> ball<00:01:59.070> as<00:01:59.159> well<00:01:59.189> obviously<00:01:59.670> he's<00:01:59.969> quite

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
a ball as well obviously he's quite

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850 
a ball as well obviously he's quite
short<00:02:00.450> five<00:02:00.719> foot<00:02:00.750> nine<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.439> he's<00:02:01.500> got<00:02:01.680> good

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
short five foot nine but he's got good

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.560 
short five foot nine but he's got good
jumping<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.369> he<00:02:02.460> actually<00:02:02.579> does<00:02:02.880> win<00:02:03.299> quite<00:02:03.540> a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
jumping so he actually does win quite a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.850 
jumping so he actually does win quite a
lot<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.840> headers<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.409> do<00:02:04.530> want<00:02:04.680> across

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
lot of headers so if you do want across

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.649 
lot of headers so if you do want across
to<00:02:04.979> him<00:02:05.040> then<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.610> am<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.820> wouldn't<00:02:06.060> advise<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.329> as

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
to him then I am I wouldn't advise it as

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.479 
to him then I am I wouldn't advise it as
much<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.409> am<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.829> definitely<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.310> if

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
much but I am it can definitely do it if

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.499 
much but I am it can definitely do it if
you<00:02:08.580> need<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:08.970> look<00:02:09.090> at<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.300> ball

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
you need to and look at this ball

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.420 
you need to and look at this ball
control<00:02:09.810> loses<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.289> wins<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> back<00:02:10.770> cuts<00:02:11.280> back

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
control loses it wins it back cuts back

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.430 
control loses it wins it back cuts back
inside<00:02:11.720> incredible<00:02:12.720> finish

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
inside incredible finish

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.170 
inside incredible finish
so<00:02:13.770> effective<00:02:14.370> at<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.670> because<00:02:14.820> he<00:02:15.030> just

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
so effective at that because he just

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.030 
so effective at that because he just
retrieved<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.690> ball<00:02:15.720> as<00:02:16.110> soon<00:02:16.530> as<00:02:16.620> he<00:02:16.680> loses

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
retrieved the ball as soon as he loses

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.800 
retrieved the ball as soon as he loses
it<00:02:17.070> which<00:02:17.520> is<00:02:17.700> just<00:02:17.940> ridiculous<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.570> look<00:02:18.720> at

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
it which is just ridiculous and look at

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.330 
it which is just ridiculous and look at
this<00:02:18.870> ball<00:02:19.050> control<00:02:19.320> close<00:02:19.590> control<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.220> and

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
this ball control close control in and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.010 
this ball control close control in and
out<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.580> defense<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.150> there<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.810> can't

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
out of the defense and there you can't

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.180 
out of the defense and there you can't
give<00:02:22.110> him<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.260> much<00:02:22.440> spit<00:02:22.620> he<00:02:22.860> will<00:02:22.980> score

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
give him that much spit he will score

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.830 
give him that much spit he will score
that<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.940> goes<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.390> back<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.690> there

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
that and it goes in the back in there

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.930 
that and it goes in the back in there
due<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.260> issues<00:02:25.530> at<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.890> top<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.160> him<00:02:26.400> it

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
due to issues at the top of him it

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.760 
due to issues at the top of him it
wasn't<00:02:27.210> perfect<00:02:27.360> like<00:02:27.990> most<00:02:28.230> strikers<00:02:28.650> and

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
wasn't perfect like most strikers and

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.160 
wasn't perfect like most strikers and
was<00:02:29.550> his<00:02:29.850> left<00:02:30.090> foot<00:02:30.240> can<00:02:30.420> lay<00:02:30.540> down<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:30.960> try

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
was his left foot can lay down so try

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.240 
was his left foot can lay down so try
and<00:02:31.260> shoot<00:02:31.380> was<00:02:31.530> right<00:02:31.710> for<00:02:31.800> as<00:02:31.920> much<00:02:32.040> as<00:02:32.100> you

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
and shoot was right for as much as you

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.760 
and shoot was right for as much as you
can<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.670> also<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.420> shot<00:02:33.630> power<00:02:33.810> from<00:02:34.440> time<00:02:34.650> to
