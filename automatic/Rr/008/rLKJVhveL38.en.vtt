00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.150
 I will show you the procedure to make this store 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.909
 with cloisonné and black porcelain 150 

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:11.579
 and the colors applied flat could work on this support 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.499
 enameled like this 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.230
 from china to china 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.230
 the important thing is to have a very clean and dry support 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.220
 with the products of water going to work 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.069
 and well at first with the fleeting felt 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.159
 who he is in front of the om 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.170
 then we will trace 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.170
 with the cloisonné porcelaine 105 45 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.880
 and then we'll use the colors applied with the brush 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.490
 in these spaces 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.760
 fishmonger 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.149
 so he is equipped 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.410
 but a cannula 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.350
 before starting on the chat is always hunted in nice at the om 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.150
 here 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.479
 it's a paper 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.479
 hoyer that refines regular 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.660
 then beating the drying half an hour 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.660
 before applying inside the surface in the film 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.300
 nahla always stir the colors but never help the benjamins 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.179
 under help could create cuts 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.040
 but then we risk being very embarrassed 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.210
 during the application 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.210
 see you have a nice color palette that 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.070
 but we had to apply 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.070
 but if we will fill 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 myspace here 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.390
 I go to the next color 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.659
 see that I do not pull too much on the color that poses but as long as I 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.730
 color charge 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.720
 so it's important to work 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.350
 roughly on the same horizontal surface like that that's why 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.740
 because in fact if I turn my store if I turn it a lot 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.609
 the colors are going to fall because I have seen heavily loaded 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:29.599
 now 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.049
 is waiting 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.819
 twenty-four drying 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.789
 now my colors are dry 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.789
 I will be able to make clear mag 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.549
 he returns but more is in the meadow 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.719
 p put an end to my flaws to properly check the temperature why 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.989
 it's the temperature of me crazy back pedaling 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.959
 the colors may change 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.200
 it is for example the temperature 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.429
 and both are 30 degrees 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:05.019
 they will be less than duly be the bcl once the temperature will be 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.019
 stable we count not five minutes 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:10.779
 my friend is ready 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.369
 I can use it 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:13.799
 and not just in the microwave
