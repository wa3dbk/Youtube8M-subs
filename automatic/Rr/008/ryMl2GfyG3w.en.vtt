00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
the importance about keeping your pump

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.880 
the importance about keeping your pump
pot<00:00:11.220> strainer<00:00:11.700> cleaned<00:00:12.540> out<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.410> turn<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:13.890 
pot strainer cleaned out so you turn the

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.250 
pot strainer cleaned out so you turn the
system<00:00:14.070> off<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.120> open<00:00:15.450> up<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:16.740> lid<00:00:16.980> and

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
system off and you open up the lid and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.020 
system off and you open up the lid and
normally<00:00:19.260> you're<00:00:19.410> gonna<00:00:19.560> find<00:00:19.860> some<00:00:20.369> dirt<00:00:20.789> and

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.030 
normally you're gonna find some dirt and

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.080 
normally you're gonna find some dirt and
debris<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.390> here<00:00:21.660> today<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.800> have<00:00:22.830> leaves<00:00:23.310> so

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
debris in here today we have leaves so

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.800 
debris in here today we have leaves so
just<00:00:24.930> simply<00:00:25.170> take<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.470> over<00:00:25.560> here<00:00:26.600> pop<00:00:27.600> it<00:00:27.630> out

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
just simply take it over here pop it out

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.179 
just simply take it over here pop it out
and<00:00:29.270> go<00:00:30.270> ahead<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.380> reinstall<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.859> now<00:00:32.129> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
and go ahead and reinstall it now the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.670 
and go ahead and reinstall it now the
reason<00:00:32.699> that<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.180> very<00:00:33.390> important<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.500> keep

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
reason that it's very important to keep

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.459 
reason that it's very important to keep
this<00:00:34.859> clean<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.640> because<00:00:36.479> as<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.989> can<00:00:37.109> see<00:00:37.319> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
this clean is because as you can see the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.880 
this clean is because as you can see the
pump<00:00:38.429> motor<00:00:38.609> is<00:00:38.999> right<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.140> there's<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
pump motor is right here and there's the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.410 
pump motor is right here and there's the
water<00:00:41.239> comes<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:43.370> through<00:00:44.809> here<00:00:46.010> and<00:00:47.420> is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
water comes in through here and is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.719 
water comes in through here and is
pulled<00:00:48.899> through<00:00:49.409> this<00:00:49.559> little<00:00:49.769> opening<00:00:50.670> right

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
pulled through this little opening right

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:53.539 
pulled through this little opening right
there<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.449> right<00:00:51.749> behind<00:00:51.929> here<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.859> what's

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:53.549 
there and right behind here is what's

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.669 
there and right behind here is what's
called<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.909> impeller<00:00:54.359> now<00:00:55.049> the<00:00:55.109> impeller

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
called the impeller now the impeller

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.919 
called the impeller now the impeller
spins<00:00:56.159> similar<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.089> a<00:00:57.709> propeller<00:00:58.709> on<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> plane

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
spins similar to a propeller on a plane

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.939 
spins similar to a propeller on a plane
and<00:01:00.929> if<00:01:01.769> you<00:01:01.979> don't<00:01:02.249> keep<00:01:02.429> this<00:01:02.699> cleaned<00:01:03.389> out

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
and if you don't keep this cleaned out

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.890 
and if you don't keep this cleaned out
what<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.070> happen<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.850> sometimes<00:01:06.360> dirt<00:01:06.780> and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
what can happen is sometimes dirt and

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.050 
what can happen is sometimes dirt and
debris<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.710> get<00:01:07.920> caught<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> impeller

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
debris can get caught in the impeller

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.560 
debris can get caught in the impeller
and<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:10.170> will<00:01:10.260> cause<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.650> motor<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.160> overheat

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
and it will cause the motor to overheat

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.590 
and it will cause the motor to overheat
also<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.380> don't<00:01:13.500> keep<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.920> cleaned<00:01:14.280> out

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
also if you don't keep this cleaned out

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.320 
also if you don't keep this cleaned out
the<00:01:15.600> draw<00:01:15.930> from<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.890> water<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:18.090> needs

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
the draw from the water this this needs

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.040 
the draw from the water this this needs
to<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.480> have<00:01:19.260> a<00:01:19.290> good<00:01:19.860> flow<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.130> water<00:01:21.050> that's

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
to be have a good flow of water that's

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.500 
to be have a good flow of water that's
why<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.230> can<00:01:22.470> see<00:01:22.680> all<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> little<00:01:24.150> holes<00:01:24.270> in

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
why you can see all the little holes in

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.110 
why you can see all the little holes in
here<00:01:24.750> when<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.680> gets<00:01:25.920> clogged<00:01:26.310> up<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.880> dirt

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
here when this gets clogged up with dirt

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.570 
here when this gets clogged up with dirt
and<00:01:27.240> debris<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.990> causes<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.560> motor<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.370> pull

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
and debris it causes the motor to pull

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.720 
and debris it causes the motor to pull
harder<00:01:30.210> which<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.080> cause<00:01:31.320> overheating<00:01:31.860> so

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
harder which can cause overheating so

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.700 
harder which can cause overheating so
it's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.940> very<00:01:33.150> important<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.140> keep<00:01:34.290> your<00:01:34.410> pump

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
it's a very important to keep your pump

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.300 
it's a very important to keep your pump
hot<00:01:34.920> strainer<00:01:35.610> clean<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.890> do<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.010> maybe

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
hot strainer clean and do that maybe

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.380 
hot strainer clean and do that maybe
once<00:01:38.610> or<00:01:38.760> twice<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.000> week<00:01:40.910> so<00:01:41.910> that's<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.270> is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
once or twice a week so that's it is

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.850 
once or twice a week so that's it is
very<00:01:42.630> simple<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.350> keep<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.650> clean

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
very simple just keep it clean

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.620
