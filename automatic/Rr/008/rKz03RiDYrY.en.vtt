 maltese lover welcome to ski 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.000
 brazil number 6 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.870
 I'm 2 felipe and today I'll tell 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.210
 you 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.139
 two types of johnnie walker red 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.440
 label 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.630
 A lot of people do not know but they have more than 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.170
 a type of johnnie walker red label 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.050
 let's go to them the first many people already 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.050
 simply drank and june the old car 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.119
 false leblon because it is 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.070
 It is very common in brazil people 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.369
 enjoy the bottle of johnnie walker 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.219
 red label and place within it a 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.760
 national whiskey would be a case you 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.180
 fill the bottle already with national writing 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.420
 and so pass the Brazilian 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.160
 this is very common in nightclubs in some 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.989
 Brazil's botecos they also do this 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.800
 unfortunately it is difficult to control 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.300
 this is a very common practice in the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.000
 Brazil therefore does not advise anyone 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.920
 baby next to the big field reminds nightclub 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.140
 in bar because it's difficult for you 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.210
 make sure you 're drinking whiskey 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.880
 original 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.909
 unless you know the good owner 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.220
 we are going to a second type junior break of 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.740
 good law sold in brazil he is not 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.950
 national and yes in Brazil he has 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:25.920
 a doser inside it and comes with the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.259
 crisis but which itself out doser 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.250
 that's what I say here it's so here 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.670
 plastic 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.920
 it is used to control the dosage of 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.530
 ski on the goal in the cup and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.020
 make it difficult for the person put the other 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.700
 that within him it hinders him 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.270
 does not prevent it is sold in brazil 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.250
 and behind the sold in Brazil have 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.840
 information in Portuguese allows fifth 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.200
 with information in Portuguese 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.700
 remember johnny walker black label is 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.030
 produced in scotland 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.280
 then it is imported the one with the meter he does not 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.600
 is the national is simply the one sold in the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.750
 Brazil 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.849
 the third type that is this is a 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.110
 version out of Brazil 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.270
 what is the name of more countries? 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.200
 developed that will not stay this 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.200
 on here 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.050
 and it matters little the doser that is the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.860
 American version is behind mickey 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.080
 English 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.800
 if in Germany allows has 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.099
 German 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.140
 in italy the italian and so on 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.120
 if brescia here I'll open here 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.200
 For you, I have a version of him. 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.330
 thumbnail is the same as a nokia sold 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.790
 that in the United States because if here already 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.080
 is flat for you to put in the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.530
 jackets 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.459
 so if I open here to open sealed 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.580
 broke the seal 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.319
 Look here they do not have a donor so you are 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.390
 easy to put in the cup this here in 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.349
 even easier for you to fill with 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.720
 other esq 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.209
 But how did you win that the Brazilian is 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.950
 very cheap here and here goes to the trash 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.940
 no one is interested in filling another 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.819
 ski to sell again here we have 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.400
 junk milk produced for 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.680
 countries let us say the first world or 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.380
 developed countries such as jazz already 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.940
 We're talking nowadays, I think. 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.060
 here is very easy you put a 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.609
 sticker a hive that a party like 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.980
 person in Brazil a crisis well 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.230
 bum 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.540
 well this is keeping it closed and so 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.000
 I can try this one. 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.790
 review about this one in 200ml and will 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.530
 for putin jacket 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:41.340
 the third type will have the case now 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:44.510
 what would be the fourth type that is the part 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.400
 good phase being exposed type 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:52.650
 fourth type of eye on any layman 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.680
 here he does not come with joni ronnie esse 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.609
 Here, my affection is seeing eliana from the left. 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.709
 to the right 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:03.000
 everyone knows and the common good is the 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.769
 johnnie walker is the game is walking in the 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.040
 older versions that I have here 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:13.650
 miniature does not appear jonny this 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.930
 The 1940s version even has a cork coming 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.910
 even with stopper 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.430
 well this fourth version of johnnie 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.500
 walker red label original 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.000
 Nothing wrong with it. I bought the 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.440
 thumbnail because I'm not interested 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 in large bottles 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.570
 I'm not a person who likes 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.070
 much of my defeat really naked does not 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.110
 is my forte 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.520
 nothing wrong with who you like then 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.090
 I bought it here to try the taste 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:43.890
 of a whiskey produced a long time ago 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:46.680
 we now have here the fifth of the 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:51.180
 in this case presented here 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.220
 by the oc of 1960 the fifth title john 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.500
 walker walking backwards 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.060
 here is a June he is walking 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.890
 right to left and here from 1960 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.980
 already was an era that produced a 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.410
 Very good time, so I decided 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.550
 try and I got this show who 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.050
 the term miniature correct the thumbnail of 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.020
 a German author 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.140
 produced in 1960 this lens 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.840
 here's a tw there because it was delivered to 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.510
 twh airline that is now part of 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.760
 da america online 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:30.150
 a detail if you are seeing here 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.950
 side by side are you going thinking here 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.020
 This is darker than this one. 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.570
 here with a previous 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.530
 It's actually because there's more Scott here. 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.000
 so it influences when you are seeing 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.280
 There's more scott here behind the 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.169
 The one that was most scott here already has 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.190
 - scott one after another but the thing 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.020
 same number as the agreement with the same 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.340
 because many years they put a 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.150
 caramel syrup to have this color 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.540
 well 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.570
 Only the latest version is missing the 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.880
 sixth version the sixth version of johnnie 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.720
 walker red label is the version that is 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.910
 sold in bottles or cans is 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.700
 or johnny walker red label glue 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.860
 He's coming. I had it ready for you. 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.970
 drink as if from an ok radio globe 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.919
 with coke 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.260
 only that a simpler coca cola does not 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.620
 so let's say a generic 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.729
 then this would be the sixth version of June 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.610
 to the breaking of the lehman 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.530
 this version is very common in australia 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.320
 because Australia is a country much more 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.039
 too hot to make 40 degrees is not much 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.200
 common 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.360
 so they prefer bb won either with 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.550
 coca cola and so company already sells 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.949
 ready for you ready 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.300
 ready to be consumed ready for 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:47.129
 drink 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.539
 This is the sixth version of johnnie walker. 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:51.210
 red label 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:53.250
 so we have the first false a 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.919
 second is sold in brazil with donor 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.780
 and the third is sold out of the bar at 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:00.389
 Brazil in a developed country without a 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.409
 the doser called is quite 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:05.400
 interesting 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:09.419
 I have no pain the fourth version s unita 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:13.529
 here in June he has won the fifth 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:15.779
 version is with jonny walking backwards and 

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:16.979
 accept the version is johnnie's tin 

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:19.529
 walker red label 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:21.389
 So people thought I had a 

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:24.150
 good walk Brazilian version but not 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:26.639
 there are more and those lucky enough to have 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:29.310
 This johnnie walker here in 1960 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:31.139
 guarded by his grandfather at home who 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.810
 saved to collect will stay 

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:36.210
 surprised with taste that is very good 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:40.319
 the next video is talking about 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:42.090
 dye in the ski that is what we call 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:44.900
 today of caramel syrup 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.900
 to the next
