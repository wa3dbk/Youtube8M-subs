sounds enter I've had a bit of trouble

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.319 
sounds enter I've had a bit of trouble
installing<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.300> portal<00:00:34.050> 2<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:36.000> retro

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
installing the portal 2 and the retro

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.209 
installing the portal 2 and the retro
I've<00:00:36.510> tried<00:00:36.809> different<00:00:36.989> sort<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> retro<00:00:37.680> sound

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
I've tried different sort of retro sound

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.190 
I've tried different sort of retro sound
packs<00:00:38.460> I've<00:00:38.850> actually<00:00:39.149> gotten<00:00:39.420> one<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.989> work

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
packs I've actually gotten one to work

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.410 
packs I've actually gotten one to work
so<00:00:40.440> far<00:00:40.739> which<00:00:40.950> they<00:00:41.489> all<00:00:41.610> seem<00:00:41.850> kind<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.239> dodgy

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
so far which they all seem kind of dodgy

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.060 
so far which they all seem kind of dodgy
because<00:00:42.750> they<00:00:42.870> seem<00:00:43.110> all<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.649> place<00:00:43.890> so

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
because they seem all out of place so

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.790 
because they seem all out of place so
basically<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> sound<00:00:44.940> pack<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.590> texture<00:00:46.590> pack

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
basically a sound pack is a texture pack

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.100 
basically a sound pack is a texture pack
but<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> sound<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.480> alters<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
but just the sound it just alters the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990 
but just the sound it just alters the
sound<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> best<00:00:50.039> way<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.280> test<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.789> out

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
sound so the best way to test this out

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.360 
sound so the best way to test this out
is<00:00:51.180> hopefully<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.469> minecraft<00:00:52.800> loud

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
is hopefully I have minecraft loud

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.000 
is hopefully I have minecraft loud
enough<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.149> play<00:00:54.329> some<00:00:54.539> TNT<00:00:54.840> down<00:00:55.350> while<00:00:55.980> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
enough if I play some TNT down while I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.799 
enough if I play some TNT down while I
we<00:00:56.250> fly<00:00:56.520> away<00:00:56.760> you'll<00:00:56.969> actually<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.449> able<00:00:57.539> to

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
we fly away you'll actually be able to

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.420 
we fly away you'll actually be able to
hear<00:00:58.109> the<00:01:00.199> classical<00:01:01.199> minecraft<00:01:01.680> explosion

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.800 
reahard this sound I was amazed i used
to<00:01:07.170> make<00:01:07.320> TNT<00:01:07.619> cannons<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.820> blow<00:01:08.880> him<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
to make TNT cannons and blow him up and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.940 
to make TNT cannons and blow him up and
blowed<00:01:10.409> pigs<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.310> days<00:01:11.580> all<00:01:12.119> right<00:01:12.950> all

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
blowed pigs up for days all right all

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.219 
blowed pigs up for days all right all
right<00:01:14.010> we'll<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.150> enough<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> TNT

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
right we'll have enough of the TNT

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.870 
right we'll have enough of the TNT
action<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.310> also<00:01:17.430> muck<00:01:17.729> around

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
action here but you can also muck around

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.570 
action here but you can also muck around
whether<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.840> sounded<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.100> test<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.490> out

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
whether the sounded just to test it out

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.130 
whether the sounded just to test it out
then<00:01:20.850> they'll<00:01:21.060> play<00:01:21.240> around<00:01:21.509> with<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> sound

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
then they'll play around with the sound

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.560 
then they'll play around with the sound
pack<00:01:22.380> now<00:01:22.830> let's<00:01:23.340> get<00:01:23.430> back<00:01:23.490> into<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.060> option

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
pack now let's get back into the option

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.840 
pack now let's get back into the option
so<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.049> press<00:01:25.229> f9<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:26.460> actually<00:01:26.729> get

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
so you have to press f9 to actually get

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.330 
so you have to press f9 to actually get
into<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.299> audio<00:01:27.780> Tory<00:01:28.080> options<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.040> can

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
into the audio Tory options and you can

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.880 
into the audio Tory options and you can
basically<00:01:29.579> choose<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.659> actual<00:01:31.140> sound<00:01:31.619> pack

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
basically choose what actual sound pack

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.399 
basically choose what actual sound pack
you<00:01:32.070> want<00:01:32.369> now<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.240> example<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.930> want<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
you want now for example if you want to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.410 
you want now for example if you want to
at<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> same<00:01:34.920> time<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.549> enable<00:01:35.909> them<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
at the same time you can enable them and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.179 
at the same time you can enable them and
can<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.689> two<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.020> same<00:01:37.290> time<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.979> so

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
can have two at the same time but so

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.429 
can have two at the same time but so
which<00:01:38.400> one<00:01:38.579> whatever<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.570> higher<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:39.869> will

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
which one whatever one is higher up will

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.940 
which one whatever one is higher up will
overwrite<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.570> example<00:01:42.600> if<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.740> want

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
overwrite it so for example if I want

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.039 
overwrite it so for example if I want
deportment<00:01:44.369> predominantly<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.180> want<00:01:45.509> portal<00:01:45.869> 2

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
deportment predominantly I want portal 2

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.289 
deportment predominantly I want portal 2
sounds<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.700> playing<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.240> I'll

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299

Tory<00:03:00.930> I've<00:03:01.170> actually<00:03:01.290> tested<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.830> out<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.040> it

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
Tory I've actually tested it out and it

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.979 
Tory I've actually tested it out and it
does<00:03:02.340> work<00:03:02.610> without<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.390> mud<00:03:03.600> but<00:03:03.810> they

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
does work without the mud but they

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.229 
does work without the mud but they
actually<00:03:04.230> they<00:03:05.160> have<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.459> sort<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.700> switch<00:03:06.030> and

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
actually they have to sort of switch and

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.620 
actually they have to sort of switch and
swap<00:03:06.540> what<00:03:07.230> sort<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.940> like<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.060> sound<00:03:09.360> pack
