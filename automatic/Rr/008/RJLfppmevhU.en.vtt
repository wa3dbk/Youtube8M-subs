these iphone 5c and iphone 5s rumors we

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.149 
these iphone 5c and iphone 5s rumors we

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
some real parts this time over the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.660 
some real parts this time over the
fingerprint<00:01:43.710> scanning<00:01:43.920> technology<00:01:44.520> there's

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
fingerprint scanning technology there's

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.310 
fingerprint scanning technology there's
apparently<00:01:44.880> coming<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> home

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
apparently coming to just the home

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.319 
apparently coming to just the home
button<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.799> iPhone<00:01:46.920> 5s<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.880> not

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
button of the iPhone 5s and not

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.870 
button of the iPhone 5s and not
necessarily<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:49.380> whole<00:01:49.590> display<00:01:50.070> but

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
necessarily the whole display but

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.670 
necessarily the whole display but
remember<00:01:51.360> Apple<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.079> company<00:01:52.530> that

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
remember Apple is this company that

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.649 
remember Apple is this company that
loves<00:01:53.009> prototyping<00:01:53.820> they<00:01:54.000> love<00:01:54.299> trying

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
loves prototyping they love trying

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.330 
loves prototyping they love trying
different<00:01:54.899> things<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.680> they<00:01:55.829> probably<00:01:56.070> are

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
different things and they probably are

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.800 
different things and they probably are
trying<00:01:56.640> both<00:01:56.820> things<00:01:57.119> at<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.299> same<00:01:57.390> time

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
trying both things at the same time

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.170 
trying both things at the same time
whatever<00:01:58.560> happens<00:01:59.130> regardless<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.880> really

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
whatever happens regardless it's really

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.340 
whatever happens regardless it's really
cool<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> see<00:02:00.600> if<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> home<00:02:00.990> button<00:02:01.200> is

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
cool to see if the home button is

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.230 
cool to see if the home button is
finally<00:02:01.740> gonna<00:02:01.890> get<00:02:02.100> more<00:02:02.399> functionality<00:02:03.119> but

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
finally gonna get more functionality but

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.209 
finally gonna get more functionality but
obviously<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:04.200> could<00:02:04.409> all<00:02:04.469> be<00:02:04.649> bitched<00:02:04.979> at

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
obviously this could all be bitched at

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.530 
obviously this could all be bitched at
last<00:02:05.430> minute<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:05.909> let's<00:02:06.149> see<00:02:06.240> how<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.390> goes

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
last minute so let's see how that goes

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.660 
last minute so let's see how that goes
and<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.619> laughed<00:02:07.890> about<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.280> Nokia<00:02:08.640> Lumia

925 being considered a phablet what it's

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.430 
925 being considered a phablet what it's
everything<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.840> well

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
everything but that well

there's gonna be a Snapdragon 400 which
is<00:02:25.830> odd<00:02:26.040> since<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.640> thought<00:02:26.820> those<00:02:27.030> were<00:02:27.270> stuck

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
is odd since I thought those were stuck

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.330 
is odd since I thought those were stuck
a<00:02:27.570> duel<00:02:27.870> or<00:02:28.200> but<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.710> point<00:02:28.950> being<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.310> that

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
a duel or but the point being is that

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.980 
a duel or but the point being is that
apparently<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.910> device<00:02:30.210> will<00:02:30.450> be<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.660> mid

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
apparently this device will be a mid

apparently this device will be a mid
seared<00:02:31.230> phone<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:31.830> that's<00:02:32.340> set<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.180> only

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
reason why that quad core processor can

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.130 
reason why that quad core processor can

covering everything why but apparently

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.550 
covering everything why but apparently
everything<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.660> pretty<00:03:00.870> much<00:03:00.960> confirmed<00:03:01.440> that
