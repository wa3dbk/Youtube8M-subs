00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.879
 welcome friends or androidblog 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.890
 unboxing lg due mini version 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.809
 reduced to the top of the house range 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:16.920
 Korean let's see what it contained 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:18.480
 package packaging as I said that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.060
 really just came to the office 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.000
 then we go to open it to discover 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.510
 practically together it opens here from the side 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.490
 let's see the g2 here in the front 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.289
 mini among other things with the film of 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.079
 applied factory this makes us think 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.329
 at a new terminal here we will go to 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.050
 see in detail shortly 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.489
 we open the receiver that divides the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.910
 second part of the package we find 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:49.140
 immediately a really quick guide 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.770
 quick and the earphones do not send but it is 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.579
 of invoice that seem enough 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.109
 economic nor to see then the 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.489
 this charger is open and ed 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.350
 at 0 85 amps 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.330
 and then we still find in the package 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.460
 the usb micro usb data cable and the battery 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.100
 which therefore is not within the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.080
 terminal we keep it here we raise the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.460
 box and let's get ours 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.200
 g2 mini 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.049
 Meanwhile I speak a little bit of 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:28.570
 dimensions and dimensions are 129 point 6 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:31.720
 x 66 x 9.9 mm thick 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.360
 so let's see how the various are 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.930
 sides as in the older brother the sides 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.390
 they are clean on both sides 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.890
 right and left below we find two 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.390
 grids one is probably of the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.300
 microphone and the other is that of 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.580
 system speaker with the socket in the middle 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.550
 micro usb for charging and for i 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.979
 data transfers over the three jack 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.390
 and a half of the headphones the second 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.729
 microphone for flow attenuation 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.619
 and also in this case we have the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.910
 infrared for the function of 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.580
 TV remote 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.950
 at the rear the 8 megapixel camera 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.459
 with LED flash and autofocus the classic two 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.929
 back buttons blg plus the central one 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.200
 for turning off the lockout 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.160
 unlock and flash the camera in 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.459
 network 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.110
 in this rough plastic that is a lot 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.480
 pleasant to the touch 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.980
 we see on the front we have the capsule 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.709
 earphones that also resumes here 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.720
 design of the elder brother here the various 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.720
 brightness and proximity sensors 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.820
 one megapixel front camera no 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.989
 button on the frame because the keys are 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.080
 on the display 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.989
 also for this the two minis go 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.840
 then to open the terminal opens 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.239
 doing that by sticking the nail here where 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.000
 there is the usb socket 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.820
 come on is actually pretty tough 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.519
 if you don't slide the whole nail from 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.420
 around it here is jumped out here 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.970
 see the nfc chip 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.250
 let's go and admit the battery in the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.560
 meanwhile you can see how we have here 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.030
 the slot for the micro sim but also for 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:13.530
 memory expansion because it goes to 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.650
 expand the 8 gigabytes of memory present 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.590
 sorry on the device we go to 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.860
 insert the battery and try to re 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.120
 close in the best possible way 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.430
 ok 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.440
 while we're at it, let's try a first one 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.530
 ignition we remove the film of 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.900
 factory and turn on with the back button 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.540
 hoping that there is a minimum of charge 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.209
 is turned on while I talk to you a little 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.580
 other technical characteristics and the 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.850
 processor that moves this g2 mini is a 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:49.380
 qualcomm snapdragon 404 but cortex a7 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:52.080
 from 1.2 gigahertz with gpu adreno 305 a 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.730
 gigabytes of ram as already mentioned 4 are 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.120
 those of storage 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:03.450
 the 4.7-inch display unit with 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:07.049
 resolution 960 x 540 pixels and 234 are i 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:10.200
 ppi the battery as I told you before 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:14.310
 when inserted we are 2440 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.430
 milliampere now radio technology sees 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:21.479
 four gsm bands four umts but bands 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:26.520
 also lte at 150 megs in download on 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:28.500
 wifi abgnac and with wifi direct dlna 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.590
 and all related functions that 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.740
 we find on the latest android smartphones 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.380
 bluetooth 4.0 but as we have seen 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.840
 first also the nfc then a card 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.850
 really very complete technique for 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.860
 this g2 mini that is putting us a 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.539
 little bit to light up but it is 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.510
 just to review the time of 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:50.760
 ignition turned on immediately and with 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.310
 the picture of the display lit up 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.169
 g2 mini I give you an appointment in some 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.330
 day to review 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.520
 Meanwhile, I invite you to like it if 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
 you liked the video and sign up 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.039
 to the channel 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.050
 for now it's all a greeting from the s 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.050
