00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 it's time for the test but a test with a 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.610
 touch of nostalgia 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:12.750
 If you connect there before, here was a motor 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:13.679
 now is the boot bags is the money can 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.510
 mala 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:21.960
 now has a motor know what's left of the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.939
 name search at least here in Brazil already 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.769
 which he now answers by the nickname that 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.769
 won in every country he's walked 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.630
 but the change was radical still good because 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.210
 the last models made in the late 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.110
 Already needed a good reform 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.539
 the first try the new beetle on 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.300
 1998 did not convince so much on this second 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.660
 that appeared in 2010 reminds us much more 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.899
 original and brought together the charism to be 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.370
 on the outside it looks like inside only the handles 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.350
 in the colonies to kill the longing for 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.899
 face has gained more space 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.060
 although losing a place today only takes 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.510
 four in the rear seat continue 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.260
 tight now of a finish 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.260
 just looking 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.420
 all in the best difficult generic style 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.420
 from behind made another revolution was in the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.909
 in addition to the typical 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.549
 modern cars like onboard computer 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.250
 also has a nice stopwatch 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.040
 analog and can even be 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.900
 shot when you miss talking about 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.950
 ripped off wants to see something else 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.460
 interesting 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.130
 the engine was 1.3 with 46 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.960
 horses air cooled and four 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:52.100
 counter cylinders 0 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.549
 it was a novel there, it has five seconds and the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.890
 maximum of 10 per hour that arrived there 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.310
 which enabled on some roads today 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.310
 Brazil 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.470
 now the four cylinders are line is 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.560
 2.0 liquid cooled ii with turbo 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.140
 the engine makes available to the citizen 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.410
 200 horses orchestrated by an exchange of 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.510
 dual clutch with six zero gears 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:30.800
 thus 7.5 seconds and maximum of 225 per 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:33.530
 and that the difference in the clear 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.019
 evolved suspension in place of the bar 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.600
 an independent set in the 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.489
 four wheels and leaves those torn 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.840
 that happened when you exaggerate a 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:48.550
 little in the history books 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.550
 now it seems like passed preferred 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.670
 if you the blouse electronic controls 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.050
 traction and stability help put the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.630
 house in order 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.520
 the same thing at the time of stopping and 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.970
 emergence with a flap was a 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:08.490
 recklessness due to drum brakes 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:10.710
 now a four-wheel drive and the s 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.300
 or succeeded 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.210
 When we say tax, who does not 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.890
 wants to know from consul the old one no longer 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.730
 it was prized by the economy 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.250
 the 1,300 around 8,7 kilometers per 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:30.450
 liter of gasoline in a city circuit 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.450
 road today slightly less 7,9 km 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.490
 but between us do you think that if someone 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.100
 have the money to buy a little 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.340
 if you care about that I think 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.340
 that does not 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.000
 It's maybe not even Brazil in this new 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.819
