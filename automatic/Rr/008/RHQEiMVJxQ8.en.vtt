00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.590 

I<00:00:02.160> want<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.940> talk<00:00:03.120> about<00:00:03.210> some<00:00:03.480> of<00:00:03.510> the

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
I want to talk about some of the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.030 
I want to talk about some of the
problems<00:00:03.780> I've<00:00:04.080> been<00:00:04.109> having<00:00:04.260> with<00:00:04.590> my<00:00:04.680> system

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
problems I've been having with my system

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.290 
problems I've been having with my system
but<00:00:05.189> first<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.640> thought<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:05.939> would<00:00:06.029> be<00:00:06.090> a<00:00:06.120> good

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:06.300 
but first I thought it would be a good

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.150 
but first I thought it would be a good
idea<00:00:06.479> to<00:00:07.229> show<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.470> how<00:00:07.680> it's<00:00:07.830> all<00:00:07.920> life<00:00:08.040> is

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
idea to show you how it's all life is

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.530 
idea to show you how it's all life is
set<00:00:08.340> up<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.610> haven't<00:00:08.849> seen<00:00:09.030> any<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.389> the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
set up I haven't seen any of the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.180 
set up I haven't seen any of the
particularly<00:00:10.230> similar<00:00:10.620> life<00:00:10.740> moms<00:00:10.980> saying

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
particularly similar life moms saying

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.470 
particularly similar life moms saying
there<00:00:11.340> isn't<00:00:11.460> any<00:00:11.670> but<00:00:11.850> I<00:00:11.880> just<00:00:12.030> haven't<00:00:12.270> seen

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
there isn't any but I just haven't seen

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.330 
there isn't any but I just haven't seen
that<00:00:12.630> many<00:00:12.720> so<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.710> thought<00:00:14.010> I'd<00:00:14.100> show<00:00:14.220> you<00:00:14.250> a

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
that many so I thought I'd show you a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.129 
that many so I thought I'd show you a
few<00:00:14.519> photos<00:00:14.880> here<00:00:15.150> about<00:00:15.450> how<00:00:15.600> I<00:00:15.630> originally

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
few photos here about how I originally

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.740 
few photos here about how I originally
set<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.410> all<00:00:16.500> up<00:00:17.000> okay<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> plan<00:00:18.270> since<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
set it all up okay the plan since the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.500 
set it all up okay the plan since the
very<00:00:19.050> beginning<00:00:19.760> has<00:00:20.760> been<00:00:20.940> to<00:00:21.060> hide<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
very beginning has been to hide the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.300 
very beginning has been to hide the
pipes<00:00:21.750> as<00:00:22.110> much<00:00:22.289> as<00:00:22.410> possible<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.949> didn't<00:00:23.190> want

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
pipes as much as possible I didn't want

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.769 
pipes as much as possible I didn't want
to<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.430> looking<00:00:23.670> at<00:00:23.820> him<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.180> didn't<00:00:24.420> want<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.660> be

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
to be looking at him I didn't want to be

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.720 
to be looking at him I didn't want to be
stepping<00:00:25.410> over<00:00:25.590> him<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.160> didn't<00:00:26.400> want<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.640> have

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
stepping over him I didn't want to have

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.519 
stepping over him I didn't want to have
to<00:00:26.820> worry<00:00:27.000> about<00:00:27.150> dog<00:00:27.539> running<00:00:27.750> into<00:00:28.080> him<00:00:28.320> and

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
to worry about dog running into him and

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.950 
to worry about dog running into him and
knocking<00:00:29.100> him<00:00:29.190> out<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.300> idea<00:00:30.570> had<00:00:30.660> been<00:00:30.690> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
knocking him out so the idea had been to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.779 
knocking him out so the idea had been to
hide<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.289> hide<00:00:31.470> everything<00:00:32.009> underground<00:00:32.279> and

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:32.789 
hide it hide everything underground and

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.219 
hide it hide everything underground and
then<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.359> covered<00:00:33.690> with<00:00:33.809> dirt<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:34.229 
then to be covered with dirt and

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:36.049 
then to be covered with dirt and
everything<00:00:34.679> can<00:00:35.069> gravity<00:00:35.370> feeds<00:00:35.640> straight

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
everything can gravity feeds straight

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.180 
everything can gravity feeds straight
into<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.479> tank<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.739> didn't<00:00:37.949> need<00:00:38.039> to<00:00:38.100> worry

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
into the tank so I didn't need to worry

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.689 
into the tank so I didn't need to worry
about<00:00:38.460> it

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.950 

okay<00:00:42.979> originally<00:00:43.979> I<00:00:44.159> had<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.879> coming<00:00:45.659> out<00:00:45.839> of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
okay originally I had this coming out of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:01:09.760 
okay originally I had this coming out of
the<00:00:46.019> ground<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.699> go<00:00:47.879> all<00:00:48.089> the<00:00:48.120> way<00:00:48.210> back

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.920 

okay<00:01:10.850> see<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> actual<00:01:12.240> water<00:01:12.420> level<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.780> this

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
okay see the actual water level on this

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.830 
okay see the actual water level on this
now<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.340> up<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.700> lot<00:01:15.090> higher<00:01:15.420> than<00:01:15.660> what<00:01:15.720> I

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
now it is up a lot higher than what I

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.870 
now it is up a lot higher than what I
wanted<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.970> it's<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:18.150> quite<00:01:18.720> over<00:01:19.020> time<00:01:19.880> it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
wanted that it's not quite over time it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.280 
wanted that it's not quite over time it
didn't<00:01:21.030> want<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.300> that<00:01:21.980> and<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:24.780> picked<00:01:25.230> it

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
didn't want to do that and I picked it

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.900 
didn't want to do that and I picked it
off<00:01:25.410> for<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> beds<00:01:26.040> at<00:01:26.160> once<00:01:26.370> so<00:01:26.730> it's<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
off for all the beds at once so it's a

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.940 
off for all the beds at once so it's a
lot<00:01:27.030> worth<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.510> it<00:01:27.600> normally<00:01:27.660> would<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:27.990> but

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
lot worth what it normally would be but

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.200 
lot worth what it normally would be but
this<00:01:29.160> is<00:01:29.340> not<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> want

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
this is not what I want

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.540 
this is not what I want
running<00:01:30.420> out<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.690> the<00:01:30.840> ground<00:01:31.050> so<00:01:31.500> time<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.430> fix

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
running out on the ground so time to fix

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.600 
running out on the ground so time to fix
it<00:01:33.140> okay<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.530> my<00:01:34.680> very<00:01:34.920> own<00:01:35.190> elegant

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it okay so this is my very own elegant

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.550 
it okay so this is my very own elegant
solution<00:01:36.060> I'm<00:01:36.570> gonna<00:01:36.810> get<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.760> bend<00:01:38.760> pipe<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
solution I'm gonna get the bend pipe and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.960 
solution I'm gonna get the bend pipe and
put<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.680> through<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.890> end<00:01:41.130> cap<00:01:41.370> and<00:01:41.580> then<00:01:41.850> I'm

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
put it through the end cap and then I'm

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.240 
put it through the end cap and then I'm
gonna<00:01:42.180> put<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.750> end<00:01:42.960> cap<00:01:43.200> straight<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
gonna put the end cap straight on the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.820 
gonna put the end cap straight on the
return<00:01:45.120> pipe<00:01:45.330> and<00:01:45.720> glue<00:01:46.080> it<00:01:46.230> all<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.440> place<00:01:46.560> so

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
return pipe and glue it all in place so

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.460 
return pipe and glue it all in place so
now<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.100> gonna<00:01:47.190> be<00:01:47.310> able<00:01:47.400> leaking<00:01:47.820> out

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
now it's gonna be able leaking out

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.300 
now it's gonna be able leaking out
admittedly<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.740> would<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:49.980> been<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> lot

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
admittedly it would have been a lot

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.700 
admittedly it would have been a lot
easier<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.790> buy<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> 40<00:01:51.330> mil<00:01:51.510> hole<00:01:51.720> saw<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.530> I

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
easier to buy a 40 mil hole saw but I

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.730 
easier to buy a 40 mil hole saw but I
couldn't<00:01:53.040> really<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.700> 40<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:55.200> $30

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
couldn't really just the 40 or the $30

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.430 
couldn't really just the 40 or the $30
price<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:56.940> one<00:01:57.060> little<00:01:57.090> sauce<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.780> I'm

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
price just for one little sauce so I'm

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:06.940 
price just for one little sauce so I'm
improvising

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.020 

all<00:02:07.950> right<00:02:08.039> I'm<00:02:08.250> not<00:02:08.369> gonna<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.670> every<00:02:08.940> single

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
all right I'm not gonna do every single

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.070 
all right I'm not gonna do every single
one<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.270> them<00:02:09.420> because<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:09.810> really

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
one of them because it's really

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.780 
one of them because it's really
difficult<00:02:10.259> one<00:02:10.649> hand<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.069> I'll<00:02:11.250> do<00:02:11.370> more<00:02:11.550> and

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
difficult one hand but I'll do more and

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.400 
difficult one hand but I'll do more and
then<00:02:11.880> come<00:02:11.910> back<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.360> magically<00:02:13.170> I'm<00:02:13.290> back

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
then come back and magically I'm back

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.330 
then come back and magically I'm back
again<00:02:13.560> okay

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
again okay

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.600 
again okay
so<00:02:14.819> it's<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:15.989> gonna<00:02:16.230> fit<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.190> I've<00:02:17.310> got<00:02:17.489> my

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
so it's not gonna fit so I've got my

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.990 
so it's not gonna fit so I've got my
little<00:02:18.290> Stanley<00:02:19.290> knife<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.770> basically<00:02:20.520> I'll

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
little Stanley knife and basically I'll

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.610 
little Stanley knife and basically I'll
chop<00:02:21.270> up<00:02:21.420> all<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.720> little<00:02:21.870> edges<00:02:22.080> trying<00:02:22.560> to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
chop up all the little edges trying to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.190 
chop up all the little edges trying to
cut<00:02:22.830> myself<00:02:23.420> till<00:02:24.420> I've<00:02:24.540> got<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> tall<00:02:24.930> very

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
cut myself till I've got a tall very

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.070 
cut myself till I've got a tall very
very<00:02:25.410> smooth<00:02:25.970> okay<00:02:26.970> it's<00:02:27.450> pretty<00:02:27.690> close<00:02:28.020> to

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
very smooth okay it's pretty close to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.750 
very smooth okay it's pretty close to
being<00:02:28.260> than<00:02:28.560> happy<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:28.920> still<00:02:29.250> see<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.550> not

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
being than happy I still see it's not

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.080 
being than happy I still see it's not
quite<00:02:30.300> there<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.920> bring<00:02:32.400> out<00:02:32.550> my<00:02:32.760> trusty

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
quite there so I bring out my trusty

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.160 
quite there so I bring out my trusty
little<00:02:33.920> file<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.390> little<00:02:36.390> slow<00:02:36.540> filing<00:02:36.959> later

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
little file a little slow filing later

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.490 
little file a little slow filing later
and<00:02:37.470> we<00:02:37.650> have<00:02:37.800> quite<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.100> nice<00:02:38.459> snug<00:02:38.760> fit<00:02:39.500> around

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
and we have quite a nice snug fit around

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.620 
and we have quite a nice snug fit around
the<00:02:40.709> back<00:02:40.890> there<00:02:41.220> some<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.269> may<00:02:42.390> say<00:02:42.600> but

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
the back there some of you may say but

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.479 
the back there some of you may say but
Krong

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
Krong

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.160 
Krong
if<00:02:44.489> it's<00:02:44.940> completely<00:02:45.360> closed<00:02:45.569> off<00:02:45.780> you'll<00:02:46.019> get

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
if it's completely closed off you'll get

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.960 
if it's completely closed off you'll get
an<00:02:46.290> airlock<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.069> won't<00:02:47.220> actually<00:02:47.459> be<00:02:47.700> able

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
an airlock and it won't actually be able

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.750 
an airlock and it won't actually be able
to<00:02:48.530> break<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.680> siphon<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.190> you'd<00:02:50.610> be<00:02:50.730> correct

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
to break the siphon and you'd be correct

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.080 
to break the siphon and you'd be correct
sorry<00:02:51.630> but<00:02:52.500> soon<00:02:52.709> now<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.549> we<00:02:53.700> have<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.880> nice

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
sorry but soon now and we have a nice

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.240 
sorry but soon now and we have a nice
breather<00:02:54.510> valve<00:02:54.810> for<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.069> will<00:02:56.160> be

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
breather valve for it so this will be

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.890 
breather valve for it so this will be
able<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.519> suck<00:02:56.670> up<00:02:56.880> all<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.180> air<00:02:57.330> but<00:02:57.780> it'll

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
able to suck up all the air but it'll

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.240 
able to suck up all the air but it'll
stop<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.200> water<00:02:58.500> from<00:02:58.739> coming<00:02:58.830> out<00:02:59.190> and

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
stop the water from coming out and

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.660 
stop the water from coming out and
pouring<00:02:59.730> out<00:03:01.010> okay<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.280> probably<00:03:02.549> not

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
pouring out okay this is probably not

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.759 
pouring out okay this is probably not
necessary<00:03:03.360> for<00:03:03.569> most<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.049> but<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.560> is

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
necessary for most of you but this is

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.199 
necessary for most of you but this is
the<00:03:04.890> stuff<00:03:05.069> that<00:03:05.100> used<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.549> glue<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:06.000> pipes

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
the stuff that used to glue the pipes

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.600 
the stuff that used to glue the pipes
together<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:07.319> there's<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.620> priming<00:03:07.980> fluid<00:03:08.310> and

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
together so there's a priming fluid and

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.789 
together so there's a priming fluid and
the<00:03:08.940> cement<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.959> prom'<00:03:10.260> fluid<00:03:10.560> just<00:03:10.620> make

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
the cement the prom' fluid just make

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.170 
the cement the prom' fluid just make
sure<00:03:10.920> it's<00:03:11.100> all<00:03:11.160> sticks<00:03:11.459> together<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:12.000> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
sure it's all sticks together and the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.849 
sure it's all sticks together and the
cements<00:03:12.600> it's<00:03:12.840> relatively<00:03:13.230> quickly<00:03:13.530> and

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
cements it's relatively quickly and

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.830 
cements it's relatively quickly and
holds<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:14.700> all<00:03:14.820> quite<00:03:15.120> watertight<00:03:15.570> so

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
holds it all quite watertight so

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.520 
holds it all quite watertight so
basically<00:03:17.930> tricky<00:03:18.930> when<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.140> can't<00:03:19.290> hold<00:03:19.440> it

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
basically tricky when you can't hold it

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.580 
basically tricky when you can't hold it
all<00:03:19.650> together<00:03:19.739> but<00:03:20.840> paint<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:21.959> all<00:03:22.049> on<00:03:22.260> make

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
all together but paint it all on make

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.900 
all together but paint it all on make
sure<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.890> get<00:03:23.010> all<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.310> bits<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.700> sides

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
sure you get all the bits that the sides

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.380 
sure you get all the bits that the sides
are<00:03:24.000> going<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.239> get<00:03:25.850> paint<00:03:26.850> all<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.150> bits<00:03:27.329> that

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
are going to get paint all the bits that

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.149 
are going to get paint all the bits that
it<00:03:27.540> goes<00:03:27.690> onto<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.230> other<00:03:28.380> side

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:39.290 

and<00:03:32.159> down<00:03:32.969> here

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.580 

okay<00:03:40.300> so<00:03:40.540> now<00:03:40.720> I'm<00:03:40.840> gonna<00:03:40.930> put<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.170> cement<00:03:41.349> on

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
okay so now I'm gonna put the cement on

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.809 
okay so now I'm gonna put the cement on
which<00:03:41.830> is<00:03:41.950> gonna<00:03:42.069> be<00:03:42.160> a<00:03:42.310> little<00:03:42.550> bit<00:03:42.670> awkward

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
which is gonna be a little bit awkward

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.630 
which is gonna be a little bit awkward
one-handed<00:03:43.650> but<00:03:44.650> basically<00:03:44.920> it<00:03:45.220> comes<00:03:45.430> out

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
one-handed but basically it comes out

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.809 
one-handed but basically it comes out
like<00:03:45.790> that<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.620> then<00:03:47.620> just<00:03:47.800> brush<00:03:48.069> it<00:03:48.310> all

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
like that and then just brush it all

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.420 
like that and then just brush it all
around<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:49.540> say<00:03:50.020> awkward<00:03:50.680> as<00:03:50.770> hell<00:03:50.920> one-handed

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
around I say awkward as hell one-handed

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:02.570 
around I say awkward as hell one-handed
and<00:03:54.780> then<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:55.900> all<00:03:56.080> just<00:03:56.110> slide<00:03:56.800> straight<00:03:57.190> on

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.290 

I'm<00:04:03.580> just<00:04:03.700> going<00:04:03.819> to<00:04:03.880> make<00:04:04.000> sure<00:04:04.150> you're

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
I'm just going to make sure you're

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.699 
I'm just going to make sure you're
relatively<00:04:04.540> quick<00:04:04.870> with<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.140> because<00:04:05.349> it<00:04:05.560> does

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
relatively quick with it because it does

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.270 
relatively quick with it because it does
set<00:04:05.950> very<00:04:06.160> quickly<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:07.440> then<00:04:08.440> basically<00:04:09.069> all

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
set very quickly and then basically all

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.430 
set very quickly and then basically all
in<00:04:09.430> place<00:04:09.640> so<00:04:10.390> I<00:04:10.420> got<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.750> sprout<00:04:11.049> little

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
in place so I got the sprout little

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.990 
in place so I got the sprout little
spout<00:04:11.590> in<00:04:11.799> there<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:14.380> goes<00:04:14.590> into<00:04:14.769> there<00:04:15.000> now

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
spout in there it goes into there now

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.409 
spout in there it goes into there now
it's<00:04:16.180> not<00:04:16.329> perfectly<00:04:16.959> circle<00:04:17.729> but<00:04:18.729> I<00:04:19.060> found

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
it's not perfectly circle but I found

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.330 
it's not perfectly circle but I found
you<00:04:19.540> put<00:04:19.660> a<00:04:19.720> couple<00:04:19.900> layers<00:04:20.139> of<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.859> cement<00:04:21.160> in

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
you put a couple layers of the cement in

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.860 
you put a couple layers of the cement in
there<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.910> it<00:04:22.060> seals<00:04:22.300> up<00:04:22.450> any<00:04:22.630> holes

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
there and it seals up any holes

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.350 
there and it seals up any holes
absolutely<00:04:23.440> perfectly<00:04:25.080> on<00:04:26.080> another<00:04:27.150> layer<00:04:28.150> of

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
absolutely perfectly on another layer of

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.230 
absolutely perfectly on another layer of
glue<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:29.190> it's<00:04:30.190> got<00:04:30.430> quite<00:04:30.639> a<00:04:30.760> bit<00:04:30.970> clearly

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
glue and it's got quite a bit clearly

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.760 
glue and it's got quite a bit clearly
rounder<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:31.810> didn't<00:04:32.080> have<00:04:32.200> any<00:04:32.380> problems

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
rounder so I didn't have any problems

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.360 
rounder so I didn't have any problems
with<00:04:32.830> water<00:04:33.130> leaking<00:04:33.550> out<00:04:33.700> anyway<00:04:34.060> but<00:04:35.370> that's

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
with water leaking out anyway but that's

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.010 
with water leaking out anyway but that's
because<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.760> can<00:04:37.030> I'm<00:04:37.300> gonna<00:04:37.419> do<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.660> little<00:04:37.810> run

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
because I can I'm gonna do a little run

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.270 
because I can I'm gonna do a little run
around<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.440> drop<00:04:38.620> into<00:04:38.800> all<00:04:38.950> the<00:04:39.130> bill

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
around and drop into all the bill

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.250 
around and drop into all the bill
siphons<00:04:39.700> and<00:04:39.880> pick<00:04:40.479> off<00:04:40.570> everything<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:41.050> lot<00:04:41.169> of

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
siphons and pick off everything a lot of

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.840 
siphons and pick off everything a lot of
them<00:04:41.350> at<00:04:41.440> once<00:04:41.620> I<00:04:41.919> will<00:04:41.979> get<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.280> maximum<00:04:42.700> flow

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
them at once I will get the maximum flow

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.040 
them at once I will get the maximum flow
going<00:04:43.060> through<00:04:43.180> it<00:04:43.419> and<00:04:43.600> we'll<00:04:43.690> be<00:04:43.810> able<00:04:43.930> to

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
going through it and we'll be able to

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.230 
going through it and we'll be able to
see<00:04:44.289> if<00:04:44.680> they've<00:04:45.070> got<00:04:45.100> any<00:04:45.490> water<00:04:46.000> going

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
see if they've got any water going

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.980 
see if they've got any water going
through<00:04:46.450> it<00:04:46.570> so<00:04:47.789> exciting<00:04:48.789> stuff<00:04:49.270> here

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:03.159 

so<00:04:54.560> this<00:04:54.710> is<00:04:54.830> bell<00:04:55.009> siphon<00:04:55.220> number<00:04:55.610> one<00:05:02.169> and

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
so this is bell siphon number one and

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.520 
so this is bell siphon number one and
now<00:05:03.590> we<00:05:03.650> get<00:05:03.860> shake<00:05:04.160> you<00:05:04.280> can<00:05:05.050> as<00:05:06.050> you<00:05:06.110> go<00:05:06.470> to

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
now we get shake you can as you go to

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:14.050 
now we get shake you can as you go to
bell<00:05:06.740> siphon<00:05:06.919> number<00:05:07.340> 2<00:05:11.199> and<00:05:12.199> I<00:05:12.319> 1<00:05:12.470> Z<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:13.060> then

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
bell siphon number 2 and I 1 Z and then

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.309 
bell siphon number 2 and I 1 Z and then
back<00:05:14.360> to<00:05:14.539> the<00:05:14.660> original<00:05:14.690> ones<00:05:15.229> and<00:05:17.199> that's<00:05:18.199> my

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 
back to the original ones and that's my

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:29.439 
back to the original ones and that's my
dog<00:05:18.470> wondering<00:05:18.800> what<00:05:18.889> at<00:05:18.979> home<00:05:19.099> doing<00:05:28.360> and<00:05:29.360> I

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
dog wondering what at home doing and I

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.839 
dog wondering what at home doing and I
get<00:05:29.599> that<00:05:29.660> little<00:05:29.810> shake<00:05:33.070> and<00:05:34.070> they<00:05:34.430> are<00:05:34.610> now

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
get that little shake and they are now

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:46.749 
get that little shake and they are now
all<00:05:35.240> going<00:05:35.599> off<00:05:35.720> at<00:05:35.840> once<00:05:45.400> so<00:05:46.400> I<00:05:46.430> don't<00:05:46.610> know<00:05:46.669> if

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
all going off at once so I don't know if

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.070 
all going off at once so I don't know if
you<00:05:46.820> can<00:05:46.940> hear<00:05:47.120> that<00:05:47.270> I<00:05:47.419> can<00:05:47.659> hear<00:05:47.840> water

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
you can hear that I can hear water

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.710 
you can hear that I can hear water
moving<00:05:48.349> around<00:05:48.560> behind<00:05:48.889> it<00:05:49.130> but<00:05:50.000> I<00:05:50.120> cannot<00:05:50.449> see

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
moving around behind it but I cannot see

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.300 
moving around behind it but I cannot see
any<00:05:51.139> water<00:05:51.440> doing<00:05:51.680> anything

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
any water doing anything

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.640 
any water doing anything
I<00:05:52.599> did<00:05:53.599> notice<00:05:53.810> there's<00:05:54.110> a<00:05:54.169> little<00:05:54.380> bit<00:05:54.500> of<00:05:54.590> a

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
I did notice there's a little bit of a

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.140 
I did notice there's a little bit of a
pop<00:05:54.949> of<00:05:55.099> water<00:05:55.340> which<00:05:55.610> I<00:05:55.699> think<00:05:55.819> was<00:05:55.909> due<00:05:56.060> to

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
pop of water which I think was due to

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.080 
pop of water which I think was due to
build<00:05:56.389> up<00:05:56.539> through<00:05:56.780> the<00:05:56.900> top<00:05:57.050> of<00:05:57.080> you<00:05:57.940> and<00:05:58.940> it

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
build up through the top of you and it

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.270 
build up through the top of you and it
did<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.300> same<00:05:59.509> with<00:05:59.630> this<00:05:59.720> one<00:05:59.900> here<00:06:00.139> so<00:06:01.009> I'm

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
did the same with this one here so I'm

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.710 
did the same with this one here so I'm
contemplating<00:06:01.909> I<00:06:01.970> might<00:06:02.120> rise<00:06:02.330> that<00:06:02.539> up<00:06:02.630> a

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
contemplating I might rise that up a

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.560 
contemplating I might rise that up a
little<00:06:02.840> bit<00:06:02.990> higher<00:06:03.169> just<00:06:03.470> to<00:06:04.310> make<00:06:05.210> it<00:06:05.240> so<00:06:05.479> it

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
little bit higher just to make it so it

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.360 
little bit higher just to make it so it
won't<00:06:05.659> do<00:06:05.900> that<00:06:06.050> but<00:06:06.470> overall<00:06:06.949> I'm<00:06:07.310> quite

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
won't do that but overall I'm quite

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.930 
won't do that but overall I'm quite
happy<00:06:07.789> with<00:06:07.970> how<00:06:08.120> it<00:06:08.210> works<00:06:09.400> and<00:06:10.400> come<00:06:10.639> back<00:06:10.759> in

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
happy with how it works and come back in

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.180 
happy with how it works and come back in
here<00:06:11.599> is<00:06:11.840> all<00:06:12.080> the<00:06:12.199> water<00:06:12.380> coming<00:06:12.680> out<00:06:12.889> on<00:06:13.099> the

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
here is all the water coming out on the

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.390 
here is all the water coming out on the
other<00:06:13.310> end

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
other end

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.650 
other end
so<00:06:15.940> you<00:06:16.000> see<00:06:16.240> all<00:06:16.330> the<00:06:16.419> water<00:06:16.540> coming<00:06:16.690> out<00:06:17.430> and

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
so you see all the water coming out and

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:32.980 
so you see all the water coming out and
flowing<00:06:19.660> down<00:06:19.870> into<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:20.139> pond<00:06:24.060> having<00:06:25.060> fun

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990
