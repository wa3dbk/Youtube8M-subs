son is now quite big so he doesn't we
don't<00:00:45.570> need<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:45.960> anymore

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
don't need to do that anymore

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.380 
don't need to do that anymore
but<00:00:47.190> that's<00:00:47.430> more<00:00:47.730> or<00:00:47.850> less<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> standard

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
but that's more or less the standard

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.299 
but that's more or less the standard
seat<00:00:48.600> position<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> ease<00:00:50.280> of

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
seat position if you have the ease of

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.110 
seat position if you have the ease of
fix<00:00:51.530> these<00:00:52.530> are<00:00:52.800> fixed<00:00:53.070> mount<00:00:53.280> points<00:00:53.699> used

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
fix these are fixed mount points used

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.830 
fix these are fixed mount points used
then<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:56.100> even<00:00:56.340> less<00:00:56.719> you<00:00:57.719> know

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
then you have even less you know

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.689 
then you have even less you know
leverage<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.770> move<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.039> seat<00:00:59.219> around<00:00:59.399> but

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
thing there are two possibilities to

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.050 
thing there are two possibilities to
just<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.409> buckle<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> seat<00:01:13.890> belt<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.700> know<00:01:14.729> I

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.090 
know you can hold on just let me figure
the<00:01:18.479> focus<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.170> because<00:01:19.320> I'm<00:01:19.890> using

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the focus on this one because I'm using

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.980 
the focus on this one because I'm using
my<00:01:20.310> 5d<00:01:20.820> mark<00:01:21.000> ii<00:01:21.060> camera<00:01:21.450> which<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> great

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
my 5d mark ii camera which is a great

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.890 
my 5d mark ii camera which is a great
thing<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> camcorder<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.450> it

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
thing but it's not a camcorder so it

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.580 
thing but it's not a camcorder so it
doesn't<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.290> autofocus<00:01:25.890> anyway<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:28.200> i<00:01:28.380> hope

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
doesn't have autofocus anyway so i hope

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.319 
doesn't have autofocus anyway so i hope
you<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.860> see<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.250> there<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:29.970> actually<00:01:30.299> two

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
you can see that there are actually two

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.319 
you can see that there are actually two
positions<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.079> try<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:32.369> bucco<00:01:32.759> has<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
positions you can try the bucco has a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.749 
positions you can try the bucco has a
slight<00:01:33.689> angle<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.520> try<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
slight angle here so if you try to

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.450 
slight angle here so if you try to
buckle<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.450> as<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
buckle it as you think with the with the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
tip pointing towards me in this case

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.580 
tip pointing towards me in this case
which<00:02:05.310> makes<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.880> task<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.690> bit<00:02:06.840> easier<00:02:07.350> but

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
which makes the task a bit easier but

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.960 
which makes the task a bit easier but
nonetheless<00:02:08.660> still<00:02:09.660> quite<00:02:09.899> hard<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.730> we<00:02:11.730> put

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
nonetheless still quite hard so we put

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.000 
nonetheless still quite hard so we put
some<00:02:12.330> more<00:02:12.510> about<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:14.340> here<00:02:14.790> we<00:02:14.850> go

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.130 

there<00:02:20.010> alright<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:21.360> doable<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.840> that's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
there alright so it's doable and that's

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.350 
there alright so it's doable and that's
what<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.350> do<00:02:22.440> every<00:02:22.530> time<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:23.160> as<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.150> see

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
what I do every time but as you can see

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.080 
what I do every time but as you can see
it's<00:02:24.720> quite<00:02:25.230> complicated<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.370> buckle<00:02:26.880> here

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
it's quite complicated the buckle here

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.230 
it's quite complicated the buckle here
is<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.360> quite<00:02:27.810> tight<00:02:27.840> fit<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.610> especially<00:02:30.000> if

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
is it quite tight fit and especially if

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.300 
is it quite tight fit and especially if
you're<00:02:30.360> trying<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.720> do<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.680> with<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> kid<00:02:32.190> in

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
you're trying to do it with a kid in

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.730

here<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.790> from<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.510> other<00:02:33.600> side<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.560> car

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
here and from the other side of the car

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.100 
here and from the other side of the car
which<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.100> what<00:02:35.370> usually<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:36.000> do<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.870> pretty

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
which is what usually you do it's pretty

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.590 
which is what usually you do it's pretty
hard<00:02:37.350> huh<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.880> fit<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:39.360> it's<00:02:39.510> a

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
hard huh so it is a fit but it's a

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.200 
hard huh so it is a fit but it's a
pretty<00:02:39.810> tight<00:02:40.050> fit<00:02:40.130> okay<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.160> hope<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:41.970> has
