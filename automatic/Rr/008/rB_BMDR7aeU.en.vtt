do<00:00:01.589> you<00:00:01.970> have<00:00:02.970> any<00:00:03.179> thoughts<00:00:03.449> on<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:04.020> Paleo

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
do you have any thoughts on the Paleo

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.289 
do you have any thoughts on the Paleo
diet<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:05.310> course<00:00:05.609> I'm<00:00:05.910> sure<00:00:05.940> you<00:00:06.150> have<00:00:06.270> many

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
diet of course I'm sure you have many

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.270 
diet of course I'm sure you have many
but<00:00:08.690> the<00:00:09.690> whole<00:00:09.870> theory<00:00:10.139> behind<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.740> we

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
but the whole theory behind it that we

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.630 
but the whole theory behind it that we
are<00:00:11.759> now<00:00:12.059> meant<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.570> eat<00:00:12.780> lots<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.980> meat<00:00:14.910> and

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
are now meant to eat lots of meat and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.230 
are now meant to eat lots of meat and
not<00:00:17.640> much<00:00:17.850> else<00:00:20.000> yeah<00:00:21.000> yeah<00:00:21.960> well<00:00:23.210> yeah<00:00:24.210> I

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
not much else yeah yeah well yeah I

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.640 
not much else yeah yeah well yeah I
think<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:24.600> absurd<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.170> mean<00:00:25.439> there's<00:00:25.560> no

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
think it's absurd I mean there's no

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.290 
think it's absurd I mean there's no
point<00:00:26.070> beating<00:00:26.250> around<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> bush<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:27.210> know

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
point beating around the bush you know

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.769 
point beating around the bush you know
first<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.320> all<00:00:28.730> many<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> scientists<00:00:30.539> that

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
first of all many of the scientists that

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.080 
first of all many of the scientists that
i<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:31.050> read<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.890> suggested<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.669> we

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
i have read have suggested that we

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.690 
i have read have suggested that we
probably<00:00:33.390> never<00:00:34.050> ate<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.680> lot<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.460> animal

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
probably never ate a lot of animal

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.490 
probably never ate a lot of animal
products<00:00:36.030> even<00:00:36.660> during<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> Paleolithic

products even during the Paleolithic

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.580 
products even during the Paleolithic
period<00:00:38.100> where<00:00:38.309> ever<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.610> period<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.590> because

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
period where ever the period was because

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.900 
period where ever the period was because
we<00:00:40.829> weren't<00:00:40.980> very<00:00:41.190> good<00:00:41.280> hunters<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.820> had

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
we weren't very good hunters we had

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.000 
we weren't very good hunters we had
sticks<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.360> rocks<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.870> know<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:43.860> weren't

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
sticks and rocks you know so we weren't

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.650 
sticks and rocks you know so we weren't
we<00:00:44.219> weren't<00:00:44.460> all<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.579> successfully<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
we weren't all that successfully and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.440 
we weren't all that successfully and
capturing<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.680> killing<00:00:46.710> animals<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:48.300> were

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
capturing and killing animals we were

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.200 
capturing and killing animals we were
mostly<00:00:48.809> eating<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.410> berries<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.640> fruit<00:00:50.940> and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
mostly eating the berries and fruit and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.450 
mostly eating the berries and fruit and
nuts<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.570> shoots<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.140> leaves<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:53.129> women

nuts and shoots and leaves the women

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.180 
nuts and shoots and leaves the women
were<00:00:53.579> likely<00:00:53.879> out<00:00:54.270> gathering<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:56.039> in

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
were likely out gathering and and in

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.410 
were likely out gathering and and in
fact<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.840> I'm<00:00:57.840> sure<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.199> know<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:59.210> study<00:01:00.210> on

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
fact as I'm sure you know the study on

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.750 
fact as I'm sure you know the study on
the<00:01:00.449> teeth<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.989> every<00:01:01.260> known<00:01:01.440> hominid<00:01:01.980> that

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.120 
was done at Johns Hopkins University
some<00:01:05.189> what<00:01:06.180> probably<00:01:06.479> 25<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.350> 30<00:01:07.680> years<00:01:07.710> ago

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
some what probably 25 or 30 years ago

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.670 
some what probably 25 or 30 years ago
now<00:01:08.280> show<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:08.970> every<00:01:09.630> single<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.409> them

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
now show that every single one of them

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.750 
now show that every single one of them
lived<00:01:11.670> primarily<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.450> fruit<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.610> forget<00:01:14.610> his

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
lived primarily on fruit I forget his

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
lived primarily on fruit I forget his
name<00:01:14.820> he's<00:01:15.570> been<00:01:15.810> given<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.110> name<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
name he's been given a name but the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.070 
name he's been given a name but the
Swiss<00:01:17.520> man<00:01:17.759> who<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.119> found<00:01:18.150> frozen<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.930> ice

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
Swiss man who was found frozen the ice

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.200 
Swiss man who was found frozen the ice
that<00:01:19.290> was<00:01:19.409> 10,000<00:01:20.130> years<00:01:20.280> old<00:01:21.049> in<00:01:22.159> Switzerland

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
that was 10,000 years old in Switzerland

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.460 
that was 10,000 years old in Switzerland
this<00:01:24.210> his<00:01:24.479> stomach<00:01:24.840> contents<00:01:25.350> were

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
this his stomach contents were

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.200 
this his stomach contents were
essentially<00:01:26.009> nothing<00:01:26.189> but<00:01:26.520> berries<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
essentially nothing but berries and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.990 
essentially nothing but berries and
vegetation<00:01:27.960> fruit<00:01:28.350> primarily<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.670> what<00:01:29.909> he

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
vegetation fruit primarily is what he

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.410 
vegetation fruit primarily is what he
was<00:01:30.060> living<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.049> I've<00:01:31.950> seen<00:01:32.400> no<00:01:33.390> evidence

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
was living on so I've seen no evidence

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.770 
was living on so I've seen no evidence
to<00:01:34.409> suggest<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.280> humans<00:01:36.090> ever<00:01:36.270> lived<00:01:36.540> on

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
to suggest that humans ever lived on

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.319 
to suggest that humans ever lived on
primarily<00:01:37.710> fruit<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.280> what's<00:01:38.939> absolutely

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
primarily fruit and what's absolutely

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450 
primarily fruit and what's absolutely
true<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.930> our<00:01:40.259> digestive<00:01:40.890> tracts<00:01:41.250> are

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
true is that our digestive tracts are

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.740 
true is that our digestive tracts are
simply<00:01:41.939> not<00:01:42.150> adapted<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:44.659> you<00:01:45.659> know

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
simply not adapted for that so you know

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.109 
simply not adapted for that so you know
one<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> things<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.640> came<00:01:47.640> out<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
one of the things that came out in the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.270 
one of the things that came out in the
last<00:01:48.540> year<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.200> half<00:01:49.350> was<00:01:49.890> research

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
last year and a half was research

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.999 
last year and a half was research
published<00:01:50.729> back<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:50.939> 2013<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.439> proved

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
published back in 2013 that proved

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.800 
published back in 2013 that proved
something<00:01:53.399> I've<00:01:53.670> been<00:01:53.700> teaching<00:01:54.060> people<00:01:54.659> for

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
something I've been teaching people for

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.109 
something I've been teaching people for
25<00:01:55.229> years<00:01:55.500> now<00:01:55.799> which<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.790> excess

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
25 years now which is that excess

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.389 
25 years now which is that excess
protein<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.659> harmful<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> body<00:01:58.399> this

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
protein is harmful to the body this

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.639 
protein is harmful to the body this
research<00:01:59.880> showed<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.380> excess<00:02:01.380> protein

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
research showed that excess protein

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.280 
research showed that excess protein
shortens<00:02:02.369> our<00:02:02.460> telomeres<00:02:02.939> which<00:02:03.210> makes<00:02:03.960> our

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
shortens our telomeres which makes our

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.740 
shortens our telomeres which makes our
lives<00:02:04.560> shorter<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.490> typically<00:02:06.180> as<00:02:06.390> people

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
lives shorter and typically as people

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.749 
lives shorter and typically as people
age<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.560> are<00:02:07.590> more<00:02:07.920> prone<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> various

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
age they are more prone to various

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.520 
age they are more prone to various
diseases<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.539> i<00:02:09.569> would<00:02:09.810> suggest<00:02:09.989> we're<00:02:10.379> not

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
diseases so i would suggest we're not

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.790 
diseases so i would suggest we're not
just<00:02:10.739> living<00:02:11.129> less<00:02:11.910> fewer<00:02:12.870> years<00:02:13.319> we

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
just living less fewer years we

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.680 
just living less fewer years we
more<00:02:14.010> protein<00:02:14.430> consumption<00:02:14.880> we're<00:02:15.420> all<00:02:15.540> so

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
more protein consumption we're all so

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.320 
more protein consumption we're all so
much<00:02:15.930> likely<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:16.800> more<00:02:16.950> sick<00:02:17.310> as<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.910> result

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
much likely to be more sick as a result

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.710 
much likely to be more sick as a result
so<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.290> know<00:02:19.380> there's<00:02:20.000> our<00:02:21.000> systems<00:02:21.480> look

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
so you know there's our systems look

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.150 
so you know there's our systems look
like<00:02:21.930> those<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.380> bonobos<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:22.890> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
like those the bonobos and the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.570 
like those the bonobos and the
chimpanzees<00:02:23.850> who<00:02:24.630> eat<00:02:24.960> almost<00:02:25.680> no<00:02:26.100> animal

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
chimpanzees who eat almost no animal

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.760 
chimpanzees who eat almost no animal
products<00:02:26.940> whatsoever<00:02:27.290> especially<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
products whatsoever especially the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.220 
products whatsoever especially the
bonobos<00:02:29.190> with<00:02:29.580> which<00:02:29.880> with<00:02:30.720> whom<00:02:30.960> we<00:02:31.200> share

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
bonobos with which with whom we share

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.920 
bonobos with which with whom we share
the<00:02:31.590> greatest<00:02:32.010> resemblance<00:02:32.630> but<00:02:33.630> even<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
the greatest resemblance but even the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.010 
the greatest resemblance but even the
chimpanzees<00:02:34.520> no<00:02:35.520> leaky<00:02:35.940> said<00:02:36.180> maybe<00:02:36.540> they<00:02:36.750> eat

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
chimpanzees no leaky said maybe they eat

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.470 
chimpanzees no leaky said maybe they eat
meat<00:02:37.200> twice<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.220> year<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:38.730> know<00:02:38.790> what<00:02:39.210> if<00:02:39.300> it's

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
meat twice a year you know what if it's

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.810 
meat twice a year you know what if it's
five<00:02:39.870> times<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.320> year<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:40.950> clearly<00:02:41.400> not<00:02:41.580> a

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
five times a year it's clearly not a

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.580 
five times a year it's clearly not a
significant<00:02:42.630> part<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.930> their<00:02:43.050> diet<00:02:43.200> and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
significant part of their diet and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.890 
significant part of their diet and
there's<00:02:44.250> no<00:02:44.430> reason<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:45.060> we<00:02:45.420> need<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.780> be

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
there's no reason that we need to be

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.480 
there's no reason that we need to be
eating<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.230> now<00:02:46.380> we<00:02:46.830> were<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.010> talking<00:02:47.430> about

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
eating it now we were just talking about

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.610 
eating it now we were just talking about
this<00:02:47.790> here<00:02:48.030> today<00:02:48.210> in<00:02:48.600> one<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.320> lectures

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
this here today in one of the lectures

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.980 
this here today in one of the lectures
today<00:02:50.160> one<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.910> questions<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.570> got<00:02:51.750> during

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
today one of the questions I got during

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.510 
today one of the questions I got during
lecture<00:02:52.290> time<00:02:53.060> was<00:02:54.060> how<00:02:54.630> about<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.520> blood

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
lecture time was how about the blood

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.490 
lecture time was how about the blood
type<00:02:56.700> diet<00:02:56.910> no<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.660> someone<00:02:57.960> said<00:02:58.140> well<00:02:58.320> yeah

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
type diet no and someone said well yeah

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.170 
type diet no and someone said well yeah
I<00:02:58.530> mean<00:02:58.590> with<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.370> know<00:02:59.460> with<00:02:59.580> my<00:02:59.760> blood<00:03:00.030> type

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
I mean with you know with my blood type

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.420 
I mean with you know with my blood type
I<00:03:00.390> should<00:03:00.660> eat<00:03:00.750> meat<00:03:01.170> right<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:02.100> be<00:03:02.190> as<00:03:02.280> strong

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
I should eat meat right to be as strong

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.700 
I should eat meat right to be as strong
as<00:03:02.580> possible<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:03.090> don't<00:03:03.750> believe<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.530> don't

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
as possible I don't believe that I don't

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.750 
as possible I don't believe that I don't
believe<00:03:04.860> there's<00:03:05.010> any<00:03:05.160> science<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.640> support

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
believe there's any science to support

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.850 
believe there's any science to support
that<00:03:06.060> but<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.750> believe<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.200> may<00:03:07.380> be<00:03:07.440> true<00:03:07.740> that

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
that but I believe it may be true that

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.400 
that but I believe it may be true that
people<00:03:08.610> with<00:03:08.970> certain<00:03:09.180> blood<00:03:09.510> types<00:03:09.750> may<00:03:10.140> for

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
people with certain blood types may for

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.490 
people with certain blood types may for
various<00:03:10.980> reasons<00:03:11.040> perhaps<00:03:11.580> maybe<00:03:12.540> for

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
various reasons perhaps maybe for

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.860 
various reasons perhaps maybe for
instance<00:03:13.830> let's<00:03:14.370> look<00:03:14.550> at<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.820> ones<00:03:15.660> that

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
instance let's look at the ones that

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.540 
instance let's look at the ones that
should<00:03:16.050> eat<00:03:16.170> meat<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:16.920> may<00:03:17.130> be<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.310> these

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
should eat meat it may be that these

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.210 
should eat meat it may be that these
people<00:03:17.790> are<00:03:18.060> people<00:03:18.270> who<00:03:18.510> have<00:03:18.540> trouble

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
people are people who have trouble

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.979 
people are people who have trouble
getting<00:03:20.220> their<00:03:20.520> protein<00:03:20.940> from<00:03:21.150> plant<00:03:21.840> sources

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
getting their protein from plant sources

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.990 
getting their protein from plant sources
for<00:03:22.680> whatever<00:03:22.920> reason<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.580> doesn't<00:03:23.730> mean

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
for whatever reason that doesn't mean

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.870 
for whatever reason that doesn't mean
that<00:03:24.030> they<00:03:24.270> can't<00:03:24.300> it<00:03:25.080> just<00:03:25.140> means<00:03:25.500> that

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
that they can't it just means that

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.130 
that they can't it just means that
typically<00:03:26.880> they're<00:03:27.239> not<00:03:27.420> doing<00:03:27.690> as<00:03:27.900> well<00:03:27.930> as

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
typically they're not doing as well as

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.600 
typically they're not doing as well as
others<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.770> us<00:03:28.860> do<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:30.290> they<00:03:31.290> might<00:03:31.800> throw<00:03:32.400> they

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
others of us do so they might throw they

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.130 
others of us do so they might throw they
might<00:03:32.790> feel<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.360> function<00:03:33.750> better<00:03:33.900> through

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
might feel and function better through

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.140 
might feel and function better through
eating<00:03:34.290> animal<00:03:34.530> products<00:03:34.920> but<00:03:35.880> they<00:03:36.030> are

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
eating animal products but they are

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.220 
eating animal products but they are
they're<00:03:36.420> going<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.600> get<00:03:36.660> sick<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.050> live<00:03:37.200> a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
they're going to get sick and live a

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.380 
they're going to get sick and live a
shorter<00:03:37.560> life<00:03:37.709> so<00:03:38.070> it's<00:03:38.850> clearly<00:03:39.239> not

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
shorter life so it's clearly not

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.540 
shorter life so it's clearly not
something<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:40.110> we<00:03:40.230> need<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.530> be<00:03:40.620> doing<00:03:40.680> what

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
something that we need to be doing what

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.580 
something that we need to be doing what
we<00:03:41.670> need<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.820> be<00:03:41.940> doing<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.270> giving<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.320> body<00:03:43.500> a

we need to be doing is giving the body a

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.840 
we need to be doing is giving the body a
chance<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:44.070> deal<00:03:44.340> with<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.700> underlying

chance to deal with the underlying

chance to deal with the underlying

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
condition that's making it hard for them

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.380 
condition that's making it hard for them
to<00:03:46.770> get<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.100> protein<00:03:47.459> they<00:03:47.820> should<00:03:48.000> easily<00:03:48.180> be

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
to get the protein they should easily be

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.570 
to get the protein they should easily be
getting<00:03:48.840> biting<00:03:49.500> mangoes<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:49.920> watermelons

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
getting biting mangoes and watermelons

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.610 
getting biting mangoes and watermelons
because<00:03:51.390> as<00:03:51.540> I'm<00:03:51.660> sure<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:51.959> realize<00:03:52.350> rainy
