00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 yes, welcome to my first 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.610
 murdering review show today 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.090
 sonic ii the dear shader for the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.259
 Version 1.4 point 5 can install 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.650
 this requires your design 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.940
 modifications the links to the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.880
 respective pages I will you 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.740
 Of course, fit into the description and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.609
 Let's start right away 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:31.340
 needed the deep if a mod of taxis 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:35.670
 bugs do not know if deep hd 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.940
 below download then click as 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.030
 Next, put the gls shader also 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.700
 click here then click here 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.460
 you downloaded that then needed the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.800
 sonic of her family shaikhs all over 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.520
 important is that you do not have the version 0 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.280
 9 under the but the version is 0.8 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.180
 very important but here you can do something like that 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.650
 you want these things here 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.299
 and maybe you better that 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.729
 tutorial after you can do you leave 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.680
 you also have the magic lounge underneath 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.420
 It is also recommended as you with him 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.439
 maybe mods can install or 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.600
 also the memory easier 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.400
 increase can increase easily without 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.830
 awkward something with beard files 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.520
 to write and yes 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.009
 after you get that all 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.220
 downloaded just pulls 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.500
 everything on the desktop then you have 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.790
 Everything here he represents a new order 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.770
 to call a folder to the kandier who can 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:48.570
 we wanted him now just the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:50.549
 not the power of the church the gls 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.850
 damage and the optive are a motto 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.640
 here at ultimo so what you still 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.070
 Downloaded it opens and pulls 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.340
 the folder also means maybe 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.719
 The folders are simply different 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.830
 you then in shadows around it more important 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.940
 We do not work 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.430
 and this add zip archive when 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.580
 her winter means then he has to shut up 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.680
 to actively add but it is important 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.200
 must be and not as usual 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.180
 It does not work 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.700
 then you can read the he draws 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.540
 also with here in and yes then 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.610
 you just start to press minecraft 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.560
 then log in to options force update 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.370
 then download a new one here 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.370
 minecraft points 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:51.190
 Of course that takes hold short time 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.510
 Now it's faster if you do that 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.390
 should again and you can easily 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:04.540
 close minecraft and open the magic 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:08.950
 lounge then you go to setup and world 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:12.480
 this was just new from the of 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.150
 sofa have I tested 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.800
 here you can just wear her up 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:25.019
 add then look for the folder with me 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:28.980
 I already have you on me first 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:32.620
 studied whether deep moth 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.110
 and important the number of memory allowed 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.940
 not over 3 gigabytes of its otherwise 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.450
 the mine crashes then they are 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.260
 just time to test exactly minecraft 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.540
 start everything well then again 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.170
 Will you be the switch so the gls as 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.470
 shader back on test starts again 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.100
 is also good and then you would still have 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.750
 shaders point 12 help does not found what 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.080
 but that's all right 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.989
 that way 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.630
 then you just say ok, log in 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.620
 yes and i would say we'll see each other 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.620
 then just go somewhere 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.239
 yes welcome back to life 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.220
 we could easily recognize 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.430
 sees installation is successful 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.340
 even back there the scots give that 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.370
 not alone 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.640
 and there comes the sun 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:35.600
 if you are passionate if that of course 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.940
 moment the tree breaks here 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.840
 had the shows we the shadow here 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:47.300
 which of course comes together and one 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:51.220
 So pretty nice trees! 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:54.980
 move on the glass moves 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:59.360
 the water looks a little different 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.940
 amazon water damage there is one 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.220
 other modification and yes I would 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.680
 say that was it first and drags 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.550
 a comment 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.550
 see you next time
