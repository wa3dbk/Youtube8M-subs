00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:18.390
 hello everyone and with you Alexey 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.600
 snooping today at your request I 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.060
 tell you about the game injustice i 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.840
 absolutely not a bar of debt but got a man 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.570
 goes, I was playing in the while version as nublo on 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.070
 I just don't have a joystick keyboard 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.100
 I myself did not take a joystick for ten years and 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:42.149
 Then I rarely played such games as 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.910
 mortal kombat street fighter and other things 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.829
 I had some other time 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.520
 preferences and therefore the skill of committing 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.360
 epic combo passed me by gently 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.230
 saying fighting games is not my element and I'm with 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.480
 some caution established injustice 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.300
 games at the beginning shows what will happen 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.270
 overwhelm danger epic and 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.430
 cool music one menu which is already 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.970
 may not play at all but just 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.570
 look at the movement of characters by word 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.680
 if you are well, like I must pass 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:24.140
 learning she looks here in baby style 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.240
 and move to eat try servant 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.540
 I myself probably studied longer 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.659
 than the game itself here you are shown all 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.570
 possible kombu until you all have them 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.110
 repeat and go no further with mine 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.049
 running it was pretty hard but in 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.240
 In the future, I just chopped on 6 buttons and 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.259
 me something turned out that there with 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.840
 The plot with it is all confusing and as I understand it 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.750
 at the beginning we are shown parallel 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.040
 the universe 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.700
 we see batman joker and superman 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.720
 which kills 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.300
 joker spoilers then move us 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.170
 our universe where all the villains 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.470
 let loose 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.300
 and we have to deal with them 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.080
 some sort out we will begin to play 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.870
 for batman and our first opponent 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.840
 defstroke first cutscene like batman 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.920
 beats defstrouka and then us 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.459
 transfer control 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.380
 next bain alex m martian hunter 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.620
 does not want to help us 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.270
 joker wants to destroy everything to hell 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.100
 Justice League is trying 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:42.820
 confront him and this is all hacking mother 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.310
 your how is it here a lot later 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.650
 all of our heroes 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.010
 move to a parallel universe but 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.100
 move not all there we fight with 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.299
 joker and then it turns out that batman 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.480
 outlawed but cant dangerous there is none 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.400
 broken about dumps further playable 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.920
 becomes a character like green 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.080
 lantern which we can beat lyuley 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.299
 local Reiman and cyborg 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.450
 opportunity is also provided 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:17.799
 fight with himself only 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.140
 in a different guise this is the first time where I 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:24.040
 really piled the next one 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.680
 aquaman character will tell you so me this 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.670
 really liked the character 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.760
 coolness 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.680
 cool combos and just liked a 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.410
 what is his superudar 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.290
 he really should pay attention 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.030
 I was struck here by the interaction with 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.500
 characters 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:47.200
 dialogue communication brawl at first you not knowing 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.050
 reasons blame them for something or you 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.840
 blamed then you twist 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.250
 they are you and then, as if nothing had happened 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.820
 no scratches 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.890
 fatigue and other things that happen 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.200
 should have happened before the fight 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.150
 like for example when cyborg attacked 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.630
 defstroke and lexor lute 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.940
 harley quinn here is not very 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.680
 the joker just took it out or I learned 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.420
 play 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:20.760
 although no less I understood my calling it 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.650
 just click on the buttons epic wines 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.640
 by the way about some impenetrability 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.530
 all the characters present here such 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.160
 pill which gives effect 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.500
 color suit is still an interesting fact to distinguish 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.220
 our superman from ours could 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:43.570
 a city coward and a red one 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.540
 our coward they have no martian you and in 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.120
 this universe is useless 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.840
 By the way on the locations you can in the background 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.050
 see some characters like dumsday 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:01.950
 Dadshot Huge Gorilla 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:05.440
 armor watts it's a huge shrimp in 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.020
 you barrel and you barrel and you and you 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.919
 too, the barrel become playable 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:15.940
 characters like lex lethor green arrow 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:19.169
 cyborg and others but go deeper into 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.960
 the plot I will not and then spoilers will go 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.940
 the game itself can not be said that not much 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.150
 like you can not say that not 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.830
 liked with time just bothers 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:35.140
 monotony with various characters 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.169
 the game didn't have to be done in style 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.289
 fighting game 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:41.870
 could make arcades well and for such 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:45.409
 the plot of the game is quite mediocre 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.229
 but she probably has a good multiplayer 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:50.990
 Well, if you want to look like a joker 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.969
 batman trash beats thats sure 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.599
 play as a single and in 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:06:00.560
 multiplayer can not say that the game is on 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:04.159
 lover what can i say with you was 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.909
 Alexei smells broadcasting good luck and to new 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.909
 meeting
