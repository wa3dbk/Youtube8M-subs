00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
process the glues at the point of the

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.910 
process the glues at the point of the
incisions<00:03:56.870> you're<00:03:57.020> saying<00:03:57.200> it's<00:03:57.470> underneath

incisions you're saying it's underneath

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.430 
incisions you're saying it's underneath
the<00:03:58.280> end<00:03:58.670> where<00:03:58.970> I've<00:03:59.150> lifted<00:03:59.480> its<00:03:59.870> lies

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
the end where I've lifted its lies

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.680 
the end where I've lifted its lies
beneath<00:04:00.770> that<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:01.430> allows<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.180> tissues<00:04:02.540> to

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
beneath that and allows the tissues to

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.070 
beneath that and allows the tissues to
adhere<00:04:03.050> to<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.610> raw<00:04:04.610> space<00:04:05.209> beneath<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:05.900> that

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
adhere to the raw space beneath so that

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.600 
adhere to the raw space beneath so that
the<00:04:06.200> space<00:04:06.440> is<00:04:06.470> obliterator<00:04:07.070> dude<00:04:07.459> you're

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
the space is obliterator dude you're

people think the whole thing is there's

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.300 
people think the whole thing is there's
another<00:04:11.540> thing<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:12.200> was<00:04:12.350> all<00:04:12.500> lift<00:04:12.709> enough<00:04:12.980> but

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
another thing it was all lift enough but

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.970 
another thing it was all lift enough but
the<00:04:13.610> whole<00:04:13.900> everything<00:04:14.900> gotta<00:04:15.230> go<00:04:15.410> out<00:04:15.950> a

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
the whole everything gotta go out a

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.440 
the whole everything gotta go out a
segment<00:04:16.520> where<00:04:16.640> we<00:04:16.790> were<00:04:16.880> tightening<00:04:17.330> the

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
segment where we were tightening the

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.390 
segment where we were tightening the
muscles<00:04:17.840> as<00:04:17.989> well<00:04:18.020> ok<00:04:18.620> because<00:04:18.830> that<00:04:19.190> would've

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
muscles as well ok because that would've

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.920 
muscles as well ok because that would've

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.870 
i think that at this stage she's she is
fully<00:05:53.350> healed<00:05:53.710> she<00:05:53.830> has<00:05:54.100> areas<00:05:54.430> that<00:05:54.580> are<00:05:54.670> numb
