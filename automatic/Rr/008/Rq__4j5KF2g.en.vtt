00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.740 
reason is because i'm most natural
deodorants<00:02:11.440> are<00:02:11.590> aluminium<00:02:11.860> free<00:02:12.730> so<00:02:13.420> like

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
deodorants are aluminium free so like

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.750 
deodorants are aluminium free so like
this<00:02:13.959> one<00:02:14.230> he<00:02:14.440> actually<00:02:14.560> said<00:02:15.069> says<00:02:15.489> at<00:02:15.640> the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
this one he actually said says at the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.920 
this one he actually said says at the
back<00:02:16.000> no<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.319> mini

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
back no and the mini

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.900 
back no and the mini
chloral<00:02:19.930> hydrates<00:02:20.410> over<00:02:20.980> there<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.430> then

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
chloral hydrates over there and then

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.300 
chloral hydrates over there and then
this<00:02:22.120> one<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.810> think<00:02:23.290> says<00:02:23.650> at<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.980> back<00:02:24.130> as

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
this one I think says at the back as

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.390 
this one I think says at the back as
well<00:02:24.340> even<00:02:24.760> though<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:24.940> doesn't<00:02:25.090> um<00:02:25.680> it's<00:02:26.680> you

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.250 

see<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.030> lemme<00:02:33.299> know<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.629> ingredients<00:02:34.110> now

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
see I lemme know in the ingredients now

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.069 
see I lemme know in the ingredients now
just<00:02:34.560> go<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:35.370> your<00:02:35.519> other<00:02:35.700> your<00:02:36.689> beauty

aluminum if it doesn't I'll explain now

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.679 
aluminum if it doesn't I'll explain now
give<00:02:42.150> myself<00:02:42.360> 20<00:02:42.870> seconds<00:02:43.799> ok<00:02:44.689> what's

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
give myself 20 seconds ok what's

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.309 
give myself 20 seconds ok what's
happening<00:02:45.989> now<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.379> 1km<00:02:47.060> cancer<00:02:48.170> survivors<00:02:49.170> or

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
happening now is 1km cancer survivors or

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.509 
happening now is 1km cancer survivors or
cancer<00:02:49.790> patients<00:02:51.920> given<00:02:52.920> some<00:02:53.189> advice

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
cancer patients given some advice

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.170 
cancer patients given some advice
they're<00:02:53.909> told<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.599> they<00:02:55.260> shouldn't<00:02:55.590> use

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
they're told that they shouldn't use

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.670 
they're told that they shouldn't use
products<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.480> will<00:02:58.079> expose<00:02:58.439> them<00:02:58.650> to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
products that will expose them to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.309 
products that will expose them to
aluminium<00:02:58.859> or<00:02:59.720> anything<00:03:00.720> or<00:03:00.810> expose<00:03:01.140> them<00:03:01.290> to

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
aluminium or anything or expose them to

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.530 
aluminium or anything or expose them to
aluminium<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:02.010> most<00:03:02.609> of<00:03:02.730> my<00:03:02.819> deodorants<00:03:03.180> have

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
aluminium and most of my deodorants have

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.690 
aluminium and most of my deodorants have
eliminated<00:03:04.049> them<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.159> because<00:03:05.459> it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
eliminated them and this is because it

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.930 
eliminated them and this is because it
could<00:03:06.030> cause<00:03:06.540> it's<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.709> reoccurrence<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.849> the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
could cause it's a reoccurrence of the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.759 
could cause it's a reoccurrence of the
cancer<00:03:09.359> and<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.510> was<00:03:09.690> scary<00:03:10.109> enough<00:03:10.230> obviously

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
cancer and I was scary enough obviously

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.479 
cancer and I was scary enough obviously
more<00:03:11.159> people<00:03:11.430> have<00:03:11.549> heard<00:03:11.760> about<00:03:11.879> it<00:03:12.030> and

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
more people have heard about it and

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.619 
more people have heard about it and
researchers<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.670> scientists<00:03:15.150> are<00:03:15.299> starting

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
researchers and scientists are starting

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.649 
researchers and scientists are starting
to<00:03:15.659> see<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.139> might<00:03:16.349> be<00:03:16.560> linked<00:03:17.069> to<00:03:17.159> cancer<00:03:17.659> like

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
to see it might be linked to cancer like

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.569 
to see it might be linked to cancer like
the<00:03:18.720> first<00:03:19.079> occurrence<00:03:19.349> of<00:03:19.590> cancer<00:03:20.010> but<00:03:20.280> it's

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
the first occurrence of cancer but it's

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.920 
the first occurrence of cancer but it's
not<00:03:20.730> been<00:03:20.879> confirmed<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.540> it's<00:03:21.659> not<00:03:21.780> written

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
not been confirmed so it's not written

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.740 
not been confirmed so it's not written
in<00:03:22.200> stone<00:03:22.260> but<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.670> worrying<00:03:24.389> enough

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
in stone but that is a worrying enough

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.960 
in stone but that is a worrying enough
ok<00:03:25.170> that's<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.799> second<00:03:26.220> point<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.700> third

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
ok that's the second point the third

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.250 
ok that's the second point the third
point<00:03:27.299> is<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:28.159> bit<00:03:29.159> superficial<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:30.260> my

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
point is a bit superficial and my

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.440 
point is a bit superficial and my
underarms<00:03:31.920> have<00:03:32.400> gotten<00:03:32.790> darker<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.299> darker

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
underarms have gotten darker and darker

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.319 
underarms have gotten darker and darker
progressively<00:03:34.170> over<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.709> years<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.329> I

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
progressively over the years and I

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.119 
progressively over the years and I
didn't<00:03:36.930> think<00:03:37.049> I<00:03:37.290> just<00:03:37.349> got<00:03:37.500> used<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.010> I

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
didn't think I just got used to it I

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.369 
didn't think I just got used to it I
mean<00:03:38.430> most<00:03:38.790> people<00:03:38.940> have<00:03:39.180> darker<00:03:39.629> underarms

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
mean most people have darker underarms

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.619 
mean most people have darker underarms
but<00:03:41.370> funny<00:03:41.609> thing<00:03:41.699> is<00:03:41.940> once<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.180> start<00:03:42.449> using

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
but funny thing is once I start using

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.960 
but funny thing is once I start using
this<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:43.109> didn't<00:03:43.410> know<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.829> was<00:03:43.919> a<00:03:43.949> surprise<00:03:44.190> but

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
this I didn't know it was a surprise but

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.640 
this I didn't know it was a surprise but
after<00:03:45.359> about<00:03:45.449> two<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.989> three<00:03:46.019> months<00:03:46.379> my

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
after about two to three months my

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.009 
after about two to three months my
underarm<00:03:47.280> side<00:03:47.579> getting<00:03:47.819> lighter<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.750> wasn't

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
underarm side getting lighter it wasn't

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.009 
underarm side getting lighter it wasn't
reaching<00:03:49.169> my<00:03:49.349> underarms<00:03:49.949> what<00:03:50.099> happens<00:03:50.489> is<00:03:51.019> my

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
reaching my underarms what happens is my

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.530 
reaching my underarms what happens is my
other<00:03:52.319> deodorants<00:03:52.919> used<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.609> imitate<00:03:53.849> my<00:03:54.180> skin

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
other deodorants used to imitate my skin

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.099 
other deodorants used to imitate my skin
after<00:03:54.959> i<00:03:54.989> shaved<00:03:55.319> i<00:03:55.530> don't<00:03:55.799> wax<00:03:56.040> i<00:03:56.220> shave<00:03:57.109> and

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
now when i shave and i use this it's

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.259 
now when i shave and i use this it's
fine<00:04:00.690> doesn't<00:04:01.139> stink<00:04:01.470> although<00:04:02.459> i'll<00:04:02.849> point

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
fine doesn't stink although i'll point

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.569 
fine doesn't stink although i'll point
out<00:04:03.479> now<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:04.049> before<00:04:04.500> i<00:04:04.530> used<00:04:04.919> my<00:04:05.010> deodorants

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
out now that before i used my deodorants

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.699 
out now that before i used my deodorants
after<00:04:06.239> i<00:04:06.269> shave<00:04:06.569> i<00:04:06.750> always<00:04:07.049> put<00:04:07.199> in<00:04:07.349> a<00:04:07.379> bit<00:04:07.680> of

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
after i shave i always put in a bit of

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.689 
after i shave i always put in a bit of
oil<00:04:08.040> my<00:04:08.760> underarms<00:04:09.479> just<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.139> soothe<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.859> so

oil my underarms just to soothe it so
that's<00:04:11.879> the<00:04:12.000> third<00:04:12.389> reason<00:04:12.720> I<00:04:13.079> took<00:04:13.349> a<00:04:13.650> picture

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
that's the third reason I took a picture

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.039 
that's the third reason I took a picture
yesterday<00:04:14.819> of<00:04:15.180> my<00:04:15.269> underarms<00:04:15.750> on<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.900> day

thing<00:04:43.419> I'm<00:04:43.690> going<00:04:43.840> to<00:04:43.930> say<00:04:43.990> is<00:04:44.380> even<00:04:44.680> though

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
thing I'm going to say is even though

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.240

both<00:04:45.130> of<00:04:45.190> them<00:04:45.639> say<00:04:46.240> paraben<00:04:46.930> free<00:04:47.009> I'm<00:04:48.009> not
