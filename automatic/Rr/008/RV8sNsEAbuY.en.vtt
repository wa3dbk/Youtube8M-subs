how rigid the boat actually is and how

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.249 
how rigid the boat actually is and how
well<00:02:02.069> it<00:02:02.189> holds<00:02:02.310> up<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:02.819> some<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> more

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
well it holds up to some of the more

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.370 
well it holds up to some of the more
aggressive<00:02:04.470> roles<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.840> including<00:02:07.049> some

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
aggressive roles you know including some

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.199 
aggressive roles you know including some
of<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.470> forward<00:02:07.799> rolls<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.250> seeing<00:02:08.549> how<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
of the forward rolls just seeing how the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.160 
of the forward rolls just seeing how the
c<00:02:09.539> positioning<00:02:10.430> holds<00:02:11.430> up<00:02:11.579> in<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.880> boat<00:02:12.170> when

c positioning holds up in the boat when

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.420 
c positioning holds up in the boat when
doing<00:02:13.410> some<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.709> more<00:02:13.829> difficult<00:02:13.950> roles

doing some of the more difficult roles
i'm<00:02:14.790> hoping<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.799> it'll<00:02:16.799> be<00:02:16.950> an<00:02:17.459> excellent

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
i'm hoping that it'll be an excellent

i'm hoping that it'll be an excellent
rolling<00:02:18.269> boat<00:02:19.790> initially<00:02:20.790> what<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:20.970> do<00:02:21.090> like

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
rolling boat initially what I do like

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.380 
rolling boat initially what I do like
about<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.870> boat<00:02:22.079> as<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.350> roller<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.700> really

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
about the boat as a roller is I really

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.880 
about the boat as a roller is I really
like<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.750> fact<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.109> it<00:02:25.260> has<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> hard<00:02:25.620> shine

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
like the fact that it has a hard shine

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.340 
like the fact that it has a hard shine
on<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.209> that's<00:02:27.209> drawing<00:02:27.750> me<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.170> boat<00:02:28.319> a

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
on it that's drawing me to the boat a

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.370 
on it that's drawing me to the boat a
little<00:02:28.500> bit<00:02:28.880> very<00:02:29.880> curious<00:02:30.359> to<00:02:30.390> see<00:02:30.690> how<00:02:30.989> it

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
little bit very curious to see how it

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.410 
little bit very curious to see how it
will<00:02:31.590> static<00:02:32.010> brace<00:02:32.280> how<00:02:32.519> it<00:02:32.880> will<00:02:32.970> hold<00:02:33.120> up<00:02:33.269> on

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
will static brace how it will hold up on

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.990 
will static brace how it will hold up on
its<00:02:33.540> side<00:02:33.889> also<00:02:34.889> the<00:02:35.220> momentum<00:02:35.639> of<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.850> boat

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
its side also the momentum of the boat

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.789 
its side also the momentum of the boat
I'm<00:02:36.209> very<00:02:36.510> curious<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.930> how<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.230> will<00:02:37.560> be

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
I'm very curious to how that will be

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.129 
I'm very curious to how that will be
just<00:02:38.730> with<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.030> height<00:02:39.269> especially<00:02:39.959> in<00:02:40.049> the

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139

a specialized green line boat the track

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.479 
a specialized green line boat the track
seemed<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.579> just<00:02:47.730> embrace<00:02:47.940> its<00:02:48.540> ancestry

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.820 

what<00:02:54.489> I<00:02:54.520> really<00:02:55.090> am<00:02:55.420> impressed<00:02:55.690> with<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.680> boat

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
what I really am impressed with the boat

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.220 
what I really am impressed with the boat
about<00:02:57.099> is<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.790> way<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.330> for<00:02:58.540> Trent<00:02:58.810> rolls

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
about is the way that it for Trent rolls

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.170 
about is the way that it for Trent rolls
even<00:03:02.230> with<00:03:02.379> a<00:03:02.410> north<00:03:02.800> sac<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.310> have<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.790> hard<00:03:04.030> time

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
even with a north sac I have a hard time

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.110 
even with a north sac I have a hard time
rolling<00:03:04.690> like<00:03:04.870> Ford<00:03:05.200> Ford<00:03:05.470> rolling<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.190> lot<00:03:07.030> of

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
rolling like Ford Ford rolling a lot of

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.080 
rolling like Ford Ford rolling a lot of
boats<00:03:07.269> but<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:08.050> one<00:03:09.599> worked<00:03:10.599> no<00:03:10.840> problem<00:03:12.090> one

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090

of<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.300> challenges<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.900> did<00:03:14.230> have<00:03:14.410> with<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
of the challenges I did have with the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.009 
of the challenges I did have with the
boat<00:03:14.890> which<00:03:15.700> was<00:03:15.730> quite<00:03:16.209> obvious<00:03:16.420> looking<00:03:16.930> at

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
boat which was quite obvious looking at

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.880 
boat which was quite obvious looking at
the<00:03:17.140> footage<00:03:17.319> is<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:18.160> rear<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:20.500> laid-back

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
the footage is the rear the laid-back

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.880 
the footage is the rear the laid-back
roles<00:03:21.370> especially<00:03:22.360> getting<00:03:22.780> into<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.650> hand

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.800 
roles especially getting into the hand
rolls<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.849> became<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.269> little<00:03:25.569> bit<00:03:25.690> more

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
rolls it became a little bit more

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.860 
rolls it became a little bit more
difficult<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:28.060> has<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.239> lot<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.720> do

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
difficult and that that has a lot to do

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.600 
difficult and that that has a lot to do
with<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.049> back<00:03:29.319> deck<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:30.250> height<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.459> the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
back deck a little bit of a challenge

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.130 
back deck a little bit of a challenge
coming<00:03:34.690> up<00:03:34.930> on<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.230> rear<00:03:36.750> for<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.840> for<00:03:38.110> the

coming up on the rear for the for the
lay<00:03:38.290> back<00:03:38.500> rolls<00:03:38.799> I<00:03:39.069> think<00:03:39.880> that<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.150> seat<00:03:40.390> was

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
lay back rolls I think that the seat was

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.250 
lay back rolls I think that the seat was
up<00:03:40.569> about<00:03:41.500> an<00:03:41.650> inch<00:03:42.390> relieved<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.599> you<00:03:44.140> can

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
up about an inch relieved that you can

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.559 
up about an inch relieved that you can
see<00:03:44.470> we<00:03:44.650> customize<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.519> seat<00:03:45.819> hoping<00:03:46.540> to

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
see we customize the seat hoping to

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.539 
see we customize the seat hoping to
improve<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.140> role<00:03:47.290> ability<00:03:47.709> by<00:03:47.799> placing<00:03:48.099> foam

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
improve the role ability by placing foam

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.250 
improve the role ability by placing foam
under<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:48.940> front<00:03:49.120> lip<00:03:49.390> of<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.540> scene<00:03:49.780> we

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
under the front lip of the scene we

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.319 
under the front lip of the scene we
reduce<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.769> movement<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.519> seat<00:03:51.880> cushion

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
reduce the movement and the seat cushion

reduce the movement and the seat cushion
raised<00:03:52.569> James<00:03:52.989> about<00:03:53.260> half<00:03:53.500> an<00:03:53.650> inch<00:03:53.739> we<00:03:54.430> tried

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
raised James about half an inch we tried

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.670 
raised James about half an inch we tried
to<00:03:55.090> lift<00:03:55.239> up<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.569> seat<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:56.019> try<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.290> compensate

to lift up the seat to try to compensate

a<00:04:02.500> drawback<00:04:02.739> on<00:04:03.130> it<00:04:03.310> but<00:04:03.459> some<00:04:03.639> of<00:04:03.700> the

the concepts of re-enter rolling the

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.440 
the concepts of re-enter rolling the
track<00:04:59.410> when<00:04:59.830> I<00:04:59.889> get<00:05:00.160> back<00:05:00.340> in<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.639> kayak<00:05:01.060> I<00:05:01.240> was

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
track when I get back in a kayak I was

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.510 
track when I get back in a kayak I was
using<00:05:01.599> to<00:05:01.750> suck<00:05:02.110> into<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.680> track<00:05:02.919> which<00:05:03.250> was

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
using to suck into the track which was

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.279 
using to suck into the track which was
great<00:05:03.820> kept<00:05:04.270> most<00:05:04.510> of<00:05:04.599> the<00:05:04.750> water<00:05:04.990> in<00:05:05.169> the

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
great kept most of the water in the

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:06.180 
great kept most of the water in the
second<00:05:05.650> nut<00:05:05.740> inside

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.340

kya<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:07.030> only<00:05:07.240> issue<00:05:07.360> for<00:05:07.720> me<00:05:07.840> was<00:05:08.020> when<00:05:08.050> I

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
kya the only issue for me was when I

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.140 
kya the only issue for me was when I
entered<00:05:08.800> a<00:05:08.890> kayak<00:05:09.280> my<00:05:09.580> feet<00:05:09.790> got<00:05:10.000> tangled

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
entered a kayak my feet got tangled

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.970 
entered a kayak my feet got tangled
little<00:05:10.750> bit<00:05:10.930> in<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.110> sock<00:05:11.410> to<00:05:11.620> suck<00:05:11.830> at

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
little bit in the sock to suck at

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.070 
little bit in the sock to suck at
stretch<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:12.610> then<00:05:12.970> it<00:05:13.120> was<00:05:13.240> very<00:05:13.480> hard<00:05:13.750> reach

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
stretch and then it was very hard reach

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.440 
stretch and then it was very hard reach
and<00:05:14.350> find<00:05:14.590> a<00:05:14.710> pedal<00:05:15.040> and<00:05:15.190> position<00:05:15.760> myself<00:05:15.790> so

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
and find a pedal and position myself so

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.390 
and find a pedal and position myself so
then<00:05:16.630> when<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:16.810> tried<00:05:16.900> to<00:05:17.290> do<00:05:17.410> a<00:05:17.440> good<00:05:17.770> roll<00:05:18.160> I

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
then when I tried to do a good roll I

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.940 
then when I tried to do a good roll I
failed<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.630> I<00:05:19.720> decided<00:05:20.170> to<00:05:20.350> take<00:05:20.560> a<00:05:20.620> more

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
failed and I decided to take a more
