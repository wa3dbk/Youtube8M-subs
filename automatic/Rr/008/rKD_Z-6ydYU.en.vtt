Calendar<00:02:45.099> this<00:02:46.099> I<00:02:46.310> think<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.609> better<00:02:46.849> than<00:02:47.060> any

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
Calendar this I think is better than any

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.989 
Calendar this I think is better than any
calendar<00:02:47.689> app<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.519> Apple<00:02:49.519> has<00:02:49.549> ever<00:02:49.730> made<00:02:49.939> I

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:49.999 
calendar app that Apple has ever made I

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.309 
calendar app that Apple has ever made I
think<00:02:50.150> it's<00:02:50.359> way<00:02:50.480> better<00:02:50.659> than<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.049> one<00:02:51.200> that

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
think it's way better than the one that

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.240 
think it's way better than the one that
comes<00:02:51.560> on<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.370> snow<00:02:53.180> leopard<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:54.500> contacts

comes on a snow leopard and contacts

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.159 
comes on a snow leopard and contacts
here<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.879> this<00:02:56.120> is<00:02:56.180> what<00:02:56.450> really<00:02:56.629> separates

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
here and this is what really separates

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.920 
here and this is what really separates
it<00:02:57.349> from<00:02:57.379> the<00:02:57.829> iphone<00:02:58.370> amen<00:02:59.299> it<00:02:59.419> makes<00:02:59.569> it<00:02:59.750> more

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
it from the iphone amen it makes it more

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.439 
it from the iphone amen it makes it more

of<00:04:42.680> messed<00:04:42.890> up<00:04:43.070> on<00:04:43.250> there<00:04:43.520> is<00:04:43.730> the<00:04:45.640> gigabytes

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
of messed up on there is the gigabytes

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.880 
of messed up on there is the gigabytes
they<00:04:46.970> should<00:04:47.180> have<00:04:47.300> bumped<00:04:47.810> up<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:47.930> least<00:04:48.260> 120

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
they should have bumped up to least 120

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.880 
they should have bumped up to least 120
because<00:04:49.250> um<00:04:50.260> computers<00:04:51.260> now<00:04:51.470> personal

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890

because um computers now personal
computers<00:04:52.220> have<00:04:52.370> so<00:04:52.670> much<00:04:52.850> memory<00:04:53.750> that<00:04:54.470> they

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
computers have so much memory that they

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.350 
computers have so much memory that they

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
should have bumped it up because it's

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.510 
should have bumped it up because it's
feeling<00:04:57.050> too<00:04:57.170> much<00:04:57.200> like<00:04:57.560> a<00:04:57.590> oversized<00:04:58.250> ipod
