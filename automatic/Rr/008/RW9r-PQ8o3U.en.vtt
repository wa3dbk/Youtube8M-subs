00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 hello everybody after the round ipad with 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.940
 he junior of the net 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.030
 Arriving in Brazil and already the ipad and dude 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.070
 on the net it bothers a lot of people 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.170
 now its time to talk about him 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.970
 mini ipad with retina display 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.340
 then we have here the old mini ipad 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.680
 and the ipad with retina the old screen in color 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.990
 black and lead and a mini retina that already 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.769
 changed color now space clay movies 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.050
 space 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.599
 they can see a graffiti tone gives a 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.550
 Tomorrow I think it's more beautiful. 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.370
 model that has 3g and is already compatible with 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.140
 4g in Brazil so they have antennae and 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.180
 Ask for an old one only handle on the 3g that in the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.309
 but the 3g model also has 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.530
 an antenna that in terms of design 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.620
 format they are exactly the same 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.829
 chassis but some small differences 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.079
 The mini ipad with retina screen is lightly 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.000
 heavier who was the ipad user 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.860
 Mini common will notice that it is a little 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.600
 heavier but not quite anything 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.340
 significant that will make a difference 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.980
 in everyday use 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.120
 the main novelty of the ipad mini against 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.369
 Argentina is also more difficult to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.650
 show in a video that his resolution 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.060
 which is now the same as the ipad is as it already 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.490
 it was to be expected a very high screen 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.450
 setting where you can not even see 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.610
 the pixels 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.890
 the screen also has a much more contrast 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.710
 high but this is one more difference 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.170
 useful when opening something heavier 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.270
 as a game you notice that the chip to 7 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.030
 really makes a difference in life. 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.950
 performance is like comparing the iphone 5 s 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.930
 with iphone 4s 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.119
 this results in a more fluid system 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.210
 do not choke like the mini ipad that at 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.350
 Sometimes it gives a choke, no, it 's seven 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.020
 the impression I have is that I'm 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.490
 using a smaller ipad only and no more 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.200
 as was the case with the model 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.880
 and some people 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.920
 asked if it warmed up more because 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.869
 the ipad 3 when it was released with the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.270
 the first retina screen that warmed the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.860
 enough he does not suffer as much from this 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.670
 problem but during the game he can 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.469
 reach 40 degrees 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.420
 so that was our ipad surrender 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.420
 mini with retina screen that found on the net 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.720
 he had a son and remembers that in good and 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.879
 Then you already know, if you like, click 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.739
 I liked it if you did not like it too. 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.150
 I like it, tell me why you did not like it. 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.780
 It was a question to leave here 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.440
 comments 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.440
 to the next 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.950
 the squid with him junior in the net that lost 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.269
 it leaves here the function of it here 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:37.280
 this guy here he will appear is 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.280
 naked do not look go of clothes
