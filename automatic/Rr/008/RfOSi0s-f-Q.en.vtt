I think she's good she's fed she does
what<00:00:38.339> she<00:00:38.519> does<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:39.360> there's<00:00:39.660> always<00:00:39.839> going

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
what she does but there's always going

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.270 
what she does but there's always going
to<00:00:40.080> be<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> danger<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.710> she'll<00:00:40.920> cross<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
to be the danger that she'll cross the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.220 
to be the danger that she'll cross the
line<00:00:41.460> right<00:00:41.699> so<00:00:42.089> what<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.449> couple's<00:00:42.960> past

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
couple months and in my opinion maybe

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.729 
couple months and in my opinion maybe
not<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.720> yours<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:45.989> my<00:00:46.230> opinion<00:00:46.559> she's

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
tight maybe maybe not but for me it's

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.100 
tight maybe maybe not but for me it's
just<00:06:59.509> absolute<00:07:00.509> nonsense

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.730

what

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
what

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.610
