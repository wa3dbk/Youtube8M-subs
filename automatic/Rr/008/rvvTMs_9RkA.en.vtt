00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.549
 how do we prepare the whole body 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:18.980
 Generally Gorelov 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:18.980
 first drives in size 280 but then 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.710
 cut along the complex and descent plank 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.710
 do things on 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.260
 preferably do it not hot 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.100
 the time that the towers were relatively 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.100
 harshly 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.180
 200 kilograms cut through the whole process 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.290
 scales 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:13.550
 it used to take weeks Celsius one 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.970
 day work out everything done from yet 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.820
 You can see such liners here 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.010
 then out of two, first for the flute 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.490
 hole then sweat out of two 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.200
 scored where these liners are needed 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.520
 in the spring sometimes 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.810
 if the family is not strong and for the nucleus 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:44.650
 the case stands on our place 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:47.150
 the liner is simply inserted here 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.450
 tightened by this wire and nowhere 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.420
 drops out does not swell it in the rain 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.850
 Here is the lead 1 3 somewhere enough for 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.040
 nucleus and then when it is already dirt 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.670
 Beginning years to expand with all 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.670
 rested 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:15.050
 take the frame then we bring it to Prague 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.590
 forms we put a loop 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.590
 lots of 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.360
 heat up 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.030
 or in the resulting 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.030
 then let's sell the car come on 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.620
 polishes 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.660
 turn on 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.490
 information 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.490
 1 and 2 and 3 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:54.150
 if somewhere something can drink lei 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.150
 touch up hot unevenly trimmed 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.350
 abnormal 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:04.350
 discover the truth 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.350
 equipped
