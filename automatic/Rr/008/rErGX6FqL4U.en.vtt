00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 Hi everyone, everything is good, I 'm not here today. 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.030
 talking about bronze has received many 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.730
 messages asking how the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.349
 bronzer I am I am very white 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.960
 I can wear bronze 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.580
 so I'm going to do a quick tutorial 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.830
 a year while walking zico 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.779
 for those who want to use brass but're with 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.840
 fear is very white and does not know 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.580
 charge 100 the first thing to do if 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.449
 Do you like bronze? 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.640
 and it's good for you to buy one that is 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.260
 a little darker than your skin 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.600
 Why do not you want to go all orange? 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.399
 that look of mud on your face and go 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.140
 so you doing product layer 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.230
 you get a color intensity 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.110
 cool without looking exactly like this 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.739
 clay with this thing you sung 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.570

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.449
 and if you are very white you 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.239
 need a bronze is compatible with the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.309

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.530
 but for you that in the machine can serve 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.750
 wmc 25/20 and me 15 it's hard to find one 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.399
 the machine is golden he plays well 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.280
 light to me it does not work 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.380
 is a hole because I use a client 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.990
 but for me it does not work 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.149
 he is not max he has a team but he is the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.680
 chinext or know that chinese does not come 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:05.250
 glitter in the face was going to me that I'm mw 30 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.310
 or 35 I use this mosaic of victory 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.380
 simple enough time 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.730
 This is mine, but I have to 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.360
 use day to day 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.420
 to condor here too and it works for 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.230
 I will a bronze mosaic too 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.910
 who is not here but she has is very 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.950
 well it has a strong effect on you 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.920
 how to undo layer and will stay 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.110
 powerful on your face and he has more 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.610
 glitter is no longer possible already has a 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.490
 A little more of him since then goes more 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.890
 for the night was going if you want a bronze 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.730

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.540

 I have here that mine is over but he is more 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.290
 the goal and I just showed 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.240
 he has a glitter 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.250
 so it does not arrive if that tension 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.370
 you see that it has a stronger glow 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.730
 is good so let's start'll get the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.340
 my bronze and a police officer a fan of 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.630
 shoping selleck this is five o'clock 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.830
 the schools you meet at 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.320
 www.betboo.com a link will be here 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.690
 underneath you just talk I want a brush 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.940
 black listening maicon da silva colors 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.030
 She's just the boss and that's cheap. 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.150
 So let's start with the tutorial. 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.560
 the bronze and the breath is the following I take 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.170
 the sound of the computer 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.989
 was the next step is we have to 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.480
 dance when we get sun where the 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.780
 people tan in the sun and leave 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.890
 our face is more tan in case the 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.890
 Vermelhinho finally usually happens is 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.610
 on top of the cheekbones at the tip of the 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.790
 nose on top of forehead and chin 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.330
 then it will catch up with the fever lech 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.330
 bronze 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.000
 on top of the apple of the face 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.780
 you take a quantity well on top of the 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.450
 apple face 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:17.799
 There you go up to the temple and 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.799
 do malls and see 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:25.340
 came here and made his 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.250
 the marketer is good that he takes product 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.750
 But he will not leave you there, do not cry. 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.870
 who will get the product but it spreads 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.889
 with quality 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.440
 that 's what we want, we do not 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.759
 want to scratch orange in our faces 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.070
 so I'm going up to try to figure it out 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.430
 already went to the top of the forehead and I'm going to the middle 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.430
 the face 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.320
 You can do this with a witch. 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:52.190
 like this one from here pop 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:58.340
 I'll do another side with him but here 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.900
 O face made you rise to the temple and 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.789
 protest goes down 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:09.949
 It's good now, on the nose, it 's pretty basic. 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:11.030
 do sharp and lateral and with fernando 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:15.770
 is easy 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.810
 side side or up 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:23.990
 more failing a little way up 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:29.030
 the effect gets better and the chin is 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:32.180
 Calm people, just come here and apply. 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.340
 Good, that was with the five 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.530
 schools broad by chery dotcom network 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.539
 now I'm going to use the normal zither brush 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.599
 of dust and I'll do the following looks will 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.940
 get a little stronger 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:46.150
 you have a higher color concentration 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.280
 so you need a blend of me 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:52.330
 better not to take the risk in the face 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.330
 like I'm talking to you 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.070
 Feb is good for whites. 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.460
 which needs more color dispersion 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.250
 bigger 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.530
 if you are like I was already going to the brown 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.300
 It's getting more tan 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.370
 You can already use a brush like this. 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.900
 because then you have more control 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.340
 it was very weak at first 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.320
 Are you at risk of getting very good? 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.320
 in the face turn this effect 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:28.099
 so the staff the bronze is ready 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:31.430
 On this side I used the febr uche he has 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:33.169
 a lighter effect but that's for sure 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.819
 we are with bronze 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:39.589
 and on this side I did with the normal brush 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:41.270
 to a greater concentration if you are already 

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:42.589
 more tan and more 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.050
 tan but strawberry 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:48.229
 It's good to finish, I'm going to have a good time. 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:51.589
 we also give 5 colors that you 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:56.899

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:59.089

00:06:56.899 --> 00:07:03.559
 still vocals that there was dubai 

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:05.830
 Saying that all you need to do is see it now. 

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:05.830
 two 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.480
 you are ready personal and confidential that 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.550

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.290
 he has a little taste of fruit and he is a 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.580
 unequal world super bass that has a 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.440
 chip is very light but it stays 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:31.240
 practically transparent in the mouth 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:33.160
 the staff of the hotel bronze swan 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.120
 the most white and for those who want to use 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.600
 the bronze 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.250
 Even if you speak softly, you 

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.440

 want to play the blush on top is on

 I wish I did not like blush 

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.450
 I only use the brass so for me it's over. 

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.850
 What else do you want to play in the blush? 

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:58.450
 now can play more dug can play 

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:02.190
