magic powder in the low offering thing

00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:24.509 
magic powder in the low offering thing
we're<00:06:21.699> a<00:06:22.559> little<00:06:23.559> demon<00:06:23.919> will<00:06:24.039> come<00:06:24.219> out<00:06:24.399> and

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:24.519 
we're a little demon will come out and

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:29.189 
we're a little demon will come out and
he<00:06:24.699> will<00:06:24.909> give<00:06:25.119> us<00:06:25.299> half<00:06:25.539> magic<00:06:27.509> which<00:06:28.509> M<00:06:28.779> is

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
he will give us half magic which M is

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.819 
he will give us half magic which M is
really<00:06:29.709> kind<00:06:29.859> of<00:06:29.979> a<00:06:30.069> good<00:06:30.249> thing<00:06:30.309> because<00:06:30.609> it<00:06:30.909> a

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:31.829 
really kind of a good thing because it a

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:33.959 
really kind of a good thing because it a
doubles<00:06:32.829> the<00:06:33.009> amount<00:06:33.219> of<00:06:33.429> time<00:06:33.639> it<00:06:33.849> takes

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:33.969 
doubles the amount of time it takes

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.159 
doubles the amount of time it takes
before<00:06:34.239> our<00:06:34.539> magic<00:06:34.899> runs<00:06:35.079> out<00:06:35.319> I<00:06:37.169> guess

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
before our magic runs out I guess

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.079 
before our magic runs out I guess
because<00:06:38.439> it's<00:06:38.499> only<00:06:38.860> showing<00:06:38.889> half<00:06:39.610> the<00:06:39.909> meter

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:40.089 
because it's only showing half the meter

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:42.929 
because it's only showing half the meter
I<00:06:40.419> don't<00:06:40.959> know<00:06:41.079> it's<00:06:41.589> that<00:06:42.249> little<00:06:42.369> demon<00:06:42.669> do

00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:42.939 
I don't know it's that little demon do

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:47.369 
I don't know it's that little demon do
it's<00:06:43.059> kind<00:06:43.239> of<00:06:43.269> funny<00:06:43.979> but<00:06:45.509> it's<00:06:46.509> very<00:06:47.049> useful

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:47.379 
it's kind of funny but it's very useful

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:49.409 
it's kind of funny but it's very useful
to<00:06:47.709> have<00:06:47.829> double<00:06:48.249> our<00:06:48.339> magic<00:06:48.879> power<00:06:49.089> before

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.419 
to have double our magic power before
