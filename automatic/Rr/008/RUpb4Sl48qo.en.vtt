FX<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.229> all<00:01:34.380> about<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.009> we've<00:01:35.400> been<00:01:35.520> able<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
FX is all about and we've been able to

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.490 
FX is all about and we've been able to
really<00:01:36.119> co-develop<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.140> very<00:01:37.320> first

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
really co-develop for the very first

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.789 
really co-develop for the very first
time<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:38.159> boat<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.659> motor<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.350> same<00:01:40.530> time

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
time a boat and a motor at the same time

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.200 
time a boat and a motor at the same time
so<00:01:41.100> when<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.340> got<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> chance<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.090> this

so when we got a chance to see this

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.910 
so when we got a chance to see this
engine<00:01:42.450> two<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:42.810> three<00:01:42.990> years<00:01:43.200> ago<00:01:43.350> before<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
engine two or three years ago before the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.350 
engine two or three years ago before the
market<00:01:44.189> ever<00:01:44.369> got<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> chance<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.240> we're

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
market ever got a chance to see it we're

that we're dealing with now you know
they're<00:02:34.720> lighter<00:02:34.930> there<00:02:35.230> faster<00:02:35.680> they<00:02:35.860> go

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
they're lighter there faster they go

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.530 
they're lighter there faster they go
farther<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.610> they're<00:02:36.760> more<00:02:36.910> reliable<00:02:36.940> and

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
farther and they're more reliable and
