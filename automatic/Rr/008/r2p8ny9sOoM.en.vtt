00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Elena Tanis is undoubtedly one of the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.210
 key figures in the artistic panorama 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.219
 Spanish especially from the 60's 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.309
 that certainly has not had the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.680
 recognition that should the reasons 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.390
 of these are several on the one hand 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.490
 instead of a vision still too much 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.250
 romantic the artist's paper an idea 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.460
 of art very tied to a 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.150
 still does a certain type of painting for 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.850
 the other side of the fact that we live in a 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.370
 time determined by where the canon 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.680
 artistic is determined by the 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.080
 market that the market to the market 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.800
 like products that are consumed 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.890
 products that are easily digestible 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.430
 that the market is tied to the times 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.070
 shorts and the work of Elena Asins is all 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.910
 the opposite on the one hand the fact that 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.510
 the work has some score that only 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:07.030
 It works when there is a viewer 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:11.149
 agent viewer who is capable of 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.590
 read to endorse this score and 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.340
 then there is another aspect that is linked to 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.430
 this is that his work has also 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.729
 much to do with the dance the rhythms the 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.440
 dance the body again is something that 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.760
 can never be perceived as something 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.630
 separate from 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.630
 the viewer feels it when it is 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.630
 living 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.909
 and I think I'm launching a 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.460
 speech somehow a reading a 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.030
 cryptogram then it's about 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.060
 decipher the message not since I 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.220
 understand me as an individual 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.400
 but that message gets that the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.890
 society be a little better 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.750
 so you think it 's the most 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.009
 important that I reflect on what 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.649
 auto meditation network to a self-reflection 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:14.300
 about itself as if we said in 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.300
 computer a feedback 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.900
 I believe in Spain , a department that 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.730
 called the calculation center not then 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.530
 for me it was fundamental 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.290
 I think it was one of the most 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.049
 important that has been done in Spain 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.950
 then an experiment was done that was 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:41.590
 for research we would say educational or 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.560
 cultural and we met there we had 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.629
 seminars we did not have access to 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.140
 computer the computer was a device 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:54.430
 immense but nevertheless I in that 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:58.420
 era I was aware of what that 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.629
 instrument meant thing that I think 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.500
 that few people took is to say the creation 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:07.599
 of a new era from Gutenberg with the 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.099
 company with the printing press had not 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:14.129
 created a social revolution like the one 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:19.060
 it has occurred with computer science 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:21.910
 I got to program and make a kind 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.849
 of film in which these sequences 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.040
 you see developed over time 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.079
 they were developing on the machine was 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.160
 pretty much what I keep doing to 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.160
 through the videos 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.109
 good videos are very important 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.719
 tremendously important to me because 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:50.200
 is where the time really enters 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:53.980
 it becomes clear that there is a passing and 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.879
 a transformation and a transition 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:02.269
 and a sequence I want 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:07.750
 incorporate the time element to my work 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.750
 that has always been an ideal of mine 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.000
 the music is we would say the complement 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.180
 absolute of the work I am always 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.530
 thinking in some way musically 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.820
 because my work is musical in itself 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.850
 then the creation of gorka alda is 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.680
 very important because it fits is 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.680
 made exclusively for videos 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.500
 to look back 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.960
 I started thinking about how to skate 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.430
 things are transformed depending on the 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.590
 scale has occurred the phenomenon of 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.410
 that cities are first center 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.990
 where was the church the town hall 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.180
 tell us that then the periphery is going 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.820
 dispersing and it turns out that we 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:15.430
 we find the ancient cities 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:17.800
 and the modern not me the idea of â€‹â€‹mine is that the 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.889
 center be the emptiness 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.919
 the almost sacral emptiness like when there's 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.560
 dance then you are saving a 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.710
 space 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.580
 that you do not step on that is for me the center 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:36.200
 as a construction and around that 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.200
 they are organizing things 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.430
 what I try to do 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:47.260
 it's an investigation simply about 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:52.710
 what visual language thinking about 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.710
 images can you can transmit us
