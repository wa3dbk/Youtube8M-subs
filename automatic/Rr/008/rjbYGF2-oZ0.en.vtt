got a just a credit card holder case and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.150 
got a just a credit card holder case and
which<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.050> pretty<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.739> case<00:00:49.950> by<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
which is pretty I like this case by the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.069 
which is pretty I like this case by the
way<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.969> little<00:00:51.300> shame<00:00:51.629> burr<00:00:51.780> for<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
way as a little shame burr for the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
way as a little shame burr for the
speaker<00:00:52.469> my<00:00:53.100> speakers<00:00:53.460> back<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.210> that

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
speaker my speakers back here so that

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.790 
speaker my speakers back here so that
they<00:00:54.890> engineered<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.460> case<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.500> now

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
they engineered the case for that so now

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.410 
they engineered the case for that so now
hear<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> audio<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> front<00:01:00.030> inside<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
hear the audio in the front inside the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.460 
hear the audio in the front inside the
back<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:01.370> also<00:01:02.370> got<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.019> external<00:01:04.019> glass

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
back I also got this external glass

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.670 
back I also got this external glass
world<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.460> glass<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.450> phone<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.049> $20

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
world of glass on this phone it was $20

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.219 
world of glass on this phone it was $20
but<00:01:08.490> from<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.240> worth<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:09.990> if<00:01:10.110> I

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
but from you it's it's worth it so if I

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.050 
but from you it's it's worth it so if I
drop<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> phone<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> rock<00:01:11.189> I'll<00:01:11.729> shatter

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
drop the phone on a rock I'll shatter

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.910 
drop the phone on a rock I'll shatter
the<00:01:12.360> externals<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.140> glass<00:01:13.380> instead<00:01:13.799> of

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the externals really glass instead of

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.460 
the externals really glass instead of
the<00:01:14.100> internal<00:01:14.939> don't<00:01:15.630> only<00:01:15.930> go<00:01:16.110> ahead<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the internal don't only go ahead and

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.070 
the internal don't only go ahead and
show<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.680> real<00:01:16.950> fast<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:18.600> thing<00:01:18.840> comes

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
show you real fast so this thing comes

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
then locked in like that pretty smart

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.380 
then locked in like that pretty smart
the<00:01:25.650> wires<00:01:25.979> are<00:01:26.460> right<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.360> see

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the wires are right here you can see

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.830 
the wires are right here you can see
that<00:01:27.829> right<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:28.939> so<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.210> make<00:01:30.450> sure<00:01:30.479> you

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that right there so just make sure you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.319 
that right there so just make sure you
don't<00:01:30.960> bend<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.530> too<00:01:31.710> hard<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.090> thing

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
don't bend that too hard but this thing

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.620 
don't bend that too hard but this thing
works<00:01:33.689> pretty<00:01:33.810> good<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.490> it<00:01:35.490> charges<00:01:35.729> indoor

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
works pretty good and it charges indoor

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.649 
works pretty good and it charges indoor
lighting<00:01:36.869> or<00:01:37.140> charges<00:01:37.770> from<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> Sun<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.090> even

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
lighting or charges from the Sun so even

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.800 
lighting or charges from the Sun so even
if<00:01:40.070> I'm<00:01:41.070> blocking<00:01:41.549> Hampton<00:01:41.939> solar<00:01:42.240> panel<00:01:42.659> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
if I'm blocking Hampton solar panel and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.830 
if I'm blocking Hampton solar panel and
the<00:01:42.869> LED<00:01:43.740> light<00:01:44.030> indicates<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.540> still

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the LED light indicates that it's still

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.749 
the LED light indicates that it's still
charging<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.619> external<00:01:47.100> battery<00:01:47.250> which<00:01:47.729> is

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
charging the external battery which is

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.420 
charging the external battery which is
back<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.470> external<00:01:49.920> battery<00:01:50.070> back

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
back here and the external battery back

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.940 
back here and the external battery back
here<00:01:50.670> by<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.880> way<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:52.790> 3,800<00:01:53.790> milliamp<00:01:54.270> hour

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
here by the way is 3,800 milliamp hour

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.330 
here by the way is 3,800 milliamp hour
which<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.070> pretty<00:01:56.159> good

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
which is pretty good

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.820 
which is pretty good
that<00:01:58.670> internal<00:01:59.150> battery<00:01:59.509> and<00:01:59.689> here<00:01:59.930> is<00:02:00.020> 2,300

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
that internal battery and here is 2,300

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.130 
that internal battery and here is 2,300
milliamp<00:02:01.220> hour<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:02.600> this<00:02:02.840> thing<00:02:03.110> should

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
milliamp hour so this thing should

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.039 
milliamp hour so this thing should
