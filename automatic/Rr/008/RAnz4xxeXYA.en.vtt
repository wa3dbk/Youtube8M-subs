00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello everyone is a bit different 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.859
 this is another video about books e 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.030
 this always noticias courage of chef 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.460
 and we tell each other how or the other 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.840
 what I wanted to tell you today about the house of 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.900
 ghosts little book of dickens 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.180
 charles dickens never struck me 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.380
 he doesn't know that much because he doesn't 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.689
 I do not know how nice and above all 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.630
 why have all things in winter and 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.700
 england that bidding but why up 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.540
 everything happens in winter everything 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.050
 happens under Christmas and also tales la 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.840
 ghost house happens all close 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.379
 such and tells you with the cold 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.149
 Background winter I think it is not 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.820
 that is to say, I do not play the role of a king 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.489
 because I can't argue enough 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.969
 I don't catch it in a cardboard because 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.379
 I think you go very seriously, thanks 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.909
 written to you I love you 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.159
 account is nice I was telling myself 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.090
 I think it pays you a lot in very successful 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.299
 to take capture the reader at least 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.310
 a reader like me because you do n't lose 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.659
 very very much in descriptions ok 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.880
 fantastic in his age probably 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.140
 they were something fantastic and they were 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.570
 however, today the people in front of us are mastered 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.979
 spiniello if we don't particularly say 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.960
 that they didn't reset me at all 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.939
 I read it but I stayed like that 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.680
 I did n't make either crap I liked it 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.110
 which is therefore perhaps even worse in one 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.490
 society where no emotion today 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.670
 that is, after all these years 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.390
 probably it is trivial at the time 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.040
 it was probably something innovative 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.600
 I'm not a literary expert though 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.080
 I believe that perhaps they were not at the time 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.159
 books of hours with ghosts and not in 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.439
 that way 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.710
 but today is a thing you have seen from 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.500
 already said already read jaguar owes it in 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.259
 movies and TV series so he didn't 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.569
 particularly excited I wanted though 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.420
 tell you that he has an account 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.069
