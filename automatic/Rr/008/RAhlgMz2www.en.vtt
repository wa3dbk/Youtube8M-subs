00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.850 
Arctic's over here which ecliptic flies

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.160 
Arctic's over here which ecliptic flies
that's<00:00:14.850> the<00:00:15.000> top<00:00:15.270> now<00:00:15.600> this<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.870> what<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.020> do

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
there we'll paint on which has been a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:35.420 
there we'll paint on which has been a
lot<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:27.320> must<00:01:28.320> say<00:01:29.930> just<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:33.980> nice<00:01:34.980> even

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
lot I must say just like this nice even

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.610 
lot I must say just like this nice even
coats<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.300> all<00:01:36.660> you<00:01:36.900> need<00:01:37.080> is<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.290> little

coats like that all you need is a little

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.870 
coats like that all you need is a little
little<00:01:38.130> bit<00:01:38.510> just<00:01:39.510> because<00:01:40.550> you<00:01:41.550> don't<00:01:41.730> want

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
little bit just because you don't want

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.490 
little bit just because you don't want
to<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.120> too<00:01:42.330> much<00:01:42.480> because<00:01:42.690> all<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.080> does<00:01:43.110> is

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
to be too much because all it does is

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.900 
to be too much because all it does is
just<00:01:43.650> make<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:43.950> transfer<00:01:44.430> from<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.700> heats

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
just make the transfer from the heats

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.420 
just make the transfer from the heats
and<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.120> processor<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> heatsink<00:01:46.310> just<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
and the processor to the heatsink just a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.890 
and the processor to the heatsink just a
lot<00:01:47.670> better<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:50.310> nice<00:01:50.550> back<00:01:50.970> make<00:01:51.690> sure<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
lot better so so nice back make sure you

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.330 
lot better so so nice back make sure you
have<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.050> nice<00:01:52.470> even<00:01:53.280> coat<00:01:54.620> get<00:01:55.620> it<00:01:55.770> everywhere

have a nice even coat get it everywhere
it's<00:01:56.700> little<00:01:56.940> processors<00:01:57.540> basically<00:01:58.110> black

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
it's little processors basically black

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.640 
it's little processors basically black
oh<00:01:59.480> that's<00:02:00.480> a<00:02:00.600> really<00:02:01.050> dark<00:02:01.380> gray<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:03.650> you

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
oh that's a really dark gray and you

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.750 
oh that's a really dark gray and you
know<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.800> can<00:02:05.010> get<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.400> little<00:02:05.640> metal

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
know you can get on the little metal

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.670 
know you can get on the little metal
edges<00:02:06.240> right<00:02:06.360> there<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.810> don't<00:02:06.990> want<00:02:07.230> to<00:02:07.530> get

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
edges right there you don't want to get

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.609 
edges right there you don't want to get
motherboard<00:02:08.780> can't<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.289> enough

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
motherboard can't it's just that enough

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.080 
motherboard can't it's just that enough
so<00:02:11.430> nice<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.720> evenly<00:02:13.080> put<00:02:13.410> on<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.890> little<00:02:14.849> light

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
so nice and evenly put on a little light

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.229 
so nice and evenly put on a little light
glare<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.599> processor<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:16.909> I'll<00:02:17.909> be<00:02:18.030> back

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
glare on the processor but I'll be back

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.569 
glare on the processor but I'll be back
when<00:02:18.749> installing<00:02:19.499> the<00:02:19.829> heatsink<00:02:20.609> shouldn't
