that I really like the packaging also I
think<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.140> great<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.549> lid<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.090> clear

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
think it's great that the lid is clear

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.600 
think it's great that the lid is clear
but<00:01:12.960> even<00:01:13.290> though<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.560> clear<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.340> still

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
but even though it's clear you can still

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.969 
but even though it's clear you can still
see<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.240> color<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.259> really<00:01:16.530> handy<00:01:16.830> when

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
