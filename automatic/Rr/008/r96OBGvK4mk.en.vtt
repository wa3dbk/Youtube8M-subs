00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
downside of the whole brand new Moto G

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.260 
downside of the whole brand new Moto G
is<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.049> lack<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> LTE<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.430> exactly<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.060> same

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
is the lack of LTE but exactly the same

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.359 
is the lack of LTE but exactly the same
as<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.689> first<00:01:24.960> moto<00:01:25.290> G<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.619> was<00:01:25.799> no<00:01:25.979> LTE

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
as the first moto G there was no LTE

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.270 
as the first moto G there was no LTE
only<00:01:26.869> HSPA+<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.380> we're<00:01:28.500> probably<00:01:28.770> expecting

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
only HSPA+ so we're probably expecting

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.880 
only HSPA+ so we're probably expecting
an<00:01:29.369> LTE<00:01:29.759> moto<00:01:30.090> G<00:01:30.360> coming<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.990> about<00:01:31.049> 3<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.680> 4

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
an LTE moto G coming out in about 3 to 4

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.140 
an LTE moto G coming out in about 3 to 4
months<00:01:32.220> from<00:01:32.340> now<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> biggest

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
months from now but the biggest

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.880 
months from now but the biggest
improvement<00:01:33.600> by<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> mile<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.470> brand<00:01:34.770> new

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890

improvement by a mile of this brand new
Moto<00:01:35.100> G's<00:01:35.369> definitely<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.939> build<00:01:36.270> quality<00:01:36.600> it's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850
