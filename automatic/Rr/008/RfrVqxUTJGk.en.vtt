 orders and today we will go 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:22.020
 in space with a simple command 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 it's first of all the order 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.869
 you will have a link in the descriptions 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.150
 the video that will send you to the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.070
 creator's site is all the way down there will be 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.359
 the whole order to copy so after 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.369
 when you copy it you do 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.230
 we will ask you already as a block so 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.989
 show you how to do it 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.620
 take to see in you do that steve 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.239
 zahn to activate your nick after 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.239
 two point minecraft 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.230
 how to pull from the dense low attracted 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.260
 2.8 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.280
 block and that's it you received your 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:57.370
 bluff command so here you copy 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.320
 and you paste the order here so with 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.390
 ctrl v 1 i think you do not know this 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.730
 that right click and copy a college paste 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.140
 it does not work in minecraft so 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.190
 you press finished there will be a 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.390
 small lake that's normal because it's 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.700
 relatively long 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.440
 so after you press the lever 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.830
 to operate all this machine of 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.479
 ill 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.040
 so she'll be created that's cool 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.320
 so in fact it's not a machine that 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.030
 will give you items where there will be a 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.220
 button that will give you some ideas 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.000
 no need to actually work 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.920
 something to get this item so I'm going 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 show you that so 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.670
 so I'm really sorry for 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.410
 always say so that's it then you have 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.910
 you have to take all these items that 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.000
 I then have an oak staircase 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.070
 a block of glass make forgiveness a blog 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.920
 coal to block to make a ball of 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.160
 fire and a funnel so again 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.050
 so here you have to let go of both 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.849
 blocks at the same time finally time by 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.920
 moments here are you let go of his blocks 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.410
 like that and that to give you a bad because 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.119
 everything will have written cockpit rockets that 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.220
 means that it worked so here 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.110
 do the same with that you see who 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.020
 the super it gave us a mike hart 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.590
 with writing was she that ok I do not know 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.630
 what it means 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.160
 here are you also let go of these two blocks 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.250
 and it gives you a funnel that 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.900
 is called trust hours query ok this is 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.540
 an angle we can not say that too much 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.459
 French so then 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.400
 oh yes we must also dropped all 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:30.250
 blocks finally all and all these items in 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:34.030
 same time and you will have the egg that 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.400
 so here you go you will also need 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.730
 of all these items wanted to search then 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.480
 bar to make iron block into 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.760
 websites 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.519
 pauli brick stairs an error 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.439
 and bricks of an error so in fact 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.739
 I have not if I gave you lama for 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:52.299
 detect finally for download so that 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.430
 like that you should not do it all 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.439
 work that I did seek it the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.939
 blocks and everything yeah I think I do it 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.349
 so here is there will be a link in the 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.739
 distribution the video to download 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.349
 the map 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:07.480
 So here we have to do everything in 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.769
 a platform for the rocket that is going 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.430
 allow us to go to the moon so 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:16.269
 you first do a tech cross in 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.319
 ambri of the desert at the end of this cross 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:23.349
 you put blocks to do like that 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:26.530
 after you put blocks two years of 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.930
 polite sites ah yes I still wanted to say 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.549
 that all I'm doing here is that 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.950
 compatible with the a bit from the 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.329
 1.8 a little 8 points bath provided pan de 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.290
 1.8 -3 it works 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:41.049
 on the other hand if you still play on the 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.879
 1.1.3 it does not work so here after 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.590
 with this new block of 1.8 it's 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.900
 for that in fact that I remembered 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.819
 that I needed to specify 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.310
 with this block 1 you have to do some 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:57.040
 squares in the sides of these of this 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.290
 cross that's it like that after you have 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.750
 need stairs to put 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.750
 like that here you go 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.959
 ok tek tek 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.650
 and now so now you need 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.750
 bars of iron so one in the middle 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.150
 sides have to put 3 of height 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.030
 one two three one two three one two 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.470
 three one two three are here after 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.530
 we will use 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.300
 we will finally use this egg you 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.120
 put right middle with right click 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.710
 so here after so would like well so lie 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.479
 to the rocket that will be created especially 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.580
 not to make a right click forgiveness 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.470
 will be refused because otherwise you will 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.150
 the breakage and so that in fact must all 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.150
 just go in like that 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.950
 and so now the least of the packages 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.990
 here I am, I have just removed the 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.830
 shader since after that moves in 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.020
 space here is a man 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.430
 yeah I'm doing a little ellipses we get 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.680
 found after when we are in 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.430
 the space is withering on the moon 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.200
 So here the rocket lands finally it's 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.280
 weird because it lasted finally she 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.980
 lasted less than before because 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.690
 that I did a test before so if its 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.100
 costs all that's it so here we go we 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.510
 see gun there if we do like that 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.910
 it's rotten it's stuck 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.040
 potted and I think it's done 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.210
 on purpose because finally you will see after 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.690
 you will understand 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.130
 so she will explode one is where way 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.900
 finally anyway why throw 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:36.360
 Anyway sometimes I say what 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.680
 I blocked ok I have to say no matter 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.510
 what because she actually I really 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.890
 too tired today with courage 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.530
 did not have to do like the French because 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.140
 that I remind you that I am in 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.160
 germany at school so so we have everything 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.830
 his art in all its positions 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:54.380
 slowness of fatigue and those to get up 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:56.460
 3 bayal a thing that is missing 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.300
 so that's like it was 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.200
 really on the moon 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:05.250
 here it is cool here they just have me 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.630
 the combination of two of our successes is going 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.630
 on the moon it's more like on up 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.130
 of astronomers so here are men then 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.470
 it's not a new world 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.210
 created on the world you wrote that 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.650
 it's a shame but he can not 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.950
 to make it simple we can do that on 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.290
 servers with multi world is in 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.090
 just above our platform 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:29.500
 there is something ugly that was created 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:31.090
 so there is this kind of half moon 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.690
 it's weird it's not round there 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:39.820
 but she is she goes in every way 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.840
 So yeah that's it I think 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.660
 cool enough what can we do with a 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.950
 order anyway I already have him for 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.300
 this command because it really 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:53.470
 manage so here I thought everything for 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.540
 this video yeah so I hope these 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:59.260
 12 hours this video will have pleased you 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.910
 this video will please you and you liked 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.650
 a little bit of bike that makes me super 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.160
 pleasure and that's it and especially shown 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.160
 the attack
