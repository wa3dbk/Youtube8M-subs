to the states to start animating for big
mouth<00:04:43.660> we<00:04:43.900> know<00:04:44.050> it<00:04:44.950> is<00:04:45.070> not<00:04:45.100> about<00:04:45.340> this

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
mouth we know it is not about this

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.629 
mouth we know it is not about this
project<00:04:45.940> for<00:04:46.419> this<00:04:46.720> is<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.990> facility<00:04:47.680> we're<00:04:48.520> not

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
project for this is a facility we're not

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.690 
project for this is a facility we're not
let<00:04:48.850> me<00:04:49.030> we<00:04:49.570> had<00:04:50.290> a<00:04:50.320> chance<00:04:50.590> to<00:04:50.770> climb<00:04:50.979> to<00:04:51.220> 14

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
let me we had a chance to climb to 14

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.379 
let me we had a chance to climb to 14
years<00:04:51.840> out<00:04:52.840> of<00:04:53.070> almost<00:04:54.070> 16<00:04:54.669> that<00:04:54.880> they're<00:04:55.090> in

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
years out of almost 16 that they're in

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.530 
years out of almost 16 that they're in
there<00:04:55.630> in<00:04:55.840> Colorado<00:04:56.290> although<00:04:56.590> I<00:04:57.240> think<00:04:58.240> it's

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
there in Colorado although I think it's

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
there in Colorado although I think it's
a<00:04:58.690> life<00:04:59.229> interest<00:05:00.270> yeah<00:05:01.270> so<00:05:01.630> this<00:05:01.930> this

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
a life interest yeah so this this

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.280 
a life interest yeah so this this
project<00:05:03.070> is<00:05:03.190> a<00:05:03.250> in<00:05:04.030> the<00:05:04.150> leadville<00:05:04.479> area<00:05:04.810> and

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
project is a in the leadville area and

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.500 
project is a in the leadville area and
we're<00:05:05.440> as<00:05:05.530> you<00:05:05.680> saw<00:05:05.919> there<00:05:05.950> there's<00:05:06.520> there's

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
we're as you saw there there's there's

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.030 
we're as you saw there there's there's
several<00:05:07.720> fourteeners<00:05:08.320> at<00:05:08.500> this<00:05:08.889> particular

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
several fourteeners at this particular

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.640 
several fourteeners at this particular
range<00:05:09.490> so<00:05:10.030> i<00:05:10.419> think<00:05:10.540> our<00:05:10.900> audience<00:05:10.930> might<00:05:11.410> need

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
range so i think our audience might need

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.820 
range so i think our audience might need
to<00:05:11.800> know<00:05:11.950> what<00:05:12.130> a<00:05:12.280> protein<00:05:12.700> Ares<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:13.210> sure<00:05:13.419> yeah

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
to know what a protein Ares so sure yeah

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.560 
to know what a protein Ares so sure yeah
so<00:05:14.830> 14<00:05:15.220> ER<00:05:15.250> is<00:05:15.550> over<00:05:15.790> 40<00:05:16.060> is<00:05:16.120> a<00:05:16.210> fourteen

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
so 14 ER is over 40 is a fourteen

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.570 
so 14 ER is over 40 is a fourteen
thousand<00:05:16.930> foot<00:05:17.050> mountain<00:05:17.380> which<00:05:17.830> is<00:05:18.010> roughly

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
thousand foot mountain which is roughly

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.100 
thousand foot mountain which is roughly
40<00:05:18.910> 30<00:05:19.150> million<00:05:19.450> were<00:05:19.570> thinking<00:05:19.810> what<00:05:19.930> did<00:05:19.960> you

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
40 30 million were thinking what did you

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.240 
40 30 million were thinking what did you
hundred<00:05:20.320> meters<00:05:20.500> in<00:05:20.620> like<00:05:20.740> that<00:05:20.919> and<00:05:22.169> like<00:05:23.250> you

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
hundred meters in like that and like you

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.350 
hundred meters in like that and like you
said<00:05:24.400> there's<00:05:24.669> almost<00:05:24.789> six<00:05:25.060> different

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
said there's almost six different

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.969 
said there's almost six different
Colorado<00:05:25.690> but<00:05:25.870> there's<00:05:26.050> a<00:05:26.110> spring<00:05:26.500> jumps<00:05:26.860> out

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
Colorado but there's a spring jumps out

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.860 
Colorado but there's a spring jumps out
of<00:05:27.010> level<00:05:27.370> the<00:05:27.490> salon<00:05:27.760> change<00:05:28.210> where<00:05:28.720> there's

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
of level the salon change where there's

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.590 
of level the salon change where there's
14<00:05:29.289> of<00:05:29.320> them<00:05:29.500> all<00:05:30.070> work<00:05:30.250> right<00:05:30.520> in<00:05:30.640> a<00:05:30.700> row<00:05:30.820> so

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
14 of them all work right in a row so

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.740 
14 of them all work right in a row so
it's<00:05:31.840> very<00:05:32.770> logical<00:05:33.370> to<00:05:33.520> to<00:05:34.330> get<00:05:34.479> them<00:05:34.600> all

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
it's very logical to to get them all

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.700 
it's very logical to to get them all
home<00:05:35.229> one<00:05:35.500> shot<00:05:35.740> well<00:05:36.310> logica<00:05:37.090> I<00:05:37.120> mean<00:05:37.470> well<00:05:38.470> it

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
home one shot well logica I mean well it

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.950 
home one shot well logica I mean well it
makes<00:05:39.490> sense<00:05:39.610> like<00:05:40.090> okay<00:05:40.360> there's<00:05:40.600> the<00:05:40.780> waves

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
makes sense like okay there's the waves

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.830 
makes sense like okay there's the waves
and<00:05:41.820> but<00:05:42.820> it's<00:05:42.970> a<00:05:43.860> about<00:05:44.860> 90<00:05:45.250> miles<00:05:45.430> so<00:05:45.910> yeah<00:05:46.810> I

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
and but it's a about 90 miles so yeah I

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.260 
and but it's a about 90 miles so yeah I
don't<00:05:47.020> know<00:05:47.169> what<00:05:47.380> that<00:05:47.410> would<00:05:47.590> be<00:05:47.620> it's<00:05:47.919> like

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
don't know what that would be it's like

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.660 
don't know what that would be it's like
150k<00:05:49.590> and<00:05:51.150> about

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
150k and about

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.900 
150k and about
almost<00:05:54.510> 15,000<00:05:55.410> years<00:05:55.560> I'm<00:05:56.040> very<00:05:56.100> cool<00:05:56.640> yeah

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
almost 15,000 years I'm very cool yeah

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.480 
almost 15,000 years I'm very cool yeah
it's<00:05:57.450> a<00:05:57.660> lot<00:05:57.810> it's<00:05:58.140> a<00:05:58.260> lot<00:05:58.320> because<00:05:59.190> it's

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
it's a lot it's a lot because it's

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.520 
it's a lot it's a lot because it's
because<00:05:59.880> you<00:06:00.000> don't<00:06:00.180> it's<00:06:00.390> almost<00:06:00.720> all<00:06:01.170> opted

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
because you don't it's almost all opted

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.980 
because you don't it's almost all opted
around<00:06:01.860> you<00:06:02.370> just<00:06:02.490> go<00:06:02.670> from<00:06:02.850> summit<00:06:03.300> to<00:06:03.780> valley

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
around you just go from summit to valley

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.110 
around you just go from summit to valley
the<00:06:04.200> sample<00:06:04.740> of<00:06:05.130> not<00:06:05.340> to<00:06:05.490> mention<00:06:05.880> that<00:06:06.000> the

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
the sample of not to mention that the

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.450 
the sample of not to mention that the
average<00:06:06.360> altitude<00:06:06.960> you<00:06:07.560> do<00:06:07.740> running<00:06:08.100> and<00:06:08.280> will

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
average altitude you do running and will

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.730 
average altitude you do running and will
be<00:06:08.610> on<00:06:08.640> or<00:06:08.940> thousand<00:06:09.360> more<00:06:09.540> legs<00:06:09.780> oh<00:06:10.110> yeah

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
be on or thousand more legs oh yeah

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.520 
be on or thousand more legs oh yeah
because<00:06:11.040> the<00:06:11.700> peaks<00:06:11.940> are<00:06:12.180> you<00:06:12.480> know<00:06:12.630> 42<00:06:13.140> or<00:06:13.290> 43

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
because the peaks are you know 42 or 43

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.450 
because the peaks are you know 42 or 43
hundred<00:06:14.010> and<00:06:14.190> the<00:06:14.250> valleys<00:06:14.700> are<00:06:15.770> 28<00:06:16.770> 33

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
hundred and the valleys are 28 33

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.490 
hundred and the valleys are 28 33
thousands<00:06:18.180> of<00:06:18.270> like<00:06:18.480> that's<00:06:18.900> what<00:06:19.050> people<00:06:19.380> to

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
thousands of like that's what people to

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.070 
thousands of like that's what people to
get<00:06:19.620> an<00:06:19.740> idea<00:06:19.830> could<00:06:20.520> we<00:06:20.640> say<00:06:20.850> that<00:06:21.120> at<00:06:21.330> 4,000

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
get an idea could we say that at 4,000

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.500 
get an idea could we say that at 4,000
in<00:06:22.320> example<00:06:22.830> you'd<00:06:22.980> be<00:06:23.130> running<00:06:23.370> with<00:06:23.700> thirty

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
in example you'd be running with thirty

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.810 
in example you'd be running with thirty
percent<00:06:24.990> less<00:06:25.230> oxygen<00:06:25.470> or<00:06:25.950> less<00:06:26.370> something

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
percent less oxygen or less something

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
pressure up there so there's not a steak

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.190 
pressure up there so there's not a steak
yeah<00:06:32.520> it's<00:06:33.150> it's<00:06:33.600> gonna<00:06:33.780> be<00:06:33.930> the<00:06:33.990> more

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
yeah it's it's gonna be the more

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.950 
volcania and i'll do the speed go 50k in
the<00:07:00.330> states<00:07:01.070> and<00:07:02.070> then<00:07:02.390> yeah<00:07:03.390> then<00:07:03.420> you<00:07:03.780> rock

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
focus races for the year I have a few

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.880 
focus races for the year I have a few
other<00:07:11.090> there's<00:07:12.090> another<00:07:12.360> goal<00:07:13.290> to<00:07:13.410> help<00:07:13.530> range

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:13.890 
other there's another goal to help range

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.570 
other there's another goal to help range
around<00:07:14.430> it's<00:07:14.820> over<00:07:14.970> by<00:07:15.120> a<00:07:15.150> spec<00:07:15.560> and<00:07:16.560> there's<00:07:17.100> 7

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
around it's over by a spec and there's 7

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.930 
around it's over by a spec and there's 7
14<00:07:18.030> years<00:07:18.180> in<00:07:18.210> that<00:07:18.360> range<00:07:18.690> don't<00:07:18.930> like<00:07:19.050> this

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 
14 years in that range don't like this

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.990 
14 years in that range don't like this
and<00:07:20.940> that<00:07:21.390> should<00:07:21.540> be<00:07:22.430> take<00:07:23.430> about<00:07:23.610> half<00:07:23.670> as

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 
and that should be take about half as

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.870 
and that should be take about half as
long<00:07:24.150> yeah<00:07:25.080> so<00:07:25.680> instead<00:07:25.950> of<00:07:26.010> maybe<00:07:26.220> 30<00:07:26.520> hours

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 
long yeah so instead of maybe 30 hours

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.230 
long yeah so instead of maybe 30 hours
of<00:07:26.910> take<00:07:27.540> 15<00:07:28.130> would<00:07:29.130> you<00:07:29.250> be<00:07:29.430> surprised<00:07:30.060> you

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 
of take 15 would you be surprised you

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.640 
of take 15 would you be surprised you
