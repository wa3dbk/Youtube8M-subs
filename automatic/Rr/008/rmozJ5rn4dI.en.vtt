okay<00:00:48.850> just<00:00:49.030> from<00:00:49.570> a<00:00:49.630> defensive<00:00:50.050> point<00:00:50.290> of<00:00:50.410> view

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500

okay just from a defensive point of view
I<00:00:50.560> think<00:00:50.650> you<00:00:51.070> guys<00:00:51.250> realize<00:00:51.730> that<00:00:52.210> the

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
I think you guys realize that the

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.570 
I think you guys realize that the
collision<00:00:52.930> is<00:00:53.050> massive<00:00:53.650> massive<00:00:53.950> in

collision is massive massive in

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.270 
collision is massive massive in
professional<00:00:55.330> rugby<00:00:55.450> special<00:00:55.990> especially<00:00:56.530> so

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
professional rugby special especially so

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.710 
professional rugby special especially so
one<00:00:57.700> is<00:00:57.820> going<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.000> make<00:00:58.180> sure<00:00:58.330> that<00:00:58.540> you

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
one is going to make sure that you

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.570 
one is going to make sure that you
dominate<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.920> collision<00:01:00.310> and<00:01:00.430> that

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
dominate the collision and that

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.220 
dominate the collision and that
advantage<00:01:00.730> line<00:01:01.240> battle<00:01:01.660> should<00:01:01.870> be<00:01:01.990> run

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
advantage line battle should be run

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
that's the most important thing that is

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.120 
that's the most important thing that is
why<00:01:04.330> you<00:01:04.390> find<00:01:04.750> double<00:01:04.900> tackling<00:01:05.410> in<00:01:05.650> close

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130

guy outside the outside him so it's

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.430 
guy outside the outside him so it's
important<00:01:18.520> that<00:01:18.730> once<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.780> tackle<00:01:20.140> is<00:01:20.229> made

they left he's lifted the lid leg which
is<00:02:18.800> destabilizing<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.930> ball<00:02:21.290> carrier

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
is destabilizing that the ball carrier

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.010 
is destabilizing that the ball carrier
he<00:02:22.340> comes<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.060> make<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.360> double<00:02:23.660> hit

high<00:02:29.240> which<00:02:29.930> will<00:02:30.140> be<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.290> dangerous<00:02:30.710> tackle

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
high which will be a dangerous tackle

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.940 
high which will be a dangerous tackle

him that's a dangerous tackle and from

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.130 
him that's a dangerous tackle and from
the<00:02:55.310> double-hit<00:02:55.760> perspective<00:02:56.330> if<00:02:56.570> this<00:02:56.900> arm

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140

excellent and the tackler the guy made

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.150 
excellent and the tackler the guy made
the<00:03:05.330> initial<00:03:05.510> atmosphere<00:03:06.260> alized<00:03:06.590> he's

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
the initial atmosphere alized he's

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.310 
the initial atmosphere alized he's
destabilized<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.180> tap<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.900> ball<00:03:09.110> carrier

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
destabilized the tap to the ball carrier

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.770 
destabilized the tap to the ball carrier
and<00:03:09.770> he<00:03:10.070> can<00:03:10.250> release<00:03:10.550> it<00:03:10.790> then<00:03:10.940> after<00:03:11.360> there

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
and he can release it then after there

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.710 
and he can release it then after there
is<00:03:11.930> forward<00:03:12.200> momentum<00:03:12.440> going<00:03:13.239> okay<00:03:14.239> so<00:03:14.300> that's

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
is forward momentum going okay so that's

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.660 
is forward momentum going okay so that's
all<00:03:14.900> in<00:03:15.170> within<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.920> law
