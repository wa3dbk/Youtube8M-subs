00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.780 
this is but how incredible incredibly
like<00:02:33.980> mountainous<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.159> other<00:02:35.340> parts<00:02:35.640> are

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
like mountainous the other parts are

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.000 
like mountainous the other parts are
it's<00:02:36.299> just<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.629> best<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.200> both<00:02:37.349> worlds<00:02:37.829> this

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
it's just the best of both worlds this

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.180 
it's just the best of both worlds this
is<00:02:38.190> definitely<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.940> top<00:02:39.290> seed<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.890> year

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
is definitely the top seed of the year

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.580 
is definitely the top seed of the year
of<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.430> life<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.269> century<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.439> the
