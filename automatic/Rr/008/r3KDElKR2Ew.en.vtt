00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.020 
sort of the atmosphere in Cleveland yeah
it<00:03:32.380> does<00:03:32.650> because<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.130> Zeke's<00:03:33.370> point<00:03:33.609> earlier

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
it does because the Zeke's point earlier

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.339 
it does because the Zeke's point earlier
year<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.209> heard<00:03:34.450> Mike<00:03:34.660> Miller<00:03:34.900> say<00:03:35.139> this

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
year you heard Mike Miller say this

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.589 
year you heard Mike Miller say this
offensive<00:03:35.769> one<00:03:36.099> line<00:03:36.310> genius<00:03:36.819> well<00:03:37.419> there's

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
offensive one line genius well there's

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.960 
offensive one line genius well there's
15<00:03:37.959> often<00:03:38.290> so<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.799> office<00:03:39.099> not<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.310> problem<00:03:39.669> I

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
15 often so the office not the problem I

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.580 
15 often so the office not the problem I
think<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.540> last<00:03:40.720> four<00:03:40.959> years<00:03:40.989> LeBron

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
think the last four years LeBron

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.370 
think the last four years LeBron
realized<00:03:42.280> how<00:03:42.519> tough<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:43.090> defense<00:03:43.690> had<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:44.139> be

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
realized how tough the defense had to be

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.740 
realized how tough the defense had to be
when<00:03:44.889> you<00:03:44.919> got<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.519> playoffs<00:03:45.819> and<00:03:46.239> how

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
when you got to the playoffs and how

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.569 
when you got to the playoffs and how
each<00:03:47.019> round<00:03:47.319> you<00:03:47.530> got<00:03:47.709> close<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.160> finals

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
each round you got close to the finals

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.120 
each round you got close to the finals
you<00:03:49.180> had<00:03:49.299> to<00:03:49.389> play<00:03:49.540> even<00:03:49.599> better<00:03:49.780> defense<00:03:50.650> so

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
you had to play even better defense so

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.039 
you had to play even better defense so
now<00:03:51.310> they're<00:03:51.519> 20<00:03:51.730> 30<00:03:52.180> throughout<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.690> season

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
now they're 20 30 throughout the season

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.349 
now they're 20 30 throughout the season
twenty<00:03:53.349> seventh<00:03:53.799> and<00:03:53.919> defense<00:03:54.069> so<00:03:54.549> that<00:03:55.120> type

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
twenty seventh and defense so that type

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.180 
twenty seventh and defense so that type
of<00:03:55.389> defense<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:56.049> not<00:03:56.290> going<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.709> win<00:03:56.889> a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
of defense is not going to win a

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.550 
of defense is not going to win a
championship<00:03:57.609> maybe<00:03:58.540> that's<00:03:58.810> why<00:03:58.959> LeBrons<00:03:59.349> in

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
championship maybe that's why LeBrons in

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.229 
championship maybe that's why LeBrons in
chill<00:03:59.769> mode<00:03:59.799> he<00:04:00.160> had<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.340> go<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.489> Orlando<00:04:01.060> have

chill mode he had to go to Orlando have

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.659 
chill mode he had to go to Orlando have
