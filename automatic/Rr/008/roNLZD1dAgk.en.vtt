now<00:00:31.019> installing<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:32.040> I'll<00:00:32.610> lay<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.120> this

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
now installing it I'll lay it out this

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.389 
now installing it I'll lay it out this
foam<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.079> most<00:00:34.290> important<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:34.950> got<00:00:35.100> EV<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
foam is the most important it's got EV a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.340 
foam is the most important it's got EV a
foam<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.390> locks<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> back<00:00:37.320> of

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
foam here and that locks on the back of

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.400 
foam here and that locks on the back of
a<00:00:37.620> strut<00:00:38.040> there<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> feed<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> final<00:00:40.110> stitch

locked<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.660> once<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.020> slide<00:00:46.350> it

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
locked on to that so once I slide it

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.459 
locked on to that so once I slide it
underneath<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.420> pull<00:00:48.420> my<00:00:48.600> camera<00:00:49.020> up<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.410> I

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
understand on here is there is a loop on

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.660 
understand on here is there is a loop on
the<00:01:20.640> back<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:22.110> mount<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:23.159> loop<00:01:23.490> is

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the back of the mount and this loop is

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.490 
the back of the mount and this loop is
to<00:01:23.850> put<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.210> lease<00:01:24.450> through<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.259> have

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
any problems or think that you might

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.550 
any problems or think that you might
break<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.479> these<00:01:27.630> bases<00:01:27.840> which<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.380> have

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
break one of these bases which we have

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.039 
break one of these bases which we have
seen<00:01:28.890> very<00:01:29.280> few<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.299> does<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> loose

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
seen very few but it does have a loose

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.130 
seen very few but it does have a loose
leash<00:01:31.770> loop<00:01:32.220> right<00:01:32.610> underneath<00:01:33.000> here<00:01:33.420> but

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
leash loop right underneath here but

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.440 
leash loop right underneath here but
these<00:01:34.829> are<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> lot<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.340> fun<00:01:35.670> change<00:01:36.329> your

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
these are a lot of fun change your

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.630 
these are a lot of fun change your
angles<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.960> your<00:01:37.110> cameras<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.400> also

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
angles of your cameras you can also

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.910 
angles of your cameras you can also
install<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.720> any<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> struts<00:01:40.530> going

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
install this on any of the struts going

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.429
