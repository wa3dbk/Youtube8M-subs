00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.580 
don't have a weapon so I'm yet no God
I'm<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.720> take<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.050> as<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.260> good<00:00:25.529> sign

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
I'm going to take that as a good sign

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.130
