00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.780
 you know that I was distressed 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.670
 yes I do them myself I find that 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.139
 it's pretty basic so I did not do it 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.970

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.160

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.460
 how would you show you a 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.140
 little how did I do but he knows that 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.449
 I used two packets of wicks in 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.090
 of colors it does not color tron 2 of 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.040
 the brand expression I will put some 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.660
 pictures if I find it but it's 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.050
 really simple I cut the packets 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.360
 in 4 and I put the traits without order 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.340
 special in genius at a place one month 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.010
 meet a red and here is the result 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.809
 I like it enough but here is the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.000
 about the video we're going to be from you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.070
 explain how to hydrate your hair to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.590
 the inside of yours often when that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.750
 13 we say ok I'll blow I'm going 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.670
 I will do something else I will go out 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.199
 a little bit and even my hair but this is 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.699
 absolutely no reason to stop 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.080
 to take care of your hair because 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.939
 if you did not scratch the video 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.650
 distress when you go to undo them 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.619
 down they are going to be super dry and brittle 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.450
 he the primary goal that was the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.000
 protect them from having a 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.890
 protective hairstyle turn into 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.810
 destructive hairstyle because your 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.909
 hair is dry and completely broken 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.040
 inside your restanques this him 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.049
 know how to jtrack my hair to 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.759
 inside braids kill the video 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.200
 so I'm going here betting my head in half 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.000
 sections it's always easier for 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.640
 I'm working in section I'm going 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.320
 start by spraying my hair back 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.329
 with loki inside my 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.579
 vaporizer I'm just going to put 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.780
 just a bit of history just moisten 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.210
 I do not want to have hair 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.790
 completely wet inside 2013 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.020
 then I'll add my living room 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.119
 Cheryl fault excuses 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.890
 he is really very good 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.270
 scented are super good and not cost 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.090
 dear I think it costs in the 7 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.090
 euros etc for 355 milliliters I find 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.040
 that they see it absolutely 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.090
 I just put it at the level of the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.100
 things stop this is absolutely 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.920
 not worth guide missed all the attraction 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.810
 it's waste of products so I 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.000
 put it everywhere everywhere in all my 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.490
 head I forget no press but I 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.960
 going really fast game 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.960
 I will not go into detail what 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.390
 he was really not going beyond the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.580
 game cover stops because that would be 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.769
 as I just said of the dies 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.769
 full looting of such a good product 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.019
 then I will sell the hydration 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.609
 with my burkina shea butter if 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.290
 you saw my previous videos you 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.540
 know that I love shea butter 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.909
 burkina I'm going to melt in the 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.640
 just mares that it's completely 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:00.129
 liquid it's super fat but I love 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.170
 so I'm going to put it on the braids 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.000
 also just where my 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.670
 hair stops I do not put any 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.450
 tons because it's hot so do not 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.450
 must not exaggerate 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.940
 so we must not forget the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.500
 scalp is a mixture of oil 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.200
 of olives and castor oil that I have 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.480
 in this small container applicators 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.190
 apply it especially in the scalp and 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.690
 I must admit that I do not 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.640
 the oil on my scalp that when 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.650
 I have 13 because in general I have 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.140
 really lazy in m and I do not like 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.480
 have the whole scalp a tile and 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.720
 so I do that when I distressed 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.220
 the rest of the time but my scalp 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.290
 he has no oil and he does not 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.810
 no less well so here I put it just 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.280
 to feed and who knows how to stimulate the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.019
 push I really do not take my head 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.480
 with oil on my scalp 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.790
 but for the hair in front of me 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.350
 and I put it every night to avoid 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.000
 the box to boost your installation 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.440
 hair in front because whatever he in 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.739
 either the 13 always end up 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.739
 break 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.870
 and that's all for my journey and 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.820
 mini mistress aggression I do it 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.950
 once a week every Sunday 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.830
 and that's all I think it's 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.150
 rather simple it takes just 5 10 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.740
 minutes depending on the quantity does 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.960
 would be what you have and it will not do 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.610
 as well a hair and more things 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.530
 are superb 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.530
 I'm kisses and at the next
