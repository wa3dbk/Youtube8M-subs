00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.430
 DVD review with a new trailer check 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.960
 and I just wanted to go to one 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.400
 press screening I do not have a trailer 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.110
 My eyes were totally cool 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.190
 and thought combo has does so 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.630
 quickly a trailer check can do it yourself 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.160
 but not building more green screen 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.820
 so the white wall sorry for that and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.550
 that's about it's the end of it 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.140
 even james franco in dryness 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.430
 we are in a bunker because the maya 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.900
 thought this week is the world under 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.880
 have you ever shit may 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.099
 why do not we listen to the no 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.570
 suspect maja fixer and the shitty one 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.279
 is that we have filmed in the film 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.899
 well it comes out next summer well 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.579
 maybe that shitty one is that 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.110
 but the world went under was 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.030
 circumstances never really suit him 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.379
 funny it's about the end of the world we are 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.700
 have prepared the scene so that the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.379
 work was not completely in vain 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.379
 we'll do that in here for so long 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.890
 i could be a bit if i did 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.480
 do not change 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.550
 the penis is mightier than the beautiful 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.910
 that my father and the grass both 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.940
 clear 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.979
 dixon not actually go ever 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.360
 not more about me but I carry you 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.049

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.590

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.670

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.650
 Everything cool he should have for us 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.190
 all are enough until we get irritated 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.910

 He must have been over the top again 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.620
 everything is danced , you danced 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.580
 was white stuff in the face frank 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.050
 Come on, you have someone 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.130
 blown storm probably has 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.380
 watched and got one down 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.100
 jay did not know that you are beautiful here 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.750
 to see you 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.430
 we did not blow ourselves and are 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.990
 not even hey james franco about it yesterday 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.400
 no flute sucked now I know 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.810
 then sure that you give optics 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.640
 really not what happened last night 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.090
 is that because maybe so to sit 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.740
 stay 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.600
 a few are pretty over 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.200
 things happened and there were many 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.259
 dead 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.540
 Tell me about those dead old sails 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.840
 is there crucified michael sailer is 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.550
 dead 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.440
 david michaels has that is a bitter 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.910
 loss 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.910
 Michael Cera is dead 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.340
 are you doing now, it does better than 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.800
 in the last six movie where the hell 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.060
 was that in green hornet werner you are 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.350
 one who was nominated for the oscar 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.480
 So the Swiss had to be right 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.560
 sell so there was dead there is so 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:40.720
 many dead so many dead okay that was 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.720
 good for making jokes what is it 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.090
 On Sunday 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.459
 6 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:09.300
 So today I have mine for the first time 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.300
 own therefore troops do not resent 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.580
 as far as comedies are concerned, 2013 is not 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.650
 that too, that I am so incredible 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.240
 Happy in January seems to be mobile forms 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.620
 reader can be pretty funny like one 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.580
 I think the same as hangover 3 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.590
 this year should start 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.330
 I'm curious to be fifth of 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.950
 I peek a little bit away 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.600
 which still holds so but with 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.160
 that's the end of a new movie 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.540
 Cheated on if I am now 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.570
 earlier but the bringing sony 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.760
 Pictures unfortunately only on 29 august 2013 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.770
 the cinemas are waiting for many months 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.850
 somehow the story is told here 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.890
 of six friends in one 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.120
 apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.130
 the world actually live the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.900
 maya calendar somehow arrived 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.400
 a great part of humanity is destroyed 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.930
 is somehow somehow trying again 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.100
 to crawl and survive together 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.380
 In the process , these six friends learn each other 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.020
 know better than you ever thought 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.670
 live in le and are now in one 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.930
 very difficult situation as a whole 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.490
 Comedy packed with a lot 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.500
 fecal humor the actual number i 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.880
 that one thinks okay that can now 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.620
 not as good as it is known 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.060
 the comedy the hardest subject and to 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.650
 need a terrific cast though 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.270
 that's exactly where the film is a real 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.010
 really a lot known 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.450
 faces like emma watson many guys 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.239
 we know and the three best known 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.609
 of them are john james franco and seth 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.320
 rogen than yourself and I like that 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.270
 really cool that just yourself 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.660
 a lot of self-irony play here at 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.280
 Day 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.840
 Alone that trailer sees that 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.610
 heart tomorrow here the sidekick allowed 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.260
 on his performance in green lantern 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.090
 or that you meet six 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.770
 assume that he does not spend a day 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.840
 could blow one without a man 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.160
 I think that's pretty daring 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.600
 pretty cool that it goes over 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.070
 let hello africa are quite 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.410
 Oscar-nominated actors and 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.000
 that's why not any little ones 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.470
 Henchman and that's exactly how it works 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.220
 ranks sonar help in oscar 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.720
 was nominated 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.220
 I think great class makes the trailer 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.990
 I already enjoy it, I hope it is 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.880
 just a small sample of the film 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.470
 and that's where the movie is 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.630
 definitely now on my watchlist and 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.250
 trailer is just since 24 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.390
 hours out I hope you find that 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.310

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.290
 Although not august nor one said 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.030

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.590
