00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.810
 how to increase muscle mass 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.240
 quickly 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.040
 do not confuse strength training 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.410
 with volume because they are not equal 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.660
 and you usually find people who think 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.000
 that to raise muscle mass there is 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.040
 lift all the weight you can this is 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.290
 an error because you will not be able to increase 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.810
 volume but will increase in any case 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.090
 some force and can even cause you 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.190
 an injury to the muscle for it 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.170
 you need to make a greater number of 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.329
 repetitions in your series other 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.310
 repetitions at least to make it 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.739
 volume training plus the 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.260
 recovery between series and series must 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.210
 be longer, you're wrong in 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.670
 think that those who go to the gym and 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.890
 they have better body and more muscles are 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.360
 those who lift more weight and therefore 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.430
 they have more strength 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.610
 Volume training should 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.610
 make between 70 and 80 percent of your 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.340
 strength in each repetition and instead the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.080
 90 or 100 basal strength training 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.540
 percent of your strength in each 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.490
 rising so you must do it 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.620
 in the correct way to get up 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.180
 muscle mass and get results 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.190
 visible 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.870
 you should know that all the nutrients 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.060
 of supplements are taken out of the 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.220
 food and not for that they will be more 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.590
 effective and you will get better 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.630
 results are good because we 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.979
 facilitate the intake of nutrients and 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.860
 which for example is easier to take 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.390
 multivitamin supplements to ingest 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.770
 a lot of food for 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.780
 achieve the same nutrients 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.520
 the protein is important but not 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.140
 forget that you should eat 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.539
 carbohydrates to increase your 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.880
 assimilation in the muscle cell due 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.740
 to its effect for in your life so 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.630
 help the protein assimilation of 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.819
 muscle and the rest of the processes 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.280
 metabolic of the body and that is not 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.619
 found in the supplements only 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.600
 manages to spend money and not because 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.969
 other does not mean that they will go up 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.189
 muscle mass faster and even if you take 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.899
 expensive and good brand supplements that 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.690
 promise miracles when it comes to winning 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.420
 muscle 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.640
 and the method is possible at least 18 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.560
 hours sleeping little affects the process of 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.390
 recovery and regeneration 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.490
 muscle tissues that have been damaged 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.680
 in training, lengthening the time 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.020
 of recovery needed to get 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.000
 recover you while they themselves 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.070
 they act growth hormone which 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.830
 it helps us to increase muscle mass and 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.710
 lose fat one of the bases to catch 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.040
 volume is sleeping a lot eating a lot and not 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.019
 train too 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.359
 Be careful with stimulants with 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.099
 caffeine, guarana and ephedrine since 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.530
 can have side effects in your 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.870
 Real body that can help us 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.269
 lose weight and burn fat but you have a 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.250
 accelerating effect which will make your 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.439
 pulsations and your heart go more 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.780
 quickly so not all the people at 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:03:00.130
 taking it tolerates it well that's why it's better 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.900
 take a fat burner of l carnitine 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.120
 if you want to know more about how 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.350
 get a body with muscles 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.780
