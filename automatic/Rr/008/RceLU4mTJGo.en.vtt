exciting game restore today I'll be
showing<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.660> how<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.840> do<00:00:34.050> smooth<00:00:34.440> rotations

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
showing you how to do smooth rotations

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.119 
showing you how to do smooth rotations
right<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.150> for<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.480> I've<00:00:36.809> created<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.559> mob

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
right so for this I've created the mob

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.619 
right so for this I've created the mob
cannon<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.670> demonstrate<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.239> rotation

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
cannon to demonstrate the rotation

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.360 
cannon to demonstrate the rotation
purposes<00:00:39.930> look<00:00:40.110> at<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.890> mob<00:00:41.100> dude

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
purposes look at this it's a mob dude

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.790 
purposes look at this it's a mob dude
he's<00:00:41.730> got<00:00:42.000> his<00:00:42.120> purple<00:00:42.480> arms<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.900> this<00:00:43.410> weird

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
cannon it's just him on a giant gun

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.620 
cannon it's just him on a giant gun
which<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.430> cool<00:00:47.580> that<00:00:48.180> that's<00:00:48.449> nice

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630

and what he's going to do is basically

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180 
and what he's going to do is basically
rotate<00:00:51.210> towards<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> mouse<00:00:51.750> now<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.950> are

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
rotate towards the mouse now if you are

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.770 
rotate towards the mouse now if you are
a<00:00:53.510> regular<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.610> sorrell<00:00:56.610> series<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.239> I

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
a regular of this sorrell series and I

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.299 
a regular of this sorrell series and I
have<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.960> ask<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.380> do<00:00:58.530> something<00:00:58.950> like

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
have to ask you to do something like

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.299 
have to ask you to do something like
this<00:00:59.630> basically<00:01:00.630> from<00:01:01.079> what<00:01:01.320> I've<00:01:01.590> said

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
this basically from what I've said

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.670 
this basically from what I've said
before<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.120> something<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.320> image

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
before you do something like this image

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.280 
before you do something like this image
angle<00:01:05.040> equals<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.119> then<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.330> whip<00:01:06.990> out<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
angle equals and then you whip out the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.680 
angle equals and then you whip out the
point<00:01:07.649> Direction<00:01:08.130> function<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> X<00:01:09.509> and

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
point Direction function with the X and

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.710 
point Direction function with the X and
the<00:01:09.750> y<00:01:09.930> whoops<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.420> gnostics<00:01:12.420> applause

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the y whoops and the gnostics applause

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.520 
the y whoops and the gnostics applause
why<00:01:12.899> write<00:01:14.300> something<00:01:15.300> like<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
why write something like that and it

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.529 
why write something like that and it
would<00:01:16.619> work<00:01:16.800> you<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:18.030> good<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.450> not

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
would work you know it's good it's not

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.320 
would work you know it's good it's not
bad<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.350> know<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.649> works<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.910> we<00:01:21.060> play

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
bad it you know it works and if we play

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.080 
bad it you know it works and if we play
this<00:01:21.479> see<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.709> instantaneous<00:01:23.369> at<00:01:23.729> points

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
this see it's instantaneous at points

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.639 
this see it's instantaneous at points
where<00:01:24.209> you<00:01:24.240> want<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.569> to<00:01:24.690> go<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.200> guess<00:01:25.350> job

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
where you want it to go and I guess job

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.730 
where you want it to go and I guess job
done<00:01:26.119> but<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:28.530> not<00:01:28.679> really

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
done but it's a really it's not really

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.529 
done but it's a really it's not really
amazing<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> mean<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.850> could<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.090> better<00:01:30.300> it's<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
amazing I mean it could be better it's a

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.499 
amazing I mean it could be better it's a
bit<00:01:30.690> hard<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.800> too<00:01:32.459> instantaneous<00:01:33.149> it's

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
bit hard it's too instantaneous it's

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.999 
bit hard it's too instantaneous it's
it's<00:01:33.810> not<00:01:33.959> smooth<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.860> know

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
it's not smooth you know

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.279 
it's not smooth you know
it's<00:01:35.220> unrealistic<00:01:35.610> based<00:01:36.599> in<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> real<00:01:37.020> world

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
it's unrealistic based in the real world

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.889 
it's unrealistic based in the real world
if<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:38.160> tart<00:01:38.369> had<00:01:38.550> to<00:01:38.700> move<00:01:38.880> from<00:01:39.450> one<00:01:39.660> side<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
if a tart had to move from one side to

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.960 
if a tart had to move from one side to
the<00:01:40.050> other<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.410> would<00:01:40.560> explode<00:01:41.039> lives<00:01:41.520> would

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the other it would explode lives would

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.180 
the other it would explode lives would
be<00:01:42.179> lost<00:01:42.360> damage<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.200> property<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.830> the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
be lost damage to property and the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.279 
be lost damage to property and the
surrounding<00:01:44.520> area<00:01:44.819> it<00:01:45.179> would<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.509> mad<00:01:45.690> you

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
surrounding area it would be mad you

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.650 
surrounding area it would be mad you
know<00:01:46.319> it'd<00:01:46.830> be<00:01:46.860> smoky<00:01:47.190> be<00:01:47.369> fire<00:01:47.640> there'd<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.179> so

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
know it'd be smoky be fire there'd be so

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.719 
know it'd be smoky be fire there'd be so
much<00:01:48.810> friction<00:01:49.050> it<00:01:49.860> might<00:01:50.340> even<00:01:50.459> cause<00:01:50.580> a

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
much friction it might even cause a

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.520 
much friction it might even cause a
black<00:01:51.060> hole<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.390> suck<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.869> whole<00:01:51.990> world<00:01:52.229> in

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
black hole and suck the whole world in

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.609 
black hole and suck the whole world in
it<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.069> know<00:01:53.190> so<00:01:53.819> instead<00:01:54.509> what<00:01:55.470> we're

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it as we know so instead what we're

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.380 
it as we know so instead what we're
going<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.039> is<00:01:56.250> we're<00:01:56.819> going<00:01:56.849> to<00:01:57.030> smooth

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
going to do is we're going to smooth

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.589 
going to do is we're going to smooth
this<00:01:57.420> out<00:01:57.690> when<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.729> viciously<00:01:59.729> change<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
this out when we viciously change the

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:01.999 
this out when we viciously change the
most<00:02:00.720> salient<00:02:01.050> side<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.349> going<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.560> slowly

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
most salient side it's going to slowly

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.880 
most salient side it's going to slowly
move<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.060> left<00:02:03.270> see<00:02:03.780> slowly<00:02:04.289> as<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:04.709> there

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
move to the left see slowly as if there

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.080 
move to the left see slowly as if there
were<00:02:04.950> some<00:02:05.160> cogs<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.550> gears<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.940> motors

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
were some cogs and gears and motors

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.449 
were some cogs and gears and motors
working<00:02:06.569> together<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.349> achieve<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.920> goal<00:02:08.250> of

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
working together to achieve the goal of

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.280 
working together to achieve the goal of
changing<00:02:09.390> its<00:02:09.800> angle<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.819> do<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.290> maniacs

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
changing its angle so to do this maniacs

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.050 
changing its angle so to do this maniacs
that<00:02:13.349> we're<00:02:13.560> going<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.709> go<00:02:13.830> back<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.700> step

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
that we're going to go back to that step

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.820 
that we're going to go back to that step
and<00:02:15.300> we're<00:02:15.780> going<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.959> replace<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.530> code

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
and we're going to replace this code

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.729 
and we're going to replace this code
with<00:02:17.520> some<00:02:17.700> other<00:02:17.849> things<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.500> point

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
with some other things so this point

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.140 
with some other things so this point
Direction<00:02:20.160> function<00:02:20.730> that's<00:02:20.849> gonna<00:02:20.970> give<00:02:21.120> us

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
Direction function that's gonna give us

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.130 
Direction function that's gonna give us
value<00:02:21.480> we're<00:02:21.569> going<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.750> change<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.080> to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
value we're going to change that to

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.280 
value we're going to change that to
point<00:02:23.069> derp<00:02:23.540> just<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.629> variable<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:24.989> came<00:02:25.140> up

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
point derp just a variable we came up

with some point direction just like that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.399 
with some point direction just like that
then<00:02:27.390> over<00:02:27.659> here<00:02:27.689> we're<00:02:27.900> gonna<00:02:27.989> say<00:02:28.170> image

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
then over here we're gonna say image

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.260 
then over here we're gonna say image

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
there's some sign this is we're going to

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.580 
there's some sign this is we're going to
open<00:02:36.090> up<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.330> bracket<00:02:36.720> here<00:02:37.230> we're<00:02:37.380> going<00:02:37.470> to

open up a bracket here we're going to

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.850 
open up a bracket here we're going to
say<00:02:38.150> degrees<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.420> radians<00:02:39.470> because<00:02:40.470> game

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
say degrees to radians because game

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.920 
say degrees to radians because game
maker<00:02:41.070> uses<00:02:41.310> radians<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.120> degrees<00:02:42.630> so

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
maker uses radians and not degrees so

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.930 
maker uses radians and not degrees so
we're<00:02:43.050> going<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.230> convert<00:02:43.530> some<00:02:43.860> stuff<00:02:44.130> so

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
we're going to convert some stuff so

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.040 
we're going to convert some stuff so
what<00:02:45.060> do<00:02:45.150> we<00:02:45.180> want<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.450> convert<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.750> radians

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
speed of which it rotates so we're going

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.150 
speed of which it rotates so we're going
to<00:03:10.650> copy<00:03:10.860> that

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
to copy that

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.890 
to copy that
go<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.610> create<00:03:12.420> right<00:03:12.900> here<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:14.670> know<00:03:14.820> do<00:03:15.750> that

go to create right here you know do that
our<00:03:16.830> speed<00:03:17.070> equals<00:03:17.250> five<00:03:18.050> so<00:03:19.050> I'm<00:03:19.290> going<00:03:19.410> to

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
our speed equals five so I'm going to

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.570 
our speed equals five so I'm going to
start<00:03:19.680> off<00:03:19.740> with<00:03:19.800> our<00:03:19.980> speed<00:03:20.220> equals<00:03:20.430> five

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
start off with our speed equals five

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.530 
start off with our speed equals five
we're<00:03:20.790> going<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.970> check<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.270> out<00:03:21.360> they're

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
we're going to check it out they're

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.640 
we're going to check it out they're
going<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.780> change<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.140> our<00:03:22.230> speed<00:03:22.440> equals

going to change it to our speed equals

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.710 
going to change it to our speed equals
one<00:03:22.980> something<00:03:23.460> lower<00:03:23.820> check<00:03:24.450> out<00:03:24.570> what

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
one something lower check out what

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.420 
one something lower check out what
happens<00:03:25.440> then<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.800> then<00:03:25.950> change<00:03:26.250> to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
happens then and then change to

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.380 
happens then and then change to
something<00:03:26.580> like<00:03:26.760> 20<00:03:27.080> so<00:03:28.100> click<00:03:29.100> OK<00:03:29.400> here<00:03:30.090> make

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
something like 20 so click OK here make

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.690 

here<00:03:37.180> we<00:03:37.300> are<00:03:37.450> notice<00:03:37.960> the<00:03:38.470> turret<00:03:38.800> slowly

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
here we are notice the turret slowly

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.670 
here we are notice the turret slowly
rotates<00:03:40.330> to<00:03:40.780> where<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:40.990> mouse<00:03:41.140> is<00:03:41.170> it's<00:03:41.530> not

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
rotates to where the mouse is it's not

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.230 
rotates to where the mouse is it's not
instantaneous<00:03:42.160> it's<00:03:42.580> very<00:03:42.820> smooth<00:03:43.090> it's

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
instantaneous it's very smooth it's

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.870 
instantaneous it's very smooth it's
pleasing<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.140> eye<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:45.130> player<00:03:45.400> this

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
pleasing to the eye of the player this

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.740 
pleasing to the eye of the player this
is<00:03:45.940> really<00:03:46.330> good<00:03:46.480> look<00:03:46.690> at<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:46.810> that's<00:03:47.380> nice

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
is really good look at that that's nice

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.780 
is really good look at that that's nice
so<00:03:49.750> five<00:03:50.110> is<00:03:51.270> moderately<00:03:52.270> quick<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:54.640> looks

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
so five is moderately quick that looks

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.350 
so five is moderately quick that looks
really<00:03:54.970> good

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
really good

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.320 
really good
let's<00:03:55.780> change<00:03:56.020> to<00:03:56.230> one<00:03:56.440> now<00:03:57.430> one<00:03:57.700> should<00:03:58.060> make

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
let's change to one now one should make

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.410 
let's change to one now one should make
it<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.630> lot<00:03:58.930> slower<00:03:59.230> five<00:04:00.010> times<00:04:00.400> slower<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:01.330> be

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
it a lot slower five times slower to be

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.220 
it a lot slower five times slower to be
exact

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.640 

look<00:04:08.230> at<00:04:08.290> that

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
look at that

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.830 
look at that
wow<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:10.780> really<00:04:11.170> slow<00:04:12.390> notice<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.480> value

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
wow that is really slow notice the value

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.830 
wow that is really slow notice the value
of<00:04:13.960> RSP<00:04:14.290> that<00:04:14.530> is<00:04:14.680> lower<00:04:15.480> decrease<00:04:16.480> the<00:04:16.630> speed

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
of RSP that is lower decrease the speed

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.470 
of RSP that is lower decrease the speed
our<00:04:17.080> highest<00:04:17.440> our<00:04:17.710> speed<00:04:18.100> increases<00:04:18.940> so<00:04:19.300> if<00:04:19.360> we

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
our highest our speed increases so if we

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.950 
our highest our speed increases so if we
had<00:04:19.570> to<00:04:19.660> make<00:04:19.780> this<00:04:19.900> thing<00:04:20.080> 20<00:04:20.520> like<00:04:21.520> such<00:04:21.960> okay

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
had to make this thing 20 like such okay

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.900 
had to make this thing 20 like such okay
it's<00:04:23.890> going<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.160> move<00:04:24.220> really<00:04:24.400> quickly

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
it's going to move really quickly

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.840 
it's going to move really quickly
but<00:04:25.870> over<00:04:26.080> here<00:04:26.110> when<00:04:26.860> it<00:04:27.010> comes<00:04:27.220> up<00:04:27.400> notice

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
but over here when it comes up notice

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.520 
but over here when it comes up notice
that<00:04:28.000> even<00:04:28.330> though<00:04:28.450> it's<00:04:28.600> fast<00:04:28.960> it's<00:04:29.380> not

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
that even though it's fast it's not

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.830 
that even though it's fast it's not
instantaneous<00:04:30.340> there<00:04:30.700> is<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.910> slight<00:04:31.330> delay<00:04:31.510> it

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
instantaneous there is a slight delay it

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.010 
instantaneous there is a slight delay it
is<00:04:32.320> rotating<00:04:32.920> towards<00:04:33.400> where<00:04:33.550> it<00:04:33.640> needs<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:33.880> be

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
is rotating towards where it needs to be

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.210 
is rotating towards where it needs to be
so<00:04:35.020> even<00:04:35.320> if<00:04:35.410> you're<00:04:35.560> going<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:35.800> make<00:04:35.920> a<00:04:35.950> game

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
so even if you're going to make a game

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.200 
so even if you're going to make a game
where<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.120> star<00:04:37.360> rotates<00:04:37.630> like<00:04:38.050> all<00:04:38.230> mad<00:04:38.920> and

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
where the star rotates like all mad and

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.330 
where the star rotates like all mad and
it's<00:04:40.210> nearly<00:04:40.900> instantaneous<00:04:41.560> use<00:04:41.920> this<00:04:42.100> code

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
it's nearly instantaneous use this code

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.620 
it's nearly instantaneous use this code
rather<00:04:42.550> because<00:04:43.090> see<00:04:43.720> that<00:04:43.930> see<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:44.890> moving

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
rather because see that see that moving

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.270 
rather because see that see that moving
even<00:04:46.630> though<00:04:46.780> it's<00:04:47.080> pretty<00:04:47.290> instantaneous<00:04:48.070> it

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
even though it's pretty instantaneous it

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.250 
even though it's pretty instantaneous it
still<00:04:48.700> gets<00:04:49.240> there<00:04:49.480> it<00:04:49.540> doesn't<00:04:49.750> flick<00:04:50.110> the

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
still gets there it doesn't flick the

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.240 
still gets there it doesn't flick the
sprite<00:04:50.470> doesn't<00:04:50.740> like<00:04:50.890> totally<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.930> know

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
sprite doesn't like totally you know

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.920 
sprite doesn't like totally you know
mirror<00:04:54.250> itself<00:04:54.610> to<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:54.880> other<00:04:55.030> side<00:04:55.300> of<00:04:55.330> jump

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
mirror itself to the other side of jump

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.670 
mirror itself to the other side of jump
there<00:04:56.140> it<00:04:56.740> gets<00:04:57.040> there<00:04:57.430> progressively<00:04:58.680> so

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
there it gets there progressively so

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.620 
there it gets there progressively so
that<00:04:59.830> pretty<00:05:00.010> much<00:05:00.100> wraps<00:05:00.250> up<00:05:00.700> smooth

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
that pretty much wraps up smooth

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.440 
that pretty much wraps up smooth
rotations<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:03.130> wanted<00:05:03.880> to<00:05:03.940> get<00:05:04.090> this<00:05:04.240> one<00:05:04.390> out

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
rotations I wanted to get this one out

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.700 
rotations I wanted to get this one out
of<00:05:04.600> the<00:05:04.690> way<00:05:04.780> because<00:05:04.930> in<00:05:05.290> my<00:05:05.380> next<00:05:05.560> tutorial

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
of the way because in my next tutorial

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.520 
of the way because in my next tutorial
I'll<00:05:06.190> be<00:05:06.220> creating<00:05:06.730> a<00:05:07.210> some<00:05:07.780> basic<00:05:08.140> tarde<00:05:08.500> eye

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
I'll be creating a some basic tarde eye

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.320 
I'll be creating a some basic tarde eye
with<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:08.950> player<00:05:09.160> moves<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.730> then<00:05:09.790> the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
with the player moves and then the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.360 
with the player moves and then the
turret<00:05:10.720> kind<00:05:10.960> of<00:05:11.050> enemy<00:05:11.740> turrets<00:05:12.010> rotate

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
turret kind of enemy turrets rotate

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.950 
turret kind of enemy turrets rotate
towards<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.700> player<00:05:12.880> depending<00:05:13.240> on<00:05:13.330> how<00:05:13.450> far

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
towards the player depending on how far

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.070 
towards the player depending on how far
away<00:05:14.200> he<00:05:14.320> is<00:05:14.560> or<00:05:14.920> something<00:05:15.100> so<00:05:15.930> this<00:05:16.930> will

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
away he is or something so this will

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.260 
away he is or something so this will
speed<00:05:17.230> up<00:05:17.380> that<00:05:17.530> whole<00:05:17.830> absorption<00:05:18.610> process

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
speed up that whole absorption process

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.420 
speed up that whole absorption process
so<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.020> hope<00:05:20.230> you<00:05:20.350> found<00:05:20.530> this<00:05:20.710> tutorial<00:05:20.890> a

time for that basic tart AI as requite
exciting<00:05:42.430> we<00:05:42.640> will<00:05:42.670> be<00:05:42.940> seeing<00:05:43.210> the<00:05:44.020> mob

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
exciting we will be seeing the mob

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.070 
exciting we will be seeing the mob
cannon<00:05:44.950> again<00:05:45.220> but<00:05:45.850> we<00:05:46.090> won't<00:05:46.270> have<00:05:46.419> active

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
cannon again but we won't have active

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.780 
cannon again but we won't have active
control<00:05:47.470> that<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.800> mob<00:05:47.950> cannon<00:05:48.280> will<00:05:48.430> be

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
control that the mob cannon will be

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.500 
control that the mob cannon will be
autonomous<00:05:49.210> sent<00:05:49.450> away<00:05:49.510> it'll<00:05:50.340> you<00:05:51.340> know<00:05:51.510> move

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
autonomous sent away it'll you know move

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.390 
autonomous sent away it'll you know move
around<00:05:52.720> depending<00:05:53.110> on<00:05:53.200> the<00:05:53.260> environment<00:05:53.590> so

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
around depending on the environment so

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.100 
around depending on the environment so
thanks<00:05:54.850> for<00:05:54.910> watching<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.390> I'll<00:05:55.900> catch<00:05:55.930> you
