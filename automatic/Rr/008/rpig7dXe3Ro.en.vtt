hey<00:00:00.539> guys<00:00:00.780> quadratic<00:00:01.410> here<00:00:01.620> from<00:00:01.800> quadcopter

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hey guys quadratic here from quadcopter

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.030 
hey guys quadratic here from quadcopter
taught<00:00:02.520> us<00:00:02.669> I<00:00:03.140> want<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.230> do<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> new<00:00:04.529> video<00:00:04.799> today

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
taught us I want to do a new video today

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.070 
taught us I want to do a new video today
for<00:00:05.339> you<00:00:05.660> for<00:00:06.660> my<00:00:06.750> much<00:00:06.990> ado<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:08.040> needed<00:00:09.080> g10

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
for you for my much ado and needed g10

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.529 
for you for my much ado and needed g10
arms<00:00:13.040> he's<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.070> quarter-inch<00:00:14.780> v10<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:17.539> they're

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
arms he's a quarter-inch v10 and they're

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.900 
arms he's a quarter-inch v10 and they're
virtually<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.740> same<00:00:20.600> size<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.050> file<00:00:22.910> they

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
virtually the same size and file they

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.769 
virtually the same size and file they
use<00:00:24.119> for<00:00:24.150> my<00:00:24.420> aluminum<00:00:25.369> okay<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:27.300> what<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.599> did

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
use for my aluminum okay but what I did

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.810 
use for my aluminum okay but what I did
was<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:27.990> changed<00:00:28.470> these<00:00:28.949> inner<00:00:29.160> cuts<00:00:29.460> out<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
was I changed these inner cuts out to

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.740 
was I changed these inner cuts out to
make<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.090> more<00:00:30.439> rigid<00:00:33.230> less<00:00:34.230> flexible<00:00:35.480> but<00:00:36.480> i

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
make it more rigid less flexible but i

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.470 
make it more rigid less flexible but i
milled<00:00:37.530> out<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.860> area<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.850> as<00:00:39.000> much<00:00:39.180> as<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.420> do

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
milled out this area not as much as I do

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.750 
milled out this area not as much as I do
the<00:00:39.719> aluminum<00:00:40.170> because<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.309> wanted<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.640> have

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the aluminum because I wanted to have

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.130 
the aluminum because I wanted to have
make<00:00:42.149> sure<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.420> strong<00:00:42.690> enough<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
make sure it's strong enough there to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.020 
make sure it's strong enough there to
hold<00:00:43.290> motors<00:00:43.680> but<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.340> can<00:00:44.489> still<00:00:44.700> put<00:00:44.910> any

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
hold motors but you can still put any

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630 
hold motors but you can still put any
motor<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.809> want<00:00:46.460> virtually<00:00:47.460> any

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
motor on here you want virtually any

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.869 
motor on here you want virtually any
motor<00:00:47.910> all<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> Tigers<00:00:48.930> 4006<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.039> empty

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
motor all the Tigers 4006 is empty

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.540 
motor all the Tigers 4006 is empty
motors<00:00:51.239> all<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.660> turnigy<00:00:51.960> stuff<00:00:52.489> because<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
motors all the turnigy stuff because I

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.689 
motors all the turnigy stuff because I
left<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> mounting<00:00:54.270> patterns<00:00:54.570> here

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
left all the mounting patterns here

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.220 
left all the mounting patterns here
still<00:00:56.699> got<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.850> hole<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.570> wiring<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
still got your hole for your wiring and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.340 
still got your hole for your wiring and
what<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.640> did<00:00:59.820> different<00:01:00.180> cuts<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.750> just

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
what I just did different cuts here just

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.990 
what I just did different cuts here just
to<00:01:01.410> give<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.590> some<00:01:02.039> strength<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.609> twisting

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
to give it some strength and twisting

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.170 
to give it some strength and twisting
and<00:01:03.180> bending<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.769> I'm<00:01:04.769> really<00:01:05.220> excited<00:01:05.430> about

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and bending so I'm really excited about

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.020 
and bending so I'm really excited about
these<00:01:06.390> arms<00:01:06.780> guys<00:01:07.280> they<00:01:08.280> turned<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:08.700> really

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
these arms guys they turned out really

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.039 
these arms guys they turned out really
nice<00:01:10.490> weight<00:01:11.490> wise<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.360> be<00:01:12.479> honest<00:01:12.780> with<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
nice weight wise to be honest with you

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.510 
nice weight wise to be honest with you
they're<00:01:13.380> probably<00:01:13.409> no<00:01:13.860> lighter<00:01:14.130> than<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
they're probably no lighter than the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.780 
they're probably no lighter than the
aluminum<00:01:15.380> just<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:16.650> what<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> did<00:01:17.159> was<00:01:17.369> if

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
aluminum just because what I did was if

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.149 
aluminum just because what I did was if
you<00:01:17.880> look<00:01:18.030> at<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.799> if<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> look<00:01:19.979> at<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
you look at here if you look at the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.140 
you look at here if you look at the
luminal<00:01:20.610> versus<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.060> g10<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:23.549> side<00:01:23.850> walls

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
luminal versus the g10 the side walls

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.600 
luminal versus the g10 the side walls
here<00:01:24.570> are<00:01:24.600> thicker<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> g10<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
here are thicker on the g10 then the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.850 
here are thicker on the g10 then the
aluminum<00:01:26.939> because<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.270> wanted<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:28.590> aluminum

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
aluminum because I wanted the aluminum

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.080 
aluminum because I wanted the aluminum
is<00:01:28.920> more<00:01:29.040> rigid<00:01:29.340> obviously<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:29.939> was<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
is more rigid obviously if there was the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.120 
is more rigid obviously if there was the
same<00:01:30.270> cuts<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.320> needed<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.829> add<00:01:31.979> this

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
same cuts but I needed to add this

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.499 
same cuts but I needed to add this
support<00:01:32.520> here<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.850> thickened<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.360> these

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
support here so I thickened up these

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.200 
support here so I thickened up these
walls<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.530> then<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> added<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.579> triangle

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
walls here and then I added the triangle

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.630 
walls here and then I added the triangle
cut<00:01:36.390> here<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.869> all<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.100> walls<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.579> are

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
cut here so all the walls here are

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.990 
cut here so all the walls here are
thicker<00:01:39.170> then<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> aluminum<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.759> I'm<00:01:41.850> not

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
thicker then on the aluminum and I'm not

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.899 
thicker then on the aluminum and I'm not
replacing<00:01:42.509> aluminum<00:01:42.930> with<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> g10<00:01:44.100> i'm<00:01:44.700> just

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
replacing aluminum with the g10 i'm just

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.980 
replacing aluminum with the g10 i'm just
going<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.060> offer<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.450> an<00:01:45.570> alternative

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
going to offer it as an alternative

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.149 
going to offer it as an alternative
because<00:01:46.170> i<00:01:46.290> think<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.680> aluminum<00:01:47.009> looks

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
because i think the aluminum looks

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.800 
because i think the aluminum looks
pretty<00:01:48.090> kick<00:01:48.329> ass<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.770> frames<00:01:50.810> and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
pretty kick ass on the on the frames and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.600 
pretty kick ass on the on the frames and
i<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.170> they're<00:01:52.500> super<00:01:52.829> strong<00:01:53.070> my<00:01:53.399> arms

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
i like that they're super strong my arms

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.740 
i like that they're super strong my arms
have<00:01:54.180> proved<00:01:54.509> been<00:01:55.040> old<00:01:56.040> time<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.579> time<00:01:56.700> again

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
have proved been old time and time again

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.370 
have proved been old time and time again
strong<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:58.110> crashes<00:01:59.780> but<00:02:00.780> i<00:02:00.840> will<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.049> offering

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
strong in crashes but i will be offering

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.569 
strong in crashes but i will be offering
the<00:02:01.500> g10<00:02:01.860> arms<00:02:03.380> very<00:02:04.380> soon<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.920> all<00:02:05.219> from<00:02:05.460> in

really<00:02:16.420> nice<00:02:16.570> no<00:02:16.900> work<00:02:17.110> there<00:02:20.850> same<00:02:21.850> same<00:02:22.300> hole

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
really nice no work there same same hole

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.500 
really nice no work there same same hole
pattern<00:02:22.930> for<00:02:23.110> all<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.320> iconic<00:02:24.100> frames<00:02:24.510> from

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
pattern for all the iconic frames from

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.950 
pattern for all the iconic frames from
this<00:02:25.720> year<00:02:25.990> they'll<00:02:26.410> all<00:02:26.650> fit<00:02:27.930> see<00:02:28.930> a

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
this year they'll all fit see a

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.940 
this year they'll all fit see a
different<00:02:29.350> layer<00:02:29.530> in<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:29.830> g10<00:02:30.190> there<00:02:31.950> so

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
different layer in that g10 there so

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.740 
different layer in that g10 there so
when<00:02:33.550> I<00:02:33.580> mailed<00:02:33.850> out<00:02:33.940> this<00:02:34.120> area<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.480> only

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
when I mailed out this area I only

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.000 
when I mailed out this area I only
milled<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.610> 2.125<00:02:36.610> an<00:02:37.030> eighth<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.240> an<00:02:37.390> inch

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
milled it 2.125 an eighth of an inch

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.840 
milled it 2.125 an eighth of an inch
versus<00:02:39.010> like<00:02:39.880> point<00:02:40.590> 175<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:42.700> can

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
versus like point 175 and you can

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.180 
versus like point 175 and you can
probably<00:02:43.060> see<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.980> thickness<00:02:47.130> compared<00:02:48.130> to

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
probably see the thickness compared to

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.660 
probably see the thickness compared to
the<00:02:48.610> two<00:02:48.820> there<00:02:49.090> let's<00:02:49.630> see<00:02:50.340> probably<00:02:51.340> see

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
the two there let's see probably see

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.810 
the two there let's see probably see
there<00:02:51.880> it's<00:02:52.600> it's<00:02:53.050> thicker<00:02:53.320> here<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.550> you'll

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
there it's it's thicker here so you'll

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.710 
there it's it's thicker here so you'll
be<00:02:54.910> able<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.120> fit<00:02:55.270> any<00:02:55.420> any<00:02:55.900> any<00:02:56.050> arm<00:02:57.450> will<00:02:58.450> be

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
be able to fit any any any arm will be

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.420 
be able to fit any any any arm will be
interchangeable<00:02:59.620> with<00:02:59.800> any<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.160> frames

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
interchangeable with any of the frames

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.220 
interchangeable with any of the frames
that<00:03:00.730> are<00:03:00.790> using<00:03:01.090> aluminum<00:03:01.450> so<00:03:02.250> but<00:03:04.230> pretty

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
that are using aluminum so but pretty

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.540 
that are using aluminum so but pretty
exciting<00:03:06.090> for<00:03:07.090> me<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.270> get<00:03:07.330> these<00:03:07.510> done<00:03:08.550> I've

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
exciting for me to get these done I've

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.680 
exciting for me to get these done I've
had<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.730> lot<00:03:09.820> of<00:03:09.880> people<00:03:10.060> ask<00:03:10.240> for<00:03:10.540> them<00:03:10.630> and

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
had a lot of people ask for them and

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.000 
had a lot of people ask for them and
I've<00:03:10.810> done<00:03:11.020> them<00:03:11.080> in<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.290> past<00:03:11.500> but<00:03:11.709> now<00:03:11.890> with

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
I've done them in the past but now with

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.560 
I've done them in the past but now with
this<00:03:12.130> design<00:03:12.580> for<00:03:12.850> testing<00:03:14.820> but<00:03:15.820> you<00:03:16.209> know<00:03:16.330> my

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
this design for testing but you know my

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.759 
this design for testing but you know my
cost<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.110> g10<00:03:17.440> cost<00:03:17.680> more<00:03:17.920> than<00:03:18.040> aluminum<00:03:18.550> so

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
cost the g10 cost more than aluminum so

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.870 
cost the g10 cost more than aluminum so
you<00:03:20.769> know<00:03:20.860> that's<00:03:21.010> that's<00:03:21.310> what<00:03:21.519> held<00:03:21.670> me<00:03:21.730> back

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
you know that's that's what held me back

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.420 
you know that's that's what held me back
most<00:03:22.209> of<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.390> time<00:03:22.769> but<00:03:23.769> I'm<00:03:23.920> excited<00:03:24.220> about

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
most of the time but I'm excited about

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.699 
most of the time but I'm excited about
these<00:03:24.670> arms<00:03:25.000> guys<00:03:25.470> it's<00:03:26.470> going<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.680> change

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
these arms guys it's going to change

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.890 
these arms guys it's going to change
everything<00:03:27.070> on<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.489> frames<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:28.720> going<00:03:28.870> to

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
everything on the frames it's going to

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.540 
everything on the frames it's going to
be<00:03:28.989> these<00:03:29.140> are<00:03:29.290> super<00:03:29.680> strong<00:03:29.769> I<00:03:30.220> believe

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
be these are super strong I believe

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.650 
be these are super strong I believe
these<00:03:30.700> are<00:03:30.730> going<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:30.970> be<00:03:31.060> these<00:03:31.300> are<00:03:31.360> going<00:03:31.600> to

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
hold up just as much but you know these

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.270 
hold up just as much but you know these
aren't<00:03:33.880> going<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.120> bend<00:03:34.300> you<00:03:34.540> know<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:36.070> we've

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.580 
and he's happy with it so far because of
the<00:03:40.660> design<00:03:40.810> of<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.080> frame<00:03:41.320> with<00:03:41.500> the

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
the design of the frame with the

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.979 
the design of the frame with the
vibration<00:03:42.400> dampers<00:03:42.760> it's<00:03:42.940> still<00:03:43.150> holding<00:03:43.780> up

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
vibration dampers it's still holding up

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.330 
vibration dampers it's still holding up
pretty<00:03:44.110> well<00:03:44.640> but<00:03:46.650> these<00:03:47.650> are<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:47.890> new<00:03:48.040> iconic

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340

pretty well but these are the new iconic
ex<00:03:48.610> arms<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.120> these<00:03:49.269> will<00:03:49.480> enter<00:03:49.690> trains<00:03:49.930> with

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
ex arms and these will enter trains with

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.150 
ex arms and these will enter trains with
