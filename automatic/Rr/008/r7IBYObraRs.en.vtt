00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.900
 hello very good to all kids and here 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.420
 again after a long time with 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.300
 another a boxing that lately does not come out 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.880
 nothing but today as you know will be the 'day 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.009
 without iva 'in media markt and I wanted to 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.290
 buy a tablet since laptops 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.599
 that he usually uses to go to college 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.000
 and such I am leaving more for 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.610
 game themes and that to take me the 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.469
 to sites and more than anything to play more 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.420
 that to work and I wanted a tablet 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.309
 that had windows 8 but windows 8 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.879
 normal not this one that now lead to 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.640
 new samsung tablets good and those of 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.530
 those of windows also one day a windows 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.969
 8 normal and that it had a processor 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.630
 this a little bit smaller so that 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.760
 let's say he 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.680
 and the standard that they usually use in 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.810
 common tablets did not want a box of 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.190
 these or nothing 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:08.180
 and nothing here I go audio teaching what is the 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.400
 samsung smart pc I just caught you 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.810
 relatively little a few hours ago in the 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.330
 mean bad happens is that there is a tail 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.460
 tremendous and it has cost me quite a lot to leave 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.340
 and I'm going to show you a boxing 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.300
 explain why I like this tablet 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.190
 and not others like iph like the ipad other 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.560
 samsung tablets and it 's good we're going to 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.650
 proceed to a boxing is worth we have already 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.740
 removed what would be the wrapper this 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.360
 the sticker that held it and here and the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.729
 we have what comes to be the tablets 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.440
 As you can see, it looks like a laptop but 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.000
 is in the thing that I like about 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.470
 tablet so they look like a laptop 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.770
 but not that later they are not portable 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.470
 let's see if I can open it 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.810
 perfect let's leave it here the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.210
 act the plastic that arrives will cover it 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.910
 and good to the naked eye as you can see 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.570
 It looks like a laptop but not if you give it 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.360
 here you can take out that with one hand 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.580
 to see if it leaves me good first I'm going to 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.740
 teach it a little how is today I am 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.899
 hooked this would be 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.720
 ignite or beige is a normal tablet 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.280
 and current is not a tablet is 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.230
 current is not very big or anything 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.270
 but it is very well it also takes its 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.680
 keyboard that there are many that you have to 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.470
 buy the keyboard apart but this is not 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.030
 is already wearing it and now I am in usb 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.180
 I think if you want to put a mouse 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.950
 it also carries this is like a laptop 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.360
 as if a laptop but then apart from 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.980
 the features of a tablet that the 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.840
 you can remove it in case you want it 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.730
 take to class and just do not want 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.709
 be with the keyboard and want to be 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.930
 simply with the touch button and 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.420
 also it takes already I say to you it takes windows 8 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.830
 which is what I wanted to use the windows 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.480
 that I usually carry the tablets I do not know 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.459
 right now what is it called but the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.860
 windows 8 normal this is what it would be 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.900
 where is subject 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.110
 and the people who will usually ask me 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.890
 for the technical specifications we 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.520
 take there 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.520
 to see if I read it well it takes windows 8 is 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.250
 of 32 gb 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.640
 memory of 2 gb of ram 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.280
 and we're going to see him read a little verb 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.470
 I'm not a little if the processor is 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.140
 an intel atom that is what I said or 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.560
 is not the most powerful because it is the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.720
 basic use of tablets is not 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.400
 the most powerful not like the ones from samsung 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.500
 that have come out new but I for what 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.360
 that I want to use it more than anything that 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.340
 do work and move around the 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.220
 university let's say I have enough 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.050
 it's not for the price that it has 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.120
 pretty good and good and now I'm going to see 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.770
 if I can get this out of here or if I teach 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.860
 the system of this that can be put 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.260
 with the keyboard is worth the same 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.870
 I would finish unhooking here as you see 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.610
 we have the windows 8 system that was 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.790
 this has now incorporated the 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.100
 new xbox the menu this good is not 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.290
 exactly windows 8 but the language of 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.390
 menu design here has the system 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.520
 it has the games I suppose that 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.010
 you can download applications and that 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.200
 the area that is pretty cool and then 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.580
 Here is what I'm going to do the most 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.370
 to use more than to play this 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.709
 I just do not know if you could connect 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.200
 with xbox or something like that I have to read 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.730
 the instructions 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.280
 but here for example we arrived 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.739
 desk and here has what to me 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.600
 like or is a windows 8 normal for 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.700
 can install it here the programs that 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.919
 I also want this tactile me 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.080
 I used to be a lot, I already know that it's a 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.690
 no bullshit but it's cool to be able to do 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.880
 here all the tactile wineries here what 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.190
 of the connections to is a normal windows 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.200
 the normal windows with the windows menu 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.260
 8 and such and the truth that this one is very 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.120
 pretty the tablet as you see here the 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.880
 You can compare a little with my hand 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.800
 it is quite light in the samsung 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.800
 and well nothing here would go out 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.580
 we would pay it 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.220
 ok here it's supposed to have the usb 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:03.249
 that would take the usb port here to 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.189
 put the micro sd 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:08.229
 the vine did not carry or is it leads to the hole 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:10.869
 but as I read in the instructions 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.129
 no me here have it from windows 8 the intel 

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:14.169
 atom what I said before the 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.719
 processor and then I'm active as 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.439
 paquito he would see what happens is that 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:23.409
 here shit me 10 now say good and 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:25.749
 is and here would be what would be the 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.719
 this to carry it is very little heavy is 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:30.429
 very fine and the truth is that it is quite 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.839
 practical for that for what I want it 

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:35.379
 for the let's say to go to college 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:37.419
 for jobs and a little more and to do 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:40.749
 average job for work does not have to 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:43.119
 outside there is a multi employee of that good 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:44.769
 and here we are going to see the rest that has 

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:47.829
 Well this is not anything really is 

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:50.709
 simply this was not dictated support but 

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:53.079
 good the current charger though 

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:55.119
 what was most striking was that we have already 

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:56.649
 seen the charger current and little 

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:59.650
 more and then here we have the 

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:02.620
 instructions that I do not know if carry this 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.720
 to some installation CD that does not 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.930
 I do not think it did not crack times of the pact because 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.550
 not going to argue but we will be you 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.009
 guides and sights here carry the 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.979
 components in case someone wants it 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:19.509
 buy carries that is what it comes to be 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:21.080
 the screen the charger takes 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.259
 current 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:28.060
 and good here we have good options 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.060
 here it puts optional 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.920
 the keyboard but according to him according to the tablet 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.020
 it also has to come to you, come to me, the 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.940
 keyboard I came with the tablet though 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.950
 here it puts optional I do not know why it says 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.900
 sold separately because I do not know the 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.340
 truth would be the best some offer and the 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.330
 pencil that I have it that catches 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.370
 gases that I have to ask for 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:50.160
 internet that one pointed the truth 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:53.570
 if you look at it here you have the keyboard what is 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.570
 to connect the keyboard 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.070
 and well nothing this would be the information 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.840
 they told me that I have a week to 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.520
 try it I 'll take it to the university 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.490
 Now that I'm still from 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.440
 exams in my utopia of that term of 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.530
 a damn time exams me the 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.050
 I'll take the trastear for the library 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.690
 this week and for the moment I think that 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.610
 It makes me happy whether it's the opinion 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.200
 tablet I will continue let's say testing the 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.120
 but I am happy what is the 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.590
 design and all that the benefits that 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.530
 has also been testing there 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.810
 they had it exposed, look what was left 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.730
 the truth is very cool and already one already 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.890
 you know guys if you have not gone halfway 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:34.650
 sea still had this afternoon to 

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.840
 buy a lot of products and more 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.000
 cheap be without some cheap 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.200

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.260
 unboxing if I had

 I say I caught this one that is 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.600
 pretty good 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.970
