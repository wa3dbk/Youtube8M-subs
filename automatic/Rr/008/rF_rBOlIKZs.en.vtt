microphone dynamic microphones are used
for<00:00:32.029> singing<00:00:32.480> in<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:32.630> most<00:00:32.809> cases<00:00:33.050> because

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
for singing in the most cases because

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.560 
for singing in the most cases because

the<00:00:43.760> actual<00:00:44.300> internet<00:00:44.690> for<00:00:44.809> the<00:00:44.900> microphone

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
the actual internet for the microphone

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.319 
the actual internet for the microphone
is<00:00:45.440> here<00:00:45.470> in<00:00:45.740> a<00:00:45.800> small<00:00:46.010> capsule<00:00:46.310> in<00:00:47.000> this

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
is here in a small capsule in this

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.880 
is here in a small capsule in this
capsule<00:00:47.780> there<00:00:47.930> are<00:00:47.990> actually<00:00:48.350> only<00:00:48.530> three

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
capsule there are actually only three

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.610 
capsule there are actually only three
things<00:00:49.420> first<00:00:50.420> of<00:00:50.540> all<00:00:50.660> this<00:00:50.900> is<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.230> wafer

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
things first of all this is the wafer

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.860 
things first of all this is the wafer
thin<00:00:51.800> membrane<00:00:52.310> which<00:00:52.790> is<00:00:52.940> clamped<00:00:53.270> in<00:00:53.510> here

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
thin membrane which is clamped in here

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.690 
thin membrane which is clamped in here
it's<00:00:54.079> elastic<00:00:54.380> and<00:00:54.710> when<00:00:55.130> sound<00:00:55.460> waves

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
it's elastic and when sound waves

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.550 
it's elastic and when sound waves
reached<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.329> membrane<00:00:56.660> it<00:00:56.870> goes<00:00:57.110> with<00:00:57.380> them

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
reached the membrane it goes with them

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.650 
reached the membrane it goes with them
so<00:00:58.130> when<00:00:58.250> I<00:00:58.280> talk<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.760> microphone<00:00:58.850> now<00:00:59.600> the

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
so when I talk to the microphone now the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.290 
so when I talk to the microphone now the
Merman<00:01:00.170> changes<00:01:00.680> its<00:01:00.890> position<00:01:01.130> when<00:01:02.030> we<00:01:02.149> talk

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
Merman changes its position when we talk

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.940 
Merman changes its position when we talk
louder<00:01:02.600> it<00:01:02.810> moves<00:01:03.020> more<00:01:03.290> than<00:01:03.350> when<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:03.710> talk

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
louder it moves more than when I talk

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.249 
louder it moves more than when I talk
quieter<00:01:04.579> but<00:01:05.390> we<00:01:05.600> need<00:01:05.780> another<00:01:06.079> thing

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
quieter but we need another thing

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:07.810 
quieter but we need another thing
because<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.799> moving<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.220> membrane<00:01:07.610> has

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
because the moving of the membrane has

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.120 
because the moving of the membrane has
to<00:01:08.030> be<00:01:08.149> catched<00:01:08.420> for<00:01:09.079> this<00:01:09.229> there<00:01:09.619> is<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.740> coil

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
to be catched for this there is a coil

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.100 
to be catched for this there is a coil
which<00:01:10.399> is<00:01:10.430> fixed<00:01:10.880> on<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.060> membrane<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:11.960> when

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
which is fixed on the membrane so when

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.990 
which is fixed on the membrane so when
the<00:01:12.229> membrane<00:01:12.560> moves<00:01:12.829> the<00:01:13.219> coil<00:01:13.460> moves<00:01:13.670> too

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
the membrane moves the coil moves too

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.630 
the membrane moves the coil moves too
but<00:01:14.329> all<00:01:14.750> good<00:01:15.140> things<00:01:15.320> come<00:01:15.530> through<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.460> one

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
but all good things come through so one

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.130 
but all good things come through so one
thing<00:01:16.850> is<00:01:17.000> still<00:01:17.299> missing<00:01:17.420> name<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.990> in

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
thing is still missing name the in

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.500 
thing is still missing name the in
magnet<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:19.220> magnet<00:01:19.520> receives<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.120> voltage

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
magnet the magnet receives the voltage

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.350 
magnet the magnet receives the voltage
which<00:01:20.810> appears<00:01:21.200> from<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.530> coils<00:01:21.890> moving<00:01:22.360> so

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
which appears from the coils moving so

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.060 
which appears from the coils moving so
we<00:01:23.479> begin<00:01:23.659> again<00:01:23.840> I<00:01:24.200> talk<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:24.979> microphone

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
we begin again I talk to the microphone

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.310 
we begin again I talk to the microphone
the<00:01:25.729> membrane<00:01:26.210> moves<00:01:26.390> with<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:26.780> membrane<00:01:27.049> also

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
the membrane moves with a membrane also

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.289 
the membrane moves with a membrane also
the<00:01:27.560> coil<00:01:27.740> moves<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.549> voltage<00:01:28.909> that<00:01:29.180> is

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
the coil moves and the voltage that is

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.390 
the coil moves and the voltage that is
affected<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.020> magnetic<00:01:30.500> changes<00:01:30.950> the

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
affected to the magnetic changes the

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.070 
affected to the magnetic changes the
louder<00:01:31.700> I<00:01:31.820> talked<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.299> greater<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.720> movement

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
louder I talked the greater the movement

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.300 
louder I talked the greater the movement
of<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.290> membrane<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.830> coil<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:34.250> the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
of the membrane and the coil and the

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
ground an electrical voltage the quieter

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.350 
ground an electrical voltage the quieter
took<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.280> smaller<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.790> movement<00:01:38.119> of<00:01:38.240> the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
took the smaller the movement of the

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.120 
took the smaller the movement of the

those<00:01:58.939> recorded<00:01:59.479> membrane<00:01:59.900> vibration<00:02:00.409> so<00:02:00.740> you

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
those recorded membrane vibration so you

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.770 
those recorded membrane vibration so you
see<00:02:01.040> it's<00:02:01.580> not<00:02:01.850> that<00:02:02.000> difficult<00:02:02.180> understand

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
see it's not that difficult understand
