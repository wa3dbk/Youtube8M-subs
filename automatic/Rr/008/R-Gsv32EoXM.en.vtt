00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
that now at this part of the line I'd

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.399 
that now at this part of the line I'd
the<00:01:36.000> hole<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.270> tie<00:01:36.420> with<00:01:36.479> my<00:01:36.689> left<00:01:36.900> hand<00:01:37.020> just

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
like that that is important because if

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.840 
like that that is important because if
it<00:01:40.020> gets<00:01:40.200> loose<00:01:40.500> your<00:01:41.310> wraps<00:01:41.520> are<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.790> to

it gets loose your wraps are going to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.340 
it gets loose your wraps are going to
unravel<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.630> you're<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> start<00:01:43.259> from

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
unravel and you're have to start from

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.819 
unravel and you're have to start from
the<00:01:43.439> beginning<00:01:44.210> now<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> next<00:01:45.840> step<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.259> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
the beginning now the next step is to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.399 
the beginning now the next step is to
grab<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> other<00:01:47.189> end<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.579> your<00:01:47.670> line<00:01:48.290> at<00:01:49.290> your

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
grab the other end of your line at your

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.560 
grab the other end of your line at your
time<00:01:49.939> you're<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> put<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> eye

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
time you're going to put it in the eye

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.200 
time you're going to put it in the eye
the<00:01:51.750> hook<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.500> opposite<00:01:52.860> direction<00:01:53.210> and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the hook in the opposite direction and

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.940 
the hook in the opposite direction and
you<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.170> go<00:01:55.259> about<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.500> couple<00:01:55.799> inches

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
you can just go about a couple inches

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.410 
you can just go about a couple inches
here<00:01:56.430> you're<00:01:56.729> going<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.939> pull<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.180> through<00:01:57.210> a

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
here you're going to pull it through a

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.289 
here you're going to pull it through a
little<00:01:57.630> later<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.250> then<00:01:59.250> what<00:02:00.060> you're<00:02:00.180> going

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
little later and then what you're going

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.440 
little later and then what you're going
to<00:02:00.360> want<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.700> take<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.969> part<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.360> the

to want to do is take this part of the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.569 
to want to do is take this part of the
line<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.530> line<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.189> shank<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
line and line it with the shank of the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.979 
line and line it with the shank of the
hook<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.439> hold<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.560> with<00:02:07.649> your<00:02:07.710> left<00:02:08.009> hand<00:02:08.989> so

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
now I got everything aligned on the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.400 
now I got everything aligned on the
shank<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.569> hook

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
shank of the hook

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.230 
shank of the hook
and<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.800> loop<00:02:14.010> line<00:02:14.610> you're<00:02:14.850> still<00:02:15.030> holding

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
and the loop line you're still holding

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.860 
and the loop line you're still holding
with<00:02:15.540> your<00:02:15.690> left<00:02:15.870> hand<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.850> then<00:02:17.850> we're<00:02:18.660> going

with your left hand and then we're going

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.620 
with your left hand and then we're going
to<00:02:18.930> do<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.470> wrap<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.640> line<00:02:20.910> around

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
to do is wrap this line around

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.180 
to do is wrap this line around
everything<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.500> hope<00:02:22.740> you're<00:02:22.890> holding

everything that you hope you're holding

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.840 
everything that you hope you're holding
here<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.580> about<00:02:25.130> seven<00:02:26.130> more<00:02:26.280> times<00:02:26.460> with<00:02:26.700> the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
here and about seven more times with the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.520 
here and about seven more times with the
this<00:02:27.150> kind<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.540> line<00:02:27.980> we'll<00:02:28.980> go<00:02:31.280> one<00:02:32.450> two

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
this kind of a line we'll go one two

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.650 
this kind of a line we'll go one two
three<00:02:34.530> four<00:02:35.340> five<00:02:36.200> six<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.530> seven<00:02:38.420> now<00:02:39.420> hold

three four five six and seven now hold

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.930 
three four five six and seven now hold
it<00:02:39.750> tight<00:02:39.900> again<00:02:40.140> with<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.380> left<00:02:40.620> hand<00:02:40.940> then

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
it tight again with that left hand then

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.060 
it tight again with that left hand then
we're<00:02:42.060> going<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.360> do<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.810> pull<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.650> tag<00:02:43.860> in

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
we're going to do is pull the tag in

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.800 
we're going to do is pull the tag in
through<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.790> eye<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:47.630> kind<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.690> go<00:02:48.750> slow

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
through the eye and kind of go slow

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.600 
through the eye and kind of go slow
sometimes<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.620> will<00:02:49.740> get<00:02:49.860> tension<00:02:50.250> build<00:02:50.460> up

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
sometimes it will get tension build up

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.730 
sometimes it will get tension build up
over<00:02:50.880> here<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.140> don't<00:02:52.230> want<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.560> knot

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
over here and you don't want it to knot

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.460 
over here and you don't want it to knot
up<00:02:53.330> you're<00:02:54.330> going<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.540> get<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.870> point<00:02:55.110> where

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
up you're going to get to a point where

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.950 
up you're going to get to a point where
everything<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.430> really<00:02:56.610> close<00:02:57.000> what<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.780> like

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
everything is really close what I like

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.320 
everything is really close what I like
to<00:02:58.080> do<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.710> grab<00:02:59.280> all<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.820> loops<00:03:00.060> with<00:03:00.210> your

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
to do is grab all the loops with your

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.490 
to do is grab all the loops with your
right<00:03:00.540> hand<00:03:01.130> you<00:03:02.130> can<00:03:02.280> let<00:03:02.460> go<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.850> other<00:03:03.000> side

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
right hand you can let go the other side

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.600 
right hand you can let go the other side
and<00:03:04.500> then<00:03:04.620> go<00:03:04.740> ahead<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:04.890> keep<00:03:05.130> pulling<00:03:05.370> that

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
and then go ahead and keep pulling that

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.350 
and then go ahead and keep pulling that
tag<00:03:05.880> in<00:03:06.120> until<00:03:06.510> everything<00:03:06.960> tightens<00:03:07.380> up<00:03:07.620> and

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
tag in until everything tightens up and

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.550 
tag in until everything tightens up and
I'll<00:03:09.360> kind<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.570> go<00:03:09.690> through<00:03:09.720> your<00:03:10.170> fingers

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
I'll kind of go through your fingers

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.800 
I'll kind of go through your fingers
here<00:03:10.800> once<00:03:11.730> you're<00:03:11.880> tight<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.270> can<00:03:12.420> let<00:03:12.570> go

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
here once you're tight you can let go

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.650 
here once you're tight you can let go
and<00:03:13.770> you'll<00:03:13.920> see<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.190> completed<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:15.000> loop<00:03:15.390> knot

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
and you'll see a completed a loop knot

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.990 
and you'll see a completed a loop knot
and<00:03:16.530> what<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.040> like<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.280> do<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.490> tighten<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:17.940> a

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
and what I like to do is tighten it a

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.330 
and what I like to do is tighten it a
little<00:03:18.030> bit<00:03:18.330> up<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:19.500> nice<00:03:19.740> and<00:03:19.770> cinched

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
little bit up it nice and cinched

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.470 
little bit up it nice and cinched
together<00:03:21.410> just<00:03:22.410> like<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:24.030> tagging

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
together just like so this tagging

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.540 
together just like so this tagging
you're<00:03:24.600> going<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.780> go<00:03:24.900> ahead<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.140> cut<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:26.190> it

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
you're going to go ahead and cut and it

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.430 
you're going to go ahead and cut and it
doesn't<00:03:26.850> look<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:26.970> great

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
doesn't look that great

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.960 
doesn't look that great
and<00:03:28.440> then<00:03:28.560> what<00:03:28.709> you're<00:03:28.890> left<00:03:29.040> with<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.940> a

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
and then what you're left with is the a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.600 
and then what you're left with is the a
loop<00:03:30.240> knot<00:03:30.420> so<00:03:31.170> basically<00:03:31.530> here<00:03:31.980> this<00:03:32.400> line

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
loop knot so basically here this line

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.550 
loop knot so basically here this line
that<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:32.850> just<00:03:32.970> pulled<00:03:33.180> through<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.570> your

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
that you just pulled through is your

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.980 
that you just pulled through is your
loop<00:03:34.850> then<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:35.910> can<00:03:36.060> add<00:03:36.300> whatever<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.959> like

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
loop then you can add whatever you like

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.949 
loop then you can add whatever you like
is<00:03:37.890> tighten<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.459> down<00:03:38.510> you're<00:03:39.510> ready<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.780> fish

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
is tighten it down you're ready to fish

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.250
