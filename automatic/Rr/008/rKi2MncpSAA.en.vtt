00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
but what one of my viewers told me is

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.560 
but what one of my viewers told me is
that<00:04:39.560> it's<00:04:40.070> stays<00:04:40.340> in<00:04:40.550> your<00:04:40.700> skin<00:04:41.060> for<00:04:41.090> three

days<00:04:41.750> anyway<00:04:42.169> 72<00:04:42.710> hours<00:04:43.039> so<00:04:44.260> pretty<00:04:45.260> much<00:04:45.350> I

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
days anyway 72 hours so pretty much I

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.879 
days anyway 72 hours so pretty much I
figure<00:04:45.890> once<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:46.220> got<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.520> on<00:04:46.640> the

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
figure once you got it on the

couple<00:04:47.159> of<00:04:47.249> times<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:48.090> doesn't<00:04:48.270> matter<00:04:48.539> what

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:48.749 
couple of times it doesn't matter what

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:51.110 
couple of times it doesn't matter what
time<00:04:48.990> you<00:04:49.800> put<00:04:50.039> it<00:04:50.159> on<00:04:50.249> because<00:04:50.699> it's<00:04:50.849> staying

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
time you put it on because it's staying

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.119 
time you put it on because it's staying
in<00:04:51.240> your<00:04:51.360> skin<00:04:51.659> but<00:04:52.199> what<00:04:52.319> you<00:04:52.409> do<00:04:52.620> need<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:52.979> do
