three<00:04:30.400> there<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:33.660> went<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.870> band-pass<00:04:36.120> not<00:04:37.120> sure

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
three there I went a band-pass not sure

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.680 
three there I went a band-pass not sure
why<00:04:37.479> I<00:04:37.720> think<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.139> just<00:04:38.169> like<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:38.650> punchy<00:04:39.690> sound

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
why I think I just like the punchy sound

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.020 
why I think I just like the punchy sound
yet<00:04:41.050> like<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.740> depth<00:04:43.350> of<00:04:44.669> frequency<00:04:45.669> low

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
yet like the depth of frequency low

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.210 
yet like the depth of frequency low
frequencies<00:04:46.690> that<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:47.259> can<00:04:47.500> get<00:04:47.680> with<00:04:47.949> a

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
frequencies that you can get with a

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.840 
frequencies that you can get with a
ported<00:04:48.669> box<00:04:48.699> as<00:04:49.090> well<00:04:49.800> so<00:04:50.800> we're<00:04:51.100> for<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.639> bad

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
ported box as well so we're for the bad

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.210 
ported box as well so we're for the bad
pass<00:04:52.120> enclosure<00:04:54.720> at<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:55.840> moment<00:04:56.199> on<00:04:56.350> I've

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
pass enclosure at the moment on I've

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.640 
pass enclosure at the moment on I've
been<00:04:57.460> playing<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:58.600> audio<00:04:58.690> system<00:04:59.260> for<00:04:59.440> about

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
been playing the audio system for about

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.529 
been playing the audio system for about
two<00:04:59.889> weeks<00:04:59.919> now<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:01.440> I<00:05:02.789> felt<00:05:03.789> the<00:05:03.940> spider<00:05:04.270> a

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
two weeks now and I felt the spider a

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.110 
two weeks now and I felt the spider a
couple<00:05:04.840> of<00:05:04.930> days<00:05:05.080> ago<00:05:05.139> for<00:05:06.039> the<00:05:06.070> drivers<00:05:06.940> which

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
couple of days ago for the drivers which

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.890 
couple of days ago for the drivers which
are<00:05:07.300> over<00:05:07.479> here<00:05:09.330> still<00:05:10.330> fairly<00:05:10.630> stiff<00:05:11.080> so<00:05:11.680> I

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
are over here still fairly stiff so I

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.960 
are over here still fairly stiff so I
thought<00:05:13.900> I<00:05:13.930> just<00:05:14.590> pull<00:05:14.830> them<00:05:14.889> out<00:05:15.039> for<00:05:15.910> a

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
thought I just pull them out for a

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.240 
thought I just pull them out for a
couple<00:05:16.150> of<00:05:16.240> hours<00:05:16.419> and<00:05:16.810> run<00:05:17.530> our<00:05:17.680> 20<00:05:18.070> Hertz

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
couple of hours and run our 20 Hertz

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.600 
couple of hours and run our 20 Hertz
test<00:05:18.669> tone<00:05:19.289> just<00:05:20.289> to<00:05:20.470> break<00:05:20.680> him<00:05:20.860> in<00:05:21.150> bit<00:05:22.150> more

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
test tone just to break him in bit more

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:33.120 
test tone just to break him in bit more
so<00:05:24.660> they're<00:05:25.660> still<00:05:25.990> bit<00:05:26.830> stiff<00:05:31.110> and<00:05:32.110> then<00:05:32.169> you

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
so they're still bit stiff and then you

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.399 
so they're still bit stiff and then you
just<00:05:33.460> pull<00:05:34.030> them<00:05:34.150> out<00:05:34.300> about<00:05:34.870> half<00:05:35.169> an<00:05:35.289> hour

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
just pull them out about half an hour

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:39.510 
just pull them out about half an hour
ago<00:05:35.470> just<00:05:36.310> wide<00:05:36.520> them<00:05:36.669> up<00:05:36.820> and<00:05:38.099> I'll<00:05:39.099> see<00:05:39.370> here

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
ago just wide them up and I'll see here

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.460 
ago just wide them up and I'll see here
we<00:05:39.610> go<00:05:39.789> run<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:41.050> tone<00:05:42.010> through<00:05:43.260> just<00:05:44.260> gotta

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
we go run the tone through just gotta

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.260 
we go run the tone through just gotta
find<00:05:44.710> that<00:05:45.810> remote<00:05:46.810> I<00:05:47.370> don't<00:05:48.370> you<00:05:48.490> don't<00:05:48.849> know

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
find that remote I don't you don't know

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:58.010 
find that remote I don't you don't know
where<00:05:49.570> i'll<00:05:50.199> put<00:05:50.590> up

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:05.180 

so<00:05:58.819> look<00:06:02.030> just<00:06:03.030> put<00:06:03.330> this<00:06:04.199> test<00:06:04.650> time<00:06:04.919> on

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
so look just put this test time on

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.999 
so look just put this test time on
repeat<00:06:08.090> split<00:06:09.090> the<00:06:09.240> volume<00:06:09.539> up<00:06:09.690> a<00:06:09.870> little<00:06:10.169> from

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009 
repeat split the volume up a little from

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:16.650 
repeat split the volume up a little from
bit<00:06:11.250> too<00:06:11.460> much

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:26.650 

ok

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.610 

I'll<00:06:27.170> be<00:06:27.260> running<00:06:27.410> these

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
I'll be running these

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.820 
I'll be running these
is<00:06:29.770> the<00:06:30.070> next<00:06:30.340> hour<00:06:30.460> time
