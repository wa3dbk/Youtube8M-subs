00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.310
 no no 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:18.820
 those things are the ones that are not these 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:23.699
 dogs wants to keep me from being in the 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 street because he wants people to sound 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:32.830
 that these wars that afternoon 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:37.540
 those are the things that I do not like anything 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:40.800
 of anything that they do because it will be that 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.800
 they criticize me 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:49.620
 no no no 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.500
 I wanted to bring first thank you 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.780
 we are here with the toluca latch 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.880
 It's an amazing competition super event 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.210
 both correct dog so much super price 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.060
 I was amazed how you do it for 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.460
 standing out 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.070
 more than the others I think it has 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.600
 much to see the work the coexistence 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.490
 with the copies 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.310
 they have to be happy dogs in the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.790
 track they have to be dogs that go out to 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.100
 do what 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.250
 and that is reflected at the time of 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.540
 to work 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.060
 driving carmel jars already when you take 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.360
 handling dogs I'm almost ten years old 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.670
 or ten years driving 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.610
 what kind of meat is handled in the 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.380
 past boxer period 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.340
 it's been ten years that I have 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.159
 I have creating box in it 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.929
 favorite and I've handled all the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.359
 we have released the fats with the 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.819
 moody's I have barely 2 years for 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:59.310
 people who are going to enter the ring and 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:02.090
 that maybe they will not win by X 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.390
 thing I get wants to give them 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.390
 well I think this is from sought as 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.340
 You may like the judge a copy 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.799
 You may like the same one that is behind in 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.540
 another trial and I think that the most 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.659
 professional and ethical you are 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.700
 always the decision of the without revealing 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.890
 that because 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.470
 It's a matter of taste and that's what 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.700
 are invited to cost 35 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.030
 it has been heard of people who throw 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.220
 the trophies pull more certificates what 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.330
 that they were given is touched but that 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.680
 It has a lot, it 's very sad because 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.050
 well this must be a sport is 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.600
 family can also have children 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.480
 inside then process the example to 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.640
 our children and future people 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.500
 or creators who are interested in him 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.360
 and with any you did not come today - the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.360
 exemplary this project 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.329
 We were with my caprice and my partner 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.250
 but wish and good we bet on 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.739
 beginning like all puppies we saw that 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.379
 if it was that this was not his second 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.959
 appearance in views and the result is 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.329
 so what he told me what he 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.459
 so much and I emphasize that 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.620
 the dogs to them must leave 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.379
 happy they should go out and play 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.450
 practically that is part of our 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.109
 not be scared with the tail between 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.280
 legs with bowed head throwing themselves 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:38.780
 to sit down they have to be motivated 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.780
 they should basically bring preparation 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.400
 the nerve sometimes betrays you sometimes 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.189
 the puppies are of low temperament 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.049
 that's where a selection also comes in 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:52.330
 and good copies have given we see 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:54.490
 within the short time that we have 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.569
 because we have selected well we want 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.510
 to go 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.329
 in that line some greeting for the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.159
 people then greet everyone the table 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.629
 world race sir marin that is the 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.329
 creator of the puppy and he gave us the 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:10.780
 trust bitches kenny that we also 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:13.060
 has supported a lot and this in this case to 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.129
 the organizers to Mr. Ruiz Nava who 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.229
 gives us all the facilities for this 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.630
 contest and the judges 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.389
 mario llamas if a mario flames that 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.740
 it's also out there from the band 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:30.470
 the fattest bis to all 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.470
 a heart hug 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.259
 in interview we become rivals in 

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:35.259
 its region 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.760
 hear 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.760
 toluca greetings 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:09.889
 and those things are what we like 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:14.990
 these dogs want to imitate 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:19.270
 and that is me in the street what he wants 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:23.840
 the people who usually of these wars that 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:28.900
 paint that those are the things that do not 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:34.029
 I like nothing at all of what they do 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.029
 because it will be that they criticize me 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.370
 do not 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.490
 why
