00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.240
 there will be no sweet talk today 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.400
 of love we idealize it so much 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.969
 magical feeling overestimate him that 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.700
 it only hurts our relationship 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:17.010
 so today and I want to throw a big 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.619
 shadow on love stories about not hysteria 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.390
 nasty things but before we start i wanted 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.210
 would remind the girls of my spectator 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.320
 blog post about that whole month like me 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.560
 already said in one of the previous 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.750
 releases I led a group of VKontakte stones and 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.880
 this month I am a joint cameo brand 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.460
 held a competition and now it's time 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.620
 announce the winner of this competition 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.170
 became them marina late 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.510
 and here is her competitive photo Marina thanks 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.430
 you for your beauty and your activity 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.570
 what is important now you are waiting for valuable 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.309
 camay prizes 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.710
 but we will continue the stated theme and so 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.809
 agree that only with experience people 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.410
 comes to understand that love 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.129
 high passions pure emotions cannot 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.730
 guarantee 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.850
 health and strength to our relationships and 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.710
 people who believe that all that they 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.260
 all you need is love 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.830
 often ignore the basic concept 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.570
 such as respecting humility and 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.630
 obligations to people about which we 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.799
 must take care and so are three bitter 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.049
 truth about love 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.210
 first love does not always match 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.490
 compatibility only the fact that you 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.470
 have fallen in love someone will not mean that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.630
 this is a good partner for you on 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.640
 long term can fall in love 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.220
 the person who will treat you 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.229
 not very good 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.900
 which will make you feel 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.210
 and think about yourself worse than you are on 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.340
 fact and which will not respect 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.220
 as much as you will 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.740
 Respect him can in principle fall in love 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.770
 printed which is just another 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.520
 worldview and different goals for life with 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.229
 you 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.790
 You can fall in love with a man who will 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.760
 you and 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.150
 you all the vital juices and including 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.830
 happiness yes it happens that it seems to be 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.430
 partner is near and there seems to be love 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.380
 like you are together and happiness is not 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.400
 most of your songs that i 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.740
 I receive in the personal message of VKontakte 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.170
 they are of course associated with problems in 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.960
 relationship your relationship and when i 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.330
 I read your problems about your problems I 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.490
 I understand that most of you 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.209
 there were only these problems 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.360
 because you approach the relationship as 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.780
 just like people who believe that all that 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.900
 need for relationships is only love 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.750
 who think that emotions and feelings are 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.020
 all you need to create and build 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.000
 healthy relationship but I have you all in this 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.550
 video I want to urge that when you 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 meet or when you are searching 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.450
 partner you should approach this not 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.450
 only with the heart but also immediately 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.130
 we of course when a person is looking for love he 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.860
 wants to find such a person who 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.570
 make the heart beat more and how is it 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.220
 it says in the stomach butterflies flit 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.959
 if you start a relationship with such 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.330
 the person with whom you are not 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.340
 you will most likely combine 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.350
 bad times will come 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.600
 love does not solve relationship problems 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.840
 often you write to me about love 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.049
 distance girls write me about love 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.420
 with a married man in general, you write to me 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.510
 about the attitude of which at the start 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.510
 very little chance but your love 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.840
 makes you think that you are capable 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.720
 overcome everything but really in these 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.540
 situations just love creates an illusion 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.620
 and spends your time your strength and often 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.540
 your 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.630
 and since we touched on this topic 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.700
 would like to take advantage of the moment 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.120
 those girls who wrote and asked 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.310
 I have questions about the relationship married 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.320
 by men 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.750
 immediately answer all that girls 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.520
 please run away from this relationship 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.680
 finish because firstly 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.260
 break the family especially such seeds 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.520
 who have children is simple but I think 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.290
 sin is just take on such karma 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.270
 that you will simply pay later 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.360
 all my life can not be at all 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.010
 invade the family and even just 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.170
 there is somewhere to flicker when 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.540
 the girl did not know then she suddenly finds out 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.760
 all at once the end of this relationship should 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.530
 come when the girl finds out and she 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.200
 stays in this relationship and she starts 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.120
 seem like she can overcome 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.370
 that and their interruption with this man she 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.820
 stronger is by no means something just 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.160
 family is sacred and and and blur in no 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.710
 in no case and secondly just 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.840
 even to all who 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.840
 this does not apply so quivering as I 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.870
 I as a psychologist can say that 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.090
 99 percent of men have never 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.630
 does not leave the family to his mistresses 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.740
 so girls finish these 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.930
 hopeless relationships don't waste 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.330
 your time your youth and your strength 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.000
 love is not always worth it 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.280
 sacrifice yourself yes of course one of 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.830
 the most important characteristics of love is that 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.610
 you think about another person and about him 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:18.670
 needs more than about yourself and that's fine 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.510
 love relationship when we donate 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.220
 their desires and needs and their 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.500
 time for another 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.530
 I would even say that it is adequate and 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.430
 healthy behavior is what she does 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.830
 respect 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.290
 really cool but when love 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.630
 comes to damage your own respect 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.370
 self-respect 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.620
 physical ambition and 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.340
 life goal just to 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.690
 being with someone love becomes 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.970
 problematic if you feel that 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.370
 losing yourself just to be 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.800
 with someone else talk such damn 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.440
 relationship don't let your love 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.440
 completely devour you and transform you 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.350
 0 all those who have a relationship come to 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.330
 total despair and you still 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.180
 keep asking me well as yet 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.030
 you can sacrifice yourself even more 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.070
 so that at least as something is getting better then I 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.740
 I can tell you that is no longer to 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.620
 and the more victims here are not 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.200
 definitely help love this experience and I 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:24.340
 convinced that most people have this experience 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.560
 happens to be positive healthy but also he 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.980
 happens and unhealthy and not very 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.710
 positive and of course we can do a lot of power 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:35.470
 we often hear such an attitude 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.940
 it is a lot of work they have to plow again 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.790
 plow but still 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.430
 never forget that we are not 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:45.670
 they have the right to lose their relationship 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:48.280
 personality and self respect because 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.740
 when we lose respect for ourselves we 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.580
 We not lose this very love our partner 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.750
 always feels these weaknesses and 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.030
 ceases to respect us 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.000
 and ceases to respect this relationship and 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:04.630
 according to the value of this relationship 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.110
 comes to nothing i mean that love is 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.310
 not everything you need to build strong 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.830
 and healthy relationships 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:14.110
 but then the question is what is needed 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.780
 for your relationship to be 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:19.180
 strong and healthy here on this question 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:22.210

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:38.710
 important topic she defines all our 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:42.120
 of life therefore write necessarily as you 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:45.000

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:48.280
 makes a relationship truly 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.090
 strong durable happy and 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.030
 healthy 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:54.490
