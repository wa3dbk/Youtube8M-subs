00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.559
 my morning routine we go with it 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.710
 that I look for me at two in the morning 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.850
 daily night walk rearing 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.820
 of course with my ice hockey jersey 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.980
 pajama do not know if I still left 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.960
 and i was born there at this time 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:32.029
 No orientation at 6 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.029
 then rings my well-known alarm clock 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.690
 Of course I try the alarm clock as 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.329
 turn off others here 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.690
 Well, like everyone else, you can do that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.280
 not say 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.989
 simply said I'm just too stupid 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.039
 to turn off the alarm clock 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.969
 but my method always helps 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.969
 shoot out of the window 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.330
 if then a car drove over the way 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.380
 is I always go make the heads 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.410
 a molli the only problem with the 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.740
 thing is that the initials the 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.740
 handles 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.289
 to my non-existent muesli find 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.460
 I always have tea but no idea why 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.460
 the still water 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.009
 I always go after breakfast 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.009
 brush teeth 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.579
 and what does an old adage mean? 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.079
 Exercise makes the champion 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.260
 after brushing I slip in 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.870
 my bathing things and go under the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.090
 shower but shower is for two went 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.220
 I do the daily morning 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.240
 ice blocks challenge 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.240
 with warm water 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:45.110
 then I feel my mouth what you 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:48.110
 but still are my hair 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.110
 dry 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:00.440
 After that I'll do my hair with mine 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:09.120
 Invention of the Snap Beck 2015 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:11.310

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.820

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.640
 I pack my school time but we live 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.640

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.970

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.080

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.010

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.409
 I go to school with pajamas 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.450

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.430
 have noticed this is not mine 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.549
 real morning routine for school 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.829
 everything was so simple and set up 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.220
 I've got something else 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.170
 I have a glass twice 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.409
 now have to learn about the head once 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.810
 for the shower in this video and that 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.879
 second time for instagram because there have 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.290

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.670
 lost and just have a glass 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.310
 water have to go over your head 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.150
 the name is known 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:23.190
 fast here until the next time 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.190
 and which is then easily and simply clean
