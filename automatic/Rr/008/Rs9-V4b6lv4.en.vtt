00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
difficulty on very hard right now and as

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.440 
difficulty on very hard right now and as
you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.559> see<00:00:40.590> I've<00:00:41.280> spawned<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.000> spider

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.200 
you can see I've spawned up a spider
with<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> swiftness<00:00:43.739> potion<00:00:44.370> which<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.940> just

with a swiftness potion which is just

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.080 
with a swiftness potion which is just
insane<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.410> how<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.829> heart<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.309> difficulty<00:00:47.910> is

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
insane so how the heart of difficulty is

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.510 
insane so how the heart of difficulty is
the<00:00:48.780> rare<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.350> mob<00:00:49.590> will<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:50.010> as<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.370> see

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the rare the mob will be as you can see

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.600 
the rare the mob will be as you can see
like<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.789> also<00:00:51.000> get<00:00:51.420> spider<00:00:51.809> jockeys<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.890> much

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.330 
like I also get spider jockeys like much
more<00:00:53.640> frequently<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.140> I'm<00:00:55.770> assuming<00:00:55.920> if

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
more frequently so I'm assuming if

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.770 
more frequently so I'm assuming if
you're<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.610> survival<00:00:56.789> or<00:00:57.300> things<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.660> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
you're in survival or things like that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.410 
you're in survival or things like that
now<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.590> doesn't<00:00:59.190> happen<00:00:59.579> with<00:01:00.059> charged

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
now that doesn't happen with charged

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.869 
now that doesn't happen with charged
creepers<00:01:00.930> unfortunately<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.550> don't<00:01:02.760> know

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879
