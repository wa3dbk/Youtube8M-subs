00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.710
 his half shark is about half 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.490

 I do not like 11 souls because you can 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.570
 stand when you wear a mask strictly 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.960
 15 20 minutes because for shorter 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.969
 term 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.409
 the mask just does not have time to act on 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.759
 hair it will be a blowout of vanitas money 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.950

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.990
 I exaggerate nevertheless drink kir asset and 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.570

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.280
 plus his hair is very shiny well i 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.050
