 thighs and shoulders in this case

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.130
 preference for things with a straight silhouette

 the most winning option would be 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.700

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.459
 sleeves of clothes and rigid dense fabrics 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.620
 will give any 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.760
 extra volume to wear a belt 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.160
 outfits with large print and 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.150
 horizontal stripes they only 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.620
 will add one problem areas 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.580
 female contrasts between top and bottom 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.580
 treat short especially narrow skirts 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.230
 clothing for the type of figure hourglass 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.230
 This type of shape is considered the most 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.960
 proportional to its owner 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.459
 has different shoulders and hips 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.410
 clearly marked waist and chest line 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.870
 choose clothes that best match 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.410

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.459
 smooth body bends fit almost 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.950
 any outfits 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.519
 the main thing is for their blood to repeat the lines 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.920
 figures 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.870
 but the thing will look best 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.450
 which will be inherent ease 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.340
 waviness 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.130
 to emphasize the waist is recommended 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.990
 use belts 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:40.490
 profitable calling the pencil skirt method and not 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:44.870
 recommend straight cut clothes too 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:49.190
 tight clothes tight and dense fabric 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.169
 as they make the figure fuller things with 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.160
 large figures and clear 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.160
 geometric motifs

 different narrow shoulders and hips 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.760
 poorly defined waist and flat 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.340
 buttocks should be selected models 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.820
 clothes that will help mark the line 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.640
 hips and emphasize the waist I'll go in 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:20.120
 semiadherent soft things 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.210
 focus on waist create necessary 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.800
 shape will help darts decorative seams 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.330
 folds pockets are located and on the hips 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.280
 vertical 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.990
 converging steels contrasting bottom and top 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.900
 it is recommended to wear belts and belts 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.790
 at the same time wide models distract 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.230
 attention and thin emphasize the waist 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.290
 best way to bring the whole mountain 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.960
 dresses or skirts creating volume in the area 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.840
 hips 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:57.660
 I do not recommend too tight 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:01.870
 clothes made of thin flowing fabrics 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.840
 clothing tailored to the scythe temporary 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:09.610
 cardigans and jackets 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:12.150

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.980

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:24.460
 expressive speech in size larger than 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:27.640
 buckets whether epochs expressed and the lower part 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.510
 seems much less outerwear 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.580
 for this figure 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.330
 should give volume to the bucket and 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:36.580
 visually reduce shoulders 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:40.020
 things will fit or kits for flashing 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.730
 riding and flared or puffy bottom 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.680
