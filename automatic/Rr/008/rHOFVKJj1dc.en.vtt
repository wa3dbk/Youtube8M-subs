days of space exploration food was
mostly<00:00:08.840> squeezed<00:00:09.650> at<00:00:09.830> at<00:00:09.950> tubes<00:00:10.190> and<00:00:10.700> brought

mostly squeezed at at tubes and brought

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.129 
mostly squeezed at at tubes and brought
up<00:00:11.630> to<00:00:11.660> dehydrating<00:00:12.349> packets<00:00:13.179> but<00:00:14.179> today<00:00:14.480> we

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
up to dehydrating packets but today we

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.410 
up to dehydrating packets but today we
can<00:00:15.379> have<00:00:15.679> quite<00:00:15.889> a<00:00:15.950> variety<00:00:16.100> of<00:00:16.400> food<00:00:16.670> there's

consume on earth that we have here in
space<00:00:20.359> who<00:00:20.779> just<00:00:20.960> needs<00:00:21.170> some<00:00:21.410> minor

adaptations<00:00:22.510> in<00:00:23.510> the<00:00:24.019> case<00:00:24.230> of<00:00:24.529> sandwiches<00:00:25.490> we

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
adaptations in the case of sandwiches we

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.300 
adaptations in the case of sandwiches we
had<00:00:26.390> to<00:00:26.510> substitute<00:00:26.990> for<00:00:27.019> bread<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.279> we

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
had to substitute for bread so we

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.689 
had to substitute for bread so we
decided<00:00:28.699> to<00:00:28.820> use<00:00:28.910> tortillas<00:00:29.539> but<00:00:30.199> why<00:00:30.699> mostly

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
decided to use tortillas but why mostly

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.160 
decided to use tortillas but why mostly
it's<00:00:31.820> because<00:00:31.939> bread<00:00:32.390> of<00:00:32.570> course<00:00:32.600> makes

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
it's because bread of course makes

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.200 
it's because bread of course makes
