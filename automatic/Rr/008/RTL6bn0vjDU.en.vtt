horizontal<00:00:12.630> mortising<00:00:13.620> machine<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.370> I

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
horizontal mortising machine and so I

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.580 
horizontal mortising machine and so I
figured<00:00:14.670> I'd<00:00:14.940> shoot<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.240> know

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
put the camera down to get clamped down

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.350 
put the camera down to get clamped down
so<00:00:57.500> I<00:00:57.530> needed<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:57.829> both<00:00:57.980> hands<00:00:58.280> but<00:00:58.579> got<00:00:59.270> it

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
clamped down now and you can see my

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.520 
clamped down now and you can see my
layout<00:01:01.670> there<00:01:01.850> on<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.059> side<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:02.540> what<00:01:03.410> I've

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
layout there on the side and what I've

layout there on the side and what I've
done<00:01:03.680> is<00:01:03.920> I've<00:01:04.040> got<00:01:04.160> it<00:01:04.309> pressed<00:01:04.550> all<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.759> way

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
done is I've got it pressed all the way

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.020 
done is I've got it pressed all the way
up<00:01:05.000> against<00:01:05.680> my<00:01:06.680> stop<00:01:07.009> block<00:01:07.039> over<00:01:07.700> here<00:01:07.729> on

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
up against my stop block over here on

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.389 
up against my stop block over here on
this<00:01:08.180> side<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.660> my<00:01:08.810> adjustable<00:01:09.229> stop<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:10.280> I'm

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
this side and my adjustable stop and I'm

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.210 
this side and my adjustable stop and I'm
going<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:10.610> slide<00:01:10.820> it<00:01:11.000> up<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.360> bit<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:12.220> see

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
going to slide it up to the bit and see

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.219 
going to slide it up to the bit and see
I<00:01:13.670> don't<00:01:14.390> know<00:01:14.509> if<00:01:14.539> you<00:01:14.690> can<00:01:14.810> see<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.140> the

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
I don't know if you can see it in the

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.440 
I don't know if you can see it in the
video<00:01:15.500> but<00:01:15.830> you're<00:01:16.220> gonna<00:01:16.340> line<00:01:16.700> up<00:01:16.729> your

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
video but you're gonna line up your

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.840 
video but you're gonna line up your
layout<00:01:17.810> line<00:01:18.020> with<00:01:18.979> a<00:01:19.009> far<00:01:19.250> edge<00:01:19.399> of<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.610> bit

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
layout line with a far edge of the bit

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.480 
layout line with a far edge of the bit
and<00:01:20.200> then<00:01:21.200> what<00:01:22.100> you're<00:01:22.250> going<00:01:22.369> to<00:01:22.399> do<00:01:22.610> is

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
and then what you're going to do is

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.510 
and then what you're going to do is
slide<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.520> over<00:01:26.259> until<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:28.310> other<00:01:30.520> other

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
slide it over until the other other

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.859 
slide it over until the other other
layout<00:01:31.970> line<00:01:32.209> lines<00:01:32.599> up<00:01:32.840> with<00:01:33.410> the<00:01:33.530> other<00:01:33.560> edge

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
layout line lines up with the other edge

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.880 
layout line lines up with the other edge
of<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.380> bit<00:01:37.660> there<00:01:38.660> I<00:01:38.690> think<00:01:38.899> I<00:01:38.929> got<00:01:39.110> it<00:01:39.319> and

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
of the bit there I think I got it and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.919 
of the bit there I think I got it and
I'm<00:01:39.979> just<00:01:40.039> going<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.340> take<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:41.360> stop<00:01:41.660> block

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
I'm just going to take this stop block

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:48.180 
I'm just going to take this stop block
here<00:01:42.369> I'm<00:01:43.369> gonna<00:01:43.580> press<00:01:43.789> it<00:01:43.940> up<00:01:44.030> against<00:01:44.509> my

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.550 

machine<00:01:49.190> there<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:50.030> lock<00:01:50.959> it<00:01:51.140> down

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
machine there and lock it down

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.990 
machine there and lock it down
okay<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:52.399> now<00:01:52.849> as<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.660> can<00:01:53.810> see<00:01:54.819> there's<00:01:55.819> one

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
okay so now as you can see there's one

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.389 
okay so now as you can see there's one
into<00:01:56.209> my<00:01:56.240> travel<00:01:56.810> that<00:01:57.590> lines<00:01:57.830> up<00:01:58.039> with<00:01:58.099> one

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
into my travel that lines up with one

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.339 
into my travel that lines up with one
side<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.759> bit<00:01:58.940> then<00:01:59.929> I'm<00:01:59.989> gonna<00:02:00.110> run<00:02:00.319> it

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
side of the bit then I'm gonna run it

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.910 
side of the bit then I'm gonna run it
all<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.679> way<00:02:00.770> down<00:02:01.450> until<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.810> hits<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.140> stop

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
all the way down until it hits the stop
