certain supernatural events that that

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.270 
certain supernatural events that that

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
that the Bible is false is how it talks

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.590 
that the Bible is false is how it talks
about<00:00:22.470> page<00:00:23.100> after<00:00:23.400> page<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:24.119> all<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.449> these

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
overt supernatural events and then you

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.570 
overt supernatural events and then you
put<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> Bible<00:00:28.080> down<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:29.039> look<00:00:29.429> around

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
has created a natural order rather than

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.290 
has created a natural order rather than
intervening<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.550> these<00:00:41.700> constant

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300

supernatural miracles personally I'm
rather<00:00:45.510> grateful<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.260> because<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
rather grateful for that because the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.920 
rather grateful for that because the
supernatural<00:00:48.059> universe<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.690> pretty

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
supernatural universe can be a pretty

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.069 
supernatural universe can be a pretty
scary<00:00:49.200> place<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:50.539> that's<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.750> totally

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
scary place but that's a totally

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.439 
scary place but that's a totally
separate<00:00:52.440> issue<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.520> point<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.210> was

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
separate issue the the point that I was

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.590 
separate issue the the point that I was
making<00:00:54.690> here<00:00:55.640> was<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> Bible<00:00:57.270> was<00:00:57.360> not

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
making here was that the Bible was not

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.599 
making here was that the Bible was not
just<00:00:58.050> asserting<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.800> existence<00:00:59.399> of

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
just asserting the existence of

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.209 
just asserting the existence of
supernatural<00:01:00.239> agents<00:01:01.079> such<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:01.770> God

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
supernatural agents such as God

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.299 
supernatural agents such as God
performing<00:01:02.820> miracles<00:01:03.000> or<00:01:03.739> angels<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:05.040> Devils

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
went one step further in this verses

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.320 
went one step further in this verses

independently of Jesus could still

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.819 
independently of Jesus could still
perform<00:01:29.369> magical<00:01:30.299> feats<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.840> casting<00:01:31.710> out

demons and healing the sick and so on

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.770 
demons and healing the sick and so on
there<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.189> feel<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.759> really<00:01:36.030> crossed<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.630> line

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
there I feel it's really crossed a line

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.289 
there I feel it's really crossed a line
because<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:38.040> saying<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.000> universe

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
because it's saying that the universe

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.270 
because it's saying that the universe
operates<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.869> ways<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.259> we<00:01:40.439> know<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:41.070> not

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
operates in ways that we know is not

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.480 
operates in ways that we know is not
true<00:01:41.549> human<00:01:42.329> beings<00:01:42.750> by<00:01:43.170> themselves<00:01:43.829> cannot

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
true human beings by themselves cannot

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.039 
true human beings by themselves cannot
perform<00:01:45.149> magic

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
perform magic

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.160 
perform magic
ergo<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.430> suppose<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.270> witnesses<00:01:49.020> to

ergo the suppose that I witnesses to
these<00:01:49.320> events<00:01:49.829> are<00:01:49.950> asserting<00:01:50.759> things<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
these events are asserting things that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.780 
these events are asserting things that
we<00:01:51.390> know<00:01:51.630> aren't<00:01:51.960> true<00:01:52.380> ergo<00:01:53.220> they're<00:01:53.610> either

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
we know aren't true ergo they're either

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.510 
we know aren't true ergo they're either
crazy<00:01:54.149> or<00:01:54.390> they're<00:01:54.840> liars<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.369> you're

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
crazy or they're liars now if you're

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.030 
crazy or they're liars now if you're
prepared<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.119> say<00:01:57.329> no<00:01:57.540> wait<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.079> believe<00:01:58.770> that

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
prepared to say no wait I believe that

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.120 
prepared to say no wait I believe that
human<00:01:59.340> beings<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.820> work<00:02:00.030> magic<00:02:00.299> well<00:02:01.229> then

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
human beings can work magic well then

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.370 
human beings can work magic well then
that's<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.549> completely<00:02:02.939> different<00:02:03.060> debate<00:02:03.689> but

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
that's a completely different debate but

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.350 
that's a completely different debate but
