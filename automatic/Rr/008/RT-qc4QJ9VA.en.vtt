00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 there was an expectation for the formation of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.759
 south atlantic convergence zone 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.460
 about the southeast 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.679
 beginning of this year 2015 in the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.740
 the first weeks of January in the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.560
 However, this forecast did not materialize. 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.369
 In addition, a strong atmospheric blockade 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.590
 associated with the anomalous 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.050
 subtropical highlands on the continent 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.210
 such wings that everyone is commenting on 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.510
 with this, besides the non- formation of 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.189
 we have had very irregular rain 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.840
 well below normality in the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.850
 first three weeks of January 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.100
 consequently the temperature rose 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.100
 especially in the states of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.010
 south- west and is also in the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.289
 parana beyond the interior of the bay 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.809
 then on the 20th and locking himself up was 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.149
 broken and cold fronts again 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.850
 cross the country at least 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.190
 to the southeast region and expectation 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.730
 during this month of February is that 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.030
 continue advancing from the south to the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.650
 Southeast center west is no possibility of 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.650
 formation of zaca on these regions 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.350
 looks at least in principle not 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.020
 we are following the whole evolution 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.390
 of the models in recent weeks he is 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.729
 indicating that the rain should continue in 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.320
 form of typical summer blows or 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.150
 occurs mainly in the afternoon and 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.580
 night is a rain that occurs so 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.119
 irregular is very intense but 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.189
 occurs only in small areas 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.740
 making it difficult, for example, to recompose 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.380
 large reservoirs such as a 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.070
 the other southeastern reservoirs that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.140
 are there at minimum record levels 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.600
 good in relation to temperature I think 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.899
 a great concern too if that 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.460
 January heat will return to forecast 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.939
 more heat than normal 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.820
 however, not as hot as the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.040
 which was registered between the 10th and 20th 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.130
 January with eg sao paulo 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.320
 temperatures between 35 and 36 degrees 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.659
 January with several consecutive days with 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.590
 maximum around 40 degrees this does not 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.110
 must come back 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.649
 during many consecutive days in 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.750
 February average should be a little less 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.520
 hot than the month of June 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.590
 This does not mean it will not do 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.290
 Heat like I just spoke then 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.240
 attention to energy consumption 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.850
 electric in the coming months because they do not 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.300
 sufficient rain to restore the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.300
 shells
