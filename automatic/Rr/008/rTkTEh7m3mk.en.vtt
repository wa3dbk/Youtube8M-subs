has really good print quality so overall
we<00:02:10.670> think<00:02:10.879> it's<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.090> great<00:02:11.209> value<00:02:15.580> now<00:02:16.580> let's

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
we think it's a great value now let's

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.990 
we think it's a great value now let's
take<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.060> look<00:02:17.239> at<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.540> xerox<00:02:17.930> phaser<00:02:18.580> 7760<00:02:19.580> DN

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
take a look at the xerox phaser 7760 DN

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.979 
take a look at the xerox phaser 7760 DN
so<00:02:23.000> here's<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.450> xerox<00:02:23.930> phaser<00:02:24.459> 7760<00:02:25.459> DN<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.810> d

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
so overall we really liked the Xerox

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.340 
so overall we really liked the Xerox
7760<00:03:43.990> DN<00:03:44.670> especially<00:03:45.670> for<00:03:46.060> print<00:03:46.300> quality<00:03:46.540> we

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
7760 DN especially for print quality we

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.200 
7760 DN especially for print quality we
think<00:03:47.590> this<00:03:47.680> has<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.040> best<00:03:48.220> print<00:03:48.580> quality<00:03:48.790> of

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
think this has the best print quality of

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.490 
think this has the best print quality of
any<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:49.630> color<00:03:49.840> laser<00:03:50.110> printers

any of the color laser printers
currently<00:03:50.920> available<00:03:51.190> this<00:03:52.000> is<00:03:52.150> an<00:03:52.270> ideal

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
currently available this is an ideal

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.740 
currently available this is an ideal

color<00:04:00.510> also<00:04:01.510> we<00:04:01.990> like<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.380> paper<00:04:02.590> handling

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
color also we like the paper handling

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.400
