00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
let's just start at the top so the first

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.830 
let's just start at the top so the first
verse<00:00:31.220> doesn't<00:00:32.220> have<00:00:32.730> any<00:00:33.060> chords<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.720> it

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
verse doesn't have any chords in it

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.250 
verse doesn't have any chords in it
officially<00:00:34.610> you<00:00:35.610> know<00:00:35.730> there's<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.260> vocals

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260

officially you know there's just vocals
and<00:00:37.940> some<00:00:38.940> percussion<00:00:40.610> but<00:00:42.110> there<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.230> called

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
and some percussion but there is called

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.110 
and some percussion but there is called
an<00:00:43.950> implied<00:00:44.910> harmony<00:00:46.490> which<00:00:47.490> is<00:00:47.670> kind<00:00:48.030> of

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
an implied harmony which is kind of

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.090 
an implied harmony which is kind of
happening<00:00:48.330> which<00:00:49.110> means<00:00:49.380> if<00:00:49.620> there<00:00:49.860> was<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
happening which means if there was a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.380 
happening which means if there was a
chord<00:00:50.540> this<00:00:51.540> is<00:00:51.750> what<00:00:51.900> it<00:00:51.990> would<00:00:52.050> be

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
chord this is what it would be

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.500 
chord this is what it would be
so<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.540> implied<00:00:54.870> harmony<00:00:55.560> of<00:00:55.740> this<00:00:56.300> part<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
so the implied harmony of this part the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.720 
so the implied harmony of this part the
first<00:00:57.780> verse<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.260> over<00:00:59.270> D<00:01:00.830> it's<00:01:01.830> just<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.130> deep
