00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello friends in this video I'm going to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.410
 teach how to install the super user in 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.820
 your galaxy s 4 and 9,500 with system 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.160
 operative lollipop 5.0.1 good first 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.980
 first we have to copy the file 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.410
 zip that is in the description of the video 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.750
 we download that file and copy it 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.289
 in the external memory of our galaxy 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.240
 s 4 and 9,500 good to copy this 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.789
 I will create a folder called 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.669
 root you can copy it in the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.739
 folder that you like the most once created 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.230
 the folder and copied the point file 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.140
 always superuser disconnect the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.660
 galaxy s 4 of the computer and we went to 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.719
 turn off the cell phone we have to turn it off 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.940
 to enter into recovery mode I want to 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.780
 clarify that this method of rooting the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.430
 galaxy s 4 and 9,500 is compatible only 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.539
 with the operating system android 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.940
 lollipop 5.0.1 I also want to clarify 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.609
 that for this method to work for you 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.659
 the perfection you have to have installed 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.240
 the referee first on 6.12 point 8 and if not 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.479
 you have installed in recovery fritz 26 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.790
 point 12.8 I recommend that you install it 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.040
 since it is super easy to install and 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.500
 I will also be of sunwing in the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.689
 description of this video showing the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.090
 right steps so that everyone can 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.500
 install it perfectly the recovery 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.680
 kingston 6.12 point 8 and so be able to surround 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.909
 the galaxy s 4 and 9,500 with the system 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.670
 android logic or 5.0.1 and good let's continue 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.110
 with this good video once the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.119
 galaxy s 4 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.549
 we keep pressing the volume up 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.299
 more with more power the three buttons to the 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.430
 same time 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.430
 so we will enter the recovery mode 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.149
 i 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.210
 once entered into the recovery mode of the 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.880
 filter 6.12 point 8 we go to the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.190
 second option that says install and what 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.320
 select with the power button once 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.780
 selected in the installation menu and 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.820
 we go to the second option which is the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.040
 sd card memory 1 which is the memory 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.830
 external where we copy the file 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.750
 together and now in this menu we look for the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.050
 folder that we created with the file 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.740
 points and in my case it's the root folder and 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.740
 we select it 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.580
 and there I will be the point file yes that 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.769
 we copy again we select it with 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.129
 the power button and we give the second 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.860
 option that says yes install goat point 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.080
 if the superuser file start 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.569
 be installed once it finishes 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.579
 get installed we give the button back and 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.420
 we select the first option that says 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.700
 rebot system nou or in Spanish reset 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.750
 the system now and we select it and the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.720
 cellular will restart 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.000
 as you can see the galaxy s 4 started to 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.520
 Restart once you finish 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.890
 restart we just have to update 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.470
 the superuser binaries and we're going 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.770
 to have the galaxy s 4 with system 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.040
 Android OS 5.0.1 ipods 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.110
 totally surrounded as you can see in 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.510
 this video I already have the logo of 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.520
 superuser the galaxy s 4 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.650
 I skip the process of updating 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.900
 the binaries since that is super easy 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.660
 they just have to enter the super 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.660
 user update it and give it to normal and 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.060
 we will be good users to check 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.220
 that I am already a user, and that all this 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.500
 rodeo process went smoothly 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.780
 in my s 4 and 9,500 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.540
 let's check with an application of 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.850
 pole play called roadster this 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.190
 application only serves to verify that 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.800
 if we are broken we are not users 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.020
 well we download the application we give 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.450
 to accept and here we select the 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.420
 first option that is to check if 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.450
 we are root or not 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.520
 as you can see the application gives me the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.010
 congratulations because I'm already a user 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.860
 root that means that everything went to 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.540
 This video perfectly good friends 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.540
 that would be all and until next time
