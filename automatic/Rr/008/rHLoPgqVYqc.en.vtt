00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.610
 and good states that a letter 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.549
 commented and I bring you gameplay in the 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.340
 new map of magma and good is a man 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.560
 with the m 81 and convinced the peephole of 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.070
 red dot that I do not wear red dot I wear 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.230
 blue dot and I also wear the camouflage 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.410
 this zombie that the truth is that 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.670
 it's pretty pretty good and good more 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.680
 that nothing to vary a bit as you are 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.230
 seeing we were right here when 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.670
 with stands and we were covering the 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.160
 same way must that is what you have to 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.169
 take especially at the beginning felt 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.179
 because a lot of people this in this 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.429
 map tries for the by the sides of the 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:39.039
 23 is selling for the by the flag and not 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:41.829
 it comes more than a couple of people and oysters 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.719
 take a flag the principle of fans 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.670
 not 150 points and you're killing besides 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:49.030
 someone just the flag tells you 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.949
 are 200 points for that low and let's say 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.319
 that is quite worth it here kills 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.019
 one that I do not even see him because 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:58.569
 is that these people do not see it there are people 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.249
 that carries the camouflages let's say that the 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.229
 clothing or clothing a report that 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:04.269
 you see that it is black then in the 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.799
 lava areas looks super good in the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.730
 zones of clarity looks great but 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.740
 however , 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.870
 in other areas you do not see chaos is that 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.990
 it's impossible I have to killed before not 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.000
 I know how to kill him because he did not even 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.760
 I saw and you will see that during the game 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.380
 start to see as a bit like the 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.060
 connection failures and others there is a 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.310
 safe moment especially the second 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.710
 half of the game or when I'm not 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.290
 just about to get my streak out 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.840
 they begin to hit connection jars that 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.920
 it's practically in playable and as 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.780
 you arrive paisa and for example you give me 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.880
 a lot of anger because when there's the 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.250
 moment of this that puts euthanasia already 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.410
 you know what it is that you get to a 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.270
 enemy and just commit suicide or do 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.390
 anything so strange then 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.980
 It is precisely at those moments that 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.720
 can go well two of the points that 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.760
 they count the low but they do not give you they give you 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.990
 the points according to you see a lot of rage 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.550
 because it's like having killed him 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.090
 practically this is how you give me the 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.620
 give points to one thing let's say that the 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.180
 another part is to stay the points be 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.280
 the points are the points of fact I 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.230
 matters more points than the low say 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.659
 well here you see we were trying 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.429
 press the part d 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.569
 and once we get in this way 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.459
 I knew I had here here and for 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.660
 here close as you see here appears by 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.860
 here I said I'm running here to see 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.480
 if I can get to the flag it came to 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.819
 the points arrived because I do not reach 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.440
 the points came to me nothing left me another 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.740
 let's say that with honey in the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.540
 lips you see here a little we were commenting 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.940
 dive in this area because it 's where 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.010
 there were the enemies and there you are seeing 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.080
 where everything will appear is a part 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.830
 is on the right where 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.720
 we are practically not internal to 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.640
 kill here you see me turn around 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.010
 a kind of a species do not give me a 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.380
 assistance instead of giving me the discharge and 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.090
 this is when the moment of the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.010
 I took and five are so few 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.989
 that it's okay to pull out is the connection 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.489
 of that which is in playable and less if 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.920
 on top of carrying a burst gun that 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.630
 this one that is impossible here you see me 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.790
 asomo I say there will only be someone there 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.290
 someone now someone surprise of an uncle 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.630
 I do not even know how I killed him 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.250
 chase another trying to cost me 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.440
 jump in a straight line killed this one that does not 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.360
 I know what he was doing he has clouds and 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.150
 eye because it's time for the dancer 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.950
 I mean, I'm super-determined to kill him 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.480
 and I find that effectively what 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.400
 killed but it turns out I did not mean that 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.989
 I was not referring to what I'm going to see 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.670
 outline later on here you see that this one 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.980
 is a bit like that played the charles with 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.959
 She gave him a pair of Wands killed him 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.459
 the moment arrives very few for the 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.870
 Streak starts shooting before you see it 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.209
 because with the ones that were there was impossible 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.680
 do not put a charger for the jump 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.099
 I know I'm a touch I feel that 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.630
 he also and ultime let's say that I 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.670
 saves my life but also like me 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.290
 gave half robs came the points either 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.970
 came to the points and as much as they give to 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.590
 everything I put here he 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.360
 the load star 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.730
 and is it what God wants me 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.980
 I put here to half kill him 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.140
 I'm hiding so it would not be 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.050
 basically the best option for being 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.370
 to be on this map however like this 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.010
 that would be good to put you on the map 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.280
 as a study that yes you are interested 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.530
 kill and what was the backing in the 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.849
 positions that you take as an example the 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.819
 that you will have all the maps you will have 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.220
 realized in this in these maps 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.989
 well, perfectly dominate the enemy and 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.209
 control to control more or less the 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.040
 spam having the three flags caught 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.070
 that is to say for the study map or the 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.770
 map of that container here of magma are 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.900
 maps in which 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.430
 you can have the three flags and basile 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.470
 always leaving the same place in this 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.819
 case they will keep coming out always in the 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.680
 part of the trains that is the one that I am 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.970
 pointing now or in the part of the 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.949
 scam we all need in the part of 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.870
 the trains or let's say that more or 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.129
 less can you control the responso 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.960
 have to leave a flag to the 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.509
 enemies that is what happened that clear 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.030
 well invades them and we carry 140 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.289
 points to 30 it happens that the next 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.539
 round that is where you usually take out 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.180
 the gusts and such and such as one had 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.520
 that my dogs and so on is the typical 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.270
 round in which lasts two minutes or 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.490
 it's like impossible that lasts longer 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.580
 here and my forecast was I will get 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.259
 here running from throwing the dogs and I'm going 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.229
 just to catch the flag of go to 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.580
 kill me they will cut me what will be my 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.520
 average forecast there point there because 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.289
 If it's someone in that area, I said, I do not know 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.960
 it looks like nobody is worth it because they are not covering 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.789
 from the air and I get here to take the 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.069
 dots that are 200 today is super 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.379
 well here they come to lock a companion 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:23.460
 good between quotation marks the one of companion the 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.159
 you did not know that you can jump 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.020
 over here so I went through that area without 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.249
 current to catch the flag must have arrived 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.599
 arrived arrived 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:33.449
 I was saying that I came've arrived 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.639
 the dots and again three flags 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.309
 taken from enemies 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.639
 again always appearing the area of 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:43.169
 the rails and once we know by 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.869
 what was showing up takes a little more 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.189
 of care but nevertheless you already know 

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:48.629
 with a gun of bursts in this distance 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:51.479
 they are short because it does not come too 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.699
 well that's why I'm wearing cap 40 and here you see 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.409
 how is 1 eye eye and me chasing me 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.539
 this guy did not see him and the children 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.159
 my screen connections had not even 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.419
 seen this enemy and then when 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:02.639
 serious that is being tested from the mode 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.959
 cinema because I saw that reality was different 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.419
 the realities that I had seen in 

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:08.699
 Terme had killed two bullets that 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.229
 I was super super touched but good if 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.149
 have you ever been played 10 and are back 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:15.209
 as I have killed you are going to see the mode have 

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:17.339
 and you're going to see what he really wants to say 

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:18.569
 oysters is that I was not and I my 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:19.949
 doll I love it was not full 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.149
 here they start doing the technique of 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.699
 mushroom is to say that they all do well 

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:25.709
 little by little and they come out from under the 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.329
 stones there are who even flee because 

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:29.189
 three enemies came and my companions 

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:31.349
 all go through the same area is like 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:33.209
 have a bone you know because they are 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.110
 arriving enemies because you're not going to 

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:35.370
 for them here you see that they are 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.820
 chasing one or the other 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.430
 I do not know what I do not know how many and there was another 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.560
 we load them and as you see again three 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.729
 flags the enemies were not 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.190
 eating on any hill they had 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.590
 captured but they were going 32 points in 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.139
 total before starting this round 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.919
 They were carrying 38 and they killed this one and they finished the 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:57.810
 game is a game let's say that 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.100
 pretty good at 32 1 so nothing 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.050
 I hope that according to you xavi after the 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.550
 voted video subscribed for more videos
