00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.419
 now talk about some thin 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:11.820
 moments of this tackle tackle unlike 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:13.950
 Springs that even works on any wildebeest 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.500
 that is not what is not present in the muddy bottom is not 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:22.650
 sandy and beautifully lies on stony 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.470
 bottom for more terrain on one of 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.070
 hooks I usually put on the plate 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.050
 like this and inserting it into porridge 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.220
 that is, we get on crumbling background 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.690
 the cafe stands out such a foam plate 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.420
 and 90 percent more than 95 percent 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.790
 poklevok here that all poklevok there on 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.559
 were accounted for exactly hook with 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.960
 foam with flowers foam 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.280
 play that is used 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.190
 both red and yellow foam are best 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.270
 proved popular in the white foam 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.850
 second place is yellow foam and on 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:12.260
 third place, that's just not the most 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.570
 catchy somehow red color than 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.790
 did we come to such a tackle 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.680
 fishing, that is , somewhere in the campaign went 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.060
 saw the lake 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.150
 tackle, in principle, you can carry 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.070
 many heavy will kill for money everywhere 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.060
 You can make a couple of C grade 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.970
 nose came to the lake immediately threw 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.920
 tackle with porridge if no porridge with you 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.400
 Of course, not all in the campaign I take 2 rows 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.130
 gouge 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.780
 you can fill the cork ordinary 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.729
 white bread growth and press the bread 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.460
 how to press it in the cork 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.990
 no longer wake insert hooks we are again 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.850
 I don't want anybody at will. 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:00.290
 walk and throw throws one one 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.780
 or more to pay and go to engage 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.910
 their affairs and rods we stand on 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.479
 careful and their business means 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.060
 kindle a fire put up a tent or 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:16.250
 chop wood for a fire at this time 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:19.880
 our tackle is worth making 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.360
 heard the bell ringing on the rod is not 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.820
 hurry we go with nastya sol based on herself 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.780
 sweeps fish that is what you see 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.030
 short leashes decided pulls 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.430
 a bit of them and basically all fish 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.130
 spotted why made sliding 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.760
 mounting they are on sliding here imagine 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.550
 imagine such a situation if the installation was 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.630
 deaf that is hook on the line 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.480
 he takes fish if big fish bite 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.790
 Naturally our cork can pull off 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:01.160
 easily side and we will see the ruble 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.019
 but if small fish bite the cork on 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.930
 the wall is unable to bite 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:09.380
 accordingly we will not notice therefore 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:13.690
 a sliding assembly is made here to 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:17.570
 any fish any even homemade fish 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.630
 could show us a bite on the rivers with 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.820
 strong current additionally 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.140
 on the main line too 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.220
 sliding weight can be used 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.530
 less more 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.960
 such a mozhe this case is an airplane 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:39.070
 gum pre-worn on the main 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:40.960
 fishing line and also slides the main fishing line but 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.950
 that's basically told everything if 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.640
 for something was added in the comments 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.920
 thank you so much for watching 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:55.740
 ask questions try alikina
