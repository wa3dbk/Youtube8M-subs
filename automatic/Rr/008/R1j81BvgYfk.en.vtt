00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
little investigation and found you could

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.519 
little investigation and found you could
do<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.880> mr.<00:00:24.180> recover<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.689> all<00:00:24.900> because

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
do like mr. recover to this all because

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.710 
do like mr. recover to this all because
uh<00:00:25.560> when<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.130> delete<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> file<00:00:26.789> actually<00:00:27.420> most

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
uh when you delete a file actually most

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.290 
uh when you delete a file actually most
operating<00:00:28.109> systems<00:00:28.730> what<00:00:29.730> they<00:00:29.849> actually<00:00:30.000> do

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
operating systems what they actually do

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.860 
operating systems what they actually do
is<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.840> delete<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.289> link<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:32.660> yes<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
is just delete the link to it yes the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.229 
is just delete the link to it yes the
most<00:00:34.079> Amole<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.100> only<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.579> link<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.090> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
most Amole it so only the link to it

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.299 
most Amole it so only the link to it
they<00:00:36.690> delete<00:00:36.989> them<00:00:37.200> well<00:00:37.829> what<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.010> mean<00:00:38.160> by

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
they delete them well what I mean by

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.069 
they delete them well what I mean by
this<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.520> if<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.390> let's<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.930> your

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
this is if you have let's this is your

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.510 
this is if you have let's this is your
operating<00:00:40.410> system<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.739> your<00:00:40.980> computer<00:00:41.370> you're

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
operating system or your computer you're

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.229 
operating system or your computer you're
using<00:00:42.590> say<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.710> PC<00:00:44.100> or<00:00:44.219> Mac<00:00:44.430> doesn't<00:00:44.969> matter

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
using say it's PC or Mac doesn't matter

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.510 
using say it's PC or Mac doesn't matter
well<00:00:45.539> usually<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.250> you

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
well usually it's like this and then you

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
well usually it's like this and then you
let<00:00:47.640> save<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> file<00:00:48.210> inside<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.020> then<00:00:49.110> it's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
let save a file inside and then it's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.560 
let save a file inside and then it's
saved<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.010> your<00:00:50.250> memory<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.480> this

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
saved in your memory here this is this

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.950 
saved in your memory here this is this
call<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.960> file<00:00:52.520> and<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.760> delete<00:00:54.180> this

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
call this file and then you delete this

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.950 
call this file and then you delete this
file<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.649> has<00:00:55.890> an<00:00:56.039> address<00:00:56.219> here<00:00:56.960> on

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
file this one has an address here on

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.540 
file this one has an address here on
your<00:00:58.260> Drive<00:00:58.500> everything<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.010> an<00:00:59.100> address<00:00:59.430> so

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
your Drive everything is an address so

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.580 
your Drive everything is an address so
all<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.120> does<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.170> links<00:01:01.440> are<00:01:01.559> there

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
all this does or the links are there

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.750 
all this does or the links are there
probably<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> address<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:02.520> doesn't

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
probably to the address but doesn't

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.549 
probably to the address but doesn't
matter<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.629> let's<00:01:03.780> say<00:01:03.899> when<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.290> delete<00:01:04.530> it

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
matter so let's say when you delete it

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.039 
matter so let's say when you delete it
all<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.799> doesn't<00:01:04.949> delete<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.489> link<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.869> this

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
all it doesn't delete this link so this

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.469 
all it doesn't delete this link so this
is<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.320> gets<00:01:07.590> deleted<00:01:08.180> let's<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.330> let's

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
is this gets deleted let's see let's

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.770 
is this gets deleted let's see let's
call<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> link<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> file<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
call this a link to it to the file or to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.420 
call this a link to it to the file or to
the<00:01:12.869> address<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.560> gets<00:01:13.710> deleted<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.280> now

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the address so this gets deleted so now

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.710 
the address so this gets deleted so now
the<00:01:14.490> computer<00:01:15.000> doesn't<00:01:15.150> doesn't<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.540> where

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
the computer doesn't doesn't know where

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.910 
the computer doesn't doesn't know where
your<00:01:15.869> file<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.350> anymore

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
your file is anymore

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.550 
your file is anymore
and<00:01:17.270> because<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.659> link<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.020> deleted<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and because this link is deleted and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.190 
and because this link is deleted and
then<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.830> file<00:01:20.070> still<00:01:20.400> there<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.240> still

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
then this file still there so it's still

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.700 
then this file still there so it's still
there

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
there

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.160 
there
and<00:01:22.880> usually<00:01:23.880> what<00:01:24.150> happens<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:24.960> not

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and usually what happens is it's not

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.240 
and usually what happens is it's not
usually<00:01:25.530> deleted<00:01:26.009> permanently<00:01:26.640> unless<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
usually deleted permanently unless the

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.679 
usually deleted permanently unless the
unless<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.430> overwritten<00:01:29.790> by<00:01:30.119> saving

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
unless it's overwritten by saving

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.410 
unless it's overwritten by saving
another<00:01:30.990> file<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:33.180> usually

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
another file on it and this usually

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.350 
another file on it and this usually
happens<00:01:34.049> when<00:01:34.680> when<00:01:35.490> there's<00:01:35.700> no<00:01:35.820> more<00:01:36.000> space

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
happens when when there's no more space

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.359 
happens when when there's no more space
no<00:01:36.780> more<00:01:36.960> empty<00:01:37.259> space<00:01:37.770> because<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.280> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
no more empty space because it's one to

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.859 
no more empty space because it's one to
consider<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:38.970> occupied<00:01:39.390> there<00:01:39.600> no<00:01:39.720> more

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
consider it it's occupied there no more

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.390 
consider it it's occupied there no more
empty<00:01:40.140> space<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.590> memory<00:01:40.890> card<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.280 
empty space in the memory card and
usually<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.030> operating<00:01:42.360> system<00:01:42.540> works<00:01:42.750> so

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
usually the operating system works so

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.539 
usually the operating system works so
usually<00:01:43.590> when<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.770> your<00:01:43.890> maxing<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.399> they

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
usually when is your maxing out they

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.749 
usually when is your maxing out they
will<00:01:44.670> write<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.479> over<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:47.100> when<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.490> save

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
will write it over you when you save

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.499 
will write it over you when you save
more<00:01:48.000> files

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
more files

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.090 
more files
then<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:48.990> would<00:01:49.079> basically<00:01:49.229> write<00:01:49.590> over<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
then it would basically write over the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.399 
then it would basically write over the
ones<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.610> no<00:01:50.790> link<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.259> that<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
ones that have no link or that you

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.230 
ones that have no link or that you
delete<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.829> basically<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> node<00:01:54.090> right

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
delete it basically so the node right

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.730 
delete it basically so the node right
Overman<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:54.930> they'll<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.290> permanently

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
Overman then they'll be permanently

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.580 
Overman then they'll be permanently
deleted<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.850> right<00:01:57.540> here<00:01:57.719> what<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.049> means<00:01:58.320> is

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
deleted so right here what this means is

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.490 
deleted so right here what this means is
that<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.610> fully<00:01:59.909> yes<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:01.380> this

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that that to fully yes so what this

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.569 
that that to fully yes so what this
means<00:02:01.560> there's<00:02:01.950> all<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.189> gotta<00:02:02.310> do<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.430> find

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
means there's all you gotta do is find

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.590 
means there's all you gotta do is find
the<00:02:02.759> link<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.240> actually<00:02:03.479> pretty

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
the link and this is actually pretty

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.850 
the link and this is actually pretty
easy<00:02:04.939> yeah<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.780> recover<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> links

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
easy yeah so you can recover the links

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.550 
easy yeah so you can recover the links
or<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.459> little<00:02:08.729> fuzz<00:02:08.879> easily<00:02:09.470> but<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
or the little fuzz easily but the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.290 
or the little fuzz easily but the
problem<00:02:10.890> here<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.940> say

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
problem here is if you have a say

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.790 
problem here is if you have a say
personal<00:02:12.840> or<00:02:12.989> financial

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
personal or financial

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800 
personal or financial
information<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.970> for<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.450> want<00:02:15.690> to

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
information and for that you want to

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.930 
information and for that you want to
delete<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.320> you<00:02:16.980> would<00:02:17.130> actually<00:02:17.280> need<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.790> use

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
delete it you would actually need to use

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.730 
delete it you would actually need to use
another<00:02:17.970> program<00:02:18.810> I'll<00:02:19.050> do<00:02:19.290> another<00:02:19.440> math

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
another program I'll do another math

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.390 
another program I'll do another math
easy<00:02:19.980> video<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:20.820> on<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.690> program<00:02:22.020> eraser<00:02:22.560> so

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
easy video on on the program eraser so

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.890 
easy video on on the program eraser so
if<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.670> actually<00:02:23.910> want<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.390> delete<00:02:24.780> it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
if you actually want to delete it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.320 
if you actually want to delete it
permanently<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:26.580> would<00:02:26.700> actually<00:02:26.850> have

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
permanently it's you would actually have

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.320 
permanently it's you would actually have
to<00:02:27.530> have<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.800> probably<00:02:29.280> use<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.520> program<00:02:29.880> or<00:02:30.090> do

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
to have to probably use a program or do

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.640 
to have to probably use a program or do
something<00:02:30.510> else<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.840> actually<00:02:30.990> fully<00:02:31.350> delete

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
something else to actually fully delete

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.700 
something else to actually fully delete
it<00:02:32.720> otherwise<00:02:33.720> anyone<00:02:34.050> could<00:02:34.260> do<00:02:34.350> basically

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
it otherwise anyone could do basically

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.960 
it otherwise anyone could do basically
does<00:02:34.830> all<00:02:34.920> they<00:02:35.040> need<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.340> memory<00:02:35.610> card<00:02:35.760> and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
does all they need is a memory card and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.400 
does all they need is a memory card and
then<00:02:36.090> they<00:02:36.150> could<00:02:36.300> just<00:02:36.330> go<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.810> see<00:02:37.080> what<00:02:37.110> you

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
then they could just go and see what you

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.430 
then they could just go and see what you
have<00:02:37.650> deleted<00:02:38.280> before<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:39.510> uh<00:02:39.540> well

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
have deleted before so uh well

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.550 
have deleted before so uh well
illustrate<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:41.220> by<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.460> opening<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.560> old

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
illustrate this by this opening the old

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.950 
illustrate this by this opening the old
PC<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.430> one<00:02:44.640> using<00:02:45.000> PC<00:02:45.270> file<00:02:45.510> recovery<00:02:45.750> you

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
PC this one using PC file recovery you

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.730 
PC this one using PC file recovery you
could<00:02:46.110> just<00:02:46.430> find<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:47.610> anywhere<00:02:48.120> on<00:02:48.740> Google

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
could just find this anywhere on Google

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.250 
could just find this anywhere on Google
obviously<00:02:50.100> just<00:02:50.580> like<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:51.540> what<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.930> do<00:02:51.990> is

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
obviously just like this what I do is

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.040 
obviously just like this what I do is
type<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.880> PC<00:02:54.080> inspector<00:02:55.610> file<00:02:56.610> recovery<00:02:57.120> here

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.420 

so<00:03:01.050> then<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.320> could<00:03:01.440> search<00:03:01.950> for<00:03:01.980> any<00:03:02.250> one<00:03:02.370> of

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
so then you could search for any one of

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.570 
so then you could search for any one of
these<00:03:02.580> ones<00:03:02.880> here<00:03:03.270> I<00:03:03.330> usually<00:03:03.630> pick<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.580> CNET

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
these ones here I usually pick the CNET

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.330 
these ones here I usually pick the CNET
one<00:03:05.790> here<00:03:06.210> and<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:07.650> could<00:03:07.800> base<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.220> work

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
one here and you could base and work

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.830 
one here and you could base and work
around<00:03:08.610> in<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.600> can<00:03:09.720> just

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
around in this one so you can just

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.210 
around in this one so you can just
download<00:03:09.960> it<00:03:10.230> here<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.590> whatnot<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:10.950> then<00:03:11.130> it

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
download it here and whatnot and then it

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.320 
download it here and whatnot and then it
will<00:03:11.340> open<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.610> little<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.850> guess<00:03:12.000> but<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.210> already

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
will open a little I guess but I already

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.470 
will open a little I guess but I already
have<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.660> downloaded<00:03:12.860> so<00:03:13.860> seeing<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.220> as<00:03:14.370> a

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
have it downloaded so seeing it as a

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.390 
have it downloaded so seeing it as a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
good site user to download it for free

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.330 
good site user to download it for free
so<00:03:18.209> all<00:03:18.390> just<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:19.290> before<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:19.980> let's<00:03:20.220> just

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
look at my my external hard drive my

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.250 
look at my my external hard drive my
external<00:03:26.340> memory<00:03:26.670> card<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.110> player<00:03:28.110> out<00:03:28.230> of

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
external memory card and player out of

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.100 
external memory card and player out of
it<00:03:28.440> yes<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.459> here's<00:03:29.700> my<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:30.300> my<00:03:30.750> computer

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
it yes so here's my just my computer

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.979 
it yes so here's my just my computer
here<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.680> there's<00:03:31.830> a<00:03:31.890> removable<00:03:32.250> disk<00:03:32.610> here
