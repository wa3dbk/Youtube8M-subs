pagination indicator you're not checking

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.100 
pagination indicator you're not checking
to<00:01:52.200> measure<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:53.009> size<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.420> actual<00:01:54.570> target

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.380 
to measure the size of the actual target
what<00:01:55.619> you're<00:01:55.770> checking<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.520> what<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.240> call

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
what you're checking for is what we call

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.350 
what you're checking for is what we call
interference<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.729> target<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.240> course

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
interference so this target is of course

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.490

to know what size this website is using

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.570 
to know what size this website is using
and<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.930> think<00:02:43.260> it's<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.650> letter<00:02:43.830> or<00:02:44.190> an<00:02:44.340> ear<00:02:44.550> or

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
without peering up too much you can use

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.730 
without peering up too much you can use
these<00:03:05.910> mostly<00:03:06.780> for<00:03:06.960> design<00:03:07.200> or<00:03:07.470> for<00:03:07.650> other

large sizes these little ticks along the

spacing<00:03:12.360> there's<00:03:13.140> only<00:03:13.290> two<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.530> them<00:03:13.830> this<00:03:14.370> is

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
spacing there's only two of them this is

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.980 
spacing there's only two of them this is
ten<00:03:14.700> point<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.330> can<00:03:15.480> see<00:03:15.690> here<00:03:15.960> that

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
ten point and you can see here that

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.200 
ten point and you can see here that
these<00:03:16.290> are<00:03:16.440> much<00:03:16.620> smaller<00:03:17.310> than<00:03:17.700> 10<00:03:18.030> points

these are much smaller than 10 points
facing<00:03:18.510> which<00:03:19.440> makes<00:03:19.680> sense<00:03:19.920> if<00:03:20.070> it's<00:03:20.220> six<00:03:20.400> or

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
facing which makes sense if it's six or

facing which makes sense if it's six or
seven<00:03:20.850> point<00:03:21.060> size<00:03:22.010> you<00:03:23.010> can<00:03:23.160> use<00:03:23.280> these

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
seven point size you can use these

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.400 
seven point size you can use these
things<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:24.030> measure<00:03:24.240> but<00:03:24.570> buttons<00:03:25.110> for

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
things to measure but buttons for

the<00:03:28.080> size<00:03:28.260> four<00:03:28.620> major<00:03:28.830> submission<00:03:29.400> buttons

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
the size four major submission buttons

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.830 
the size four major submission buttons
these<00:03:31.440> are<00:03:31.620> much<00:03:31.770> smaller<00:03:32.390> but<00:03:33.390> if<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.570> had<00:03:33.720> an

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
these are much smaller but if you had an

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.500 
these are much smaller but if you had an
actual<00:03:33.990> button<00:03:34.440> button<00:03:34.710> they'd<00:03:34.890> be<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.190> size

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
actual button button they'd be that size

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.580 
actual button button they'd be that size
the<00:03:36.510> other<00:03:36.630> thing<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.870> can<00:03:37.080> do<00:03:39.290> if<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.560> really

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
the other thing you can do if you really

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.350 
the other thing you can do if you really
want<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.220> since<00:03:41.460> it's<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:41.790> convenient<00:03:42.180> and

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
want to since it's so convenient and

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.480 
want to since it's so convenient and
pocket-sized<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.500> use<00:03:43.770> it<00:03:43.890> for<00:03:44.040> prototyping

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
pocket-sized is use it for prototyping

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.650 
pocket-sized is use it for prototyping
it's<00:03:45.330> about<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.690> size<00:03:45.840> of<00:03:46.020> a<00:03:46.110> screen<00:03:47.330> so<00:03:48.330> you

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
it's about the size of a screen so you

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.240 
it's about the size of a screen so you
simply<00:03:49.050> trace<00:03:49.470> around<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.740> outside<00:03:50.070> edges

a button bar to set line spacing you

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.140 
a button bar to set line spacing you
just<00:04:09.480> use<00:04:09.840> these<00:04:10.080> tix<00:04:10.440> draws<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.340> side<00:04:11.550> put

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
just use these tix draws the side put

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.320 
just use these tix draws the side put
little<00:04:12.300> marks<00:04:12.660> on<00:04:12.750> your<00:04:13.200> page<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:14.330> it's

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
little marks on your page and it's

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.420 
little marks on your page and it's
symmetrically<00:04:15.930> set<00:04:16.170> up<00:04:16.940> so<00:04:17.940> you<00:04:18.270> flip<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.140> over

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
symmetrically set up so you flip it over

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.330 
symmetrically set up so you flip it over
do<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.489> few<00:04:20.730> more<00:04:20.910> on<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.239> side<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:22.190> if<00:04:23.190> you're

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
do a few more on this side and if you're

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.580 
do a few more on this side and if you're
careful<00:04:23.810> all<00:04:24.810> you<00:04:25.020> have<00:04:25.140> to<00:04:25.229> do<00:04:25.320> is<00:04:25.440> draw

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
careful all you have to do is draw

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.820 
careful all you have to do is draw
between<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.100> lines<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:27.470> that's<00:04:28.470> your<00:04:28.650> line

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
between the lines and that's your line

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.950 
between the lines and that's your line
spacing<00:04:29.210> now<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.270> write

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
spacing now you write

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.080 
spacing now you write
towards<00:04:31.410> on<00:04:31.710> top<00:04:31.949> of<00:04:32.130> this<00:04:34.639> you<00:04:35.639> can<00:04:35.789> also<00:04:35.940> use

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
towards on top of this you can also use

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.350 
towards on top of this you can also use
some<00:04:36.509> of<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.660> items<00:04:36.780> like<00:04:37.350> the<00:04:37.500> button

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
some of the items like the button

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.510 
some of the items like the button
measuring<00:04:39.360> tool<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:40.650> simply<00:04:40.919> draw<00:04:41.069> buttons<00:04:41.370> on

measuring tool to simply draw buttons on

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.100 
measuring tool to simply draw buttons on
there<00:04:41.669> of<00:04:42.180> course<00:04:42.360> they're<00:04:42.509> better<00:04:42.660> tools<00:04:42.930> in

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
there of course they're better tools in

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.150 
there of course they're better tools in
this<00:04:43.259> but<00:04:44.039> it's<00:04:44.190> another<00:04:44.340> feature<00:04:44.849> to<00:04:45.090> have
