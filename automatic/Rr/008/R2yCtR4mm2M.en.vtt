00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.070
 little cardboard very simple stupid you 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:36.350

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.100

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.690

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.170
 english in japanese and italy various 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:52.170
 long we could see some co - products 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.809
 their little shop in zurich this showroom 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.159
 which is made in containers it's 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.790
 it's pretty cool so I leave you 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:06.420
 go see the site and get back 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.080
 account by yourself that's it then let's go 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.270
 to this little freitag pouch 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.400
 so to remember freitag 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.830
 it's a small Swiss company that has 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.310
 as a concept of recycling tarpaulins 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.350
 trucks so suddenly it makes you every 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.800
 times it's unique patterns you have 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.409
 because ben ali there is the wear of the 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.620
 tarpaulin that is different depending on 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.810
 parties that got blows so voila 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.659
 after there is the wear of the hot weather of the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.300
 cold wind from the rain of the snow and 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.020
 some models you will still have younger 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.670
 to be in color a piece of a logo that 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.260
 had precisely on the tarpaulin or whatever 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.110
 written thing 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.380
 that's what makes your model unique 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.400
 so for the one with the con going to put 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.810
 our little iphone 5 inside hop 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.409
 as you can see 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.650
 sanÃ© pc not enormously your phone 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.710
 because at the base the cover itself is 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.090
 really pretty thin at the back you 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.390
 can see that there is a small 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.590
 tongue for going out your iphone 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.019
 who did it shoot and hop here and 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.670
 then we put you your iphone 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.480
 here is the little tongue are at his 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.700
 place stupidly 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.810
 here 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.890
 so I let you see the iphone as 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.780
 still it's to his ends it's not 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.709
 like the leather pouches that 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.599
 directly that it always comes very 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.000
 thick then by a little unpleasant 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.019
 to have in the toned pocket is that 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.150
 this freitag study 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.510
 it's a little inverted it's really 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.870
 well then the blow of the case is 60 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:55.160
 francs plus shipping costs have everything 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.599
 it came back to me 64 francs delivered 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.459
 a few days it's pretty fast 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.440
 Besides, it's pretty funny when 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.069
 you order for his twenty 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.739
 small but the maran in the minutes 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.049
 who follow during the preparation 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.000
 yet another email spur as soon as he has 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.440
 been sent a third small email to 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.709
 every time a little story is 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.900
 friendly enough funny and I already have 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.569
 ordered several products from them and 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.069
 you receive what's missing it's not 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.750
 exactly the same mail and each time 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.310
 a different story is not bad 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.650
 it is well fucked I find enough 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.910
 friendly their little services so 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.389
 at the logistics level 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.670
 there is nothing to blame here so if 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.100
 you want a good product that will suit you 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.850
 lasted a very long time 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.410
 I advise you to go home 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.060
 to go see what they have they also have 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.040

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.130
 wide range of products 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.609

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:56.350
