think that implies can go to hold this
because<00:02:51.519> most<00:02:52.060> nights<00:02:52.359> plus<00:02:52.930> those<00:02:53.170> heroes

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.039 
because most nights plus those heroes
and<00:02:54.790> all<00:02:54.970> those<00:02:55.150> flying<00:02:55.480> machines<00:02:55.540> hanging

around I don't think it's gonna be able
to<00:02:57.459> do<00:02:57.579> it<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.109> looks<00:02:59.109> like<00:02:59.200> if<00:02:59.319> we<00:02:59.590> going<00:02:59.799> for

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
to do it and looks like if we going for

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.199 
to do it and looks like if we going for

a<00:03:52.580> sealed<00:03:52.850> up<00:03:52.970> these<00:03:53.510> nights<00:03:53.840> are<00:03:54.020> actually

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
a sealed up these nights are actually

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.760 
a sealed up these nights are actually
looking<00:03:56.480> fairly<00:03:56.630> numerous<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.290> this<00:03:57.440> three<00:03:57.680> of

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
looking fairly numerous to this three of

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.850 
looking fairly numerous to this three of
them<00:03:57.860> over<00:03:57.980> here<00:03:58.070> and<00:03:58.840> as<00:03:59.840> well<00:04:00.170> okay<00:04:00.500> freedom

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
them over here and as well okay freedom

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.430 
them over here and as well okay freedom
so<00:04:01.010> maybe<00:04:01.160> they<00:04:01.310> weren't<00:04:01.460> that<00:04:01.610> numerous<00:04:02.030> but

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
so maybe they weren't that numerous but

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.260 
so maybe they weren't that numerous but
if<00:04:03.440> I<00:04:03.620> be<00:04:03.770> spotting<00:04:04.430> this<00:04:04.580> expansion<00:04:05.030> here

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
if I be spotting this expansion here

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.610 
if I be spotting this expansion here
noting<00:04:05.750> that<00:04:05.780> he's<00:04:05.990> not<00:04:06.140> gonna<00:04:06.260> better<00:04:06.470> get

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
noting that he's not gonna better get

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.290 
noting that he's not gonna better get
through<00:04:06.770> that<00:04:06.860> many<00:04:07.010> towers<00:04:07.220> just<00:04:07.940> doesn't

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
through that many towers just doesn't

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.880 
through that many towers just doesn't
quite<00:04:08.390> have<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.600> firepower<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.320> troops<00:04:09.560> deal

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
quite have the firepower the troops deal

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.250 
quite have the firepower the troops deal
that<00:04:10.130> he's<00:04:10.280> even<00:04:10.340> got<00:04:10.520> this<00:04:10.610> nice<00:04:11.090> walking<00:04:11.990> his

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
that he's even got this nice walking his

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.770 
that he's even got this nice walking his
way<00:04:12.790> he'll<00:04:13.790> get<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:13.970> bit<00:04:14.180> of<00:04:14.270> experience<00:04:14.360> out<00:04:14.750> of

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
way he'll get a bit of experience out of

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.620 
way he'll get a bit of experience out of
this<00:04:14.900> nice<00:04:15.080> but<00:04:15.350> yeah<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.860> night's<00:04:16.070> still

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
this nice but yeah the night's still

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.400 
this nice but yeah the night's still
forcing<00:04:17.630> him<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:18.410> divert<00:04:18.800> attention

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
to be at the truth rather than the talus

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.580 
to be at the truth rather than the talus
just<00:04:21.209> can<00:04:21.360> take<00:04:21.540> them<00:04:21.690> forever<00:04:22.290> to<00:04:22.410> get

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
just can take them forever to get

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.830 
just can take them forever to get
through<00:04:22.620> there<00:04:22.860> in<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.040> meantime<00:04:23.750> losing<00:04:24.750> his
