00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello girls how are you I hope that you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.779
 find very well it's already the second day 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.730
 of our marathon of reviews and for the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.710
 today I have to talk to you about a 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.320
 makeup product that I have already 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.780
 long time several months with this 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.670
 December's product is approximately 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.859
 good that you had told me 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.949
 review that yes because they were interested 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.980
 what is it about just the eye shadows 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.340
 the palette of five colors of l colors 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.750
 I have four of them are these me 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.059
 sent from the page 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.640
 house dotcom I 'm going to leave the link 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.700
 in the information box you are 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.770
 pallets are sold for a 99 dollar what 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.559
 would come to be a thousand Chilean pesos or 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.050
 even a little less the good thing is that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.969
 in haiti house dotcom you can pay with 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.710
 paypal for those if you have a card 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.570
 visa mastercard type credit 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.940
 so you will not have any problems 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.980
 but if you do not have this kind of 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.289
 cards you can also pay through 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.130
 from western juniors that there are offices in 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.900
 everywhere then if you do not have 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.730
 the card you can make the deposit 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.500
 going and your llorente charge a 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.140
 little a commission I believe for the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.340
 service but there is a possibility what 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.140
 that I think is a very good thing 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.850
 because many girls who do not maybe not 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.920
 they have access to a card or they are minors 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.050
 of age or for whatever reason 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.660
 is the possibility for each of 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.220
 you and we went to review the 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.200
 general characteristics of these 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.790
 pallets these tickets as I said there are 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.520
 of five colors but there is a version 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.770
 also that these are two colors 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.110
 ballots are called palettes in metallic 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.290
 all shoulders are bright is not 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.720
 that have glitter but are not more than 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.240
 No case are of that bright finish 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.580
 and I do not know if metallic maybe rather 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.729
 Satin or a little color depends 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.580
 but in any case bright each palette 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.530
 says it lasts about 36 months is cruel and 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.259
 free which I know is something very 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.140
 important to you and the packaging is 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.060
 plastic and bring one of these applicators 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.659
 of sponge that the truth I for 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.729
 apply the shadow I do not see him 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.469
 I do not know sometimes as for specific areas 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.509
 but I think I give it more use as for 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.450
 nail jobs and that kind of thing 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.069
 but anyway it's good that they come 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.440
 about two years ago about 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.230
 I would say these pallets were well 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.459
 fashion in what blogs are and I was 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.010
 everyone turned crazy buying 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.450
 these palettes the good thing is that apart from 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.819
 that we already reviewed the price that for a 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.860
 99 dollar are super cheap are 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.360
 very many in there is cause not the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.090
 they have all but if they have a good 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.830
 number and there is a wide variety of 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.110
 colors and there are pallets that are also 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.519
 as very day days very colors 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.160
 natural and another that are like two 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.220
 very yellow green blue colors like this 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.739
 super attractive and cheerful so 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.650
 you have a great variety to choose 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.329
 there are undoubtedly for all positions I 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.849
 I would say that what stood out most about these 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.530
 pallets is without doubt the pigmentation as 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.420
 I mentioned them I have four of these 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.010
 pallets and they all have a pigmentation 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.549
 Perez 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.099
 excellent wonderful really 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.650
 spectacular pigment very very very well 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.750
 the difference for example I also have 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.579
 these other shades of elia color that I 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.340
 I've seen it in this store republic of 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.349
 beauty on the waterfront on the floor of 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.110
 down sell them these approximately 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.640
 for five thousand pesos when they are like three 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.560
 daily dollars with actually them 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.430
 multiply these are those that are the 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.620
 baker 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.030
 I did not like much good but 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.560
 be another any revision of the law 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.359
 I hope I do not pigment very well 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.340
 colors are super cute and they are not so 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.829
 dusty but now I do not know if not 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.569
 I know how to use it or do not really pigment anything 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.849
 unlike those that segmented 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.480
 super good but to the contrary I would say 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.120
 is that they are quite dusty so 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.459
 they fall quite sometimes for example the 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.260
 palette of the 120 colors is the Chinese 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.870
 and I think that you have pigments 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.000
 super good and it's a bit dusty this 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.590
 I would say it's a little less 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.799
 dusty but they're still pretty 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.510
 dusty and I think maybe what 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.609
 The problem is that I would say no 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.319
 I do not think it's a good idea to make a 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.359
 complete look with 2 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.129
 of this kind of shadows because about 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.079
 all some colors and in some 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.269
 pallets more than others tend like that 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.099
 it's hard to stick to the eyelid even though you 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.749
 you use a first one is not always cream 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.999
 or anything that is done as a 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:17.699
 little sticky before on your eyelid 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:20.430
 so you have a better version this 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.349
 like it's hard to hold on to everyone 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.949
 and I would ask you to use a 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:27.810
 matte shadow or it's called soca mate and then 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.580
 complicate things not only bright 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.229
 not only of these because if you do not go like 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.789
 fall very little that you will not last 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.660
 makeup all day free 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.660
 accompany us 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.389
 but I'm going to show you the colors that 

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:41.429
 I have the names of the palettes but 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.469
 as I tell you there is a huge variety if 

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:44.610
 you look in google if you do not know 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:45.959
 are thinking about buying one of these 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.199
 pallets there are actually many recipes 

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:51.869
 of the guachos and things so good them 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.929
 I'm going to start by showing this palette that 

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:58.259
 it's called the short dan and that is in shades 

00:04:54.929 --> 00:05:00.029
 this is my favorite ground away despite 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.499
 that I 'm not super lover of 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:03.299
 neutral colors I think this palette 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:06.119
 pigment super good is super of the day to 

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:08.429
 day and it's not boring but as I said 

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:11.039
 I would advise you to mix it with 

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:14.549
 other pallets also my second 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:17.099
 favorite is carnival that has color is 

00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:19.349
 Super cheerful is very carnival like 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.209
 indicates the name has at the beginning 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.009
 it brought like blue flashes on 

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:24.749
 some shadows but it was just the layer 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.129
 shallow after the chopped it the 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:29.549
 the first time there was practically no 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:32.579
 nothing there is a mustard tone a green a 

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:35.219
 watermelon tone a lilac and a pink that 

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:37.920
 above all it is pink pepper very much 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:40.950
 but like it costs to open 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.180
 then this circus that is a palette like 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.650
 with a lilac pink yellow green and blue 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.150
 these last three colors and I thought that 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.970
 they were going to do a lot more on but 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.800
 they are slightly cakes are not 100% 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.410
 saturated but they are not like that either 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.060
 they outweigh the pink and the dec 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.760
 they also had many blue flashes 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.130
 super nice top something was disguised in 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.290
 the note now but it was just a layer 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.180
 surface then there is nothing and 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.730
 last palette this knows that I am super 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.280
 fanatic of the lilacs and all that kind of 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.260
 colors that's why I decided to ask for it but 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.260
 it is actually like a bit monotonous, 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.420
 full of the council because 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.590
 put in the eye does not achieve but the great 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:24.780
 difference of one tone and the other is a 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.400
 pink and some lilacs the truth that I do not 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.950
 They really liked the colors but it 's a 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.020
 personal thing for the lieutenant 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.000
 little blue stars and I feel like they're like 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.550
 a little saturated and they look like 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.010
 a little used a little dirty yo 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.140
 I prefer as pink or purple more 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.820
 lit but anyway it's a 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.770
 Very nice palette but I think it is 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.280
 little versatile compared to the others 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.170
 pallets and in summary I recommend you these 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.210
 shadows I would say that these are reason 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.610
 as for people who are starting or 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.770
 if you want to acquire colors like 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.240
 a little bit more cheerful to go out 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.770
 little of the typical neutrals and not 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.510
 you want to spend a lot of money 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.550
 It seems that they are an excellent option 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.860
 especially some palettes more than others 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.900
 but if they have a needle yet 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.630
 can write in the comments 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.890
 and now with lily let's say hello 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.890
