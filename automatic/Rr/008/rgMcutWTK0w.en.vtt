feeling sharking so on and so forth just

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.439 
feeling sharking so on and so forth just
a<00:00:55.829> very<00:00:56.010> long<00:00:56.250> loop<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:57.000> annoy<00:00:57.180> someone

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
a very long loop that can annoy someone

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.790 
a very long loop that can annoy someone
and<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:57.870> can't<00:00:58.109> get<00:00:58.260> over<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.559> they're

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and if they can't get over it they're

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.619 
and if they can't get over it they're
just<00:00:59.190> basically<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.910> turn<00:01:00.090> killed<00:01:00.329> at<00:01:00.480> one

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
just basically one turn killed at one

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.270 
just basically one turn killed at one
game<00:01:00.809> um<00:01:01.399> for<00:01:02.399> rat<00:01:02.609> rat<00:01:03.059> may<00:01:03.619> be<00:01:04.619> put<00:01:04.949> down<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
game um for rat rat may be put down the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.100 
game um for rat rat may be put down the
two<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.670> maybe<00:01:05.790> put<00:01:06.270> down<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> one<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.810> would

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
two or maybe put down the one I would

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.080 
two or maybe put down the one I would
say<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.619> would<00:01:07.710> most<00:01:08.040> likely<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.400> hip<00:01:08.549> put<00:01:08.939> down

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
say it would most likely be hip put down

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.539 
say it would most likely be hip put down
the<00:01:09.210> two<00:01:09.360> because<00:01:09.600> he's<00:01:09.689> more<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.439> rat<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the two because he's more of a rat is

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.670 
the two because he's more of a rat is
more<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> third<00:01:12.270> card<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.170> used<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
more the third card that is used in the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.219 
more the third card that is used in the
deck<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.189> runs<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.970> deck<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.390> i<00:01:15.810> would<00:01:16.049> say

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
deck that runs the deck and i would say

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.420 
deck that runs the deck and i would say
magician<00:01:16.560> would<00:01:16.650> most<00:01:16.830> likely<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.159> put<00:01:17.340> down

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
magician would most likely be put down

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.770 
magician would most likely be put down
the<00:01:17.610> one<00:01:17.790> because<00:01:18.030> magicians<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.659> that

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the one because magicians the one that

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.350 
the one because magicians the one that
starts<00:01:19.140> off<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.560> loop<00:01:19.770> with<00:01:20.189> shark<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
starts off the loop with shark and

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.760 
starts off the loop with shark and
that's<00:01:21.720> basically<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.110> main<00:01:22.229> combo<00:01:22.619> you're

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that's basically the main combo you're

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.370 
that's basically the main combo you're
going<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.610> deck<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.259> reason

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
going with with the deck so the reason

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.149 
going with with the deck so the reason
why<00:01:25.680> i<00:01:26.100> chose<00:01:27.619> magician<00:01:28.619> was<00:01:28.829> something<00:01:29.130> that

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
why i chose magician was something that

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.859 
why i chose magician was something that
i<00:01:29.280> threw<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.090> said<00:01:30.450> he'd<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.720> down

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
i threw in there and said he'd be down

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.749 
i threw in there and said he'd be down
to<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.079> one<00:01:31.229> was<00:01:31.710> because<00:01:32.009> hitting<00:01:32.610> that

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.859 
to the one was because hitting that

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
would permanently put wine ups on a

basically<00:01:36.869> they<00:01:37.079> crippled<00:01:37.680> them<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.009> much

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
basically they crippled them so much

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.969 
basically they crippled them so much
that<00:01:38.250> they<00:01:38.490> wouldn't<00:01:39.090> even<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.390> tier<00:01:39.689> 1<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.229> i

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
that they wouldn't even be tier 1 and i

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.370 
that they wouldn't even be tier 1 and i
think<00:01:41.189> that's<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.490> Kaname<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.200> didn't<00:01:43.200> want

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
think that's what Kaname was didn't want

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.230 
think that's what Kaname was didn't want
to<00:01:43.500> do<00:01:43.619> at<00:01:43.890> first<00:01:44.250> when<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:44.610> hit<00:01:44.700> zen<00:01:44.970> mighty

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
to do at first when they hit zen mighty

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.389 
to do at first when they hit zen mighty
but<00:01:45.930> now<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.259> they<00:01:46.350> saw<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:47.009> did<00:01:47.220> sin

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
but now that they saw that they did sin

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.590 
but now that they saw that they did sin
mighty<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.759> people<00:01:48.000> saw<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> they<00:01:48.390> could<00:01:48.509> do

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
mighty and people saw that they could do

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.380 
mighty and people saw that they could do
other<00:01:48.720> things<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.579> they<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.939> just

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
other things that they can do this just

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.179 
other things that they can do this just
like<00:01:51.509> how<00:01:51.659> they<00:01:51.810> over<00:01:52.110> hit<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.530> sectors<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
like how they over hit in sectors and

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.889 
like how they over hit in sectors and
they<00:01:53.310> didn't<00:01:53.729> hit<00:01:53.850> centipede<00:01:54.360> which<00:01:54.570> was

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
they didn't hit centipede which was

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.510 
they didn't hit centipede which was
basically<00:01:55.140> something<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.680> could<00:01:55.920> easily<00:01:56.219> go

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
basically something that could easily go

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
basically something that could easily go
off<00:01:56.700> um<00:01:57.229> other<00:01:58.229> cars<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.829> which<00:01:59.040> may<00:01:59.729> um<00:02:00.030> these

down here zenmaines zenmaines is my own
personal<00:03:47.859> one<00:03:48.250> which<00:03:48.400> i<00:03:48.489> thought<00:03:48.670> would<00:03:48.790> be<00:03:48.850> a

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
personal one which i thought would be a

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.729 
personal one which i thought would be a
hit<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.630> means<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:50.049> something<00:03:50.410> in<00:03:50.590> the

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
hit that means is something in the

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.620 
hit that means is something in the
windup<00:03:51.069> that<00:03:51.250> actually<00:03:51.549> helps<00:03:51.850> where<00:03:52.329> you<00:03:52.480> can

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
windup that actually helps where you can

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.110 
windup that actually helps where you can
most<00:03:53.200> people<00:03:53.470> run<00:03:53.680> to<00:03:53.950> zenmaines<00:03:54.340> in<00:03:54.639> the<00:03:54.940> wind

most people run to zenmaines in the wind

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.330 
most people run to zenmaines in the wind

safety precautions but putting that

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.190 
safety precautions but putting that
means<00:03:59.650> that<00:03:59.799> one<00:04:00.040> kind<00:04:00.849> of<00:04:01.000> keeps<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.959> more<00:04:02.139> of

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
means that one kind of keeps it more of

means that one kind of keeps it more of
a<00:04:02.230> wall<00:04:02.440> it's<00:04:02.739> almost<00:04:03.069> like<00:04:03.340> how<00:04:03.519> Reaper<00:04:03.910> was

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
a wall it's almost like how Reaper was

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.039 
a wall it's almost like how Reaper was
at<00:04:04.359> one<00:04:04.630> time<00:04:04.840> at<00:04:05.079> one<00:04:06.329> so<00:04:07.329> it<00:04:07.810> would<00:04:07.959> actually

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
at one time at one so it would actually

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.099 
at one time at one so it would actually
be<00:04:08.290> pretty<00:04:08.739> beneficial<00:04:08.950> for<00:04:09.910> other<00:04:10.480> decks<00:04:10.780> but

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
be pretty beneficial for other decks but

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.009 
be pretty beneficial for other decks but
it's<00:04:11.560> not<00:04:11.709> too<00:04:11.889> harsh<00:04:12.130> and<00:04:12.639> then<00:04:13.450> now<00:04:13.870> we're

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
it's not too harsh and then now we're

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.530 
it's not too harsh and then now we're
going<00:04:14.139> to<00:04:14.200> start<00:04:14.349> getting<00:04:14.590> into<00:04:14.769> band

these<00:04:16.540> are<00:04:16.690> possible<00:04:17.050> cars<00:04:17.260> that<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.680> think

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
these are possible cars that I think

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.160 
these are possible cars that I think
would<00:04:18.730> have<00:04:19.030> a<00:04:19.060> chance<00:04:19.330> to<00:04:19.420> eating<00:04:19.600> van<00:04:19.720> going

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
would have a chance to eating van going

the pop or I believe you get the special
summon<00:04:48.640> but<00:04:49.210> governor<00:04:49.900> gives<00:04:50.110> more<00:04:50.410> advantage

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
summon but governor gives more advantage

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.590 
summon but governor gives more advantage
that<00:04:50.920> and<00:04:51.190> governor<00:04:51.550> would<00:04:51.700> be<00:04:52.000> a<00:04:52.030> possible

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
that and governor would be a possible

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.630 
that and governor would be a possible
ban<00:04:52.840> because<00:04:53.560> it's<00:04:54.100> basically<00:04:54.280> like<00:04:54.580> a

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
ban because it's basically like a

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.870 
ban because it's basically like a
Brianna<00:04:55.000> because<00:04:55.300> you<00:04:55.480> get<00:04:55.600> to<00:04:56.550> destroy<00:04:57.550> cards

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
Brianna because you get to destroy cards

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.790 
Brianna because you get to destroy cards
instead<00:04:58.030> of<00:04:58.180> bouncing<00:04:58.570> them<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:58.900> but<00:04:59.620> it's

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
instead of bouncing them and but it's

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.350 
instead of bouncing them and but it's
more<00:04:59.950> of<00:05:00.070> a<00:05:00.160> tougher<00:05:00.520> Brianna<00:05:00.820> if<00:05:01.090> you<00:05:01.300> use

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
more of a tougher Brianna if you use

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.410 
more of a tougher Brianna if you use
into<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.840> more<00:05:02.200> males<00:05:02.380> um<00:05:03.090> another<00:05:04.090> chance

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 
do need to make this deck go off and

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.650 
do need to make this deck go off and
seeing<00:06:49.920> that<00:06:49.950> they<00:06:50.220> brought<00:06:50.640> they<00:06:50.940> took<00:06:51.150> BLS

seeing that they brought they took BLS
off<00:06:51.930> which<00:06:52.470> I<00:06:52.620> didn't<00:06:52.800> put<00:06:52.890> in<00:06:52.980> this<00:06:53.070> band<00:06:53.220> was

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
off which I didn't put in this band was

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.610 
off which I didn't put in this band was
because<00:06:53.580> if<00:06:53.940> they<00:06:54.420> brought<00:06:54.630> chaos<00:06:55.080> back<00:06:55.440> it

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
because if they brought chaos back it

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.990 
because if they brought chaos back it
would<00:06:55.680> kind<00:06:55.920> of<00:06:55.980> be<00:06:56.100> at<00:06:56.190> an<00:06:56.310> advantage<00:06:56.430> when

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
would kind of be at an advantage when

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.720 
would kind of be at an advantage when
with<00:06:57.960> the<00:06:58.080> BLS<00:06:58.440> if<00:06:58.590> they<00:06:58.950> brought<00:06:59.130> chaos<00:06:59.370> back

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 
with the BLS if they brought chaos back

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.400 
with the BLS if they brought chaos back
it<00:07:00.000> would<00:07:00.830> go<00:07:01.830> on<00:07:02.010> par<00:07:02.460> with<00:07:02.490> the<00:07:02.970> BLS<00:07:03.510> and<00:07:03.780> then

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.410 
it would go on par with the BLS and then

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.350 
it would go on par with the BLS and then
