about<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.700> it's<00:03:21.970> 11<00:03:22.720> saliva<00:03:23.080> samples<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.860> it's

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
about it it's 11 saliva samples and it's

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.309 
about it it's 11 saliva samples and it's
and<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.700> samples<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.690> throughout<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.080> cycle

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
and it samples it throughout the cycle

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.490 
and it samples it throughout the cycle
and<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.880> can<00:03:28.060> graft<00:03:28.330> where<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.140> progesterone

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
and you can graft where the progesterone

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.500 
and you can graft where the progesterone
levels<00:03:29.980> are<00:03:30.100> estrogen<00:03:30.459> levels<00:03:30.940> are<00:03:31.030> when<00:03:31.420> you

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
levels are estrogen levels are when you

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.740

go to a fertility doctor they might just

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.600 
go to a fertility doctor they might just
take<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.900> blood<00:03:35.140> sample<00:03:35.200> on<00:03:35.590> day<00:03:35.709> 21<00:03:36.100> well<00:03:36.490> how

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
take a blood sample on day 21 well how

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.980 
take a blood sample on day 21 well how
do<00:03:36.670> you<00:03:36.790> know<00:03:36.940> what<00:03:37.150> your<00:03:37.330> progesterone

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
do you know what your progesterone

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.020 
do you know what your progesterone
