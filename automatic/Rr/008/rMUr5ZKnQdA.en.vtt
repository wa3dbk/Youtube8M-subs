00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
so nutrition is really really important

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.100 
so nutrition is really really important
for<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.190> riders<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:02.790> it's<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.600> long<00:00:03.810> stage

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
for the riders and it's a long stage

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.710 
for the riders and it's a long stage
that<00:00:04.410> I<00:00:04.470> 180<00:00:05.069> K<00:00:05.339> so<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.060> riders<00:00:06.359> need<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.600> be

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
that I 180 K so the riders need to be

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.059 
that I 180 K so the riders need to be
fueling<00:00:07.140> progressively<00:00:07.649> throughout<00:00:07.919> the

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
fueling progressively throughout the

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.129 
fueling progressively throughout the
stage<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.519> keep<00:00:08.670> their<00:00:08.790> energy<00:00:08.910> levels<00:00:09.360> up<00:00:09.510> so

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
stage to keep their energy levels up so

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.900 
stage to keep their energy levels up so
I'll<00:00:10.410> just<00:00:10.530> take<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.830> through<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.370> it's<00:00:11.759> got

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
I'll just take you through and it's got

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.669 
I'll just take you through and it's got
a<00:00:11.940> music<00:00:12.360> that's<00:00:12.599> what<00:00:12.719> we<00:00:12.840> give<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> riders

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
a music that's what we give the riders

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.200 
a music that's what we give the riders
at<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.099> feed<00:00:14.309> zone<00:00:14.340> somewhere<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.969> feeds

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
at the feed zone somewhere it feeds

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.480 
at the feed zone somewhere it feeds
omeone<00:00:15.570> at<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.780> moment<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:16.980> will<00:00:17.220> start<00:00:17.430> off

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
omeone at the moment so I will start off

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.429 
omeone at the moment so I will start off
with<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.789> air<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.180> bottles<00:00:18.600> obviously<00:00:19.230> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
with the air the bottles obviously the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.830 
with the air the bottles obviously the
riders<00:00:19.740> needs<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> keep<00:00:20.100> very<00:00:20.220> hydrated<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.600> we

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
riders needs to keep very hydrated so we

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.599 
riders needs to keep very hydrated so we
have<00:00:21.930> two<00:00:22.080> bottles<00:00:22.289> one<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.160> next<00:00:23.279> one

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
have two bottles one with the next one

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.099 
have two bottles one with the next one
without<00:00:23.730> an<00:00:23.939> axe<00:00:24.090> just<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.630> riders<00:00:24.960> know

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
without an axe just so the riders know

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.679 
without an axe just so the riders know
that<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.830> X<00:00:25.980> contains<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.060> SIS

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
that the one with the X contains the SIS

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.730 
that the one with the X contains the SIS
electrolyte<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.599> product<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.810> obviously

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
electrolyte and product and obviously

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.229 
electrolyte and product and obviously
very<00:00:31.920> easy<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> body<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.820> absorb<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
very easy for the body to absorb the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.200 
very easy for the body to absorb the
energy<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.809> way<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.969> playing<00:00:35.969> one<00:00:36.090> without

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
energy that way and playing one without

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.459 
energy that way and playing one without
an<00:00:36.420> extra<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.899> water

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
an extra just water

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.850 
an extra just water
so<00:00:38.250> we've<00:00:38.370> got<00:00:38.489> two<00:00:38.670> bottles<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.180> them<00:00:39.329> and

so we've got two bottles for them and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.780 
so we've got two bottles for them and
the<00:00:40.860> riders<00:00:41.160> should<00:00:41.250> love<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> bit<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.640> comfort

then lastly we have a selection of gels

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.980 
then lastly we have a selection of gels
and<00:01:17.700> energy<00:01:18.000> bars<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.509> if<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.960> through

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and energy bars so if we just go through

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.749 
and energy bars so if we just go through
the<00:01:19.259> gels<00:01:19.500> first<00:01:19.950> we've<00:01:20.820> got<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> couple<00:01:23.610> of

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.270 
the gels first we've got so a couple of
these<00:01:23.909> regulator<00:01:24.540> tonic<00:01:24.930> gels<00:01:25.140> got<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> lemon

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
these regulator tonic gels got a lemon

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.280 
these regulator tonic gels got a lemon
and<00:01:26.400> lime<00:01:26.549> pink<00:01:27.000> grapefruit<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.140> just

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the riders like this because aids

the riders like this because aids
provide<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.970> energy<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.479> also<00:01:39.600> gives

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
provide the energy but it also gives

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.130 
provide the energy but it also gives
them<00:01:40.049> about<00:01:40.710> 75<00:01:41.189> milligrams<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.970> caffeine<00:01:42.270> so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
them about 75 milligrams of caffeine so

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.120 
them about 75 milligrams of caffeine so
when<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> race<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.740> getting<00:01:43.860> quite

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
when the race is getting quite

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.679 
when the race is getting quite
aggressive<00:01:44.640> or<00:01:44.790> towards<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.149> end<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.479> stage

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
aggressive or towards the end of a stage

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.940 
aggressive or towards the end of a stage
when<00:01:45.899> they<00:01:45.990> feel<00:01:46.140> they<00:01:46.290> really<00:01:46.409> need<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> kick

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
when they feel they really need a kick

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.760 
when they feel they really need a kick
this<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.340> an<00:01:47.820> excellent<00:01:48.149> boost<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.720> them<00:01:48.899> so

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
this is an excellent boost for them so

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.420 
this is an excellent boost for them so
we<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.220> finally<00:01:51.090> we've<00:01:51.750> got<00:01:52.079> a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
we have that finally we've got a

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.060 
we have that finally we've got a
selection<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.930> energy<00:01:54.930> bars<00:01:55.079> as<00:01:55.409> well<00:01:55.619> so

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
selection of energy bars as well so

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.980 
selection of energy bars as well so
again<00:01:56.159> provides<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.030> energy<00:01:57.180> gives<00:01:57.869> them

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
again provides the energy gives them

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.690 
again provides the energy gives them
nice<00:01:58.170> nice<00:01:58.799> tasty<00:01:59.159> flavor<00:01:59.399> we've<00:01:59.610> got

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
chocolate fudge and banana fudge like

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.380 
chocolate fudge and banana fudge like
just<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.009> know<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.759> gives<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> stomach

just you know it just gives the stomach

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.700 
just you know it just gives the stomach
something<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.810> work<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.259> well<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:04.680> a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
something to work with as well so it's a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.069 
something to work with as well so it's a
really<00:02:04.890> good<00:02:04.979> source<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.939> energy<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.540> very

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
really good source of energy and very

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.570 
really good source of energy and very
cool<00:02:07.290> for<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.619> riders<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.920> eat<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.310> that's
