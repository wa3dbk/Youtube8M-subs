00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.670 
life it's special experience as I never
forget<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.720> experience<00:02:44.020> never<00:02:44.560> ever<00:02:46.680> from

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
forget the experience never ever from

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.620 
forget the experience never ever from
the<00:02:47.860> Blitzen<00:02:48.400> backs<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.300> SLS<00:02:49.930> e-cell<00:02:51.630> it's

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
the Blitzen backs to the SLS e-cell it's

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.380 
the Blitzen backs to the SLS e-cell it's
incredible<00:02:53.380> how<00:02:53.650> much<00:02:53.890> has<00:02:54.100> changed<00:02:54.130> over<00:02:54.700> 100

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
incredible how much has changed over 100

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.380 
incredible how much has changed over 100
years<00:02:55.600> was<00:02:56.410> obviously<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:56.980> very<00:02:57.160> big<00:02:57.370> gap<00:02:57.580> but

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
years was obviously a very big gap but

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.610 
years was obviously a very big gap but
if<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.660> look<00:02:58.810> at<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.020> first<00:02:59.230> automobile

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
if you look at the first automobile

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.800 
if you look at the first automobile
that's<00:02:59.980> here<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.400> today<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.000> if<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.540> look<00:03:01.690> at

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
that's here to today and if you look at

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.710 
that's here to today and if you look at
this<00:03:01.990> mother<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.440> think<00:03:02.620> it's<00:03:03.100> showing<00:03:03.720> quite

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
this mother I think it's showing quite

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.690 
this mother I think it's showing quite
clear<00:03:04.990> where<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.470> future<00:03:05.830> goes<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.520> the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
clear where the future goes and the

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.280 
clear where the future goes and the
direction<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.180> having<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.630> clean<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.170> green

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
direction of having a clean and green

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.770 
direction of having a clean and green
car<00:03:08.740> and<00:03:09.040> I<00:03:09.459> think<00:03:09.670> that's<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.940> perfect<00:03:10.660> example

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
car and I think that's a perfect example

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.960 
car and I think that's a perfect example
to<00:03:11.260> show<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:12.000> emotion<00:03:13.350> tradition

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
to show that emotion tradition

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.520 
to show that emotion tradition
fascination<00:03:16.110> here's<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.470> next<00:03:18.000> 125<00:03:19.000> years

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.590
