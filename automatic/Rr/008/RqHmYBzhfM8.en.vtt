00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.720
 out in the league in the area and this time I'm 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.360
 here for you and bringing a bug in life 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.809
 a tutorial of a bug in the game 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.630
 injustice gods tomorrow it's good this game is 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.240
 a very addictive game so do not play and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:24.900
 Philosophical Funded But I Played Because 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:27.960
 It's cool to feel good, but listen. 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.599
 and I do not listen, I listen to nothing but I'm more 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.520
 kind of like an energy noise 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.469
 infinite face of you know when you 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.969
 is wanting to do a mission in the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.070
 multiplayer for example now 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.739
 I was carrying the delay to carry it will not 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.260
 getting worse then it will be a long time 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:56.270
 without fast recording but type 'if you guys 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:56.270
 realize this guy is all out of energy 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:11.220
 if you perceive the one good he is 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.500
 not all of them are without power 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.150
 I'll show you how to recharge this 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.049
 without needing those little letters that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.650
 for example, look at and 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.650
 When are you going to fight? 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:29.100
 there is not a state of life when you go 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.540
 fight and it seems like it's here to be 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.770
 reloaded has to have some boxes 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.200
 here is energy 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.860
 I'll show you how 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.740
 reloads it without these 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.970
 power cards without paying anything in rake 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.380
 this things 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.930
 good is only you to do so look at the time 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.969
 the second of September 11 you will go 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.890
 decrease for November 30 and August 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.659
 people remember how much I'm going to do 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.939
 This you never do for 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.630
 example if you happen not in the month of 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.600
 September 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.429
 never make up the type to after 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.319
 of a September has to do before 11 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.090
 September that if you do after a 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.680
 september you 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.860
 you will run out of emissions 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.860
 bonus missions so it will be kind of bad 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.900
 I'll never do it for you, then. 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.180
 of September 11 I clicked something 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.760
 which is very good 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.810
 there you can see that they are still 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.120
 no energy 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.890
 now let's recharge they will come back 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:40.450
 here and go back to where in August 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.799
 September 1 and September 1 means whether they can 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.310
 to see that a message appeared here in 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:50.560
 There are days when the welcome came. 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.930
 and it comes and goes and it will come to welcome 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.940
 here or not but if it does not appear it does not have 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.670
 problem is only in some cases 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.340
 devices you can see that they 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.780
 recharged all my missions of 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.500
 Bonuses are not here because I already did today 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.200
 huh 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.629
 and I waiting 75 thousand to find the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.360
 package or not okay you can see 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.480
 that he is here 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.530
 all of them all my characters 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.799
 recharged 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:26.769
 they all just do not have two are all the 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:28.900
 everybody saw it so it's expensive 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.709
 If you liked the video, let me 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.109
 liked it 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.180
 sign up for the channel were liked 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:38.290
 not to lose videos like this and 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.019
 If it was useful, share it with your friends. 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.819

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.150
