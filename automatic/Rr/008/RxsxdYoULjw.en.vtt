00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.320
 good i am dan and these blocked the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.210
 Today's tutorial is a quick course of 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.210
 how to add many to the minecraft 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.200
 let's start with a trick very very 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.510
 very simple are two batch files that 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.130
 are files of orders that are 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.330
 prepare the windows operating system 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.860
 so that it executes several things of followed 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.160
 this as you can see the first thing 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.220
 we say the app data set equal to point 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.950
 bar this the same one throws minecraft 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.290
 and another launches mc to be what we are 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.690
 saying is instead of going to percent 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.190
 app data to get the point minecraft 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.110
 that the goal is directly in that 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.980
 folder then we have minecraft 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.330
 downloaded we run it with that file and 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.730
 this what will create us is a copy 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.680
 portable from minecraft that goes to 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.629
 run from that folder I'll 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.300
 you can carry on a pendrive you can 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.180
 have several minecraft in parallel very 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.850
 simple step 2 we go to the page of 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.740
 form downloads of minecraft forge and 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.440
 we download the latest version that 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.290
 let's have installed 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.200
 because it's a patch of those that go 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.790
 inside the minecraft file or 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.780
 is a mouse that modifies files 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.880
 from inside the minecraft then the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.680
 download page hits us for a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.720
 page then advertising extras 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.570
 at this point we already have spear 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.200
 minecraft we close it you see that the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.200
 version number 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.649
 we open the mc to cher and see what's coming 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.299
 there some mc mods for cher serbia for 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.640
 be able to use higher resolution textures 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.590
 with minecraft what people do not give 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.420
 account is that mc to cher actually 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.039
 is a mod manager that brings 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.409
 incorporated that mode for textures 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.710
 great if we give to add a modes with 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.009
 the arrow with the button of plus 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.750
 appears to look for many in 146 that has 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.520
 past good we have created the folder 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.099
 mods that's where Jorge would look for the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.610
 mods but inside that folder has 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.870
 created one that is called 146 or the number 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.120
 of the version that we are using there 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.569
 we would have to put the mods that go 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.010
 to go inside the minecraft point jar 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.819
 then we put it there we select it 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.560
 we give ok and here comes the funny thing 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.840
 mc patches will add the files 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.500
 inside the minecraft point hard but not 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.049
 the goal will be loaded into the metadata 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.190
 link that folder that we are all told 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.640
 we must erase when we install in 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.140
 reality regenerates it with correct data 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.630
 This allows us to take this 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.700
 copy of main transportable use 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.830
 quietly and if for a casual 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.150
 breaks files will appear one 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.280
 black screen that appeared when 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.069
 we install bad mood 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.330
 then we have gotten forge we go back to 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.030
 throw 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.550
 this first screen that comes out and cfm him 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.200
 is the forgemos loader with which is already 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.020
 a hint that it was properly installed 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.240
 the forge we let him charge him 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.330
 we let it start and in the part of 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.130
 down to the left instead of leaving one 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.900
 intro adversity I do not know what is going to 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.300
 Appear 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.410
 mons community park version tal forge 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.690
 version module 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.670
 minecraft forge version 43 more 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.320
 downloaded if you enter the section 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.080
 mods you can see that he is pleased 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.930
 both the mac mini craft power pack as 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.760
 jorge as minecraft forge you are already 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.980
 ready to install mods from 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.590
 here are three types of mods those that go 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.970
 to go inside the minecraft point hard that 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.740
 it is done exactly as we have 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.180
 made with forge mods that add 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.860
 new things to the game that are going to go 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.780
 copied in the mods folder and those that 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.690
 they replace things from the core of minecraft 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.780
 at runtime one of these 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.450
 it's not in out and temps it replaces everything 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.560
 what is the inventory interface for 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.610
 can add a list of recipes 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.260
 infrastructure to cheat in 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.860
 games without the player or if you are 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.830
 administrator 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.130
 I do not know a few extra utilities 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.140
 we see then to install it basically 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.970
 we go to the download page and we 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.400
 says it's split into two pieces 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.620
 first installs forge and then it 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.870
 install co de chequenco rebounded hard that 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.780
 it's a generic library and then it 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.360
 install the file of noten out and cens 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.910
 both the bookstore and we do not have to go to 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.700
 the file the core mods directory 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.740
 so 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.740
 we unloaded both 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.750
 and inside the minecraft folder we have 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.180
 have a core match right to it 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.229
 height that we have the mod we drop 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.229
 there the two files 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.530
 and it is already installed to have no items 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.389
 this system has a very advantage 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.919
 large with the old system update 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.210
 A monk is as simple as erasing the 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.569
 old file and back of the new file 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.370
 If we are masters bone the chicken core 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:10.190
 and we do not have installed 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.650
 good for what it serves us we do not have good 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.630
 apart from to have a list of 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.520
 all objects and recipes if you enter 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.949
 in options 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.470
 you have an option that says blog of 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:24.260
 settings this what it's for 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.870
 good is used to generate a file in 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.720
 the one that leaves a list with all the 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.360
 beings used by both blocks that 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.970
 add the mods as for objects that 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.100
 add the mods in such a way that if 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.449
 let's add a new way we know what 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.449
 ideas are free and which are not 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:49.040
 there we have an example we are seeing 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:52.640
 there holes they say in blogs 16 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.110
 all that are above 4.096 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.260
 are and from this can be used to 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.970
 objects below 4,096 can be 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.210
 used both by objects and by 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.920
 blocks and if they are blocks that are going to be 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.870
 used in the terrain generator by 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.909
 example trunks of new trees have 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.080
 to be below 256 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:13.599
 knowing these things and having this 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.389
 file if at the time of installing one 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:19.240
 you have conflict with them and from another 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:22.419
 you just have to look at a gap that 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.990
 be free we configure it in the box that 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:27.330
 It gives problems 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.909
 and the two would work much at once 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:34.289
 with this and a little patience you can 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:36.590
 install 70 80 90 more quietly and 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.389
 everything would behave in love and company 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.449
 perfectly at the end of the day for that 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:44.660
 forge was designed 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:48.140
 in short summarizing 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:51.170
 we have seen two files to make a 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.990
 portable version of minecraft we have 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:56.870
 seen how the forge is installed to the 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.400
 fast way in a client we have seen 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.760
 how it is installed 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.770
 many of the three types that can be 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.750
 those that replace core files 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.490
 those who use run and those who 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.710
 they use bots 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.680
 for the next tutorial how to install 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.420
 mods with forge on a server and os 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.560
 I guarantee it's going to be a tutorial 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.180
 express 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.310
 I think it lasts less than a minute 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.310
 including the intro see you
