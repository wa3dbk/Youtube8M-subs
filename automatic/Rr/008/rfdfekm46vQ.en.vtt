00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.099
 how are you gonna me it's going super g a 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.390
 fucking potatoes and we end up 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.340
 today for a new small 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.930
 video to talk about the hidden logos that 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.610
 you can find in everyone's life 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.830
 the days so before attacking this 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.120
 little video I just wanted to tell you 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.620
 that I do not know at all what you 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.079
 will have kids as gameplay I think 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.909
 that will be the case the fifa offer more 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.409
 of the call of I think and I would like that 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.019
 you put in comments if you 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.730
 prefer that I put you gameplay 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.030
 like that too I make any form of 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.620
 blog that you see my mouth there and 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.480
 if you prefer in the form of gameplay 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.010
 I will ask if there are people who 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.329
 have good big gameplay or if they 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.940
 know where I can find it 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.109
 if they can mle me in the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.000
 comments or bullshit like that 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.640
 for me to have good gameplay when 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.440
 even rather than mine do so 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.330
 I'll stop talking and we'll attack 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.070
 right away with the first logo so 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.420
 before attacking with the first logo I 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.369
 just wanted to make you a little 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.289
 parenthesis telling you that I'm going 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.240
 you put the logos a bit to the advanced 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.100
 like that you can search at your 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.880
 turn before I reveal the secret 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.799
 of this lot 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.200
 what is there to hide go to from 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.729
 next so for this first logo we will 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.560
 attack with that of toblerone 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.570
 toblerone this chocolate brand 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.579
 of Swiss origin and if you look 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.130
 well in the background on the mountain 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.810
 you can distinguish a bear so 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.299
 his chocolates was created in the city 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.890
 de berne which is the city of luxury and 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.869
 suddenly they said like why in 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.170
 the mark does not hide the five letters 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.750
 of the city of Bern the be1 rn2 as 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.130
 you see in the picture 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.439
 go on we go right away with the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.479
 son ex finexsi logo is a 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.520
 parcel transport company and to 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.350
 first sight this logo is nothing very 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.360
 shocking or not very particular 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.430
 except that if we look closer we 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.110
 could see an arrow between them 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.179
 last two letters of the logo car 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.560
 this company wanted to insist on the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.140
 speed of deliveries 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.600
 and for this third legault it will be the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.579
 logo of the Tour de France then for this 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.140
 logo he'll have to find you a lot 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.890
 of concentration because it is very 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.320
 difficult to see 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.450
 this is a cyclist on bike like 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.040
 you see it now so why 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.450
 and cyclists on a bike simply 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.860
 you will understand because the turn of 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.400
 France is a big competition of 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.769
 cycling 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.560
 and we follow up with the logo of carrefour 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.879
 crossroads which is the famous company 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.950
 of hypermarkets that everyone should 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.290
 know so you probably have all 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.640
 already seen this logo is certain we 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.939
 will see numbers and faster than 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.560
 other 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.150
 so at first glance there is nothing 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.239
 very special except for two arrows that 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.370
 are opposed one could think of a 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.340
 crossroads simply us slow it 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.310
 but if we look closer we 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.290
 can see that there is a great c that 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.440
 represents the first letter of this 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.930
 famous brand and in fifth place 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.170
 this is the logo of anvin a company 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.700
 French which is the galleries lafayette 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.700
 so through what they really 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.870
 wanted to show the whole world that this 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.700
 company was a company 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.829
 French and how are you going to tell me 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.329
 simply by drawing it does not turn 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.230
 eiffel with two teas from the pier 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.480
 the back and here we come already the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.370
 half of this episode had the sixth 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.459
 logo which is that of amazon 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.079
 so on this logo which is very simple we 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.879
 can see just a smile 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.340
 which is drawn by an arrow but one 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.349
 also finds that the letters wind of 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.879
 the letter has to the letter z 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.040
 which shows that we can 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.199
 make everything find on this site like the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.470
 proves what fat you are looking for and you 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:48.720
 find everything from a to z 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.760
 and now we're in 7th place 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.459
 talk about a TV channel 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.900
 because it is the logo of the nbc news which 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.849
 is super well done in montrouge on 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.010
 will find very pretty with her six 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.199
 colors that represents during the 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.760
 six specialties of this chain and for 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.310
 do not just put six colors 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.019
 they added a little beak so if I 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.680
 I'm not mistaken it's about the color 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.500
 violet 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.260
 so we can think of a peacock that makes 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.819
 the euro is for the next logo this will be 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.829
 a brand of clothes in mademoiselle 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.810
 this mark and for you it's the 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.609
 mark nor human why I put you 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.500
 alone or simply because one can read 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.479
 the name of the mark at the place as at 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.370
 backwards so I found them very well 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.599
 thought i would put it on your side 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.159
 so that you can turn your 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.289
 head to show you that I'm lying to you 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.190
 not because if I turn you the picture everything 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.330
 simply you will not see any 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.699
 difference 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.529
 and for this logo we will go back to 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.000
 us with a brand that I do not 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:39.790
 did not know before so I do not know 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.400
 not if you 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.870
 know her if you mark her cisco who 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.020
 is a computer company 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.400
 California so what 's easier 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.590
 than take the last two 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.050
 syllables of city of san francisco 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.000
 to make the name of his company but 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.100
 again if there were only that it would be 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.800
 super simple but look small 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.780
 the little stems that has above all 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.300
 it just represents the golden gate 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.610
 the famous red bridge 2 san francisco 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.620
 now swimming craze because he 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.390
 This is the brand you know 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.640
 probably all that is baskin 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.980
 robbins which is a brand of the famous 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.630
 glacier who managed in his logo to 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.240
 put the number of fragrances he 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.970
 product and yes that's fine 31 the number 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.110
 is written in pink at the very beginning and he 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:28.090
 form the b heller this is for this tenth 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.430
 water on the other hand I'm sorry I'm going 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.100
 ask you for a minute of silence for 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.500
 the person who created this logo because it's 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.720
 the one of tgv idea super pretty to 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.210
 the place that gives great but 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.220
 look what gives backwards that 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.620
 will simply give a snail 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.020
 so I found it quite weird when 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.750
 even on the part of tgv who are supposed 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.480
 to be high speed trains from 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.420
 fuck stop us I do not 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.430
 understood and that's it to finish this little 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.220
 video I just wanted to finish 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.250
 with a sports logo it will be the 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:06.490
 roland garros logo then a priori 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.260
 nothing special except 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.060
 the orange that could say we could 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.700
 to say yeah that's clay and 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.590
 leblanc who forms the lines on 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.790
 could the same be said yeah that's the 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.380
 lines of the tennis court but if we 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.330
 look at the purest create closer 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.460
 pardon look in blue simply 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.500
 we can see a player who plays 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.050
 tennis and that is in action so 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.900
 I think it makes this logo hyper hyper hyper 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.430
 do well and that's already the end of 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.230
 this little video 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.870
 so I hope you have it that does 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.120
 but hey I said to myself 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.190
 you can not make a video about 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.480
 logos not to mention the most famous logo 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.100
 to the world which is that of coca cola so 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.600
 if we return this logo a lot 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.550
 must know him but there are some 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.800
 many who have not seen the famous 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.840
 legend hours we'll say say it's 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.970
 a white person spitting on 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.190
 a black person but I do not want 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.080
 talk about this topic in that sense in 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.610
 this video because it brings too much 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.380
 problems a lot would say racism is 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.060
 she so I return you all 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.250
 just the logo I'm sorry for 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.140
 the picture is not find anything else from 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.500
 something better to be able to 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.410
 to see her 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.410
 so I hope you'll see it and that 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.180
 you will not mind, so here we go 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.740
 it's the end of this video 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.180
 I hope you have enjoyed it because I 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.320
 was given a lot of trouble it took me 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.140
 a lot of time making this video 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.970
 whether it's a real qu with my voice or 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.070
 just look at the logos at 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.560
 all take them to go get
