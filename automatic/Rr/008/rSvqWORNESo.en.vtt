00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello you love the potatoes and the 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.200
 Mangold I harvested yesterday though 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.360
 naturally processed and 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.400
 That's why we're going to make mine today 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.750
 gold potatoes the recipe i have 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.730
 found last year 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.870
 i had no idea what to look for 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.270
 can make mangold 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.400
 and that's very popular with us 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.470
 We like to do it again and again and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.410
 is one of the main recipe with me 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.920
 processed my mangold 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.920
 Then let's get started 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.460
 the quantities and the recipe 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.119
 I write to you again in the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.250
 infobox 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.660
 what I'm cooking here now 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.660
 for about two to three persons 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.550
 we need potatoes for that, I suppose 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.020
 my little one might be a bit out of the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.150
 I usually do garden 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.430
 salt potatoes out so peel and in 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.320
 salt water but cook it this way now 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.910
 beautiful new I'll simply in a 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.350
 cook the shell and then with the peel 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:59.920
 then eat mangold back whole bunch 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.609
 olive oil 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.609
 salt pepper 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.810
 garlic 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.130
 that was it and off you go first and foremost 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.080
 we need the potatoes 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.670
 I make a pressure cooker all the way 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.590
 I have smaller potatoes 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.030
 cut with it the potatoes 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.009
 even then a very small one 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.229
 potatoes were easy 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.450
 potatoes to the pot water on it salt 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.970
 lid on it and then take it 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.220
 you the mangold I cut the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.720
 stile of chard like we are out 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.530
 they are always too hard and they taste good too 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.500
 very intensive 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.780
 you can silence in principle then 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.670
 In addition, cook asparagus simply 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.979
 cook or with ham and develop 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.060
 I spread and spread cheese over it 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.810
 Never tried before maybe 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.500
 also do it 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.759
 you simply cut the leaves 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.619
 stripes do not just have to be thin 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.619
 just strip it 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.469
 and then you take those 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.149
 cloves of garlic i have a paper now 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.530
 the whole day here cutting the edge 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.469
 dice if we have more garlic 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.060
 you want to have taste and want 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:12.390
 then help you in a pan in 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:15.489
 olive oil and should then in the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:20.650
 garlic together with the one gold 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:23.799
 to dusty's field is waiting until the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.450
 potatoes are cooked as far as the 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.250
 I could already leave my top 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.239
 because you need her right now 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.239
 is very fast 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.459
 then he gives the potatoes and 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.819
 Leave it for a few minutes 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.170
 it does not really have to roast 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.239
 just braise 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.890
 The whole thing should not be dry though 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.170
 it looks dry then it still takes 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.870
 take a sip of olive oil and let the 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.730
 above 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.730
 so that everything is convincingly brilliant 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.569
 it was still tasty with salt and pepper 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.110
 The potatoes absorb a lot 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.900
 so save and not too much with it and 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.849
 then it is already finished very 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.410
 Delicious recipe the man wanted to fit 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.720
 perfect with the potatoes 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.790
 You can eat it well as a side dish 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.370
 often do it as well 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.790
 Main course is very fast and is 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.160
 delicious 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.720
