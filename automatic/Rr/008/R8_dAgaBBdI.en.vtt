00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
side of this component which makes it

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.130 
side of this component which makes it
great<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.060> isolating<00:01:09.659> parts<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.020> our

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
great for isolating parts of our

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140 
great for isolating parts of our
projects<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.340> case<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.790> want<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.060> isolate

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
projects in this case we want to isolate

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.690 
projects in this case we want to isolate
the<00:01:12.420> Flash's<00:01:12.930> voltage<00:01:13.290> from<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> Arduino<00:01:13.799> so

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the Flash's voltage from the Arduino so

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.310 
the Flash's voltage from the Arduino so
now<00:01:14.850> let's<00:01:15.060> use<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.330> opto<00:01:15.659> isolator<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
now let's use the opto isolator to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.109 
now let's use the opto isolator to
trigger<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> flash<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:17.700> are<00:01:17.880> many

different types of flash connectors but

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.440 
different types of flash connectors but
most<00:01:20.159> flashes<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.759> these<00:01:21.000> hotshoe

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
most flashes have these hotshoe

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.880 
most flashes have these hotshoe

camera<00:02:55.860> shutter<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.340> going<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:56.640> have<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.880> be

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
camera shutter is going to have to be

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.790 
camera shutter is going to have to be
opened<00:02:57.300> before<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.840> flash<00:02:58.080> fires<00:02:58.380> because

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
opened before the flash fires because

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.530 
opened before the flash fires because
the<00:02:58.920> shutter<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.190> not<00:02:59.459> fast<00:02:59.790> enough<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.239> open

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
the shutter is not fast enough to open

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.750 
the shutter is not fast enough to open
to<00:03:00.630> catch<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.989> action<00:03:01.370> therefore<00:03:02.370> we<00:03:02.489> have<00:03:02.640> to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
to catch the action therefore we have to

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.250 
to catch the action therefore we have to
work<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.090> dark<00:03:03.360> room<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:03.780> have<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.020> shutter

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
work in a dark room and have the shutter

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.840 
work in a dark room and have the shutter
already<00:03:04.800> open<00:03:05.160> when<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.370> balloon<00:03:05.610> pops

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
already open when the balloon pops

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.760 
already open when the balloon pops
either<00:03:06.209> by<00:03:06.390> setting<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.780> long<00:03:06.989> exposure<00:03:07.410> time

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
either by setting a long exposure time

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.100 
either by setting a long exposure time
we're<00:03:07.950> using<00:03:08.160> our<00:03:08.340> cameras<00:03:08.760> bulb<00:03:09.000> mode<00:03:09.330> let's

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
we're using our cameras bulb mode let's

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.900 
we're using our cameras bulb mode let's
put<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.350> whole<00:03:10.500> rig<00:03:10.739> together<00:03:11.040> now<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.489> have<00:03:11.790> my

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
put the whole rig together now I have my

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.699 
put the whole rig together now I have my
camera<00:03:12.239> set<00:03:12.420> up<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.660> tripod<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.380> I've<00:03:13.470> set

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
camera set up on a tripod and I've set

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.050 
camera set up on a tripod and I've set
the<00:03:13.800> aperture<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.489> camera<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.880> make<00:03:15.000> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
the aperture to the camera to make the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.640 
the aperture to the camera to make the
appropriate<00:03:15.330> exposure<00:03:15.870> based<00:03:16.110> on<00:03:16.320> our<00:03:16.440> flash

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
appropriate exposure based on our flash

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.229 
appropriate exposure based on our flash
output<00:03:16.920> you'll<00:03:17.519> want<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.820> set<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.030> flash

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
output you'll want to set the flash

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.910 
output you'll want to set the flash
output<00:03:18.480> as<00:03:18.840> low<00:03:18.989> as<00:03:19.140> possible<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.860> is

output as low as possible this is
because<00:03:20.250> with<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.459> flash<00:03:20.670> such<00:03:20.910> as<00:03:21.030> this<00:03:21.180> one

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
because with a flash such as this one

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.940 
because with a flash such as this one
the<00:03:21.510> flash<00:03:21.720> output<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:22.260> mainly<00:03:22.410> controlled<00:03:22.739> by

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
the flash output is mainly controlled by

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.979 
the flash output is mainly controlled by
the<00:03:23.010> duration<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.730> flash<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.630> lower<00:03:24.810> the

the duration of the flash the lower the
flash<00:03:25.200> output<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.799> less<00:03:25.950> time<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.340> bulb<00:03:26.580> is

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
flash output the less time the bulb is

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.789 
flash output the less time the bulb is
illuminated<00:03:27.570> since<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.110> pop<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.560> balloon

illuminated since the pop of a balloon
is<00:03:29.010> very<00:03:29.190> fast<00:03:29.519> we<00:03:29.730> need<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.910> quick<00:03:30.150> burst<00:03:30.360> of

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
is very fast we need a quick burst of

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.110 
is very fast we need a quick burst of
light<00:03:30.780> in<00:03:30.989> order<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.440> reduce<00:03:31.560> motion<00:03:31.890> blur<00:03:32.250> so

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
light in order to reduce motion blur so

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.460 
light in order to reduce motion blur so
you<00:03:33.180> don't<00:03:33.360> need<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.660> use<00:03:33.780> an<00:03:33.900> Arduino<00:03:34.230> for

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
you don't need to use an Arduino for

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.020 
you don't need to use an Arduino for
such<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.680> simple<00:03:34.950> circuit<00:03:35.459> but<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.670> wanted<00:03:35.970> to

open the camera shutter after the camera
shutters<00:03:57.209> open<00:03:57.420> it'll<00:03:57.780> listen<00:03:58.080> for<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.290> pop

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
shutters open it'll listen for the pop

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.020 
shutters open it'll listen for the pop
when<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.830> hears<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.100> pop<00:03:59.370> it'll<00:03:59.580> fire<00:03:59.850> the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
when it hears the pop it'll fire the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.880 
when it hears the pop it'll fire the
flash<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.540> then<00:04:00.930> close<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.320> camera<00:04:01.560> shutter

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
and then turn the lights back on let's

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.160 
and then turn the lights back on let's
see<00:04:04.410> if<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:04.620> works<00:04:04.799> here<00:04:05.100> we<00:04:05.190> go

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.479 

let's<00:04:12.170> see<00:04:12.319> how<00:04:12.439> that<00:04:12.500> looks<00:04:12.950> not<00:04:13.549> bad

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
let's see how that looks not bad

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.490 
let's see how that looks not bad
so<00:04:16.489> now<00:04:16.759> as<00:04:17.000> promised<00:04:17.479> I<00:04:17.630> have<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.989> wineglass

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
so now as promised I have the wineglass

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.740 
so now as promised I have the wineglass
and<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.919> hammer<00:04:19.130> let's<00:04:19.579> see<00:04:19.789> how<00:04:19.880> this<00:04:20.030> looks

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.469 

work<00:04:26.750> pretty<00:04:26.930> well<00:04:28.000> there's<00:04:29.000> so<00:04:29.090> much<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.330> can

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
work pretty well there's so much you can

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.029 
work pretty well there's so much you can
do<00:04:29.570> with<00:04:29.690> high-speed<00:04:29.870> photography<00:04:30.229> and<00:04:30.889> all

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
do with high-speed photography and all

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.650 
do with high-speed photography and all
the<00:04:31.130> different<00:04:31.430> types<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:31.729> sensors<00:04:32.030> if<00:04:32.270> you're
