is and it isn't a goal it's a dream so

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.400 
is and it isn't a goal it's a dream so
start<00:00:40.239> writing<00:00:40.480> it<00:00:40.690> down<00:00:40.870> then<00:00:41.140> you<00:00:41.230> all<00:00:41.379> have

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
start writing it down then you all have

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.799 
start writing it down then you all have
some<00:00:41.890> backup<00:00:42.190> position<00:00:42.610> some<00:00:43.269> fallback

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
some backup position some fallback

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.709 
some backup position some fallback
there's<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.790> smaller<00:00:45.790> outcome<00:00:46.360> that<00:00:46.540> you'll

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
there's a smaller outcome that you'll

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.430 
there's a smaller outcome that you'll
accept<00:00:47.200> then<00:00:48.190> what<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:48.460> game<00:00:48.610> and<00:00:49.440> that's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
accept then what the game and that's

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.850 
accept then what the game and that's
what<00:00:50.590> the<00:00:50.770> Bears<00:00:51.010> did<00:00:52.410> except<00:00:53.410> a<00:00:53.530> smaller

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
outcome for no good reason it's a lack

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.470
