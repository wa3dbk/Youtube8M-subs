00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 now from mike to call your we are going to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.080
 land 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.730
 with the nokia dog and whose hands are 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.759
 advancing nothing once more in kraft 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.240
 good to all we are minecraft time and 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.070
 today we are here in the new episode 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.769
 Okay today we are going to teach how to do 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.130
 What we teach today is male today 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.320
 let's teach since it was my idea how 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.430
 to have 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.100
 x-rays in minecraft 1.6 since the 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.200
 old versions also serve and that 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.720
 we wanted them three and it still serves and 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.210
 It effectively serves so good 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.600
 what are the utilities sir male 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.769
 Mira is very practical for survival and 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.910
 that allows you to see all the caves 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.910
 find the allen portal 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.560
 half 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.450
 but partners the only bad thing is that 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.870
 you need blanton and for that you need to go 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.930
 to hell 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.420
 but well we need obsidian too 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.770
 clear radio 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.190
 and to chop the obsidian that 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.750
 we need to fix good then first 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.550
 we have to do all the hard work and 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.260
 then we will have the country work the 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.640
 game that we could find the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.720
 zape portalet good we started with 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.270
 your tutorial as follows 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.439
 we finished a tunnel below and 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.380
 of 3 more or less and also good we leave 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.770
 spaces there are elections there we go to 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.149
 put mister over and let's put we're going to 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.010
 be there 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.350
 although they are sticky homes 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.230
 and we are going to put a lever next to the 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.270
 ballet forward of the piston we are going to 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.270
 expect someone to want to do something 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.159
 time set arrived 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.950
 mom is worth good we put blogs are 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.619
 in front of dell streak seen 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.100
 ok when we have your taste 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.140
 have our mini cave lit I do not know 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.310
 If your lever is okay we 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.330
 we approach our planet 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.610
 we activate it in the link there, it's good and 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.610
 good we look back since 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.350
 wait for them to change the distance rule 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.770
 because if it is born it is not going to look very messy 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.900
 the most evil 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.900
 this is a book 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.820
 even if it's a few minutes for more than 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.460
 go very messy because it's worth it 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.740
 because if you can not observe things 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:50.580
 If you want to make this cave with more 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:56.190
 Glamor can watch with a button 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:58.830
 well this is this is milk wow 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.630
 we found coal on the right if 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:08.130
 can not see us out of the sun 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:08.700
 there's a lot of lava too much lava and diamond 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.560
 there is 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.530
 diamond pin there is diamond 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.530
 there is a diamond but 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.790
 I think that more they have been here I create a sword 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.000
 I put the end you can see if 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.000
 let's try 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.500
 there's diamond up there right it's very 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.500
 cash 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.510
 extreme so you can observe better 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.080
 wow maybe we can be the milk of 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.710
 this video is worth I think it will go to 5 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.960
 fps decent decent good we hope that 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.580
 this goes well and that there is not very empty 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.120
 dollars well we started the mall as 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.120
 you can see 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.720
 and he knew both Paul Anka 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:11.140
 but good if you do not know if we are 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.140
 guiding everything harry we were going all 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.970
 and well we are back already we are 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.960
 solving your technical problems 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:27.789
 that I compose there is so much distance 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.789
 - fps I do not know what thing 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.320
 exact then putting between a 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.350
 distance form and good 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.530
 we can see, I think we can 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:46.090
 observe almost everyone from minecraft 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:46.090
 too bad now it is here 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.860
 and well you see the tunnels more than before 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.139
 the good diamonds back are but 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:05.270
 now we can look further and there 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:06.919
 I can see lapis lazuli I think this is 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.419
 a right where I'm puncturing there's a 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.289
 answered and there I will raise so that 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.920
 you see it right below the mouse by the 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.860
 bag 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:21.540
 obviously and here is that there is more 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.280
 redstone can be seen good this 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.940
 I think it was all for today no longer 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.940
 we have much more to say this this 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.830
 It has been everything we had planned 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.800
