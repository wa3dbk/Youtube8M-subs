I'll be using tamia putty which is the
technique<00:01:40.380> I'm<00:01:40.470> familiar<00:01:40.680> with<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.220> baking

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
technique I'm familiar with and baking

would<00:01:44.009> be<00:01:44.100> my<00:01:44.250> first<00:01:44.490> time<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.049> same

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
would be my first time this is the same

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.520 
would be my first time this is the same
line<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.280> I'll<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.670> filling<00:01:48.200> foot<00:01:49.200> number

one<00:01:50.899> more<00:01:51.899> or<00:01:52.049> less<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.409> try<00:01:52.890> putting<00:01:53.220> superglue

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
one more or less I try putting superglue

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.800 
one more or less I try putting superglue
down<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.329> mixing<00:01:54.840> baking<00:01:55.200> soda<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.890> top<00:01:56.250> it

down and mixing baking soda on top it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.469 
down and mixing baking soda on top it
instantly<00:01:57.810> failed<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.729> got<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.880> sad<00:02:00.119> chip

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
instantly failed I got this sad chip

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.969 
instantly failed I got this sad chip
like<00:02:00.780> shape

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
like shape

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.249 
like shape
and<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.939> second<00:02:04.240> experiment<00:02:04.810> was<00:02:04.930> putting

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
and the second experiment was putting

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.020 
and the second experiment was putting
superglue<00:02:05.799> on<00:02:05.950> top<00:02:06.219> of<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.430> baking<00:02:06.789> soda

superglue on top of the baking soda

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.160 
superglue on top of the baking soda
which<00:02:07.299> also<00:02:07.509> failed

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
which also failed

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.229 
which also failed
I<00:02:08.319> remember<00:02:09.039> reading<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:09.489> technique<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:10.060> long

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
I remember reading this technique a long

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.089 
I remember reading this technique a long
time<00:02:10.479> ago<00:02:10.720> in<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.899> modeling<00:02:11.230> magazine<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.040> it

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
time ago in the modeling magazine and it

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.710 
time ago in the modeling magazine and it
wasn't<00:02:12.280> very<00:02:12.430> clear<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.120> how<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:13.300> carry<00:02:13.629> it

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
wasn't very clear and how to carry it

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.800 
wasn't very clear and how to carry it
out<00:02:14.310> my<00:02:15.310> last<00:02:15.670> result<00:02:16.060> was<00:02:16.300> putting<00:02:16.660> the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
out my last result was putting the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.320 
out my last result was putting the
superglue<00:02:17.290> onto<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.010> actual<00:02:18.160> crack<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:19.030> the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
superglue onto the actual crack of the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.259 
superglue onto the actual crack of the
piece<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:19.959> sprinkling<00:02:20.739> baking<00:02:21.220> soda<00:02:21.489> onto<00:02:22.120> it

piece and sprinkling baking soda onto it

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.290 
piece and sprinkling baking soda onto it
this<00:02:23.260> proved<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.830> be<00:02:23.920> very<00:02:24.280> successful<00:02:24.430> in

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
this proved to be very successful in

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.300 
this proved to be very successful in
hardening<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.050> superglue<00:02:26.530> immediately

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
hardening the superglue immediately

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.500

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
I excited and this is the finish results

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.009 
I excited and this is the finish results
you<00:03:12.790> can<00:03:12.970> barely<00:03:13.360> see<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.689> louver<00:03:13.870> and

puddy<00:03:18.909> a<00:03:19.150> different<00:03:19.689> technique<00:03:20.049> all<00:03:20.260> together

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
puddy a different technique all together

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.649 
puddy a different technique all together
this<00:03:20.890> is<00:03:21.069> what<00:03:21.189> I<00:03:21.250> use<00:03:21.579> on<00:03:21.730> all<00:03:21.790> my<00:03:22.030> models<00:03:22.510> and

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659 
this is what I use on all my models and

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.869 
this is what I use on all my models and
very<00:03:22.840> familiar<00:03:23.049> more<00:03:24.040> or<00:03:24.159> less<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.519> squeeze<00:03:24.849> a

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
very familiar more or less you squeeze a

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.780 
very familiar more or less you squeeze a
little<00:03:25.090> this<00:03:25.269> patty<00:03:25.569> out<00:03:25.659> and<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.790> plaster

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
little this patty out and you plaster

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.759 
little this patty out and you plaster
across<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.359> seam<00:03:28.599> all<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:28.900> way<00:03:29.140> around<00:03:29.439> and

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
across the seam all the way around and

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.550 
across the seam all the way around and
use<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.489> cotton<00:03:30.819> bud<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.450> flatten<00:03:32.140> it<00:03:32.200> as<00:03:32.349> much

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
use a cotton bud to flatten it as much

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.300 
use a cotton bud to flatten it as much
as<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:32.769> can

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
as you can

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.970 
as you can
I<00:03:33.390> may<00:03:34.390> have<00:03:34.450> explained<00:03:34.959> before<00:03:35.079> this<00:03:35.769> is<00:03:35.950> a

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
I may have explained before this is a

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.190 
I may have explained before this is a
solvent-based<00:03:36.519> patty<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.450> shrink<00:03:37.870> so<00:03:38.140> you

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
solvent-based patty and shrink so you

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.050 
solvent-based patty and shrink so you
try<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.709> put<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:38.950> bit<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.280> an<00:03:39.400> excess<00:03:39.849> or

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
try to put a bit of an excess or

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.270 
try to put a bit of an excess or
otherwise<00:03:40.450> it<00:03:40.930> will<00:03:41.260> sink<00:03:41.620> into<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.980> crack

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
otherwise it will sink into the crack

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.610 
otherwise it will sink into the crack
and<00:03:42.519> you'll<00:03:42.639> have<00:03:42.819> to<00:03:43.060> party<00:03:44.049> at<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.260> second

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
and you'll have to party at a second

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.509 
and you'll have to party at a second
time<00:03:44.799> after<00:03:45.629> priming<00:03:49.139> this<00:03:50.340> technique<00:03:51.340> is

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.300 
time after priming this technique is
