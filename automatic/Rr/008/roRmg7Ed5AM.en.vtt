00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
rip the fan duct off and you put an 80

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.950 
rip the fan duct off and you put an 80
millimeter<00:02:24.520> fan<00:02:24.760> right<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.300> there<00:02:25.510> now<00:02:25.690> on<00:02:25.840> top

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
millimeter fan right on there now on top

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.200 
millimeter fan right on there now on top
of<00:02:26.020> that<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.380> have<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.530> vga<00:02:26.710> cooler<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:28.000> this<00:02:28.120> is

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
of that you have a vga cooler so this is

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.960 
of that you have a vga cooler so this is
a<00:02:28.240> slot<00:02:28.510> for<00:02:28.780> event<00:02:29.200> for<00:02:29.500> your<00:02:29.590> vga<00:02:29.860> cards<00:02:30.250> so

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
a slot for event for your vga cards so

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.610 
a slot for event for your vga cards so
you<00:02:31.000> can<00:02:31.450> put<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.600> fan<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.960> blow<00:02:32.080> air<00:02:32.320> on<00:02:32.470> your

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
you can put a fan to blow air on your

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.220 
you can put a fan to blow air on your
vga<00:02:33.400> s2<00:02:33.700> through<00:02:34.000> here<00:02:34.210> if<00:02:34.360> you'd<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:34.540> so

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
vga s2 through here if you'd like so

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.390 
vga s2 through here if you'd like so
that's<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.650> first<00:02:35.800> thing<00:02:35.920> let's<00:02:36.040> start<00:02:36.340> off
