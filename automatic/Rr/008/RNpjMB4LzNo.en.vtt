you<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.710> plug<00:01:46.920> them<00:01:47.070> into<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.369> figures

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you have to plug them into the figures

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
you have to plug them into the figures
back<00:01:47.729> but<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:48.899> here<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.290> sort<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.590> have
