and if you look at the state of the game
a<00:00:13.980> week<00:00:14.219> ago<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:16.350> most<00:00:16.560> efficient<00:00:16.980> way<00:00:17.039> to

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
a week ago the most efficient way to

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.070 
a week ago the most efficient way to
farm<00:00:17.430> legendary<00:00:17.880> items<00:00:18.240> was<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.660> do<00:00:18.810> chess

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
farm legendary items was to do chess

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.080 
farm legendary items was to do chess
runs<00:00:19.350> or<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.770> do<00:00:19.920> repeatable<00:00:20.490> purple<00:00:20.880> mobs

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
runs or to do repeatable purple mobs

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.370 
runs or to do repeatable purple mobs
like<00:00:21.330> mango<00:00:21.689> ma<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:23.750> this<00:00:24.750> video<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.230> audio

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
like mango ma and this video the audio

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.140 
like mango ma and this video the audio
they<00:00:25.710> had<00:00:25.830> recorded<00:00:26.160> was<00:00:26.460> basically<00:00:26.820> about

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
they had recorded was basically about

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.029 
they had recorded was basically about
the<00:00:27.420> game<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.109> state<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> game<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.890> how

the game the state of the game and how

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.700 
the game the state of the game and how
the<00:00:29.760> reward<00:00:30.150> system<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.720> diablo<00:00:31.140> 3<00:00:31.170> does<00:00:31.679> not

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the reward system in diablo 3 does not

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.420 
the reward system in diablo 3 does not
properly<00:00:32.520> scale<00:00:33.200> to<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.440> difficulty<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
properly scale to the difficulty of the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.729 
properly scale to the difficulty of the
game<00:00:35.460> as<00:00:35.940> well<00:00:36.149> as<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.510> difficulty<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
game as well as the difficulty of the

game as well as the difficulty of the
task<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.879> example<00:00:39.410> chess<00:00:40.410> runs<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.920> not

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
task for example chess runs do not

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.630 
task for example chess runs do not
require<00:00:41.370> very<00:00:41.610> much<00:00:41.670> scale<00:00:42.030> or<00:00:42.329> gear<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:43.170> they

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
require very much scale or gear but they

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
require very much scale or gear but they
the<00:00:44.640> reward<00:00:44.969> scale<00:00:45.480> with<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.930> difficulty

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the reward scale with the difficulty

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.680 
the reward scale with the difficulty
however<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.309> difficulty<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.059> task<00:00:48.390> does

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
however the difficulty of the task does

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.560 
however the difficulty of the task does
not<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.680> torment<00:00:50.430> 6<00:00:50.640> chess<00:00:50.969> runs<00:00:51.210> are<00:00:51.360> very

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
not so torment 6 chess runs are very

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.299 
not so torment 6 chess runs are very
efficient<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.770> same<00:00:52.980> thing<00:00:53.190> with

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
efficient and the same thing with

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.180 
efficient and the same thing with
repeatable<00:00:53.850> purple<00:00:54.270> mobs<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:55.559> difficulty<00:00:56.160> of

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
repeatable purple mobs the difficulty of

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.799 
repeatable purple mobs the difficulty of
the<00:00:56.370> task<00:00:56.399> does<00:00:56.879> not<00:00:57.059> scale<00:00:57.329> very<00:00:57.570> hard

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the task does not scale very hard

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.049 
the task does not scale very hard
whereas<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> reward<00:00:58.649> does<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.609> they're<00:00:59.789> very

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
whereas the reward does so they're very

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.849 
whereas the reward does so they're very
efficient<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.539> torment<00:01:00.960> 6<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.469> something

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
efficient on torment 6 but something

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.759 
efficient on torment 6 but something
like<00:01:01.980> bounties<00:01:02.520> or<00:01:02.550> rifts<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:04.110> monsters

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
like bounties or rifts the monsters

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.280 
like bounties or rifts the monsters
scale<00:01:05.460> extremely<00:01:06.240> hard<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> difficulty

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
scale extremely hard and the difficulty

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.340 
scale extremely hard and the difficulty
of<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> task<00:01:07.560> scales<00:01:08.549> extremely<00:01:09.360> hard<00:01:09.630> but

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
of the task scales extremely hard but

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.850 
of the task scales extremely hard but
the<00:01:10.500> reward<00:01:10.979> was<00:01:11.909> only<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:13.380> know<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.710> was

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the reward was only like you know it was

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.590 
the reward was only like you know it was
very<00:01:14.040> insignificant<00:01:17.000> but<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.420> last

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
very insignificant but just this last

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.300 
very insignificant but just this last
week<00:01:18.840> they<00:01:19.020> nerfed<00:01:19.259> chess<00:01:19.710> runs<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.100> nerf

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
week they nerfed chess runs a nerf

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.260 
week they nerfed chess runs a nerf
Mangum<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.119> some<00:01:21.450> purple<00:01:21.780> runs<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:23.189> at<00:01:23.939> first

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
Mangum on some purple runs and at first

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.490 
Mangum on some purple runs and at first
I<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.570> that's<00:01:24.990> not<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.350> solution

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
I was like that's not the solution

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.890 
I was like that's not the solution
people<00:01:26.189> will<00:01:26.430> always<00:01:26.670> find<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.240> new<00:01:27.270> chest<00:01:27.659> run

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
people will always find a new chest run

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.380 
people will always find a new chest run
and<00:01:28.140> people<00:01:28.619> will<00:01:29.250> always<00:01:29.490> find<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.030> new<00:01:30.060> boss

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
and people will always find a new boss

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.630 
and people will always find a new boss
or<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> new<00:01:30.990> purple<00:01:31.350> mob<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.740> farm<00:01:31.979> repeatedly

or a new purple mob to farm repeatedly
the<00:01:33.600> solution<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:35.369> problem<00:01:35.700> this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the solution to this problem this

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.569 
the solution to this problem this
underlying<00:01:36.630> problem<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:37.549> nerfing<00:01:38.549> the

rest<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.820> video<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.299> post<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.780> because<00:01:58.350> I

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
rest of that video and post it because I

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.289 
rest of that video and post it because I
still<00:01:58.890> felt<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.340> they<00:01:59.490> had<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.700> long<00:01:59.939> ways<00:02:00.149> to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
still felt like they had a long ways to

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.859 
still felt like they had a long ways to
go<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:01.430> Blizzard<00:02:02.430> released<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.299> hotfix

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
go but Blizzard released a hotfix

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.180 
go but Blizzard released a hotfix
tonight<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.649> actually<00:02:05.130> are<00:02:05.310> yesterday<00:02:07.190> they

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
tonight that actually are yesterday they

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.809 
tonight that actually are yesterday they
actually<00:02:08.670> gave<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.060> hundred<00:02:09.690> percent<00:02:09.899> bonus

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
actually gave a hundred percent bonus

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.290 
actually gave a hundred percent bonus
multiplier<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.390> rift

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
multiplier to rift

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.120 
multiplier to rift
so<00:02:13.780> that's<00:02:13.960> on<00:02:14.140> top<00:02:14.380> of<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.710> tournament

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
so that's on top of the tournament

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.660 
so that's on top of the tournament
difficulty<00:02:15.670> bonus<00:02:16.560> its<00:02:17.560> multiplicative<00:02:18.160> so

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
difficulty bonus its multiplicative so

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.670 
difficulty bonus its multiplicative so
you<00:02:18.730> if<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.450> take<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.690> look<00:02:19.960> at<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.170> new<00:02:20.320> chart

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
you if you take a look at the new chart

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.120 
you if you take a look at the new chart
it's<00:02:20.980> actually<00:02:21.520> quite<00:02:21.850> favorable<00:02:22.570> I<00:02:23.530> wouldn't

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
it's actually quite favorable I wouldn't

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.760 
it's actually quite favorable I wouldn't
say<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.670> scales<00:02:25.000> with<00:02:25.450> difficulty<00:02:26.170> yet

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
say that it scales with difficulty yet

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.600 
say that it scales with difficulty yet
because<00:02:28.350> because<00:02:29.350> torment<00:02:29.800> 1<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.100> probably

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
because because torment 1 is probably

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.250 
because because torment 1 is probably
still<00:02:30.880> going<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.270> be<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.540> most<00:02:31.690> efficient<00:02:32.140> at

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
still going to be the most efficient at

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.370 
still going to be the most efficient at
the<00:02:32.800> time<00:02:33.070> because<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.550> doesn't<00:02:33.730> scale<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
the time because it doesn't scale the

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.380 
the time because it doesn't scale the
reward<00:02:35.709> system<00:02:36.010> doesn't<00:02:36.220> scale<00:02:36.520> dramatically

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
reward system doesn't scale dramatically

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.480 
reward system doesn't scale dramatically
compared<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.560> enemy<00:02:38.950> health<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.370> damage

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
compared to the enemy health and damage

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.090 
compared to the enemy health and damage
and<00:02:39.880> torment<00:02:40.240> high<00:02:40.600> torment<00:02:41.050> levels<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:41.890> it's

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
and torment high torment levels but it's

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.130 
and torment high torment levels but it's
a<00:02:42.220> step<00:02:42.580> in<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.850> right<00:02:43.000> direction<00:02:43.209> if<00:02:44.020> you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
a step in the right direction if you

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.770 
a step in the right direction if you
play<00:02:44.650> rifts<00:02:44.920> right<00:02:45.190> now<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.730> finally<00:02:46.450> feels

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
play rifts right now it finally feels

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.080 
play rifts right now it finally feels
rewarding<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.739> other<00:02:48.430> buff<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:48.970> they

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
rewarding and the other buff that they

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.850 
rewarding and the other buff that they
did<00:02:49.300> that<00:02:49.330> dramatically<00:02:50.200> increased<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:52.300> the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
did that dramatically increased the the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.470 
did that dramatically increased the the
efficiency<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:54.130> rifts<00:02:54.520> is<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:55.360> they

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
efficiency of rifts is that they

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.410 
efficiency of rifts is that they
severely<00:02:55.989> buffed<00:02:56.440> kadala<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.760> your<00:02:58.000> gambling
