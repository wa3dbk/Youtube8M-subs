looking<00:03:24.400> for<00:03:24.700> for<00:03:24.940> sock<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:25.420> far<00:03:25.570> his<00:03:25.660> sound<00:03:25.990> he

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
looking for for sock so far his sound he

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.370 
looking for for sock so far his sound he
also<00:03:26.830> preferred<00:03:27.280> low<00:03:28.120> impedance<00:03:28.510> pickups<00:03:29.200> and

wired it with just a three position

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.280 
wired it with just a three position
switch<00:03:54.680> so<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:55.760> can<00:03:55.790> get<00:03:56.030> this<00:03:56.330> pickup<00:03:56.780> you

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
switch so you can get this pickup you

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.050 
switch so you can get this pickup you
can<00:03:57.440> get<00:03:57.590> this<00:03:57.799> pickup<00:03:58.250> you<00:03:58.400> can't<00:03:58.640> get<00:03:58.849> all

three but you can get the middle

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.690 
three but you can get the middle
position<00:04:01.810> is<00:04:02.810> these<00:04:03.170> two<00:04:03.500> out<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:04.010> phase<00:04:04.250> so

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
position is these two out of phase so

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.839
