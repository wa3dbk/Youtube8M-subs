upper body don't make this big arm
motion<00:00:17.160> you'll<00:00:17.970> see<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.240> difference<00:00:18.270> between

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
motion you'll see the difference between

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.410 
motion you'll see the difference between
all<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.260> arm<00:00:19.470> motion<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.010> make<00:00:20.250> me<00:00:21.180> where<00:00:21.359> I

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
all that arm motion you make me where I

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.939 
all that arm motion you make me where I
really<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:21.840> turned<00:00:22.080> my<00:00:22.170> body<00:00:22.410> my<00:00:22.650> elbow

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
really just turned my body my elbow

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.640 
really just turned my body my elbow
still<00:00:23.250> raised<00:00:24.019> now<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.199> good<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.500> got

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
still raised now it's good that I got

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.170 
still raised now it's good that I got
this<00:00:25.769> your<00:00:25.949> forehand<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.519> video<00:00:26.849> because<00:00:27.060> you

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
this your forehand on video because you

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.460 
this your forehand on video because you
can<00:00:27.300> really<00:00:27.480> see<00:00:27.750> where<00:00:27.900> your<00:00:27.990> racket<00:00:28.380> head

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
can really see where your racket head

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.380 
can really see where your racket head
scoops<00:00:29.070> under<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> ball<00:00:30.060> pretty

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
scoops under the ball pretty

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.780 
scoops under the ball pretty
consistently<00:00:31.080> where<00:00:31.740> my<00:00:31.920> rackets<00:00:32.309> vertical

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
consistently where my rackets vertical

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.540 
consistently where my rackets vertical
this<00:00:33.690> could<00:00:34.050> be<00:00:34.200> because<00:00:34.320> either<00:00:34.620> that's<00:00:35.340> your

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
this could be because either that's your

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.979 
this could be because either that's your
perception<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.870> to

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
perception that's what you have to do to

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.780 
perception that's what you have to do to
get<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.200> over<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.500> net<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:38.010> you're<00:00:38.670> not

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
get it over the net or you're not

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.340 
get it over the net or you're not
getting<00:00:39.210> your<00:00:39.329> racket<00:00:39.660> low<00:00:39.840> enough<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
getting your racket low enough and

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.110 
getting your racket low enough and
you're<00:00:40.410> swinging<00:00:40.770> at<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.250> ball<00:00:41.280> which<00:00:41.969> i

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
you're swinging at the ball which i

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.610 
you're swinging at the ball which i
think<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.390> more<00:00:42.540> likely<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.050> case<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.440> get

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
think is more likely the case so get

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.940 
think is more likely the case so get
ready<00:00:43.739> quick<00:00:44.100> turn<00:00:45.140> or<00:00:46.140> little<00:00:46.440> steps<00:00:46.680> by<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
ready quick turn or little steps by the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.580 
ready quick turn or little steps by the
way<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.430> more<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.940> then<00:00:48.930> let<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.260> racket

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
way do more and then let that racket

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.470 
way do more and then let that racket
fall<00:00:49.829> way<00:00:50.280> below<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> ball<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:51.239> hit<00:00:51.449> it

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
fall way below the ball and then hit it

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.200 
fall way below the ball and then hit it
now<00:00:51.750> contact<00:00:52.620> points<00:00:52.949> at<00:00:53.070> waist<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:54.120> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
now contact points at waist and it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.180 
now contact points at waist and it
should<00:00:54.360> fall<00:00:54.600> below<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.020> knees<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.100> think

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
should fall below the knees so I think

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.560 
should fall below the knees so I think
you're<00:00:56.370> getting<00:00:56.550> at<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> ball<00:00:57.090> too<00:00:57.239> much<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
you're getting at the ball too much you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.029 
you're getting at the ball too much you
can<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:57.809> again<00:00:58.020> how<00:00:58.199> your<00:00:58.320> racket<00:00:58.649> scoops

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
can see again how your racket scoops

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
can see again how your racket scoops
open<00:00:59.430> there<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.809> pull<00:01:01.079> way<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
open there and then you pull way to the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.579 
open there and then you pull way to the
left<00:01:02.180> close<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.539> then<00:01:03.660> swing<00:01:04.019> out<00:01:04.170> through

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
left close it and then swing out through

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.460 
left close it and then swing out through
it<00:01:04.769> creating<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.580> vertical<00:01:06.030> racket<00:01:06.330> face<00:01:06.470> now

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
it creating a vertical racket face now

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.020 
it creating a vertical racket face now
the<00:01:07.530> backhand<00:01:08.040> same<00:01:08.310> thing<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> turn

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the backhand same thing with the turn

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.969 
the backhand same thing with the turn
you'll<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> difference<00:01:10.229> I'm<00:01:10.710> turned

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
you'll see the difference I'm turned

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.910 
you'll see the difference I'm turned
quickly<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> way<00:01:12.119> with<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.290> arm<00:01:13.590> into

the body and high then they fall down

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.700 
the body and high then they fall down
together<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.869> go<00:01:18.990> inside<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.439> together<00:01:21.710> same

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
together and go inside out together same

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.280 
together and go inside out together same
thing<00:01:22.890> let<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> follow<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:24.119> then<00:01:24.150> how<00:01:24.930> far<00:01:25.259> out

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
thing let it follow and then how far out
