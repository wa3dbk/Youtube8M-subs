00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.520
 they chamonix zermatt and is a topo of 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.730
 bilingual hike french english 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:15.450
 he describes us in no way the high road 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.980
 classic famous place yesterday have described 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.260
 a hiking trail by the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.640
 less known but so much 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.460
 interesting has so much diversified 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.830
 this hike consists of fourteen 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.650
 days the 13 day to connect 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.159
 Chamonix in Zermatt and a day in 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.900
 extra around zermatt to discover 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:42.269
 and flirt with the north face of the cervin 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.440
 so often hikers do not have 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.979
 necessarily 14 hours of availability 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.479
 so it's also declined in ten days and 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.670
 seven days so everyone can 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:54.629
 build the chamonix zermatt that him 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.890
 so looks like each steps make up 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.729
 a chapter so the great specificity 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.589
 of this topo in fact it is that it is very 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.950
 rich in iconography there is a lot 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.200
 photos and photos actually has 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.140
 a lot of information which allows 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.360
 have a much more succinct text and 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.780
 much less heavy much more 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.299
 pleasant to read 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.729
 the photos actually allow the 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.260
 hikers to fully understand what is 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.700
 the course because the course is 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.890
 described by the photo in a way 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.470
 exhaustive with systematically 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.180
 course layout on photos as 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.580
 that the hiker can really well 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.420
 transpose materialize imagine in 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.200
 what landscape 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.020
 he will evolve from the carrier of the forest of 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.420
 the alp and also it will be able 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.190
 identify in a very easy way all 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.799
 the vertices that surround them because all 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.280
 the summits are worth noting in fact on the 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.280
 photos so in fact this topo wants to be 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.550
 a triple weaves a tool forward during 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.009
 and after the hike before since there 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.979
 a very precise chapter very complete on 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.899
 the material carried away for this this 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.550
 hike so that represents 20 years 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.899
 coaching experience 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.500
 mountain that I am so it's enough 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.209
 precise we will of course find use 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.690
 all the elements to build his 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.040
 hiking whether it's accommodations 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.489
 refueling the different 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.440
 transport and then we'll be able to 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.570
 understand what the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.360
 different days since there is a 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.209
 profile of deniv and at every step with 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.280
 a time schedule so we will be able to 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.290
 really build well understand those 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.350
 projected upstream in the hike and 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.480
 to be able to dream a little bit about 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.519
 terrain during the hike thanks to 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.950
 super photos not in principle 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.370
 especially since there is an associated text 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.310
 to each photo a text that describes the 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.989
 key elements the crossings clean 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.510
 bifurcation a little bit complicated 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.100
 every every key point is associated 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.609
 also to GPS coordinates that are 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.560
 specified in the topo as well as 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.709
 possible variants or loopholes 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.320
 possible in case of bad weather and then 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.940
 I would also say following the hike 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.860
 it is 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.750
 wonderful book of memories because 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.510
 we have all the atmosphere of the hike 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.760
 who is in there with all the summits 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.190
 which of course are to be noted so we can 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.260
 remember his hike and do not 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.510
 forget the names of the summits and the 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.270
 environment in which we evolved and this 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.870
 hiking it is made for kia north 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.060
 then she is made 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.680
 often it's not the first one 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.000
 the stirrup foot in the world of the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.900
 multi-day hike 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.300
 chamonix zermatt 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.050
 this area is often addressed by the 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.460
 around Mont Blanc 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.900
 and when we went around the mount 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.940
 white it's not a finality the turn 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.320
 movement is great to continue 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.780
 to evolve in this universe of 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.890
 hiking and chamonix zermatt and you me 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.690
 give back a little bit more difficult 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.250
 physically because the elevation differences 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.850
 are a little bit bigger than the 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.220
 white mont blanc 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.930
 but it's really a hike 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.000
 great after a tour of Mont Blanc 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.120
 to continue the discovery of the bow 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.120
 alpine
