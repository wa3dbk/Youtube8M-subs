 trailing 3 kills trailing 3 kills 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.080
 backlog and walked along a make 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.160
 prefer to always stay in the asylum 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.810
 kitchen where one 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.370
 The game is leaking again nice and hard I 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.720
 deliberately put nice mcclintock because he 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.490
 on call or duty some nice laundry on one 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.470
 somehow and 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.970
 whether colleagues the reign or not I can 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.310
 then click there Tuesday but also language 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.330
 while in and flat die 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.100
 No suit cunt man I want in the game 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.990
 you have to beat the church span 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.490
 next to me that's really a bullshit 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.960
 exciting look where I pitched for 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.370
 that that does not count 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.720
 what they suggest I never have resources 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.950
 there a bullshit tests in such a way 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.990
 death 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.340
 yes nice ok that have go yes now has to 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.080

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.490
 that we save this one another boys we 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.930
 just gonna try it yes fuck it i 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.580
 must try there of course 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.200
 impact from that and another from it 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.280
 impact lesson codes are 2 kills or five 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.690
 choices backlog 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.639
 we rate it better for a 5 kilo 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.050
 We are now lagging behind 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.760
 just partially in the first place 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.990
 because that natural play game was his 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.860
 not shared ass first place because of that 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.690
 guy also very well made 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.800
 and yes for in the knowledge kill my but no 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.530
 If you do not want me, I will go for myself
