00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
around and with more time rusty could

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.720 
around and with more time rusty could

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
set up timers scores sounds and so much

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.970 
set up timers scores sounds and so much
more<00:03:49.109> rusty<00:03:50.109> let's<00:03:50.260> change<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.620> couple<00:03:50.799> of

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
more rusty let's change a couple of

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.710 
more rusty let's change a couple of
those<00:03:51.099> goblins<00:03:51.639> into<00:03:51.970> something<00:03:52.359> different

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
those goblins into something different

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.670 
those goblins into something different
give<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:52.930> little<00:03:53.049> visual<00:03:53.290> variety<00:03:53.950> here<00:03:55.680> in

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
give it a little visual variety here in

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.010 
give it a little visual variety here in
the<00:03:56.860> desert<00:03:57.299> he's<00:03:58.299> chosen

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
the desert he's chosen

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.860 
the desert he's chosen
Yeti<00:03:59.320> interesting<00:04:00.250> choice<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:01.540> we'll<00:04:01.660> put<00:04:01.840> a

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
Yeti interesting choice so we'll put a

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.940 
Yeti interesting choice so we'll put a
Yeti<00:04:02.080> in<00:04:02.260> there<00:04:02.500> may<00:04:02.890> be<00:04:02.920> another<00:04:03.160> one<00:04:04.950> all

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
Yeti in there may be another one all

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.390 
Yeti in there may be another one all
right<00:04:08.310> looking<00:04:09.310> good<00:04:10.440> perfect<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.800> then

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
right looking good perfect and then

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.650 
right looking good perfect and then
let's<00:04:12.640> play<00:04:12.880> with<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.120> position<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.540> little

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
let's play with the position a little

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.910 
let's play with the position a little
bit<00:04:13.870> so<00:04:13.990> we<00:04:14.080> get<00:04:14.230> some<00:04:14.440> height<00:04:14.650> variety<00:04:16.920> there

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
bit so we get some height variety there

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.150 
bit so we get some height variety there
