00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
of mine right now and my intention was

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.210 
of mine right now and my intention was
to<00:02:38.450> go<00:02:38.660> into<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.959> gym<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.170> do<00:02:39.410> some<00:02:39.620> high<00:02:39.920> rep

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
stuff but I was just feeling like doing

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.440 
stuff but I was just feeling like doing
a<00:02:42.920> little<00:02:43.100> bit<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.280> pause<00:02:43.580> work<00:02:43.880> simply

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
a little bit of pause work simply

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.210 
a little bit of pause work simply
because<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.720> feel<00:02:45.050> like<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.200> has<00:02:45.410> so<00:02:45.709> much<00:02:45.860> carry

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
because I feel like it has so much carry

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.729 
because I feel like it has so much carry
over<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.700> it's<00:02:46.850> so<00:02:47.209> beneficial<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:48.500> kind<00:02:48.680> of

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
over and it's so beneficial to kind of

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.050 
over and it's so beneficial to kind of
sit<00:02:48.950> down<00:02:49.130> there<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.550> work<00:02:49.670> on<00:02:49.880> being

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
sit down there and work on being

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.630 
sit down there and work on being
explosive<00:02:50.840> which<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.739> know<00:02:51.860> when<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.430> don't

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
explosive which you know when you don't

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.100 
explosive which you know when you don't
squat<00:02:52.970> very<00:02:53.150> often<00:02:53.540> it's<00:02:53.690> something<00:02:53.959> that<00:02:54.079> you

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
squat very often it's something that you

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.080 
squat very often it's something that you
tend<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.590> lose<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.950> little<00:02:55.250> bit<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.850> helps

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
tend to lose a little bit and it helps

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.150 
tend to lose a little bit and it helps
you<00:02:56.180> maintain<00:02:56.720> tightness<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.620> control<00:02:58.010> so

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
you maintain tightness and control so

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.050 
you maintain tightness and control so
you<00:02:58.190> could<00:02:58.370> see<00:02:58.489> when<00:02:58.610> I'm<00:02:58.730> sitting<00:02:58.940> down

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
you could see when I'm sitting down

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.819 
you could see when I'm sitting down
there<00:02:59.450> I'm<00:02:59.630> keeping<00:03:00.260> as<00:03:00.380> tight<00:03:00.650> as<00:03:00.799> possible

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
there I'm keeping as tight as possible

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.370 
there I'm keeping as tight as possible
making<00:03:01.519> sure<00:03:01.760> my<00:03:02.000> core<00:03:02.600> is<00:03:02.720> tight<00:03:02.930> my<00:03:03.110> glutes

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
making sure my core is tight my glutes

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.229 
making sure my core is tight my glutes
are<00:03:03.500> tight<00:03:03.560> my<00:03:04.130> upper<00:03:04.430> back<00:03:04.579> tightness<00:03:04.910> is

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
are tight my upper back tightness is

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.600 
are tight my upper back tightness is
there<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.660> that's<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:06.019> benefit<00:03:06.440> of

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
there and that's the benefit of

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.370 
there and that's the benefit of
incorporating<00:03:07.610> Paul<00:03:07.820> squats<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:08.900> did<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.170> few

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
incorporating Paul squats so I did a few

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.410 
incorporating Paul squats so I did a few
sets<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.799> Paul<00:03:10.070> squats<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.610> then<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.150> moved

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
sets of Paul squats and then I moved

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.289 
sets of Paul squats and then I moved
into<00:03:11.600> some<00:03:12.200> five<00:03:12.500> by<00:03:12.680> five<00:03:12.890> work<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.459> then<00:03:14.030> for

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
into some five by five work and then for

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.900 
into some five by five work and then for
some<00:03:14.600> reason<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:15.140> decided<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.890> drop<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.790> weight

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
some reason I decided to drop the weight

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.270 
some reason I decided to drop the weight
a<00:03:16.940> little<00:03:17.180> bit<00:03:17.450> since<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.870> pause<00:03:18.140> squat<00:03:19.100> work

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
a little bit since the pause squat work

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.460 
a little bit since the pause squat work
kind<00:03:19.579> of<00:03:19.670> tired<00:03:19.910> me<00:03:20.150> out<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.870> really<00:03:21.200> didn't

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
kind of tired me out and I really didn't

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.380 
kind of tired me out and I really didn't
want<00:03:21.650> too<00:03:21.829> much<00:03:21.980> form<00:03:22.280> breakdown<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.360> I

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
want too much form breakdown so I

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.479 
want too much form breakdown so I
dropped<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.810> weight<00:03:23.900> down<00:03:24.079> to<00:03:24.290> 185<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:25.250> went

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
dropped the weight down to 185 and went

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.160 
dropped the weight down to 185 and went
for<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.730> set<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.150> 10<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:26.630> i'll<00:03:26.720> let<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:26.930> see<00:03:27.079> how

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:22.330

really happy with the squats I was able

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.860 
really happy with the squats I was able
to<00:04:26.220> hit<00:04:26.340> depth<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:27.000> bar<00:04:27.210> path<00:04:27.420> was<00:04:27.660> pretty

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
to hit depth the bar path was pretty

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.540 
to hit depth the bar path was pretty
straight<00:04:28.170> in<00:04:28.260> my<00:04:28.350> opinion<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:28.980> was<00:04:29.310> able<00:04:29.400> to

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
straight in my opinion I was able to

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.370 
straight in my opinion I was able to
maintain<00:04:29.700> tightness<00:04:30.420> and<00:04:30.660> I<00:04:31.050> just<00:04:31.200> need<00:04:31.320> to

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
maintain tightness and I just need to

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.470 
maintain tightness and I just need to
work<00:04:31.560> on<00:04:31.680> my<00:04:31.740> muscular<00:04:32.130> endurance<00:04:32.400> but<00:04:32.880> like<00:04:33.330> I
