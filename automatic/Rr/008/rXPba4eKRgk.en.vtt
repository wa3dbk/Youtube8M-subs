00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.009
 Memories of Gunpla Kit Review Collection Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:12.469
 1/220 scale Marasai 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:14.180
 1/220 Mara sight is the 38th of the plastic model series of Mobile Suit Data Gundam 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.539
 It is a kit that was released 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:21.740
 Snap Fit model sells as low as 300 yen 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:26.180
 Oh Daa of it was surely the collection size of the Moro gold Author for 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.200
 At the time I say I Marasai say that was a big popularity of mobile suits in the design of the family system 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.460
 That's why 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.830
 A little while ago I made the spikes of Johnny Leidenzak's shoulder armor sharp on the tsun 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.930
 It's was numb design to brat Ncho 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.260
 Although it is natural to buy the 1/144 kit, the affordable 300 yen was also attractive 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.430
 What 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.969
 There are many parts where the details of details are omitted. 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.260
 It's small but I'm selling a surprisingly balanced proportion 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.859
 Therefore Gakincho is a useful model modeler for remodeling 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.250
 After recovering for each site to fall apart if you modified 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:05.019
 Fixing joints makes policy easy, and until the early 90's 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:09.400
 Something that has been popular for remodeling to Mara rhino Marasai and Makoto Kobayashi version of the Kondo version 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:13.390
 Mara Sai, who appeared to have a double-zeta-kun here of Koide each teacher was also a sober popular 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.390
 Mara rhino terms of the initial mass production type of sister on the Kondo version 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.240
 Wisdom for the g how cold regions for the land battle was 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:24.890
 And not a Gundam I Griffon that appears in the cartoon version Zeta Gundam 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.350
 There was a maracay of these days, but the debris of the Gundam at this time was a mobile suit for ground battles. 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.670
 Naturally it was the most popular because it was popular 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.930
 It was g for land battles- weapons use the scale model guy 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:39.229
 Zaku example to have a machine gun or heat Hawk also go Nante there was Hey rubble of spot sale meeting and 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.260
 The islanders also sold a lot of debris in April 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.360
 It was a copy book 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.150
 eh 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.900
 The fit specific time being snap-fit can not be naturally Nante later fitting in a single color molding of russet 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.400
 but 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:56.750
 It's an early snap fit , so if you do n't stick it you'll get polo polo parts 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.210
 The weapon is a beam saber like a perpetual beam rifle and a tiny shield claw toothpick. 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.400
 Well we have with 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:06.100
 This kit is small for introductory remodeling where it is best to cut and paste 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.399
 It is good that kit of size easily divides parts 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:14.269
 This is not the case with expensive gunpla after high grade 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.400
 It is better to use the high grade version of Marasai or master grade Marasai for remodeling 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.540
 It seems to be cool though 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.319
 If I come home and the base kit is too complete , the remodeled part may float 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.060
 There is 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:30.390
 Not a fool Datte margin stood at I will add a hand to the whole after all 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:35.610
 In order to reduce waste , it is basic to gain experience with small and sure remodelings 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:41.390
 Something that is Mokeiya of the master had been through the old days the crap I really was well-liked 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.390
 I'm missing after the master shop is destroyed
