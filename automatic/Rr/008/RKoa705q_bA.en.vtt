00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello today we continue 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.150
 conversation and dance and motor 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:12.450
 therapy and dance abilities and advice of us 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:15.089
 dance he is very connected with a little expression 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.340
 with an expression just like in the dance and we 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.350
 can live very many feeling very 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.960
 many experiences including those 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.490
 which we might not allow 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.890
 to myself 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.539
 live under normal conditions 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 conditions of a social such 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.610
 normalized communication but in dance 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.219
 This can be because dance from including 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.440
 and arts including as if 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.950
 such an old reality is special 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.750
 reality and at the same time you can experience 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.210
 Those feelings that are not very 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.750
 taken reside on which is important 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.750
 to live 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.610
 and 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.850
 ability to dance by expression 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.380
 emotional up ability 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.759
 response or 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.320
 purification of emotional precisely 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.789
 the ability to dance to be that way 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.770
 catharsis emotional catharsis she 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.770
 also very long known 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.060
 and 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.680
 but 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.250
 except this dance allows you to live 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.680
 this situation 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.750
 symbolically, that is, we do not have to 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.800
 come into such close contact with some kind 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.520
 it may be difficult for us to experience we 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.920
 we can play it but it seemed 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.510
 would this game have sold this conditional 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.150
 situation but when we really 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.890
 the reason our body is included in it 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.380
 our feeling is included in it we 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.260
 really really and and live perry 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.920
 live reprogram some 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.930
 gone and live it again 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.200
 alexandra ordered show and warm 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.450
 meetings and partings remember how 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.099
 hard we experience separation from dear 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.540
 by people 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.900
 parting with your loved one is not 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.260
 collapsing joy there is nothing only 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.560
 confusion and bitter years later chest 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.050
 a little goes a soul remains in the dark 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.769
 spot you full 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.390
 dance in this case, the advice of psychologists 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.390
 try to follow their advice 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.760
 living this traumatic situation in 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.430
 dance you will drop a load of heavy 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.010
 memories and seemed born again 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.130
 open to new meetings and new 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.130
 impressions 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.550
 but 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.720
 it's old too 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.280
 art ability and art of dance 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.290
 including which is it still worth 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.000
 called aedes creativity 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.130
 creative symbolic is also very 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.490
 often we turn to new way 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:10.800
 movements to the way of movement which 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.670
 we didn't try didn't we try 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.700
 retrain our body 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.239
 because so many in many 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.280
 In some cases, what we have learned is 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.530
 fine why did our body learn 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.580
 fine he let us survive this 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.170
 difficult world 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.240
 here but some of these stereotypes are 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.860
 stopped working they were adequate in 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.940
 some situation now they stopped 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.710
 work in particular here when we and there 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.250
 scary and then there is a strong 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.000
 intense signal frightening world still 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.630
 some kind of 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.510
 natural reaction is compression reaction 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.360
 it turns out that if we try 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.760
 go to another situation to another pattern 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.160
 base date expansion situation 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.990
 it turns out to be you in many 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.990
 cases are much more efficient 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.139
 there 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.180
 in particular in simple domestic situations 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:26.050
 that let some cases we 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.169
 engaged in training drop downs 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.900
 competent 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.970
 mild functional incidence like 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.389
 prevention of some kind of fractures and so 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.430
 further here it turns out that our 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.729
 natural with quotes step again 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.020
 habitual reaction that compression reaction if 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.500
 at this moment we start 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.270
 turnover expand at the time of the fall 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.120
 soft 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:54.039
 feeling transitions in the body to fall then 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.039
 shows that it is safe 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:00.509
 try the grid on big enough 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:00.509
 speed sing right away 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:12.490
 Well , let's be today on this 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:15.270
 finish and next time we continue 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.270
 story 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.690
 us 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.100
 but
