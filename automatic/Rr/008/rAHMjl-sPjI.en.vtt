00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.500
 the amazing animation of the water 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.750
 we will find trevor thrown in the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.340
 beach with clear hangover signs on 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.100
 cloths and with a string of 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.930
 bodies around him little remembers the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.880
 fact that has taken him to the river del 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.939
 fatal fate of those who lie at their 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.830
 side while the sun goes around 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.840
 going down gradually emitting 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.970
 tonalities that change the color of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.010
 all the elements that surround us but 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.930
 also from the trevor itself since the light 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.000
 consequently affects the appearance 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.190
 that the character that exhibits 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.050
 shamelessly almost all of her skin affected by 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.300
 the typical orange colors of 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.400
 sunset right here our character 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.440
 embarks on a path towards a 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.690
 boat stop on the coast to which 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.670
 will go up and show us the technical aspect 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.610
 and practically playable that more 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.560
 surprised of all that demonstration 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.660
 it's hard to express in words like 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.940
 rockstar north has managed to make the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.070
 most faithful representation of water 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.619
 an element also not given to follow about 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.420
 canons of behavior determined the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.549
 effect that we saw there is unparalleled 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.770
 with that of any other game that has 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.140
 daring to improve this aspect until the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.210
 date no matter how much the claim is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.550
 for the broad spectrum of titles to 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.470
 that affects but that's the details are 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.600
 again the triggers of such effect 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.430
 visual that those little 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.260
 particularities produce the breaking of 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.180
 the waves in the high seas happen in a way 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.830
 natural and as anarchic as it is 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.990
 behavior of the water itself 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.940
 drawing varied ripples that 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.550
 they get this effect so concrete 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.100
 also the foam that our 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.990
 speedboat when crossing at full speed indicates 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.210
 how does it respond to the changes that 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.979
 we provoke ourselves in it but 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.990
 you can also glimpse your own 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.850
 interaction with us when our 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.920
 transport is still and movement 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.600
 of the waves draws a swing that goes 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.450
 Far beyond a technical aspect 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.100
 resultÃ³n what we see has its own 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.289
 echo in the interaction with our 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.630
 character making all the impact 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.210
 visual has a superior consequence to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.190
 the evident also the dynamic effect of 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.590
 the lights reach their maximum expression 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.720
 when the rays of one more sunset 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.660
 advanced than the one we described earlier 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.150
 they bathe all the aquatic mass the tones 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.430
 almost reddish orange that indicate the 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.810
 imminent end of the day they manage to give a 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.069
 special volume to the shocking 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.260
 perception 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.599
 that had already surprised us in that 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.090
 moment all this makes up the whole 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.099
 of reasons that awaken in us the 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.170
 feeling that we are facing something 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.239
 distinct something unique something that in the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.939
 current generation had not reached 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.280
 see once again it seemed impossible that a 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.079
 technical aspect although we have pointed out 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.540
 that all this goes far beyond what 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.010
 merely visual surprise but it was 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.959
 the second time we stayed 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.419
 amazed in a short space of time 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.980
 meanwhile and after having 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.930
 observed calmly all 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.859
 particularities that gave rise to 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.750
 surface 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.549
 trevor claimed our attention to 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.769
 put on the neoprene suit and 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.629
 dive into the water initiating a 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.730
 diving phase that shows another of the 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:09.060
 So many options that we have in large 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.010
 theft auto '5 would be strange that yes that 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.439
 such a good impression on the sea is 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.049
 it will ruin under him but nothing else 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.909
 far from reality in fact we could 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.980
 say that the transition between the two 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.109
 levels is ideal and that even below 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.629
 of water we will notice clearly how 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.370
 those late rays of sun go through the 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.949
 first meters close to the surface 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.550
 to light the outermost layer of 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.800
 this mass 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.990
 in this phase that did not last 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.090
 too much in time we could see a 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.250
 little the protagonist's handling by the 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.200
 water in which they also indicated the 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.820
 exploration capacity offered 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.130
 said situation when looking for 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.630
 certain elements for potential 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.440
 missions focused on a scenario 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.660
 Similary 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.670
 rockstar wants to make the whole map 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.920
 a continuous possibility of interaction 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.540
 and the aquatic part itself is a 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.460
 much larger than the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.250
 very network map dead redemption 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.290
 even here under the ocean we could 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.360
 find citizens participating in the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.730
 submarine sport giving back the 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.340
 life feeling of contextual wealth 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.410
 to everything that surrounds us until about 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.780
 dangerous sharks decided to form 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.850
 part of this nice ride taking 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.890
 to stay completely still for 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.080
 not draw attention waiting for 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.700
 at which time they will completely bypass 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.530
 our presence to climb the 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.330
 surface and embark on a new journey 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.790
 towards the presentation of the third 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.580
 good protagonist what do they think 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.680
 of water, water will be the most real 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.560
 all the game I want to go to this place 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.270
 see those sunsets sunrise night day 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.190
 and dive all day 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.900
 to know that we can meet there 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.900
 Greetings below and see you
