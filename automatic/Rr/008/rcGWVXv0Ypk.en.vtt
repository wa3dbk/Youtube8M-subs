00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.000
 hi to all and all those crossed i7 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.279
 I hope you're fine, I'm fine 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.710
 very well today we end up 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.880
 for a new size she so I 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.150
 will show you how to download 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.830
 planes and install them on xp 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.019
 windows 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.420
 so so then already I'm going to you 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.809
 show how to host a plane 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.719
 particular so the a380 a very beautiful 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.500
 plane and very big plane which is very 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.420
 very well done after so it's the same 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.730
 principle for all ages every 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.710
 other planes but I'm showing you with 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.320
 the a380 because like that at least you 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.420
 will have it and it's really a plane to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.250
 have first so you go on this 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.230
 site i'm going to put the description of which 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:09.060
 I will be the link in the description 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:11.490
 so you arrive on the forum you 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.470
 do first then you an account 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:20.400
 so me it's already done then until 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:22.409
 been you go in deadwood so there 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.470
 you go to aig kraft for its kind 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:31.290
 of an experienced so you click 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.320
 sorry for health so there you 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.479
 look for the limit you like then I 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.939
 believe that the a380 was page 3 so 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.950
 you should check whether the 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.320
 normal stuff not like for example 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.720
 sometimes there is the same plane and after it 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.240
 ya sound it's a lesson from the plane 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.680
 is strictly for nothing or if it is 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.340
 example 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.560
 paychex the painting of the plane is so 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.520
 the third 80 is a good file I 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.479
 will test and he will throw well wait 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.479
 you have to find them 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:22.350
 this is mostly you have to choose ix 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.730
 pay 9 was not doing xp slip there this 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.130
 are all planes that often x files 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.500
 but also mike bliss you want in 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.490
 life line up you have in es9 and there 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.780
 you found footprints 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.460
 so finding so let's talk about this file 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.950
 is not good because it's a sound 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.290
 but it's just going to be the smur of the plane 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.770
 so if you want to make some 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.770
 small small tripled his right plane 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.240
 so here we go 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.730
 page 3 so we have the a380 so 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:03:00.620
 x-plane 9.70 this is the version so the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.380
 version of now so forgotten about 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.830
 on the link so but look at the 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.590
 pics 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:19.110
 so that's a bit of an overview of everything from 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:25.050
 the a380 you download of course you have to 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:27.930
 if if we do not weight the file you 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.989
 seems a very small example 4 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.239
 mega byte know it's gonna be a trick 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.550
 complete you are not going that will not want 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.239
 open up so we'll tell 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.970
 above 2.7 million pts and you can 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.470
 tint but I'm not telling you the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.150
 feel that it does not work and it will work 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.930
 so the a43 you're sure that's okay 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.120
 walk has cracked you doing there it starts 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.290
 there and you wait so I'm going 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.720
 cut the video because I do not have you 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.040
 to wait anyway for all of 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.019
 after 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.760
 so that's the download 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.840
 completed we will have to move to 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.820
 Installation 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.540
 so then you click on the link one 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.540
 class will open 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:18.780
 there you arrive on this page and 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:22.770
 so you must have a file 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.240
 on your on your desk 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.430
 so who should be called he makes a date 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.819
 for me I wanted to open the 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.160
 folder 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:34.550
 you have an air trafton so in 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:37.050
 god France confesses so here you can 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.289
 add folders so I 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.539
 add company names 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.970
 air because I ranks 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:48.449
 so here we are in airbus 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.190
 so you have the airbus then you the 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.139
 put you want a monfils 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.180
 so I'm going to show you for one but 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.190
 she presents in heavy metal so the 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.190
 big plane that did not fall first video 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.780
 I showed you cluster lyon 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.729
 the names of the category is therefore you 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.770
 take the displayed and you do it 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.830
 the essay in the category that you 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.900
 wish and that's it's over 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.130
 you just have to open 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.349
 explained so I will show you 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.729
 of planar workers so me they were 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.770
 already open because it puts a little bit of 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.539
 time to open 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.960
 so you are in practice 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.569
 the codes here you go in heavy 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.960
 metal and you are looking for your file 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:36.509
 so a380 800 is that we have it so you 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.940
 double click and there you go on the 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.710
 small of aircraft icons of course not so 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.500
 that's stuff we do not care that in 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.409
 did for the sound and which copy you there 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:49.590
 where to click double-click is yours 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:56.819
 a380 is here and you can do it 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:06:00.349
 take off here is very very nice plane 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:05.370
 as you go as you have produced 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:08.310
 of course it was could change from 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:14.700
 company so you go into devices 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:17.640
 I know you go in place devices 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.440

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:38.370
 close and there you have an intro 180 m3 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:44.430
 and a kid or a chine has 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:45.750
