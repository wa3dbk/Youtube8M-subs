 6 million families 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.409
 it seems that the sky is coming on us 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.409
 the one that was his home 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.040
 I think it will be ready in three months 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.919

 john mccain 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.699

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.509
 on the other hand 1 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:46.799
 but 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.039
 I hope to do it 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:53.139
 we have not achieved many gains these days we have more work if not 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.139

 do not talk like that of your colleagues we can always do 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.909
 if that's it or it looks like a puppet and I think he's in a hurry to take

 that heavy package 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.319

 from the band 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.349
 but what can I do 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:21.719
 but that finally did not materialize 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.749
 weber

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.809
 the Italian candidate 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:50.199
 we will try to win everything 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.199

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.779
 min 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.129
 Galician 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.539
 Tehran 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
 all that 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.969

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.969
 please efe a 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:45.279
 the jj who can ask you a natural question 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.300
 because that clear way is that she according to mohamed state 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.220
 if in those was when very very strange that he understood that these had 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.539

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.059
 will enter the house 

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:01.469
 I think he was hiding something that is not a mistake in the 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:05.019
 pastrana programming that killed jackson to whom you have to understand the 

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:08.619
 a girl's heart surely interrupts her when she prepares a surprise 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.899
 but when the voltage of the virgin circuit this visit to genoa transited 

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:17.009
 all and if it is not so I decided that it is not she can change her mind when 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.009
 we want to know about her 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.939
 although you end up watching 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:28.939
 it is intended that the leader of the pp 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.520
 everything indicates that talent in art alignment 

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:45.059
 he needs to have 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.129
 I hope that 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:54.330
 the campaign on the other hand this trajectory the one-way center of the tournament 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.149
