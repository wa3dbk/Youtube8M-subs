00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
able to pull in the tackle but sadly on

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.410

the<00:03:02.340> next<00:03:02.670> play<00:03:02.820> they<00:03:02.970> were<00:03:03.090> able<00:03:03.270> to<00:03:03.360> get

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
the next play they were able to get

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.580 
the next play they were able to get
first<00:03:03.630> down<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.110> see<00:03:04.350> they're<00:03:04.560> just

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
first down so you see they're just

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.740 
first down so you see they're just
driving<00:03:05.130> down<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.370> field<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.760> somehow<00:03:06.450> my

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
driving down the field and somehow my

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.810 
driving down the field and somehow my
defense<00:03:07.200> gets<00:03:07.410> broken<00:03:07.650> down<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.550> if<00:03:08.670> there

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
defense gets broken down and if there

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.390 
defense gets broken down and if there
was<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.940> deep<00:03:09.210> bomb<00:03:09.480> down<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.470> field<00:03:10.710> and<00:03:10.980> it

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
was a deep bomb down the field and it

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.130 
was a deep bomb down the field and it
just<00:03:11.580> kind<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.820> sucked<00:03:12.060> because<00:03:12.270> nobody<00:03:12.570> was

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
just kind of sucked because nobody was

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.290 
just kind of sucked because nobody was
there<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.190> was<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.460> easy<00:03:14.640> i<00:03:14.820> believe<00:03:15.150> for

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
there and that was it easy i believe for

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.840 
there and that was it easy i believe for
a<00:03:15.390> 3-yard<00:03:15.750> touchdown<00:03:15.870> for<00:03:16.290> them<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.760> we

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
a 3-yard touchdown for them so we

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.160 
a 3-yard touchdown for them so we
weren't<00:03:17.970> able<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.209> do<00:03:18.480> anything<00:03:18.720> before<00:03:18.959> the

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
basically it guys there's not much they

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.010 
basically it guys there's not much they
could<00:06:10.580> have<00:06:10.759> done<00:06:10.909> after<00:06:11.360> that<00:06:11.479> we're<00:06:11.930> just

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
could have done after that we're just

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.240 
could have done after that we're just
going<00:06:12.169> to<00:06:12.229> kick<00:06:12.380> this<00:06:12.530> one<00:06:12.740> straight<00:06:13.069> through

the<00:06:13.340> uprights<00:06:13.669> was<00:06:14.360> a<00:06:14.389> little<00:06:14.690> bit<00:06:14.780> scary<00:06:15.080> that

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
the uprights was a little bit scary that

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:16.860 
the uprights was a little bit scary that
almost<00:06:15.500> looked<00:06:15.710> like<00:06:15.740> it<00:06:15.949> wasn't<00:06:16.069> going<00:06:16.219> in

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
almost looked like it wasn't going in

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.360 
almost looked like it wasn't going in
but<00:06:17.870> we're<00:06:18.050> able<00:06:18.199> to<00:06:18.349> barely<00:06:18.710> get<00:06:19.039> out<00:06:19.069> of<00:06:19.190> this

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
but we're able to barely get out of this

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.640 
but we're able to barely get out of this
game<00:06:19.580> with<00:06:19.940> a<00:06:19.969> three-point<00:06:20.449> win<00:06:20.569> this<00:06:21.319> is<00:06:21.530> one

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
game with a three-point win this is one

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.950 
game with a three-point win this is one
of<00:06:21.680> the<00:06:21.800> more<00:06:21.919> interesting<00:06:21.979> games<00:06:22.699> because<00:06:23.659> I

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
of the more interesting games because I

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.839 
of the more interesting games because I
mean<00:06:24.620> we<00:06:24.740> really<00:06:24.919> just<00:06:25.159> would<00:06:25.340> not<00:06:25.460> have<00:06:25.639> won

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
mean we really just would not have won

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.820 
mean we really just would not have won
if<00:06:26.000> we<00:06:26.090> didn't<00:06:26.270> get<00:06:26.330> that<00:06:26.479> pic<00:06:26.659> 6<00:06:26.900> pi<00:06:27.110> guy<00:06:27.349> who<00:06:27.409> I
