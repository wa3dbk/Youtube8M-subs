00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.080
 today I wanted to share with you a couple 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.139
 of tools that I like because they are 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.410
 fun creatives and especially because 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.270
 are at zero cost with things that 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.890
 surely you will have at home and very 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.810
 small and manageable now facing the 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.820
 summer I liked to share something that 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.509
 you could carry in the backpacks in the 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.189
 beach in the car or wherever you are 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.390
 you probably know these cubes of 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.580
 stories have become very fashionable 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.190
 lately there are a subject this 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.720
 example is pirates theme or there are those 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.270
 classics that are the first to leave 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.070
 with images of all kinds are not very 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.990
 well we use them a lot 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.910
 children roll the dice and they can 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.750
 make stories or invent a lot 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.300
 of things with them but I still like more 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.850
 personify it then this is a cube 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.340
 ruby limitation of the 'everything to a hundred' that 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.380
 it really cost me half a euro and what 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.020
 we have filled with super varied words 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.680
 not for example beach suitcase cow 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.940
 train playground rocket detective soccer 2 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.650
 all-purpose plane 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.960
 the amount of things that can be done 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.620
 with this tool they are a lot 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.000
 you can like the others because with the 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.490
 words that have come out on one side 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.440
 tell me a story you can review 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.730
 things now in school summer what 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.980
 are the nouns what are the 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.660
 adjectives with the smallest children 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.630
 tell me the consonants tell me the vowels 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.940
 we have another where each face is a theme 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.240
 of spelling as there is a face bv there 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.190
 another face with the words j &amp; g then for 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.110
 that they are reviewing you can do it in the 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.570
 language they are learning in school 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.220
 in English they are what they are learning 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.020
 since the classic words 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.740
 vocabulary blocks the family the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.510
 clothes up if you are a little older 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.510
 Maybe they can build a story 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.910
 same as here in Spanish no other 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.860
 possibility of using these cubes that 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.840
 we have a lot at home is with numbers 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.290
 so the numbers give a lot of 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.880
 games because you can if they are already adding and 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.250
 multiplying you can use the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.830
 numbers here you can find pairs and 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.959
 odd with younger kids or 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.790
 if for example you take it in the car and 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.640
 you put numbers lower than 0 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.859
 15 or so you can then in the numbers that 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.780
 have come out how many red cars how many 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:23.000
 blue cars or let's see how many 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.040
 trees happen today see and see children 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.680
 a kind of real bingo that 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.000
 when you give children materials like this 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.500
 very unfinished the child comes up in 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.480
 a lot of possibilities starts to 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.030
 use your imagination on how to use 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.670
 the cool threads of rugby cubes 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.439
 is that when moving them they change 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.120
 immediately and the possibilities are 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.879
 infinite with which is always a 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.370
 new toy that you do not have cubes of 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.579
 rubik nothing happens you can play too 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.500
 with the dice of a lifetime and today you 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.689
 I propose one of the many games that 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.810
 you can do with dice in this 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.849
 we use 4 in the first die we 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.000
 we build a list of six characters 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.829
 they can be from the classic characters 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.500
 princess detective pirate footballer 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.859
 even people that children know the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.310
 uncle dad the teacher my sister in the 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:18.260
 second you are going to put the key emotion 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.430
 what's going to happen in that story is 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.010
 Surprised 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.120
 is happy or is sad or is 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.700
 learning something a little that directs what 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.209
 what's going to happen in the third one you have 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.170
 your scenario a forest a house a 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.930
 spaceship the moon mars the beach and 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.879
 in the last you have the activities that 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.760
 have to do with what has come out 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:46.159
 we do not throw it out the 1 tell me 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.159
 a story that comes out on the 2 writes that 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.470
 story that comes out the 3 sings I invented 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.840
 a song with these three things that 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.939
 4 comes out why do not you try to make me 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.739
 a little play with dolls or 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.470
 with your little brother about what has gone 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.049
 that comes out on the 5th we are going to make an album of 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.680
 photos we will see then maybe the 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.629
 another day we got a dog and he was 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.030
 surprised and we took a pot here in 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.129
 the terrace and he little hair saw I do not know what 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.530
 Martian we have and well then 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.720
 children the truth is that they are fantastic and 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.789
 can also draw if the 6 leaves 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.900
 draw and they can paint the story 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.360
 what has gone out 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.070
 nothing more two super simple things but 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.320
 that you will see that they are going to give you a lot 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.449
 of play now in summer we need 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.759
 really be able to get into the backpacks 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.039
 things that they can use and that every day 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.410
 can change that you spend a good summer 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:40.300
 but I 'm still here every Tuesday in 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.300
