hold this little switch down this little

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.400 
hold this little switch down this little
switch<00:04:09.100> down<00:04:09.280> here<00:04:09.610> tells<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.720> system<00:04:11.200> that

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
switch down here tells the system that

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.660 
switch down here tells the system that
will<00:04:11.620> it's<00:04:11.770> closed<00:04:11.980> so<00:04:12.190> i<00:04:12.310> just<00:04:12.460> hold<00:04:12.640> that

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670

will it's closed so i just hold that
down<00:04:14.130> you<00:04:15.130> can<00:04:15.250> see<00:04:15.460> it<00:04:15.520> does<00:04:15.670> try<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:15.970> spin<00:04:16.330> but

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.210 
down you can see it does try to spin but

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.500 
down you can see it does try to spin but
there's<00:04:19.210> no<00:04:19.450> red<00:04:20.170> dot<00:04:20.200> on<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.590> laser<00:04:21.360> and<00:04:22.360> i

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
there's no red dot on the laser and i

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.090 
there's no red dot on the laser and i
actually<00:04:22.930> took<00:04:23.170> a<00:04:23.260> little<00:04:23.380> magnifying<00:04:23.860> glass

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100
