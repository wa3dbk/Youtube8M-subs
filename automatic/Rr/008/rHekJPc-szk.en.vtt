00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.770
 in this pill of techniques we go to 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.990
 see a very simple hiring a lot 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.330
 modern that we can use both 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.910
 on basic nurses who know about pop ups 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.949
 the floats for once do not 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.130
 we use single hole coal we use 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.280
 an extremely soft woven from 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 twenty books in addition to the braided we have 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.480
 need a swivel with rings 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.460
 different 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.500
 we have a sleigh bells ring like 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.270
 you can see is a traditional breeds 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.199
 and a ring has been inserted 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.870
 second ring of increased diameter a 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.569
 i love measure pretty generous a 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.519
 elastic that we will need for the trigger 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:51.949
 let's see the procedure now 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:56.249
 procedure starts from the races around the 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:00.269
 sigel ring is braided let's make a 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:03.620
 Click on any secure node 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:12.000
 let's go to the end 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:15.450
 of the ring then at the base of the ring 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.560
 let's go squeeze right into 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.200
 this way 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.920
 here you can see what it was 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:30.329
 tight at this stage with scissors 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:33.869
 we cut excess braided we choose 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:41.579
 to use about thirty centimeters of 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:44.039
 braided we cut now it is up to the hook la 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.109
 pier we are going to insert inside 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.759
 of the swivel eyelet on the side 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.759
 where we made the little knot 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.719
 this is where we come from 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.719
 to find 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.890
 now we have two alternatives for knotting 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.190
 of braided make a snelling or do 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.030
 a knotless and I'd say let's do it 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:16.220
 smelling which is certainly much more 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.860
 elegant of the classic without knot we will have 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.550
 which once performed at the node from 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.440
 sliver ring has the chance to run 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.410
 along the stem of the hook freely 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.410
 we quickly carry out a snelling 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:40.940
 we will do 78 rotations for this type of 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.090
 node that we have already seen several times 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.540
 during the various episodes of emotions car 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:52.270
 phishing and we insert from the outside to 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.270
 the braided interior 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.900
 and we have this configuration as 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.510
 you could was extremely trivial 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.850
 procedure at this point involves the use 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.940
 of the elastic which elastic there 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.800
 will serve as a hair to trigger the 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.800
 bourhis a small noose 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:33.700
 inside this noose we transfer 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:36.640
 a pair of bolis that will be the 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.710
 our trigger we can choose if two 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.800
 floating bolis or a policy 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:45.520
 founding a floating bolis for a 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:51.010
 disco so called a snow man 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:55.000
 this is the rig once completed and 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.560
 it is very high quality 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.770
 simple to build in all 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.770
 conditions
