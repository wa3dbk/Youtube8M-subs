running all over but that's just about

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.180 
running all over but that's just about
the<00:07:55.060> way<00:07:55.150> the<00:07:55.300> building<00:07:56.070> congradulations<00:07:57.070> you

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:57.190 
the way the building congradulations you

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.040 
the way the building congradulations you
should<00:07:57.400> have<00:07:57.610> the<00:07:57.910> complete<00:07:58.390> unit<00:07:58.690> installed

00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.050 
should have the complete unit installed

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.900 
should have the complete unit installed
now<00:07:59.320> hopefully<00:07:59.770> with<00:08:00.040> no<00:08:00.160> extra<00:08:00.490> screws<00:08:00.730> and

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:00.910 
now hopefully with no extra screws and

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.880 
now hopefully with no extra screws and
pieces<00:08:01.210> left<00:08:01.420> over<00:08:01.600> give<00:08:02.350> it<00:08:02.470> an<00:08:02.560> hour<00:08:02.680> and<00:08:02.860> a

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:02.890 
pieces left over give it an hour and a

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.320 
pieces left over give it an hour and a
half<00:08:03.010> and<00:08:03.280> the<00:08:03.340> freezer<00:08:03.550> unit<00:08:03.880> should<00:08:04.030> start

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:04.330 
half and the freezer unit should start

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.180 
half and the freezer unit should start
to<00:08:04.420> cool<00:08:04.600> down<00:08:04.630> sufficiently<00:08:05.440> word<00:08:06.040> of

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:06.190 
to cool down sufficiently word of

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.560
