 known for her snatching ability 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.369
 tooth pieces in living fish and 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.240
 much larger cetaceans 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.180
 It takes ninth place 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.699
 gadfly larva she buries herself in a wound 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.109
 animal and matures there before 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.990
 get out 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.779
 eighth place is monkfish 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.759
 male chauvinism is stupid in itself but 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.309
 certain types of animals he would 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.610
 impossible in principle females of the sea 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.790
 hell is massive creatures with huge 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.040
 masculine teeth on their not quite 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.440
 imperceptible they just fertilize 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.050
 when the female wants it 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.690
 seventh place is emerald 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.510
 cockroach wasp like ants go crazy 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.760
 from the fungus is known by almost all unknown 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.820
 emerald cockroach wasp which 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.940
 turns into a bomb cockroaches she plunges 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.949
 in the head of a cockroach sting paralyzing nerve 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.409
 centers pulls into the burrow and 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.020
 wall him there alone with 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.409
 growing larva that devours 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.140
 still alive the sixth helpless victim 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.990
 the place is occupied by the fish-drop I dwell 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.100
 off the coast of australia and tasmania usually 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.360
 at a depth of 600 to 1200 meters 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.850
 jelly-like torso allows and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.770
 withstand tremendous water pressure due to 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.140
 frequent cases of illegal fishing 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.570
 it is not very attractive and sea 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.390
 the creature is under threat of the world 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.640
 the fifth place is taken by a star-worm 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.980
 insectivorous mammal family 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.810
 Mole is found only in 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.080
 southeastern canada and northeast 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.420
 Us outer starfly is different from 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.690
 ordinary moles only with the structure of the stigma 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.240
 as a rosette of 22 soft rays when 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.640
 starfighter looking for food mrs you are rays on 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.220
 stigma constantly moves when it is 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.620
 get pinched together in a compact 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.200
 bundle while eating the animal front 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.020
 paws holds even when he drinks something 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.509
 submerges all the stigmas for 5 seconds 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.450
 Axolotl fourth place 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.240
 larval form of an amphibian family 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.820
 ambystomy lives in mountain ponds mexico 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.459
 axolotl grows on the sides of the head 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.970
 long shaggy twigs of three each 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.430
 sides it is gills periodically grub 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.890
 presses them to the body shakes off to have 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.680
 to remove organic residue 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.660
 lost axolotl long wide that 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.480
 well helps him when swimming 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.480
 it is interesting that the axolotl breathe through the gills 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.850
 and light if the water is poorly saturated 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.220
 oxygen axolotl goes to 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.830
 pulmonary respiration and eventually gills 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.590
 it partially atrophies the total length 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.110
 its up to 30 centimeters axolotl lead 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.780
 very calm measured life 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.110
 without worrying too much energy 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.360
 they lie quietly at the bottom sometimes wagging 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.880
 tail rise to the surface of the water 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.730
 for breath but this predators 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.670
 third ambush ambush 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.769
 place is narwhal this is unicorn mika 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.200
 feeding families of unicorn 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.600
 Narwhal is introduced into high latitudes in 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.990
 the Arctic Ocean and 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.210
 north atlantic why by 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.460
 narwhal u not exactly defined but 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.520
 definitely not to punch 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.670
 a crust of ice is believed by many 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.950
 the researchers 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.290
 this tusk is a sensitive organ and 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.810
 most likely helps a mammal 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.010
 feel pressure changes 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.510
 temperature and concentration weighted 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.240
 particles in water 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.520
 crossing narvaly probably cleaned tusks 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.730
 them from growths second place 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.550
 moon fish or mola mola this fish can 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.040
 have a length of more than 3 meters hang 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.900
 about one and a half tons the biggest 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.900
 a copy of the moon fish was caught in 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.180
 new hampshire usa its length was 5 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.180
 and a half meter in body shape fish 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.530
 reminds the drive exactly this feature 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.530
 the reason for the Latin 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.380
 the names of the moon fish have a large skin 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.320
 the thickness is elastic and its surface 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.970
 covered with small bone protrusions 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.160
 larvae of this species and juveniles 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.260
 swim in the usual way 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.290
 large adult fish swim on their side 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.390
 moving the fins quietly they seem to lie 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.430
 on the surface of the water where they are very easy 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.010
 notice and catch however many 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.620
 experts believe that they float 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.660
 only sick fish as an argument 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.880
 they lead the fact that the stomach has 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.680
 fish caught on the surface usually 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.930
 empty 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.020
 first place takes lamprey view 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.270
 threatened with destruction 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.030
 reaches a length of 120 centimeters and mass 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.550
 three kilograms spawn in june beginning 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.800
 July 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.890
 in rivers the male builds a nest with a diameter 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.440
 about 50 centimeters and guarding it after 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.260
 spawning makers die larvae 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.360
 live in a river 56 years after metamorphosis 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.060
 young lamprey roll into the sea 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.460
 sea ​​period about three years sea they 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.490
 stick to the fish and becomes their 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.770
 external parasites thanks for watching 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.770
 with you was Vlad 205 all bye
