 Aioli sauce

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.140
 I also leave you here during the time we are going to 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.479
 start 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.980
 we have put a big paella on fire 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.870
 and we will add plenty of olive oil 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.760
 we already have the oil very hot and 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.260
 now let's put the sepia that we were 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.260
 cut into tiny cubes 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.180
 when we already have the Christian cuttlefish 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.180
 we will pay for the children 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.250
 with the same oil and also you 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.250
 we will put the clams so that they open 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.280
 at least they are already open to 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.280
 I will retire 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.519
 we have a little more oil in the 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.750
 pan and we will leave the data and 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.750
 Then the onion 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.410
 I've already cut it 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.200
 tiny and green pepper and also 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.760
 we carry the pepper 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.760
 has Mayan women 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.750
 when we already have the onion and the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.500
 pretty hot pepper we're going to put 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.500
 tomato 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.750
 and we will go around 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.040
 we will roll the sauce in the afternoon 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.640
 this gives it a very good flavor 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.940
 we already incorporated the sepia 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.459
 and we will give you an account 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.439
 to tell us what we spend 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.439
 fact 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.700
 we will save a bit of smoking for 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.700
 undo the ink 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.740
 and now we are going to incorporate the uned 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.140
 perfume has to be hot 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.030
 we will not put all the momentum 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.510
 if we'll put it on later if we see 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.510
 what is missing 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.470
 we read them the ink in the broth 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.220
 we will remove the caldito already with the 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.220
 series store 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.470
 we also add the garlic mince and 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.470
 parsley 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.780
 it lacked a little broth and if 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.780
 we add 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.600
 and we will remove it so that it does not 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.100
 hit us almost at the end of cooking 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.100
 we will put the clams 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.090
 once the 15 minutes have passed 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.800
 we will put out the fire and leave it 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.800
 covered 5 minutes 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.190
 and in friends we have ready 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:37.810
 to eat our black rice paella 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:42.040
 that we will accompany with the sauce aioli 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.040
