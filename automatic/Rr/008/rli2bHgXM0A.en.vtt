hit<00:00:50.399> by<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.579> huge<00:00:50.879> tsunami<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.809> Tokyo<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
hit by a huge tsunami but Tokyo is a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.099 
hit by a huge tsunami but Tokyo is a
vast<00:00:53.629> agglomeration<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:55.010> of<00:00:56.360> urban<00:00:57.360> scape<00:00:57.930> and

vast agglomeration of of urban scape and
it<00:00:58.859> certainly<00:00:59.219> stretches<00:00:59.609> all<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.760> way<00:00:59.910> out

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it certainly stretches all the way out

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.900 
it certainly stretches all the way out
to<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> East<00:01:01.469> Coast<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.219> as
