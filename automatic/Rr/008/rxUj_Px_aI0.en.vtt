00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:10.231
Good morning guys

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:12.076
Today I'll explain how to

00:00:12.176 --> 00:00:13.996
use PS3 Proxy server

00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:17.645
we use this program to download

00:00:18.348 --> 00:00:21.148
big size games and updates from PSN store

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:24.525
by using PC

00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:29.852
Just BLAH BLAH BLAH

00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:54.886
first thing we need to download the program

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.680
you can find it in description

00:01:02.178 --> 00:01:04.978
you must install .NET Framework 1.1

00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:16.346
now I'll explaing each setting

00:01:21.412 --> 00:01:23.232
go to network setting

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.370
go to your connection

00:01:30.268 --> 00:01:32.088
then click on details

00:01:36.503 --> 00:01:38.323
the one thing we need is

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:40.025
is your IP address

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.110
form me is 100.100.100.102

00:01:45.852 --> 00:01:47.952
this IP we should write it

00:01:48.522 --> 00:01:50.342
in PS3 proxy server

00:01:54.354 --> 00:01:56.454
here you'll write your IP address

00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:00.376
100.100.100.102

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:03.995
port default 8080

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.844
tick on PS3 mode

00:02:09.074 --> 00:02:10.474
then START

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.910
Now my pc is like the server

00:02:16.824 --> 00:02:18.644
now we should go to PS3

00:02:19.484 --> 00:02:21.584
and do some changes to settings

00:02:27.203 --> 00:02:30.003
after you did all required steps in PC

00:02:42.174 --> 00:02:44.974
the prev steps was to make PC like server

00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:48.675
so we fool the PS3 to make him thing he's

00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:51.205
connected to Sony servers

00:02:55.814 --> 00:02:58.614
right now I don't have any new games

00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:00.806
to update except for Call of duty

00:03:05.978 --> 00:03:08.078
first go to Network settings

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:12.258
then Internet connection settings

00:03:16.253 --> 00:03:18.353
depends on your connection

00:03:18.614 --> 00:03:22.114
wireless or wire you should
choose the proper settings

00:03:24.912 --> 00:03:27.712
keep all default settings
except for Proxy Server

00:03:32.516 --> 00:03:34.616
at Proxy server choose "USE"

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.149
in IP address field enter your PC IP

00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:42.962
that we found in previous steps

00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:49.491
port by default 8080

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.390
and save

00:03:55.638 --> 00:03:57.038
without tests

00:04:01.285 --> 00:04:03.385
now we connected the PS3 to PC

00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:08.631
now go launch the game

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.879

00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:26.763
click on ok to start download

00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:47.217
after few seconds press cancel

00:04:52.235 --> 00:04:54.055
now we will back to PC

00:05:07.054 --> 00:05:09.854
after we start the download and cancel it

00:05:12.257 --> 00:05:14.077
go to "Logs" tap

00:05:16.462 --> 00:05:19.262

00:05:26.991 --> 00:05:29.791
right click on link and "copy shortcut"

00:05:33.985 --> 00:05:36.085

00:05:37.718 --> 00:05:39.538
and start download

00:05:49.486 --> 00:05:52.986
to be more organized just
put updates in one folder

00:06:05.534 --> 00:06:09.034
I've download it yesterday so no
need to download it again :P

00:06:14.197 --> 00:06:16.997
after download finished we copy the link

00:06:21.478 --> 00:06:23.578
and go to "Replace files" tap

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.950
as you see here first field
on left is for download link

00:06:38.597 --> 00:06:41.397
if your have more than one game or update

00:06:41.327 --> 00:06:43.427
just press on "Add" button

00:06:49.387 --> 00:06:51.487

now you're almost done.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.380
after you start the game and select download

00:07:49.842 --> 00:07:51.662
Yaaaaaa, its 20x faster.

00:07:59.358 --> 00:08:02.158
if you use wire connection
between router and PS3

00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:04.615
it will be 100x faster

00:08:06.691 --> 00:08:08.791
