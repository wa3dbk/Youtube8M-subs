00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
stems of kelp so although that is drift

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.470 
stems of kelp so although that is drift
we<00:00:45.180> that's<00:00:46.100> been<00:00:47.100> uprooted<00:00:47.730> by<00:00:48.270> though

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
we that's been uprooted by though

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.990 
we that's been uprooted by though
probably<00:00:48.840> by<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> action<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.739> waves<00:00:50.000> so

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
probably by the action of the waves so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.119 
probably by the action of the waves so
that<00:00:51.030> might<00:00:51.329> well<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.629> kind<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.110> dead<00:00:52.860> in

that might well be kind of dead in
seaweed<00:00:53.550> terms<00:00:54.230> but<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.430> Dahl's<00:00:56.699> is

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910

seaweed terms but that the Dahl's is
still<00:00:57.149> alive<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.100> we<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.280> tear<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> bit<00:00:59.730> off<00:01:02.449> of

ourselves been a survival food what else

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.859 
ourselves been a survival food what else
we've<00:01:10.770> got<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:10.890> we've<00:01:11.100> got<00:01:11.189> some<00:01:11.630> men<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
we've got here we've got some men for a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.670 
we've got here we've got some men for a
war<00:01:13.049> fur<00:01:14.479> which<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.600> often<00:01:15.900> called<00:01:16.049> gut<00:01:16.320> weeds

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.380 

that's<00:01:19.680> often<00:01:20.100> sold<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.549> health<00:01:20.850> food<00:01:21.090> shops

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that's often sold in health food shops

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.090 
that's often sold in health food shops
and<00:01:21.570> no<00:01:21.659> packets<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:23.040> sea<00:01:23.400> lettuce<00:01:24.979> but<00:01:25.979> it's

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
and no packets as sea lettuce but it's

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.770 
and no packets as sea lettuce but it's
got<00:01:26.280> weed<00:01:26.460> got<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.000> quite<00:01:27.240> careful<00:01:27.270> when

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
got weed got to be quite careful when

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.980 
got weed got to be quite careful when
you're<00:01:27.900> picking<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:29.340> quite<00:01:29.490> tasty<00:01:29.990> but

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you're picking it just quite tasty but

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.679 
you're picking it just quite tasty but
it<00:01:31.110> does<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.530> freshwater<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.329> does<00:01:33.509> like

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
it does like freshwater and it does like

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.899 
it does like freshwater and it does like
polluted<00:01:34.110> water<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:35.579> doesn't<00:01:35.610> necessarily

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
polluted water so it doesn't necessarily

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.819 
polluted water so it doesn't necessarily
mean<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.570> water<00:01:36.689> here<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.170> polluted<00:01:37.680> but

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
mean that the water here is polluted but

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.899 
mean that the water here is polluted but
you've<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.040> got<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.729> fairly<00:01:39.270> careful

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.429 

we<00:01:42.909> just<00:01:43.270> reach<00:01:43.570> down<00:01:43.600> here<00:01:45.090> they're<00:01:46.439> growing

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
we just reach down here they're growing

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.319 
we just reach down here they're growing
there<00:01:47.740> that's<00:01:48.610> interesting<00:01:49.180> it<00:01:50.170> is<00:01:50.289> a<00:01:50.320> bit<00:01:50.530> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
there that's interesting it is a bit of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.740 
there that's interesting it is a bit of
Congress<00:01:52.329> Christmas<00:01:52.869> Kerrigan<00:01:53.789> that's<00:01:54.789> quite

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
Congress Christmas Kerrigan that's quite

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.240 
Congress Christmas Kerrigan that's quite
high<00:01:56.049> up<00:01:56.259> for<00:01:56.470> Kerrigan

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
high up for Kerrigan

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
but that grows that you get dense Tufts

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.609 
but that grows that you get dense Tufts
