00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
start the up so this is it unfortunately

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.620 
start the up so this is it unfortunately
you<00:00:18.720> can't<00:00:18.960> use<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.410> left<00:00:19.650> stick<00:00:19.890> yet<00:00:20.630> because

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
you can't use the left stick yet because

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.650 
you can't use the left stick yet because
um<00:00:23.990> to<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.769> move<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.430> Camry<00:00:26.939> after<00:00:27.330> all<00:00:27.449> done

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
um to to move the Camry after all done

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.490 
um to to move the Camry after all done
l1<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.769> then<00:00:29.240> just<00:00:30.240> move<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.840> so

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
l1 and then just move like that so

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.930 
l1 and then just move like that so
that's<00:00:32.040> not<00:00:33.030> too<00:00:33.840> good<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.950> controls<00:00:35.399> are

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
that's not too good but the controls are

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.720 
that's not too good but the controls are
fine<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.469> doesn't<00:00:37.710> really<00:00:37.800> bother<00:00:37.950> me<00:00:38.399> too

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
fine so it doesn't really bother me too

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.910 
fine so it doesn't really bother me too
much<00:00:40.489> it<00:00:41.489> looks<00:00:41.520> better<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.300> v12<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.079> it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
much it looks better on the v12 so it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.299

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
upsets easier to play on the Vita than

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.870 
upsets easier to play on the Vita than
the<00:01:05.519> PSP<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.330> preserve<00:01:07.400> firstly<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.580> shape

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the PSP but preserve firstly the shape

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.929 
the PSP but preserve firstly the shape
of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.150> console<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.080> secondly<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.100> analog

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
of the console and secondly the analog

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.590 
of the console and secondly the analog
sticks<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.689> button<00:01:13.310> configuration<00:01:14.600> so

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
sticks and button configuration so

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.490 
sticks and button configuration so
that's<00:01:16.200> my<00:01:16.439> thoughts<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.790> game<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:21.500> yeah

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500

that's my thoughts on this game and yeah
I<00:01:22.770> would<00:01:23.189> definitely<00:01:23.400> recommend<00:01:23.939> by<00:01:24.540> this

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
I would definitely recommend by this

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.120 
I would definitely recommend by this
game<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.170> you've<00:01:25.290> got<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> space<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.100> your

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
game if you've got the space on your

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.950 
game if you've got the space on your
memory<00:01:26.580> stick<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:27.060> takes<00:01:27.299> up<00:01:27.570> about<00:01:29.780> I'll<00:01:30.780> just

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
memory stick it takes up about I'll just

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.620 
memory stick it takes up about I'll just
check<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:32.210> information<00:01:35.150> 1163<00:01:36.150> megabytes

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
check that information 1163 megabytes

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.690 
check that information 1163 megabytes
not<00:01:37.170> too<00:01:37.470> bad<00:01:37.680> that's<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.189> over<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.520> gigabyte

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
not too bad that's just over a gigabyte

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.039 
not too bad that's just over a gigabyte
and<00:01:40.490> even<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.880> smallest<00:01:42.240> memory<00:01:42.810> stick

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and even the smallest memory stick

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.130 
and even the smallest memory stick
before<00:01:43.259> gig<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:43.979> handle<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.909> yeah<00:01:45.899> I'll

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
before gig can handle up so yeah I'll

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.899 
before gig can handle up so yeah I'll

car<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:25.280> yeah<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:29.010> buttons<00:02:29.670> work<00:02:30.599> well<00:02:30.900> with

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
car and yeah the buttons work well with

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.050 
car and yeah the buttons work well with
this<00:02:31.290> game<00:02:31.560> as<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.280> can<00:02:32.430> see<00:02:32.610> I'm<00:02:32.730> using<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
this game as you can see I'm using the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.360 
this game as you can see I'm using the
right<00:02:33.300> stick<00:02:33.660> or<00:02:33.900> left<00:02:34.140> stick<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.590> run

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
right stick or left stick so to run

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.300 
right stick or left stick so to run
around<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:36.510> then<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:37.890> like<00:02:38.069> playing

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
around and then it's just like playing

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.729 
around and then it's just like playing
with<00:02:39.030> these<00:02:39.269> controls<00:02:39.930> since<00:02:40.470> they're

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
with these controls since they're

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.180 
with these controls since they're
probably<00:02:41.549> better<00:02:42.090> than<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.480> PSP<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.380> layout

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
probably better than the PSP the layout

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.800 
probably better than the PSP the layout
of<00:02:44.220> them<00:02:44.640> I'd<00:02:44.910> say<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.269> just<00:02:45.450> like<00:02:45.600> playing

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
of them I'd say it's just like playing

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.789 
of them I'd say it's just like playing
it<00:02:46.110> on<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.590> ps3<00:02:47.549> but<00:02:48.360> without<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.260> analog<00:02:49.530> stick

it on a ps3 but without the analog stick
of<00:02:49.920> course<00:02:50.989> so<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.019> itself<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.950> an<00:02:53.370> advantage

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
of course so that itself is an advantage

on<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> PlayStation<00:03:01.380> Store<00:03:01.819> so<00:03:02.819> that's<00:03:03.330> a

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
on the PlayStation Store so that's a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.360 
on the PlayStation Store so that's a
that's<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.170> bargain<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.890> game<00:03:05.220> because

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
that's a bargain for this game because

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.870 
that's a bargain for this game because
it's<00:03:05.609> easily<00:03:06.030> than<00:03:06.540> last<00:03:06.810> year<00:03:07.079> about<00:03:07.880> the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
it's easily than last year about the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.030 
it's easily than last year about the
story<00:03:09.180> alone<00:03:09.570> that's<00:03:09.930> about<00:03:10.109> 15<00:03:10.620> hours<00:03:10.769> I

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
story alone that's about 15 hours I

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.729 
story alone that's about 15 hours I
think<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.579> then<00:03:11.730> hundred<00:03:12.600> percent<00:03:12.989> will<00:03:13.380> take

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
think and then hundred percent will take

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.250 
think and then hundred percent will take
probably<00:03:14.160> another<00:03:14.760> 15<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.600> on<00:03:15.690> top<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.079> that

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
probably another 15 and on top of that

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.949 
probably another 15 and on top of that
