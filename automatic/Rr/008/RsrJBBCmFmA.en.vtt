00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
going on here just blackness all around

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.520 
going on here just blackness all around
and<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:56.160> can<00:02:56.370> make<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.480> really<00:02:58.080> cool<00:02:58.320> house

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530

and you can make a really cool house
right<00:02:58.860> here<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.180> just<00:03:00.260> expands<00:03:01.260> poor<00:03:02.250> a

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
right here and it just expands poor a
