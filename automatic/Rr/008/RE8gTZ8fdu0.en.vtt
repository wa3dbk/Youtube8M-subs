hey<00:00:02.399> this<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:02.760> Brady<00:00:03.380> pictures<00:00:04.380> are<00:00:04.529> going<00:00:04.650> to

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
hey this is Brady pictures are going to

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.200 
hey this is Brady pictures are going to
be<00:00:04.770> hard<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.040> do<00:00:05.190> so<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.490> thought<00:00:05.730> I'd<00:00:05.850> just<00:00:06.000> do<00:00:06.180> a

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
be hard to do so I thought I'd just do a

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.080 
be hard to do so I thought I'd just do a
little<00:00:06.359> video<00:00:07.220> this<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.460> inside<00:00:08.970> the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
little video this is inside the

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.200 
little video this is inside the
transmission<00:00:10.190> differentials<00:00:11.190> out<00:00:11.340> input

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
transmission differentials out input

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.090 
transmission differentials out input
shaft<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.660> out<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.590> have<00:00:13.799> my<00:00:14.030> output<00:00:15.030> shaft

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
shaft is out and I have my output shaft

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.849 
shaft is out and I have my output shaft
sitting<00:00:17.100> down<00:00:17.250> here<00:00:17.640> there's<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.410> race<00:00:19.410> and

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
sitting down here there's a race and

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.160 
sitting down here there's a race and
they<00:00:20.100> pump<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:21.330> race<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.840> tapered

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
they pump the race and the tapered

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.439 
they pump the race and the tapered
bearing<00:00:23.390> I<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.170> upper<00:00:25.470> bearing<00:00:26.449> reverse

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
bearing I have the upper bearing reverse

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.890 
bearing I have the upper bearing reverse
gear<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.460> five<00:00:29.910> are<00:00:30.179> synchro<00:00:30.660> off

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
gear and the the five are synchro off

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.410 
gear and the the five are synchro off
what<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.859> see<00:00:32.040> right<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.809> this<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:35.210> this<00:00:36.210> is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
what you see right here this is this is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.510 
what you see right here this is this is
sort<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.469> think<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> fifth<00:00:38.280> year

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
sort of this is I think is a fifth year

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.970 
sort of this is I think is a fifth year
on<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.480> input<00:00:39.780> shaft<00:00:40.309> and<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:42.059> actually<00:00:42.570> spins

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
on the input shaft and it actually spins

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.799 
on the input shaft and it actually spins
on<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.520> shaft<00:00:44.789> until<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.239> gets<00:00:45.390> locked<00:00:45.570> into

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
on the shaft until it gets locked into

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.630 
on the shaft until it gets locked into
place<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.379> that's<00:00:46.500> what<00:00:46.680> your<00:00:46.829> synchro<00:00:47.399> does

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
place and that's what your synchro does

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.549 
place and that's what your synchro does
so<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.210> take<00:00:49.020> my<00:00:49.320> synchro<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.600> put<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.840> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
so I take my synchro and put it on and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.660 
so I take my synchro and put it on and
you'll<00:00:52.739> notice<00:00:52.920> right<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:55.460> there<00:00:56.460> are<00:00:56.579> these

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
you'll notice right here there are these

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.139 
you'll notice right here there are these
little<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:58.010> think<00:00:59.010> they<00:00:59.129> may<00:00:59.250> be<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.489> cones<00:00:59.760> I'm

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
little I think they may be the cones I'm

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.729 
little I think they may be the cones I'm
not<00:01:00.390> sure<00:01:00.600> no<00:01:00.960> that's<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.350> code<00:01:01.500> that's<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
not sure no that's not the code that's a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.680 
not sure no that's not the code that's a
different<00:01:01.980> part<00:01:02.129> sorry<00:01:02.489> I'm<00:01:02.670> not<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.090> don't

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
different part sorry I'm not I don't

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.080 
different part sorry I'm not I don't
know<00:01:03.870> my<00:01:04.080> technical<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.769> since<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.820> is

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
know my technical here since this is

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.179 
know my technical here since this is
very<00:01:06.180> new<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.600> me<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:07.560> that's<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> synchro

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
very new to me but that's the synchro

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.730 
very new to me but that's the synchro
this<00:01:08.580> little<00:01:08.850> line<00:01:09.479> around<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.439> spring

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
this little line around it is the spring

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
this little line around it is the spring
and<00:01:11.430> then<00:01:12.420> from<00:01:12.630> there<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.799> take<00:01:14.040> your<00:01:14.750> your

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
and then from there you take your your

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.810 
and then from there you take your your
synchro<00:01:16.470> gear<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.250> actually<00:01:17.549> pressed

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
synchro gear and it's actually pressed

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.149 
synchro gear and it's actually pressed
on<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.509> set<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.009> make

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
on but we can set it on and you make

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.920 
on but we can set it on and you make
sure<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.549> gets<00:01:20.640> lined<00:01:21.000> up<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:23.330> have<00:01:24.330> no<00:01:24.540> light<00:01:24.750> in

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
sure it gets lined up I have no light in

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.859 
sure it gets lined up I have no light in
here<00:01:25.110> sorry<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:27.060> make<00:01:27.210> sure<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.479> gets<00:01:27.540> lined

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
here sorry you make sure it gets lined

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.749 
here sorry you make sure it gets lined
up<00:01:28.759> with<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> synchro<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.840> when<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.140> comes

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
up with the synchro so when that comes

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.870 
up with the synchro so when that comes
down<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.360> will<00:01:33.659> line<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:36.020> then<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.880> what

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
down it will line up then you have what

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.080 
down it will line up then you have what
is<00:01:39.290> your<00:01:40.290> slider<00:01:40.619> now<00:01:41.100> I've<00:01:41.310> marked<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.790> here

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
is your slider now I've marked on here

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.480 
is your slider now I've marked on here
and<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.899> kind<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.110> worn<00:01:43.290> off<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.890> it's

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and it's kind of worn off and it's

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.359 
and it's kind of worn off and it's
probably<00:01:44.700> pretty<00:01:44.939> impossible<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:46.369> but

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
probably pretty impossible to see but

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.280 
probably pretty impossible to see but
where<00:01:47.520> those<00:01:47.670> two<00:01:47.880> lines<00:01:48.149> are<00:01:48.450> all<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> way

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
where those two lines are all the way

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.230 
where those two lines are all the way
around<00:01:49.470> there's<00:01:49.619> three<00:01:49.829> pairs<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:52.070> larger

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
around there's three pairs of larger

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.830 
around there's three pairs of larger
teeth<00:01:54.530> now<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.880> initially<00:01:56.880> was<00:01:57.390> putting<00:01:57.689> those

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
teeth now I initially was putting those

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.600 
teeth now I initially was putting those
teeth<00:01:58.759> in<00:01:59.899> in<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.710> gaps<00:02:01.920> because<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.399> was<00:02:02.520> like

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
teeth in in the gaps because I was like

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.980 
teeth in in the gaps because I was like
oh<00:02:02.729> yeah<00:02:02.939> certainly<00:02:03.390> that's<00:02:03.540> how<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.810> goes

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
oh yeah certainly that's how it goes

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.109 
oh yeah certainly that's how it goes
because<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.610> came<00:02:05.759> apart

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
because this is the one that came apart

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.109 
because this is the one that came apart
on<00:02:06.240> me<00:02:06.360> while<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.630> was<00:02:06.659> rebuilding<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.259> well

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
on me while I was rebuilding it well

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.600 
on me while I was rebuilding it well
if<00:02:10.119> I<00:02:10.299> would<00:02:10.450> have<00:02:10.509> read<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:11.430> manual<00:02:12.430> better

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
if I would have read the manual better

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.339 
if I would have read the manual better
I'm<00:02:12.909> sorry<00:02:13.239> for<00:02:13.390> my<00:02:13.480> videoing<00:02:13.870> skills<00:02:14.140> they're

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
I'm sorry for my videoing skills they're

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.780 
I'm sorry for my videoing skills they're
horrible<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.890> would<00:02:15.220> read<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.459> manual<00:02:15.760> a

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
horrible I would read the manual a

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.860 
horrible I would read the manual a
little<00:02:16.000> better<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.239> would<00:02:16.480> have<00:02:16.569> found<00:02:16.689> that

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
little better I would have found that

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.390 
little better I would have found that
there<00:02:17.079> and<00:02:17.439> if<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:17.950> would<00:02:18.069> have<00:02:18.129> actually

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
there and if I would have actually

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.539 
there and if I would have actually
looked<00:02:18.640> there<00:02:18.879> are<00:02:19.000> two<00:02:20.099> larger<00:02:21.099> sets<00:02:21.400> of

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
looked there are two larger sets of

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.259 
looked there are two larger sets of
teeth<00:02:22.319> where<00:02:23.319> those<00:02:23.470> mesh<00:02:23.739> up<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.250> when<00:02:25.060> those

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
teeth where those mesh up and when those

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.809 
teeth where those mesh up and when those
when<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.349> gears<00:02:26.560> are<00:02:26.799> installed<00:02:27.489> on<00:02:27.579> those

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
when the gears are installed on those

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.430 
when the gears are installed on those
are<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.420> sliders<00:02:28.659> and<00:02:28.870> salt<00:02:29.079> in<00:02:29.140> those<00:02:29.230> teeth

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
are the sliders and salt in those teeth

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.130 
are the sliders and salt in those teeth
correctly<00:02:29.920> it'll<00:02:30.790> pop<00:02:31.030> over<00:02:31.299> that<00:02:31.450> spring<00:02:31.780> and

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
correctly it'll pop over that spring and

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.970 
correctly it'll pop over that spring and
it<00:02:32.620> will<00:02:32.769> catch<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:34.360> bottom<00:02:34.650> synchro<00:02:35.650> and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
it will catch the bottom synchro and

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.009 
it will catch the bottom synchro and
it'll<00:02:36.220> catch<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.430> ring<00:02:36.819> which<00:02:37.720> makes<00:02:37.930> your

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
it'll catch the ring which makes your

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.780 
it'll catch the ring which makes your
fifth<00:02:38.230> gear<00:02:38.409> spin<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:38.920> then<00:02:39.010> when<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:39.549> it

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
fifth gear spin and then when you it

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.250 
fifth gear spin and then when you it
pops<00:02:40.000> up<00:02:40.150> it'll<00:02:40.450> do<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.659> same<00:02:40.840> thing<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
pops up it'll do the same thing to the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.970 
pops up it'll do the same thing to the
reverse<00:02:41.530> gear<00:02:41.799> so<00:02:42.549> anyway<00:02:43.349> newbie<00:02:44.349> mistake<00:02:44.500> I

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
reverse gear so anyway newbie mistake I

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.050 
reverse gear so anyway newbie mistake I
guess<00:02:45.909> that's<00:02:46.090> why<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.629> like<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.470> learn

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
guess that's why I like to learn

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.830 
guess that's why I like to learn
unfortunately<00:02:49.060> it's<00:02:49.239> frustrating<00:02:49.629> at<00:02:49.810> times

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
unfortunately it's frustrating at times

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.780 
unfortunately it's frustrating at times
but<00:02:50.260> that's<00:02:51.040> what<00:02:51.250> I'm<00:02:51.310> going<00:02:51.489> through

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
but that's what I'm going through

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.480 
but that's what I'm going through
