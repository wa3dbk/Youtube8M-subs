 past technology and how I 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.040
 They sent me a comment to show 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.930
 a little more from the iphone by calling 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.850

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.220

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.020

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.310
 the little man then I 'm here without 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.280
 make up 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.130
 Actually, it's because I came home. 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.700
 and I stayed practically all day 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:43.239

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.670
 plus she's from the same area and I 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.050
 then the flight was towing the nail 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.059
 It's easy but I have to make a video 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.040
 even though here to do it for you guys 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.829
 also you like it, it's good then 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.950
 Let's get started, then we can. 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:01.030
 here the iphone 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.070
 iphone here tomorrow then people 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.799
 sorry for the bad image 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.069
 but since this camera 14 years 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.810
 today she is not so good here at 

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.850
 iphone on then will not have a 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.219
 definition as good as that 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.349
 so here we are the first page on the 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:21.490
 I have three pages the first page has 

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:25.569
 here the messages is the calendar 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:30.999
 photo album the camera weather 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:34.569
 salame the teams have the maps of the 20 years 

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:39.459
 with chaplin father captive show or grandparents 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:42.009
 time values ​​both ullah and help the 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:46.060
 and here below it is that they are here 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.989
 telephone and mail or internet 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.239
 search 

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:51.219
 so folks I'm going to teach that I'm going 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:52.900
 show you guys right? 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.910
 it's the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.640
 like I went back a little bit my 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.480
 iPhone battery then went here 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.940
 lets press I went that in the adjustments 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.000
 and the settings do not have everything else here 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.940
 wifi these things there have central here 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.180
 notifications still 50 to 60 ante 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.920
 notifications you can pick up sativa 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.440
 some applications that you are not 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.060
 using not to appear in the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.170
 screen locked so you do not spend more 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.760
 energy 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.070
 I left only two that the message 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.720
 phones and the rest are the 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.990
 applications I'm not being time 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.400
 and I leave here it is easier to put a 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.490
 little battery 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.370
 then another method that I met 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.940
 was that the privacy of privacy 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.010
 to you have the contact thing pictures and 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.840
 a microphone you disable from some 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.880
 applications like that is not necessary 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.620
 at that time and when it is necessary 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.320
 you active right? 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.209
 so I have since I did not 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.050
 I want to count I see contact 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.870
 digital 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.000
 there I leave it closed and there's also a 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.989
 another tip is we have this one 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.480
 little button né 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.690
 this button helps a lot because 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.790
 It happens like a lot of people can 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.690
 break the right button from below the 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.180
 button from up on then they 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.360
 made that auxiliary button that he does 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.530
 with what it blocks in a niche 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.170
 of the folder 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.480
 here it is cool I liked me 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.560
 used to use so we are here 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.330
 were told that it is me that I 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.750
 that I found on the internet me too 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.519
 I started to learn when I was really 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.120
 the iphone is not as good for the second 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.709
 page 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.989
 I'll show you my 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.640
 applications are and also some 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.519
 phone functions then we have 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.209
 here when the 1 when I bought the 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.030
 iphone 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.970
 I just bought when I finished when 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:53.320
 they have already called up to put the chip has 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.600
 here what you already have here such a folder 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.370
 now the iphone now has the system 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.690
 tablets for you to organize properly 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.710
 for not having applications or 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.840
 Spanish 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.330
 so attention to the small is also the 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.570
