think<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:54.989> cool<00:00:55.350> getting<00:00:55.829> higher

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
think is really cool getting higher

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.250 
think is really cool getting higher
payout<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:56.879> replaying<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.930> highest

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
payout for replaying the highest

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.930 
payout for replaying the highest
missions<00:00:58.620> definitely<00:00:59.399> gonna<00:00:59.520> attract

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
missions definitely gonna attract

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.840 
missions definitely gonna attract
players<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.629> replay<00:01:01.140> highs<00:01:01.710> over<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.670> over

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
players to replay highs over and over

players to replay highs over and over
again<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.870> also<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> minimum<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
assuming the minimum payout will be

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.080 
assuming the minimum payout will be
greater<00:01:10.020> amount<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.710> request<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.460> high<00:01:11.670> street

greater amount and request a high street

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.630 
greater amount and request a high street
it<00:01:12.479> should<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.990> greater<00:01:13.409> payout<00:01:13.920> otherwise

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
it should be a greater payout otherwise

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.940 
it should be a greater payout otherwise
we're<00:01:15.030> gonna<00:01:15.119> lose<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.570> lot<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.900> money<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.740> also

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
there are 126 periods of course this

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.819 
there are 126 periods of course this
means<00:01:28.710> more<00:01:29.400> RP<00:01:29.909> &amp;<00:01:30.090> money<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.079> period<00:01:31.500> six

finish the highest for example like less

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.480 
finish the highest for example like less
than<00:02:00.149> five<00:02:00.450> minutes<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.380> silver<00:02:01.890> less

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
than five minutes for the silver less

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.280 
than five minutes for the silver less
than<00:02:02.729> 10<00:02:03.000> minutes<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.719> got<00:02:03.869> bronze

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
than 10 minutes and if you got bronze

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.740 
than 10 minutes and if you got bronze
you<00:02:04.770> took<00:02:05.009> more<00:02:05.369> time<00:02:05.670> than<00:02:05.700> 10<00:02:06.509> minutes

you took more time than 10 minutes

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
you took more time than 10 minutes
that's<00:02:07.200> what<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.530> think<00:02:07.770> there's<00:02:08.580> gonna<00:02:08.729> be

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that's what I think there's gonna be

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.449 
that's what I think there's gonna be
times<00:02:09.149> thats<00:02:09.539> related<00:02:10.050> with<00:02:10.410> metals<00:02:10.890> or<00:02:11.099> maybe
