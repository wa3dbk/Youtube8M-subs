00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.590 
shape of my eyebrow just so I can join
them<00:01:29.130> together<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.390> start

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
them together so that I can start

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:40.330 
them together so that I can start
filling<00:01:30.900> in

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.410 

once<00:01:41.340> you're<00:01:41.520> happy<00:01:41.610> with<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.940> outline<00:01:42.300> that

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
once you're happy with the outline that

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.880 
once you're happy with the outline that
you've<00:01:42.540> drawn<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.140> go<00:01:43.260> ahead<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.620> fill

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you've drawn you can go ahead and fill

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.830 
you've drawn you can go ahead and fill
in<00:01:44.160> and<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.550> way<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.330> do<00:01:45.480> that<00:01:45.690> is

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
in and the way that I like to do that is

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.660 
in and the way that I like to do that is
to<00:01:46.230> do<00:01:46.350> sort<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.650> short<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.100> stroking

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
to do sort of short little stroking

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
to do sort of short little stroking
motions<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.330> direction<00:01:48.660> of<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.140> hair

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
motions in the direction of the hair

00:01:49.320 --> 00:02:07.279 
motions in the direction of the hair
growth

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.749 

next<00:02:08.289> I<00:02:08.380> wipe<00:02:08.619> off<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.920> excess<00:02:09.250> product<00:02:09.550> from

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
next I wipe off the excess product from

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.760 
next I wipe off the excess product from
my<00:02:09.940> brush<00:02:10.209> and<00:02:10.420> take<00:02:10.690> what's<00:02:10.990> left<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.470> run<00:02:11.680> it

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
my brush and take what's left and run it

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.350 
my brush and take what's left and run it
very<00:02:11.800> very<00:02:12.340> lightly<00:02:12.610> through<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.000> front<00:02:13.240> of

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
very very lightly through the front of

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.970 
very very lightly through the front of
my<00:02:13.510> brows<00:02:13.750> where<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.050> haven't<00:02:14.380> filled<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.800> yet

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
my brows where I haven't filled in yet

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.650 
my brows where I haven't filled in yet
the<00:02:15.370> reason<00:02:15.520> I<00:02:15.700> do<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.450> color

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
the reason I do that is so the color

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.270 
the reason I do that is so the color
isn't<00:02:16.959> as<00:02:17.050> concentrated<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:17.980> can<00:02:18.130> get<00:02:18.250> a

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
isn't as concentrated and I can get a

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.130 
isn't as concentrated and I can get a
nice<00:02:18.459> gradient<00:02:18.880> effect<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:19.750> I'm<00:02:19.810> just<00:02:19.959> doing

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
nice gradient effect so I'm just doing

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.840 
nice gradient effect so I'm just doing
that<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.620> short<00:02:20.830> stroking<00:02:21.280> motions<00:02:21.670> in

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
that in the short stroking motions in

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.310 
that in the short stroking motions in
the<00:02:21.970> direction<00:02:22.240> of<00:02:22.420> brow<00:02:22.630> growth<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.020> begin

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
the direction of brow growth to begin

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.020 
the direction of brow growth to begin
but<00:02:23.650> then<00:02:23.800> I'm<00:02:23.920> also<00:02:24.100> going<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.550> do<00:02:24.760> some

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
but then I'm also going to do some

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.580 
but then I'm also going to do some
upward<00:02:25.209> stroke<00:02:25.630> motions<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.200> mimic<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.560> look

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
upward stroke motions to mimic the look

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.020 
upward stroke motions to mimic the look
of<00:02:26.800> natural<00:02:26.860> hair<00:02:27.430> throughout<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.760> front<00:02:27.970> of

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
of natural hair throughout the front of

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.410 
of natural hair throughout the front of
the<00:02:28.120> brow<00:02:28.300> as<00:02:28.510> well<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:30.580> next<00:02:30.790> part<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.209> only
