00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:06.890
 everyone welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.410
 of the world apart in this opportunity 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.830
 We are going to make some earrings as 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.349
 these are made with wire and 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.900
 beadwork the beads that you want and 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.179
 they are very very easy to do so 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.780
 now I will tell you what we are going to need and 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.210
 how are they made 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.410
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.390
 the following 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.370
 We are going to need a base for our 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.440
 pending either these hooks or the 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.300
 that you like more down in the 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.000
 description of the video I'll leave you a 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.970
 link to an article that has heaps 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.440
 of bases for slopes where you can 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.860
 choose the one you like the most and the one that 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.270
 it's comfortable, we 're going to need it too 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.950
 beads that you want and the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.460
 You can also combine as you want 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.700
 we are going to need wire I have this 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.000
 which is a wire that is my lilac that is 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.060
 very finite and it is very easy to fold 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.360
 we're going to need a tip plier 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:07.530
 round to make our washers and 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:12.060
 a cutting plier so let's go to 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.970
 start the first thing we will do 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.829
 cut a piece of our wire yo 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.700
 I think I'm going to cut more or less 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.890
 bits 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.380
 once we have our piece of 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.619
 wire cut what we will do is with 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.190
 our round-nose pliers are going to 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.530
 do 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.160
 is the tip and for the most part 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.250
 we are going to make a round of 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.220
 this way 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.640
 until we have the base of our 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.640
 spiral 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.880
 that we have in this way for example 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:52.710
 here we have this and now with the fingers 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.560
 let's try to give it more shape if not 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.650
 you can shape it with your fingers you can 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.930
 continue giving it with the pliers until 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.150
 more or less you can do it later with 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.760
 the fingers because with the fingers if not with 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.130
 the pliers all because the wire is 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.960
 he usually scores a lot with him 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.330
 pliers and mosquitoes are usually left 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.810
 pretty ugly then what we 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.600
 we are going to try is that the form is 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.300
 clean enough for that 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.820
 say it so you have the smallest sample 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.430
 possible then you see that here with 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.790
 the fingers are doing little to 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.790
 little bit 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.950
 the spiral and let's make a spiral 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.680
 of the size for example of the width of a 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.250
 finger then I will continue here a 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.250
 a little more 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.980
 well less there 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.090
 and now what I'm going to do is like this 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.850
 wire is soft I'm going to do here 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.390
 a fold 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.390
 A) Yes 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.700
 to use this same wire as if 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.700
 out of a cane 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.560
 cane are called the wires that serve 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.989
 to put earrings that are as if 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.909
 were a pin about it's actually 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.909
 one is a pin-type wire 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.340
 so here I'm going to contribute more or less 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.340
 here 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.160
 with him and this is where we are going to 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.230
 start playing to put the beads 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.900
 as we want, what I am going to 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:41.670
 to do is put a purple 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.670
 I'm going to put a white here 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.090
 and another purple 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.850
 and so 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.860
 And this is when it comes part and almost 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.770
 end of the slope that is to do here 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.350
 a washer to be able to put our 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:02.970
 hook so I'm going to cut what I 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:06.690
 It remains here because it's a lot 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.710
 I think that there is also a lot to contribute 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.100
 a little more 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:15.940
 to your mind and with our pliers 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:19.519
 round point what we will do is take the 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.380
 wire and go around 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.960
 in this way 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.390
 to be able to make our washer we 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.840
 it would be like that and now it's just 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.940
 we shape with the pliers now I'm going to 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.249
 rearm here 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.840
 the earpice 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:39.060
 so that it stays this way 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.540
 that of the balls well stuck by the 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.090
 side down and on the top side and 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.360
 now we would simply have to put 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.570
 our little hook in this washer like this 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.570
 what 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.190
 over here 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.730
 I'm going to close a little more with the 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.730
 pliers 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.520
 this way I will not leave 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.960
 the things of your site and so I would stay 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.510
 the slope you see is very easy to 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.969
 do and the other one is done exactly 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.219
 same 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:21.329
 and here would be the earrings already 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:22.709
 finished as you see both 

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:25.110
 spirals have more or less stayed 

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:26.729
 similar at least like that to the naked eye 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.339
 it does not seem that one was bigger than 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.409
 another, but of course one millimeter plus one 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:34.289
 millimeter less is not seen there either 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.849
 simple view so nothing this is the 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.489
 tutorial that I had you ready for 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.259
 Today is very simple to do and I hope 

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:43.889
 that has also worked for you 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:46.379
 just as simple and nothing here you have 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.459
 something that you can give for yourselves 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.619
 same also the truth is that I 

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:50.759
 They like earrings very much and I 

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:53.610
 I'm generally doing 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.769
 new earrings every time I have 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.179
 occasion so here I leave this idea 

00:05:55.769 --> 00:06:00.239
 so you can perform the actions 

00:05:57.179 --> 00:06:03.119
 here I have other ideas that for example 

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:06.719
 these here are just the reverse of 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:09.419
 this and the wire is silver and I have 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.969
 these others that these are the ones that I was 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:14.069
 using lately that is also the 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:16.630
 purple wire but instead of the pearlite 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:19.570
 white is a silver pearl 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.310
 so with the same with very little 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:25.060
 variation because the truth is that I already did 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:27.460
 three different earrings good and 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.000
 four that this is white with the pearlite 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.000
 silver 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:36.370
 so here many ideas to be able 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.890
 perform for either gift or for 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.600
 you so nothing we ourselves 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.640
 we would see next week 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.920
 thank you very much for your many likes 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.300
 thanks for your comments and on 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.950
 Thank you very much for being there 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.700
 with me one more day we would see each other 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.940
 next week and foremost a bye besote 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.940
 bye
