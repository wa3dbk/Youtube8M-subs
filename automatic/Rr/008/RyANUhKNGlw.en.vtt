to<00:00:06.120> season<00:00:06.569> cast<00:00:06.779> iron<00:00:07.080> so<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.099> have<00:00:08.280> my<00:00:08.400> cast

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
to season cast iron so I have my cast

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.280 
to season cast iron so I have my cast
iron<00:00:08.910> skillet<00:00:09.389> right<00:00:09.510> here<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.170> reason

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
iron skillet right here and the reason

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.680 
iron skillet right here and the reason
that<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.650> really<00:00:10.860> like<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.429> use<00:00:11.580> cast<00:00:11.969> iron<00:00:12.269> is

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
that I really like to use cast iron is

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.310 
that I really like to use cast iron is
because<00:00:12.870> it's<00:00:13.259> non-toxic<00:00:13.880> so<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.330> nonstick

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
because it's non-toxic so a nonstick

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.859 
because it's non-toxic so a nonstick
skillet<00:00:16.590> will<00:00:17.160> have<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> carcinogenic<00:00:18.119> toxins

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
skillet will have a carcinogenic toxins

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.359 
skillet will have a carcinogenic toxins
in<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.320> will<00:00:19.500> be<00:00:19.650> released<00:00:19.980> into<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
in it that will be released into the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.650 
in it that will be released into the
food<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.640> your<00:00:20.970> cook

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
food that your cook

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.340 
food that your cook
so<00:00:22.140> cast<00:00:23.100> iron<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> much<00:00:23.820> better<00:00:24.000> choice

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
so cast iron is a much better choice

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.689 
so cast iron is a much better choice
cast<00:00:26.279> iron<00:00:26.430> can<00:00:26.670> also<00:00:27.470> put<00:00:28.470> iron<00:00:28.949> into<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
cast iron can also put iron into the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.370 
cast iron can also put iron into the
food<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:29.939> you're<00:00:30.240> making<00:00:30.660> which<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:30.960> really

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
food that you're making which is really

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.229 
food that you're making which is really
great<00:00:31.619> we<00:00:31.920> all<00:00:32.040> need<00:00:32.250> iron<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.000> lot<00:00:33.149> of

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
great we all need iron and a lot of

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.530 
great we all need iron and a lot of
people<00:00:33.480> are<00:00:33.570> deficient<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.969> I'm<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.329> using

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
people are deficient so I'm just using

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.280 
people are deficient so I'm just using
this<00:00:36.840> little<00:00:37.309> cast<00:00:38.309> iron<00:00:38.550> pan<00:00:38.820> today<00:00:39.110> but<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
this little cast iron pan today but the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.000 
this little cast iron pan today but the
process<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:42.020> seasoning<00:00:43.020> cast<00:00:43.350> iron<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
process for seasoning cast iron is the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.979 
process for seasoning cast iron is the
same<00:00:44.280> pretty<00:00:44.640> much<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:45.149> any<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.809> know<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
same pretty much for any you know a

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.200 
same pretty much for any you know a
larger<00:00:46.440> pan<00:00:46.680> I'm<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.160> using<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.579> small<00:00:47.910> one

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
larger pan I'm just using this small one

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.319 
larger pan I'm just using this small one
as<00:00:48.510> an<00:00:48.660> example<00:00:49.079> because<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.340> lot<00:00:50.910> easier

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
as an example because it's a lot easier

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.930 
as an example because it's a lot easier
to<00:00:51.480> handle<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.800> big<00:00:52.980> ones<00:00:53.219> are<00:00:53.399> pretty<00:00:53.699> heavy

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
to handle the big ones are pretty heavy

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.049 
to handle the big ones are pretty heavy
so<00:00:54.860> so<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> first<00:00:56.010> thing<00:00:56.550> you're<00:00:56.699> gonna<00:00:56.820> want

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
so so the first thing you're gonna want

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.090 
so so the first thing you're gonna want
to<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.719> make<00:00:57.899> sure<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.260> your<00:00:58.469> pan<00:00:58.800> is

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
to do is to make sure that your pan is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.389 
to do is to make sure that your pan is
clean<00:01:00.050> when<00:01:01.050> you're<00:01:01.289> cleaning<00:01:01.649> cast<00:01:01.980> iron<00:01:02.219> you

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
clean when you're cleaning cast iron you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.549 
clean when you're cleaning cast iron you
don't<00:01:02.609> want<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.879> let<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.300> soak<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> sink<00:01:04.379> or

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
don't want to let it soak in the sink or

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.890 
don't want to let it soak in the sink or
anything<00:01:04.739> because<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.460> rust<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.720> you

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
anything because it can rust so all you

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.679 
anything because it can rust so all you
need<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.110> do<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.830> run<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.820> under<00:01:09.060> some<00:01:09.090> very<00:01:09.450> hot

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
need to do is run it under some very hot

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.530 
need to do is run it under some very hot
water<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.380> use<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> scouring<00:01:11.549> pad<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.420> a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
water and use like a scouring pad like a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.719 
water and use like a scouring pad like a
brillo<00:01:12.780> pad<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.320> something<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.860> get<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.250> food

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
brillo pad or something to get the food

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.370 
brillo pad or something to get the food
off<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.740> start<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.250> clean<00:01:17.850> pan<00:01:18.479> so

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
off of it and start with a clean pan so

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.210 
off of it and start with a clean pan so
the<00:01:20.040> next<00:01:20.250> step<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:21.170> turn<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> oven<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.799> 350

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the next step is turn the oven to 350

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.960 
the next step is turn the oven to 350
which<00:01:23.850> I've<00:01:24.090> done<00:01:24.360> already<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.970> then

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
which I've done already here and then

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.830 
which I've done already here and then
you're<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.900> coat<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.470> pan<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:29.220> oil<00:01:29.840> so

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
you're going to coat the pan with oil so

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.300 
you're going to coat the pan with oil so
the<00:01:31.140> oil<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.590> I'm<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:32.009> use<00:01:32.220> today<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.939> G<00:01:33.930> so

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
the oil that I'm gonna use today is G so

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.179 
the oil that I'm gonna use today is G so
ghee<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.610> clarified<00:01:35.990> butter<00:01:36.990> which<00:01:37.890> means

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
ghee is clarified butter which means

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.600 
ghee is clarified butter which means
that<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:39.329> milk<00:01:40.110> solids<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.950> been<00:01:41.159> taken<00:01:41.520> out

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
that the milk solids have been taken out

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.510 
that the milk solids have been taken out
of<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> butter<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.600> traditional<00:01:43.520> Indian

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520

cooking<00:01:44.909> oil<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.990> really<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.590> because

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
cooking oil and I really like it because

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.480 
cooking oil and I really like it because
very<00:01:47.340> healthy<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:49.740> tastes<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.100> good

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
very healthy and it tastes really good

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.760 
very healthy and it tastes really good
as<00:01:50.640> well<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.240> also<00:01:51.420> very<00:01:51.750> high<00:01:52.200> heat<00:01:52.619> oil

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
as well and it's also very high heat oil

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.969 
as well and it's also very high heat oil
so<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> has<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> high<00:01:53.640> smoke<00:01:53.700> point<00:01:54.979> otherwise

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
so it has a high smoke point otherwise

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.530 
so it has a high smoke point otherwise

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.750 

it's<00:03:34.820> better<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.270> have<00:03:35.450> too<00:03:35.870> much<00:03:36.170> oil<00:03:36.620> in<00:03:37.280> the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
it's better to have too much oil in the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.900 
it's better to have too much oil in the
pan<00:03:37.970> than<00:03:38.270> not<00:03:38.450> enough<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:40.250> if<00:03:40.580> you're<00:03:40.730> not

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910

sure do you have enough in there okay so
as<00:03:51.080> you<00:03:51.230> can<00:03:51.350> see<00:03:51.410> it's<00:03:51.770> fully<00:03:52.070> coated<00:03:52.990> with

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
as you can see it's fully coated with

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.940 
as you can see it's fully coated with
the<00:03:54.380> ghee<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:55.600> then<00:03:56.600> I'm<00:03:56.960> going<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.320> put<00:03:57.710> it<00:03:57.830> in

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
the ghee and then I'm going to put it in

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:05.920 
the ghee and then I'm going to put it in
the<00:03:58.070> oven<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:03.500> it's<00:04:04.130> just<00:04:04.520> right<00:04:05.300> side<00:04:05.540> up<00:04:05.720> in

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
the oven and it's just right side up in

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.850 
the oven and it's just right side up in
the<00:04:06.050> oven<00:04:06.380> there<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:08.470> basically<00:04:09.470> you<00:04:09.830> just

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
the oven there and basically you just

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.750 
the oven there and basically you just
leave<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.520> in<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:11.060> oven<00:04:11.090> set<00:04:11.960> at<00:04:12.020> 350<00:04:12.760> for

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
leave it in the oven set at 350 for

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.260 
leave it in the oven set at 350 for
about<00:04:13.790> an<00:04:14.120> hour<00:04:14.210> and<00:04:14.770> then<00:04:15.770> come<00:04:16.310> back<00:04:16.610> and<00:04:17.120> you

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
about an hour and then come back and you

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.199 
about an hour and then come back and you
get<00:04:17.420> it<00:04:17.630> and<00:04:18.350> let<00:04:18.590> it<00:04:18.709> cool<00:04:18.890> and<00:04:19.310> that's

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
get it and let it cool and that's

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.000 
get it and let it cool and that's
basically<00:04:20.660> it<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.110> it's<00:04:21.290> actually<00:04:21.410> a<00:04:21.680> really

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
basically it so it's actually a really

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.790 
basically it so it's actually a really
simple<00:04:22.340> process

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.559 

okay<00:04:28.800> so<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.340> pan<00:04:29.610> has<00:04:29.819> been<00:04:30.030> in<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.240> oven<00:04:30.389> for

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:30.569 
okay so the pan has been in the oven for

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.480 
okay so the pan has been in the oven for
about<00:04:30.810> an<00:04:30.930> hour<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:31.710> I'm<00:04:31.800> gonna<00:04:31.919> take<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:32.340> out

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
about an hour and I'm gonna take it out

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.270 
about an hour and I'm gonna take it out
now<00:04:33.080> so<00:04:34.080> make<00:04:34.259> sure<00:04:34.289> you<00:04:34.560> get<00:04:34.710> an<00:04:34.860> oven<00:04:35.069> mitt

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
now so make sure you get an oven mitt

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:49.790 
now so make sure you get an oven mitt
because<00:04:35.759> it<00:04:36.030> will<00:04:36.120> be<00:04:36.270> very<00:04:36.509> hot<00:04:43.819> so<00:04:48.680> if<00:04:49.680> you

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
because it will be very hot so if you

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.860 
because it will be very hot so if you
can<00:04:49.949> see<00:04:50.250> there's<00:04:51.120> still<00:04:51.210> a<00:04:51.360> little<00:04:51.539> bit<00:04:51.780> of

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.320 
can see there's still a little bit of
oil<00:04:52.259> in<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:53.430> pan<00:04:54.169> see<00:04:55.169> it<00:04:55.289> in<00:04:55.409> there<00:04:55.639> I<00:04:56.639> usually

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330 
oil in the pan see it in there I usually
just<00:04:57.509> leave<00:04:57.690> it<00:04:57.840> in<00:04:57.960> there<00:04:58.169> but<00:04:58.590> if<00:04:59.069> you<00:04:59.159> don't

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340

just blot it with like a paper towel or

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.600 
just blot it with like a paper towel or
something<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:05.690> it's<00:05:06.690> ready<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.199> be<00:05:07.710> used<00:05:07.889> but

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
something and it's ready to be used but

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.189 
something and it's ready to be used but
before<00:05:09.000> you<00:05:09.150> blot<00:05:09.449> out<00:05:09.479> the<00:05:09.690> oil<00:05:09.990> you<00:05:10.169> should

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
before you blot out the oil you should

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.510 
before you blot out the oil you should
definitely<00:05:10.740> let<00:05:10.889> the<00:05:11.069> pan<00:05:11.729> cool<00:05:12.270> down<00:05:12.509> and

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
definitely let the pan cool down and

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.029 
definitely let the pan cool down and
that's<00:05:14.659> basically<00:05:15.659> it<00:05:15.810> so<00:05:16.199> it<00:05:16.830> should<00:05:17.009> be

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
that's basically it so it should be

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.430 
that's basically it so it should be
nonstick<00:05:18.030> now<00:05:18.300> but<00:05:18.599> I<00:05:18.630> still<00:05:19.199> recommend

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
nonstick now but I still recommend

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.589 
nonstick now but I still recommend
putting<00:05:20.009> in<00:05:20.219> oil<00:05:20.490> every<00:05:20.940> time<00:05:21.150> before<00:05:21.389> you

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
putting in oil every time before you

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.149 
putting in oil every time before you
cook<00:05:21.960> so<00:05:22.319> you<00:05:22.590> know<00:05:22.710> if<00:05:22.800> you're<00:05:22.949> gonna<00:05:23.069> like

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
cook so you know if you're gonna like

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:24.499 
cook so you know if you're gonna like
fry<00:05:23.669> an<00:05:23.729> egg

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
fry an egg

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.020 
fry an egg
for<00:05:25.080> example<00:05:25.620> I've<00:05:25.979> put<00:05:26.400> in<00:05:26.520> a<00:05:26.610> little<00:05:26.759> bit<00:05:27.000> of

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
for example I've put in a little bit of

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.149 
for example I've put in a little bit of
oil<00:05:27.180> first<00:05:27.659> just<00:05:28.050> to<00:05:28.199> make<00:05:28.379> sure<00:05:28.409> it<00:05:28.979> doesn't

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
oil first just to make sure it doesn't

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.159 
oil first just to make sure it doesn't
stick<00:05:29.550> and<00:05:29.729> that<00:05:29.819> sort<00:05:30.210> of<00:05:30.300> helps<00:05:30.719> keep<00:05:31.020> it

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
stick and that sort of helps keep it

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.879 
stick and that sort of helps keep it
nonstick<00:05:31.620> but<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:32.550> still<00:05:32.969> I'm<00:05:33.900> still<00:05:34.319> season<00:05:34.800> a

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
nonstick but I still I'm still season a

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.370 
nonstick but I still I'm still season a
pan<00:05:35.099> every<00:05:35.400> couple<00:05:35.699> months<00:05:36.030> so<00:05:36.630> I<00:05:36.659> hope<00:05:37.169> that

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
pan every couple months so I hope that

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.760
