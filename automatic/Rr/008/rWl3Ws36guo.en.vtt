to them the way Mike and I eat it which

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.380 
to them the way Mike and I eat it which
is<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.440> couple<00:02:32.860> times<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.160> week<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.580> not<00:02:34.150> just

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
is a couple times a week and not just

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.540 
is a couple times a week and not just
focusing<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:34.989> on<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.260> muscle<00:02:35.620> meat<00:02:35.800> we<00:02:36.400> like

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
focusing in on the muscle meat we like

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.360 
focusing in on the muscle meat we like
to<00:02:36.670> include<00:02:36.880> broths<00:02:37.330> gravies<00:02:38.200> Bonin<00:02:38.800> roasts

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
to include broths gravies Bonin roasts

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.789 
to include broths gravies Bonin roasts
so<00:02:39.880> that<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.150> amino<00:02:40.450> acid<00:02:41.049> profile<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.590> more

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
so that the amino acid profile is more

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.559 
so that the amino acid profile is more
balanced<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.549> nourishing<00:02:42.940> for<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.120> body<00:02:43.299> of
