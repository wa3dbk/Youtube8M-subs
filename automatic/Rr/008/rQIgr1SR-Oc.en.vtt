00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.629 

okay<00:00:10.709> what<00:00:11.709> we're<00:00:11.830> going<00:00:11.950> to<00:00:11.980> do<00:00:12.099> today<00:00:12.309> is

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
okay what we're going to do today is

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.520 
okay what we're going to do today is
there's<00:00:13.179> actually<00:00:13.539> a<00:00:13.599> leak<00:00:13.809> in<00:00:14.410> the

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530 
there's actually a leak in the

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.420 
there's actually a leak in the
refrigerant<00:00:15.099> system<00:00:15.490> and<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:17.619> through<00:00:18.400> a

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
refrigerant system and that through a

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.850 
refrigerant system and that through a
lot<00:00:18.610> of<00:00:18.759> Diagnostics<00:00:19.599> I<00:00:19.869> was<00:00:20.259> actually<00:00:20.740> able

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
lot of Diagnostics I was actually able

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.300 
lot of Diagnostics I was actually able
to<00:00:21.039> find<00:00:21.369> out<00:00:21.550> what<00:00:21.730> the<00:00:21.820> leak<00:00:22.000> was<00:00:23.130> it's<00:00:24.130> not

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
to find out what the leak was it's not

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.429 
to find out what the leak was it's not
where<00:00:24.519> you<00:00:24.640> think<00:00:24.910> it<00:00:25.029> would<00:00:25.179> be<00:00:25.439> essentially

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
where you think it would be essentially

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.859 
where you think it would be essentially
checking<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.279> Schrader<00:00:27.849> valves<00:00:28.300> on<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:28.539> on

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
checking the Schrader valves on the on

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.910 
checking the Schrader valves on the on
the<00:00:29.259> highside<00:00:29.679> and<00:00:29.740> low-side<00:00:29.920> nothing<00:00:30.730> there

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the highside and low-side nothing there

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.079 
the highside and low-side nothing there
checking<00:00:32.920> all<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:33.160> connections<00:00:33.670> nothing

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.089 
checking all the connections nothing

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:38.009 
checking all the connections nothing
there<00:00:34.300> and<00:00:35.760> actually<00:00:36.760> it<00:00:36.850> found<00:00:37.150> this<00:00:37.629> leak<00:00:37.870> in

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
there and actually it found this leak in

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.040 
there and actually it found this leak in
a<00:00:38.080> couple<00:00:38.410> different<00:00:38.500> ways<00:00:38.710> one<00:00:39.250> was<00:00:39.519> with

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
a couple different ways one was with

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.520 
a couple different ways one was with
essentially<00:00:41.050> a<00:00:41.230> a<00:00:41.860> leak<00:00:42.670> detection<00:00:42.850> kit<00:00:43.539> that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
essentially a a leak detection kit that

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.500 
essentially a a leak detection kit that
actually<00:00:44.860> leaves<00:00:45.129> the<00:00:45.340> fluorescent<00:00:46.270> collar

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
actually leaves the fluorescent collar

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.270 
actually leaves the fluorescent collar
on<00:00:46.719> it<00:00:46.750> and<00:00:47.020> I'll<00:00:47.079> show<00:00:47.289> that<00:00:47.320> within<00:00:48.010> just<00:00:48.129> a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
on it and I'll show that within just a

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.709 
on it and I'll show that within just a
moment<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.699> other<00:00:48.820> thing<00:00:49.090> which<00:00:49.239> I<00:00:49.360> have<00:00:49.390> the

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
moment the other thing which I have the

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.900 
moment the other thing which I have the
little<00:00:49.899> beeper<00:00:50.260> here<00:00:50.469> which<00:00:50.649> is<00:00:50.910> essentially

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
little beeper here which is essentially

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.720 
little beeper here which is essentially
a<00:00:52.000> refrigerant<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:53.820> gas<00:00:54.820> detector<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:56.730> this

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
a refrigerant the gas detector and this

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.319 
a refrigerant the gas detector and this
is<00:00:57.910> an<00:00:58.090> F<00:00:58.239> s<00:00:58.449> I<00:00:58.690> believe<00:00:58.989> it's<00:00:59.140> an<00:00:59.260> FS<00:00:59.590> 10

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
is an F s I believe it's an FS 10

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.299 
is an F s I believe it's an FS 10
compressor<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.530> if<00:01:02.649> I<00:01:02.739> go<00:01:02.890> on<00:01:03.039> through

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
compressor and so if I go on through

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.190 
compressor and so if I go on through
here<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.470> essentially<00:01:05.860> just<00:01:06.990> scan<00:01:07.990> on

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
here and essentially just scan on

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.420 
here and essentially just scan on
through<00:01:10.080> you'll<00:01:11.080> see<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:13.030> actually<00:01:13.450> leaking

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
through you'll see it's actually leaking

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.100 
through you'll see it's actually leaking
right<00:01:15.430> there<00:01:15.700> at<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.119> at<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.110> scene<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.990> a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
right there at the at the scene just a

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.950 
right there at the at the scene just a
little<00:01:20.470> bit<00:01:20.590> unexpected<00:01:21.220> I<00:01:21.939> think<00:01:22.689> you're<00:01:22.840> all

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
little bit unexpected I think you're all

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.260 
little bit unexpected I think you're all
I'm<00:01:23.229> also<00:01:23.470> getting<00:01:23.710> some<00:01:24.070> leaks<00:01:24.790> right<00:01:25.060> here

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
I'm also getting some leaks right here

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.850 
I'm also getting some leaks right here
on<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.509> input<00:01:25.810> shaft<00:01:26.079> seal<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:28.240> it's<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:29.049> it's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
on the input shaft seal so it's a it's

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:37.499 
on the input shaft seal so it's a it's
definitely<00:01:30.490> got<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.939> a<00:01:31.270> leak<00:01:31.630> there<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
definitely got the a leak there now the

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:46.319 
definitely got the a leak there now the
water<00:01:37.930> we<00:01:42.180> find<00:01:43.180> this<00:01:43.420> leak<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:45.119> through<00:01:46.119> this

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
water we find this leak is through this

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.780 
water we find this leak is through this
little<00:01:46.600> product<00:01:46.899> right<00:01:47.200> here<00:01:47.530> go<00:01:48.430> ahead<00:01:48.670> and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
little product right here go ahead and

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.840 
little product right here go ahead and
just<00:01:48.939> turn<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.979> well<00:01:50.979> I'll<00:01:51.280> just<00:01:51.460> bring<00:01:51.790> this

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
just turn this well I'll just bring this

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.360 
just turn this well I'll just bring this
out

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.270 

I<00:01:55.170> should<00:01:56.170> focus<00:01:56.350> on<00:01:56.680> here<00:01:58.440> this<00:01:59.440> is<00:01:59.620> a<00:01:59.650> product

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
I should focus on here this is a product

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.640 
I should focus on here this is a product
that<00:02:03.030> pretty<00:02:04.030> pretty<00:02:04.420> interesting<00:02:04.930> never<00:02:05.410> try

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
that pretty pretty interesting never try

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.240 
that pretty pretty interesting never try
this<00:02:05.680> before

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
this before

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.609 
this before
it's<00:02:07.150> a<00:02:07.300> tracer<00:02:07.720> line<00:02:07.900> it<00:02:08.140> gives<00:02:08.410> you

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
it's a tracer line it gives you

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.730 
it's a tracer line it gives you
essentially<00:02:09.250> three<00:02:10.210> different<00:02:10.470> things<00:02:11.470> that

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
essentially three different things that

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.160 
essentially three different things that
you<00:02:11.890> can<00:02:12.040> trace<00:02:12.340> once<00:02:13.210> a<00:02:13.360> coolant<00:02:13.720> additive

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
you can trace once a coolant additive

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.080 
you can trace once a coolant additive
the<00:02:14.320> other<00:02:14.470> ones<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.980> oil<00:02:15.310> additive<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:15.970> the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
the other ones the oil additive and the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.790 
the other ones the oil additive and the
other<00:02:16.210> is<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.510> course<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.960> refrigerant<00:02:17.410> out<00:02:17.650> of

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
other is of course a refrigerant out of

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.780 
other is of course a refrigerant out of
it<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.030> idea<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.960> essentially<00:02:20.560> that

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
it and the idea is is essentially that

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.610 
it and the idea is is essentially that
you<00:02:21.790> inject<00:02:22.210> this<00:02:22.360> into<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.960> your<00:02:23.170> system

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
you inject this into the your system

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.740 
you inject this into the your system
whatever<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.300> then<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.540> look<00:02:25.720> for

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
whatever that is and then you look for

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.460 
whatever that is and then you look for
tracers<00:02:26.620> actually<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.610> fluorescent<00:02:28.180> color

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
tracers actually a fluorescent color

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.230 
tracers actually a fluorescent color
that<00:02:29.470> will<00:02:30.130> illuminate<00:02:30.370> wherever<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.030> leak

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
that will illuminate wherever that leak

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.100 
that will illuminate wherever that leak
occurs<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.130> way<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.750> inject

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
occurs in a way that the that you inject

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.610 
occurs in a way that the that you inject
it<00:02:35.260> into<00:02:35.410> your<00:02:36.300> refrigerant<00:02:37.300> system<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.110> as

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
it into your refrigerant system and as

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.230 
it into your refrigerant system and as
you<00:02:38.800> essentially<00:02:39.220> have<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.760> little<00:02:39.940> syringe

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
you essentially have a little syringe

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.410 
you essentially have a little syringe
here<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.680> that's<00:02:41.860> syringe<00:02:42.250> set<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.150> screws

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
here and that's syringe set the screws

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.650 
here and that's syringe set the screws
into<00:02:43.780> here<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.700> then<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:46.090> course<00:02:46.330> you<00:02:46.480> put

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
into here and then of course you put

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.910 
into here and then of course you put
that<00:02:46.810> on<00:02:46.930> your<00:02:46.960> low<00:02:47.260> side<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.860> you

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
that on your low side and you

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.610 
that on your low side and you
essentially<00:02:48.220> just<00:02:48.430> put<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.730> on<00:02:48.820> in<00:02:51.840> yeah<00:02:52.840> you'd

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
essentially just put it on in yeah you'd

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.050 
essentially just put it on in yeah you'd
be<00:02:53.740> surprised<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.310> can<00:02:54.460> actually<00:02:54.610> push<00:02:54.880> this

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
be surprised you can actually push this

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.520 
be surprised you can actually push this
on<00:02:55.240> and<00:02:55.540> even<00:02:55.690> though<00:02:55.960> it's<00:02:56.110> under<00:02:56.260> pressure

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
on and even though it's under pressure

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.930 
on and even though it's under pressure
so<00:02:57.100> it<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:58.450> look<00:02:58.720> deal<00:02:59.520> now<00:03:00.520> I'm<00:03:00.700> going<00:03:00.880> to

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
so it this look deal now I'm going to

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.840 
so it this look deal now I'm going to
try<00:03:01.239> here<00:03:01.630> with<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.989> camera<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:03.070> see<00:03:03.100> maybe

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
try here with the camera to see maybe

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.210 
try here with the camera to see maybe
you<00:03:04.360> can<00:03:04.540> see<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:05.260> color<00:03:05.610> but<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:08.160> don't<00:03:09.160> know

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
you can see the color but I don't know

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.430 
you can see the color but I don't know
if<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.400> can<00:03:09.580> or<00:03:09.700> not<00:03:09.880> so<00:03:10.870> we'll<00:03:11.170> give<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.350> a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
if you can or not so we'll give it a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.040 
if you can or not so we'll give it a
whirl

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.790 

so<00:03:16.050> what<00:03:16.170> we're<00:03:16.290> going<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.440> do<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.650> we're<00:03:16.769> going

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.949 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:03:16.920> try<00:03:17.040> putting<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.580> camera<00:03:18.120> with<00:03:18.720> the

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
to try putting the camera with the

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.710 
to try putting the camera with the
essentially<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.980> lens<00:03:20.370> over<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:23.720> show

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
essentially the lens over it and show

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.300 
essentially the lens over it and show
you<00:03:24.780> your<00:03:25.019> answer<00:03:25.409> but<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.799> shake<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.159> this

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
you your answer but the shake in this

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.750 
you your answer but the shake in this
area

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
area

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.170 
area
get<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.540> glass<00:03:27.810> here<00:03:28.140> which<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.769> need<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.950> use

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
get the glass here which you need to use

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.199 
get the glass here which you need to use
to<00:03:30.180> find<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.599> guy<00:03:31.580> so<00:03:32.580> now<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.790> can<00:03:33.060> see

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
to find that guy so now you can see

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.220 
to find that guy so now you can see
everything<00:03:33.299> he's<00:03:33.540> got<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.720> little<00:03:33.870> bit<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.140> a

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
everything he's got a little bit of a

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.199 
everything he's got a little bit of a
yellow<00:03:34.739> hinged<00:03:35.629> tinge<00:03:36.629> to<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:37.549> and<00:03:38.549> if<00:03:38.879> I<00:03:39.000> go

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
yellow hinged tinge to it and if I go

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.069 
yellow hinged tinge to it and if I go
over<00:03:39.239> here

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
over here

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:47.660 
over here
I<00:03:42.560> can<00:03:43.560> hold<00:03:43.739> this<00:03:43.950> steady<00:03:44.220> here<00:03:44.549> I<00:03:46.430> take<00:03:47.430> this

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
I can hold this steady here I take this

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.690 
I can hold this steady here I take this
lighter<00:03:48.000> what<00:03:48.569> you<00:03:48.720> can<00:03:48.870> see<00:03:49.110> right<00:03:49.379> here<00:03:51.140> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
lighter what you can see right here and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.520 
lighter what you can see right here and
you<00:03:53.700> do<00:03:53.970> see<00:03:54.359> I<00:03:54.510> don't<00:03:54.840> know<00:03:55.019> if<00:03:55.109> you<00:03:55.200> can<00:03:55.349> see

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
you do see I don't know if you can see

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.229 
you do see I don't know if you can see
it<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:55.739> right<00:03:55.890> at<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.099> gap<00:03:56.340> there<00:03:56.670> there's<00:03:57.150> a

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
it but right at the gap there there's a

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.869 
it but right at the gap there there's a
little<00:03:57.359> bit<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.599> a<00:03:57.690> green<00:03:57.989> fluorescence

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
little bit of a green fluorescence

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.039 
little bit of a green fluorescence
everything<00:03:59.879> else<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.239> white<00:04:00.480> but<00:04:00.720> right<00:04:00.900> at

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
everything else is white but right at

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.509 
everything else is white but right at
that<00:04:01.799> gap

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
that gap

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.250 
that gap
you'll<00:04:03.329> see<00:04:03.540> even<00:04:03.660> more<00:04:03.840> for<00:04:04.049> green

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
you'll see even more for green

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.309 
you'll see even more for green
fluorescence<00:04:04.859> and<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.160> of<00:04:05.280> course<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.790> the

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
fluorescence and that of course is the

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.140 
fluorescence and that of course is the
leak<00:04:07.319> that's<00:04:07.950> occurring<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.519> lace<00:04:08.670> around<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
leak that's occurring a lace around the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.690 
leak that's occurring a lace around the
perimeter<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.989> case<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:12.500> also<00:04:13.500> as<00:04:14.340> per

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
perimeter of the case I also as per

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.250 
perimeter of the case I also as per
reference<00:04:15.120> here<00:04:15.329> you<00:04:16.289> can<00:04:16.500> see<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:17.039> put<00:04:17.789> some<00:04:18.260> on

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
reference here you can see I put some on

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.909 
reference here you can see I put some on
the<00:04:19.680> Schrader<00:04:20.039> valve<00:04:20.160> down<00:04:20.700> in<00:04:20.940> here<00:04:21.710> you<00:04:22.710> see

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
the Schrader valve down in here you see

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.469 
the Schrader valve down in here you see
that<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.520> think<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.849> can<00:04:24.120> there's<00:04:24.419> a

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
that and I think you can there's a

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.089 
that and I think you can there's a
little<00:04:24.660> bit<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.900> fluorescent<00:04:25.289> color<00:04:25.860> there

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
little bit of a fluorescent color there

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.520 
little bit of a fluorescent color there
were<00:04:26.370> that<00:04:27.240> tracer<00:04:27.660> is<00:04:27.840> just<00:04:28.050> essentially

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
were that tracer is just essentially

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.050 
were that tracer is just essentially
kind<00:04:29.010> of<00:04:29.130> leaked<00:04:29.669> out<00:04:29.849> over<00:04:30.150> on<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.270> top<00:04:30.710> so

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
kind of leaked out over on the top so

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.279 
kind of leaked out over on the top so
this<00:04:33.060> is<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.389> two<00:04:33.570> different<00:04:33.720> techniques

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
this is the two different techniques

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.029 
this is the two different techniques
that<00:04:34.410> you<00:04:34.500> can<00:04:34.680> apply<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:36.570> try<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:37.470> find

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
that you can apply to try to find

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.770 
that you can apply to try to find
outward<00:04:38.460> leak<00:04:38.760> is<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:40.430> your<00:04:41.430> AC<00:04:41.820> system<00:04:42.120> and

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
outward leak is and your AC system and

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.159 
outward leak is and your AC system and
now<00:04:43.320> Khorasan<00:04:44.479> I'm<00:04:45.479> going<00:04:45.630> to<00:04:45.720> have<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.870> do<00:04:45.990> is

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
now Khorasan I'm going to have to do is

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.320 
now Khorasan I'm going to have to do is
take<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.410> compressor<00:04:47.039> run<00:04:47.160> off<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.729> get<00:04:48.300> a

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
take that compressor run off and get a

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.860 
take that compressor run off and get a
rebuild<00:04:48.810> get<00:04:49.460> actually<00:04:50.460> just<00:04:50.639> a<00:04:50.729> seal<00:04:51.000> kit<00:04:51.300> for

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
rebuild get actually just a seal kit for

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.200 
rebuild get actually just a seal kit for
it<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.979> know<00:04:53.099> it's<00:04:53.280> not<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.460> expensive<00:04:53.849> to

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
it you know it's not that expensive to

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.300 
it you know it's not that expensive to
buy<00:04:54.450> like<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.750> remand<00:04:55.200> but<00:04:55.500> to<00:04:55.620> be<00:04:55.710> quite<00:04:55.860> honest

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
buy like a remand but to be quite honest
