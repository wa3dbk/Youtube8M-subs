00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.400
 but I am a few of them it is a window I have one of the inventors 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.179
 Van de Scepter's swinging Zetes is actually a solution 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.109
 seeing problems with stuart would be dangerous 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.689
 because wrong with it as a threatening place directly behind the wheel 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.320
 that is such a relief and i like me the direction of radiation never changes 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.240
 a language and with that the silence 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.520
 so claim that analysts do situations 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.050
 and the way you hope to make it a we hope 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.720
 I have to be him for a while 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.610
 and it is also part of the canal shipping route that two years this 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.370
 business being combined makes it a lot safer next week hopes 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.800
 with this round of light rounds here 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.720
 to test behind the wheel 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.380
 on safety and on 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.980
 yes what happens with a card one can pick up from percent 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.310
 show the difference 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.329
 summary proceedings 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.499
 cruijff has passed so off is also suitable if you are closing 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:20.920
 so finished 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.590
 I get you a current that 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.659
 after a sample from above 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.590
 what do you think water birds 10 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.770
 than the other 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.640
 the flow that 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.140
 goes back in the direction of dropping so you 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.450
 all in all a time 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.920
 it is not the same, you cannot resist both of the two summer 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.340
 and so you stay stuck with the current that occasionally goes under water 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.750
 And at some point it got so tired 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.440
 So you can stay under water for years so we didn't know why 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.750
 Party management chooses a landfill at the states 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.120
 but today a pre and I confirm with ok existing he is the youngest offspring 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.320
 with goals scored were able to qualify for many places 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.890
 to resolve the 1980s 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.960
 that company is going to be certain this promotion was also targeted 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.630
 to check if 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.119
 or who use it 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.919
 because we thought it would follow a few things 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.649
 the successful one 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.879
 the proposals that we will make an inventory of which steering mainly 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.189
 do not come 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.379
 it may of course not be just one 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.809
 five cases are expected to be 40 centimeters 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.109
 the morning 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:32.029
 But there are more Netherlands I did not know who qualify for this and 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.029
 but the wood oven stays together with 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.069
 that is an invention zoos in the netherlands very unusual 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.450
 but we have meanwhile 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.799
 be grabbed requested this design 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.209
 therefore also throughout Europe 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.569
 hopefully start applying more within europe and those were the only ones 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:53.090
 that man
