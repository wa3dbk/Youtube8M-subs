out<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.379> its<00:00:07.620> cure<00:00:08.840> this<00:00:09.840> one<00:00:10.170> has<00:00:10.679> fully<00:00:11.160> cured

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
out of its cure this one has fully cured

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.330 
out of its cure this one has fully cured
it's<00:00:12.420> still<00:00:12.780> darker<00:00:13.410> than<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.590> will<00:00:13.889> be<00:00:14.070> when

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
it's still darker than it will be when

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.670 
it's still darker than it will be when
it<00:00:14.370> finally<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.179> finished<00:00:15.690> drying<00:00:16.080> out<00:00:16.379> or

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
it finally is finished drying out or

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.200 
it finally is finished drying out or
curing<00:00:17.609> but<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.289> my<00:00:19.470> rasp<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.939> take

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
curing but this is my rasp and I take

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.740 
curing but this is my rasp and I take
the<00:00:21.420> rasp<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.050> kind<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.740> rub<00:00:23.340> against<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
the rasp and kind of rub against the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.620 
the rasp and kind of rub against the
surface<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.680> outside<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.910> take<00:00:27.119> away<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
surface on the outside to take away the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.990 
surface on the outside to take away the
edge<00:00:27.890> there's<00:00:28.890> kind<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.160> like<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.340> sharp<00:00:29.760> edge

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
edge there's kind of like a sharp edge

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.930 
edge there's kind of like a sharp edge
that<00:00:30.029> formed<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.019> cement<00:00:31.410> mold<00:00:31.700> so<00:00:32.700> we

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
that formed in the cement mold so we

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.380 
that formed in the cement mold so we
just<00:00:33.090> take<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.570> sharp<00:00:33.989> edge<00:00:34.200> away<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
just take that sharp edge away and I

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.950 
just take that sharp edge away and I
just<00:00:36.660> sort<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.960> round<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.620> off<00:00:37.940> with<00:00:38.960> scratch

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
just sort of round it off with scratch

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.540 
just sort of round it off with scratch
marks<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:41.520> mimic<00:00:42.059> how<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.140> would<00:00:43.290> be<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.739> truly

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
marks to mimic how it would be if truly

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.029 
marks to mimic how it would be if truly
was<00:00:44.820> chiseled<00:00:45.750> out<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.379> piece<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.770> limestone

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
was chiseled out of a piece of limestone

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.080 
was chiseled out of a piece of limestone
to<00:00:48.030> form<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.450> trough<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.520> kind<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.820> go

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
to form a trough so I just kind of go

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.840 
to form a trough so I just kind of go
around<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.629> outside<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:55.489> pull<00:00:56.489> it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
around the outside like that and pull it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.139 
around the outside like that and pull it
off<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.410> see<00:00:58.770> how<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.100> changes<00:00:59.280> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
off so you can see how that changes the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.889 
off so you can see how that changes the
form<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.890> outside<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.449> little<00:01:03.690> more

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
form of the outside it's a little more

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.609 
form of the outside it's a little more
smooth<00:01:04.549> this<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.610> still<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.299> undone<00:01:06.840> side<00:01:07.229> over

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
smooth this is still an undone side over

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.330 
smooth this is still an undone side over
here<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:09.740> I<00:01:10.740> will<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:12.500> pop<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.650> down<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
here and I will just pop it down and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.399 
here and I will just pop it down and
just<00:01:14.790> kind<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.060> random<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.890> get<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
just kind of random so that you get a

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.550 
just kind of random so that you get a
lifelike<00:01:19.409> age<00:01:20.310> by<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.000> elements<00:01:21.630> type<00:01:21.930> look

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
lifelike age by the elements type look

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.060 
lifelike age by the elements type look
that<00:01:23.250> you're<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.700> for

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
that you're going for

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.109 
that you're going for
now<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.340> particular<00:01:26.580> troll<00:01:28.640> was<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.820> one<00:01:30.000> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
now this particular troll was in one of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.899 
now this particular troll was in one of
the<00:01:30.210> low<00:01:30.420> pans<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.009> marked<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the low pans and so it is marked on the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.730 
the low pans and so it is marked on the
sides<00:01:33.799> by<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.250> plastic<00:01:36.000> now<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.200> want<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
sides by the plastic now if you want to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.630 
sides by the plastic now if you want to
accentuate<00:01:39.200> how<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.530> marking<00:01:41.460> is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
accentuate how that marking is

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.789 
accentuate how that marking is
displaying<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.290> take<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> same

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
displaying you just take the same

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.450 
displaying you just take the same
whereas<00:01:44.509> just<00:01:45.509> kind<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.780> dorable<00:01:46.229> down<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
whereas just kind of dorable down and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.480 
whereas just kind of dorable down and
make<00:01:47.820> more<00:01:48.119> marks<00:01:50.479> as<00:01:51.479> will<00:01:51.780> mimic<00:01:52.229> as<00:01:52.409> if<00:01:53.159> it

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
make more marks as will mimic as if it

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.330 
make more marks as will mimic as if it
were<00:01:54.470> cows<00:01:55.470> out<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:57.240> mountainside

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
were cows out of the mountainside

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.490 
were cows out of the mountainside
from<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.330> real<00:02:00.780> old<00:02:01.140> dog<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.140> some

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
from a real old dog and I have some

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.760 
from a real old dog and I have some
color<00:02:04.920> variations<00:02:05.850> there<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.500> see

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
color variations there and you can see

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.510 
color variations there and you can see
how<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.069> kind<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.580> accentuated<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.830> way<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
how that kind of accentuated the way the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.270 
how that kind of accentuated the way the
plastic<00:02:12.060> originally<00:02:12.569> marked<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.140> but<00:02:13.980> anyway

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
plastic originally marked it but anyway

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.490 
plastic originally marked it but anyway
I'll<00:02:14.520> go<00:02:14.700> around<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.060> whole<00:02:15.240> trough<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:16.319> do

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
I'll go around the whole trough to do

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.100 
I'll go around the whole trough to do
that<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.910> see<00:02:18.180> how<00:02:18.330> nice<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.870> one

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
that and you can see how nice this one

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.600 
that and you can see how nice this one
looks<00:02:19.350> inside<00:02:20.630> now<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.680> barrel<00:02:23.400> one

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
looks inside now this is a barrel one

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.670 
looks inside now this is a barrel one
that<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:24.000> done<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.110> did<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.440> same

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
that I have done and I did the same

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.360 
that I have done and I did the same
thing<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.870> have<00:02:27.870> rounded<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.770> outsides

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
thing to it I have rounded the outsides

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.860 
thing to it I have rounded the outsides
made<00:02:29.819> them<00:02:30.090> smoother<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.560> did<00:02:32.720> make<00:02:33.720> it

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
made them smoother but I did make it

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.070 
made them smoother but I did make it
look<00:02:34.050> like<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.350> was<00:02:34.500> an<00:02:34.620> old<00:02:34.769> barrel<00:02:35.100> I'd<00:02:36.080> line

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
look like it was an old barrel I'd line

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.140 
look like it was an old barrel I'd line
all<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.280> way<00:02:38.370> around<00:02:38.730> it

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
all the way around it
