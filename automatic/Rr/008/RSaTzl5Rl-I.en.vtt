her<00:02:25.920> forehead<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:28.370> my<00:02:29.370> thoughts<00:02:29.760> here<00:02:30.269> is<00:02:30.510> that

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
her forehead so my thoughts here is that

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.540 
her forehead so my thoughts here is that
she<00:02:32.790> got<00:02:33.060> extensions<00:02:34.099> crocheted<00:02:35.099> into<00:02:35.459> her

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
she got extensions crocheted into her

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.400 
she got extensions crocheted into her
hair<00:02:35.910> um<00:02:37.970> that's<00:02:38.970> my<00:02:39.120> bet<00:02:39.660> but<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.080> might<00:02:40.260> just

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
hair um that's my bet but it might just

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.660
