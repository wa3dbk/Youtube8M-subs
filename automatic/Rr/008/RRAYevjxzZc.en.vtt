00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
seven reasons why your muscles stop

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.039 
seven reasons why your muscles stop
growing<00:00:02.399> and<00:00:02.639> how<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.000> get<00:00:03.270> muscle<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.810> grow

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
growing and how to get muscle to grow

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.530 
growing and how to get muscle to grow
again<00:00:04.520> have<00:00:05.520> ever<00:00:05.700> wondered<00:00:06.000> why<00:00:06.150> your

again have ever wondered why your

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.360 
again have ever wondered why your
muscles<00:00:06.960> stopped<00:00:07.319> growing<00:00:07.589> after<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.069> few

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
muscles stopped growing after a few

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.100 
muscles stopped growing after a few
months<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.880> training<00:00:09.330> even<00:00:09.450> though<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:09.960> are

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
months of training even though you are

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.799 
months of training even though you are
training<00:00:10.559> very<00:00:10.889> hard<00:00:11.360> here<00:00:12.360> are<00:00:12.509> seven

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
training very hard here are seven

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.660 
training very hard here are seven
reasons<00:00:12.840> why<00:00:13.380> your<00:00:13.650> muscles<00:00:14.070> stopped<00:00:14.400> growing

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
reasons why your muscles stopped growing

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.930 
reasons why your muscles stopped growing
and<00:00:15.000> how<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.299> get<00:00:15.540> your<00:00:15.599> muscle<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.289> grow<00:00:16.500> again

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
and how to get your muscle to grow again

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.490 
and how to get your muscle to grow again
you<00:00:17.940> are<00:00:18.090> training<00:00:18.420> too<00:00:18.720> hard<00:00:18.750> every<00:00:19.470> time

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
you are training too hard every time

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.439 
you are training too hard every time
when<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:19.949> train<00:00:20.340> your<00:00:20.550> muscles<00:00:20.699> intensely

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
when you train your muscles intensely

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.540 
when you train your muscles intensely
you<00:00:21.750> are<00:00:22.199> actually<00:00:22.380> breaking<00:00:23.100> down<00:00:23.310> your

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
you are actually breaking down your

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.540 
you are actually breaking down your
muscles<00:00:24.230> so<00:00:25.230> your<00:00:25.439> muscles<00:00:25.830> need<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.220> recover

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
muscles so your muscles need to recover

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.689 
muscles so your muscles need to recover
from<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.939> damages<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.570> inflicted<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.260> them

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
from the damages you inflicted on them

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.820 
from the damages you inflicted on them
so<00:00:29.699> train<00:00:29.970> each<00:00:30.179> muscle<00:00:30.510> group<00:00:30.660> only<00:00:31.170> once<00:00:31.560> or
