often<00:00:47.970> a<00:00:48.180> lot<00:00:48.540> faster<00:00:48.989> than<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> duct<00:00:49.440> tape

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
often a lot faster than the duct tape

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.090 
often a lot faster than the duct tape
well<00:00:50.760> that's<00:00:51.030> why<00:00:51.270> i<00:00:51.600> recommend<00:00:52.470> in<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> last

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
the HD clear duct tape so when you still

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.020 
the HD clear duct tape so when you still
together<00:01:01.470> it<00:01:02.470> lasts<00:01:02.739> a<00:01:02.860> lot<00:01:02.980> longer

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
together it lasts a lot longer

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.410 
together it lasts a lot longer
let's<00:01:05.690> get<00:01:05.869> started

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.240 

so<00:01:09.960> first<00:01:10.259> we're<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.650> start<00:01:10.740> off<00:01:11.009> with

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
so first we're going to start off with

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.090 
so first we're going to start off with
bass<00:01:12.049> want<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.140> add<00:01:13.200> an<00:01:13.380> enemy<00:01:13.650> character<00:01:13.979> he's

gonna probably add his head first I'm

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.920 
gonna probably add his head first I'm
using<00:01:17.340> these<00:01:17.580> small<00:01:17.909> strips<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> was

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
using these small strips because I was

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.649 
using these small strips because I was
too<00:01:19.200> cheap<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.009> lazy<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.460> buy<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.670> big<00:01:21.450> batch

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
you might want to double this goes this

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.499 
you might want to double this goes this
tape<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.200> really<00:01:31.619> thin<00:01:32.090> it's<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.330> see

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
as you can see i got started with

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.300 
as you can see i got started with
details<00:02:28.230> we're<00:02:29.230> doing<00:02:29.440> our<00:02:29.620> throw<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:29.980> i<00:02:30.010> got

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
details we're doing our throw so i got

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.430 
details we're doing our throw so i got
is<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.550> old<00:02:30.670> hair<00:02:30.910> we<00:02:31.540> have<00:02:31.660> had<00:02:31.870> been<00:02:32.110> in<00:02:32.230> here

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
is the old hair we have had been in here

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.330 
is the old hair we have had been in here
it<00:02:32.680> was<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.100> little<00:02:33.430> difficult<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.940> carve<00:02:34.210> at

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
it was a little difficult to carve at

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.380 
it was a little difficult to carve at
take<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.370> look<00:02:37.710> pretty<00:02:38.710> close<00:02:38.890> right

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
take a look pretty close right

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.809 
take a look pretty close right
so

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
so

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:51.050 
so
