00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.100 

one<00:00:03.760> of<00:00:03.820> the<00:00:03.880> primary<00:00:04.120> reasons<00:00:04.540> I<00:00:04.630> like<00:00:04.779> salt

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.110 
one of the primary reasons I like salt

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.220 
one of the primary reasons I like salt
is<00:00:05.350> a<00:00:05.740> lot<00:00:05.920> more<00:00:06.069> natural<00:00:06.660> wave<00:00:07.660> to<00:00:07.930> chlorinate

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.230 
is a lot more natural wave to chlorinate

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.610 
is a lot more natural wave to chlorinate
your<00:00:08.440> pool<00:00:08.680> since<00:00:09.460> it<00:00:09.670> is<00:00:10.210> a<00:00:10.379> salt<00:00:11.379> basically

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
your pool since it is a salt basically

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.640 
your pool since it is a salt basically
if<00:00:12.580> the<00:00:12.820> element<00:00:13.119> that's<00:00:13.240> in<00:00:13.420> chlorine<00:00:13.629> when<00:00:14.619> a

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
if the element that's in chlorine when a

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.100 
if the element that's in chlorine when a
saltwater<00:00:15.150> pool<00:00:16.150> does<00:00:16.360> it<00:00:16.570> just<00:00:16.750> generates

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
saltwater pool does it just generates

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.189 
saltwater pool does it just generates
the<00:00:17.260> chlorine<00:00:18.150> by<00:00:19.150> using<00:00:19.420> the<00:00:19.509> salt<00:00:19.779> and<00:00:19.990> the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
the chlorine by using the salt and the

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.040 
the chlorine by using the salt and the
salt<00:00:20.380> cell<00:00:20.710> with<00:00:21.670> electrodes<00:00:22.210> it's<00:00:22.839> a<00:00:22.869> little

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
salt cell with electrodes it's a little

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.570 
salt cell with electrodes it's a little
bit<00:00:23.140> complicated<00:00:23.439> but<00:00:23.890> basically<00:00:23.949> it's<00:00:24.519> the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
bit complicated but basically it's the

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:34.290 
bit complicated but basically it's the
most<00:00:24.730> natural<00:00:24.910> way<00:00:25.300> to<00:00:26.080> chlorinate<00:00:26.380> your<00:00:26.589> pool

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.420 

and<00:00:34.410> salt<00:00:35.410> water<00:00:35.500> chemistry<00:00:35.890> slightly

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
and salt water chemistry slightly

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.190 
and salt water chemistry slightly
different<00:00:36.760> in<00:00:36.850> regular<00:00:37.180> chemistry<00:00:37.690> you'll

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
different in regular chemistry you'll

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.470 
different in regular chemistry you'll
find<00:00:38.410> at<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.590> chlorine<00:00:38.860> level<00:00:39.190> Rives<00:00:39.670> high<00:00:40.000> so

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
find at the chlorine level Rives high so

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.650 
find at the chlorine level Rives high so
it's<00:00:40.629> usually<00:00:40.750> 3.0<00:00:41.559> to<00:00:41.949> 5.0<00:00:42.550> at<00:00:43.329> my<00:00:43.480> own

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
it's usually 3.0 to 5.0 at my own

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.420 
it's usually 3.0 to 5.0 at my own

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960

the 5.0 range and I swim every day
doesn't<00:00:50.199> really<00:00:50.320> affect<00:00:50.650> me<00:00:50.860> is<00:00:51.640> just<00:00:51.820> very

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
doesn't really affect me is just very

doesn't really affect me is just very
natural<00:00:52.480> you<00:00:52.720> can<00:00:53.230> lower<00:00:53.409> it<00:00:53.530> of<00:00:53.680> course<00:00:53.829> by

natural you can lower it of course by

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.770 
natural you can lower it of course by
adjusting<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:54.489> chlorine<00:00:54.790> down<00:00:55.000> but<00:00:55.720> it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
adjusting the chlorine down but it

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.869 
adjusting the chlorine down but it
doesn't<00:00:56.050> do<00:00:56.110> any<00:00:56.260> harm<00:00:56.530> to<00:00:57.280> have<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.519> high<00:00:57.640> for

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
reading in a salt pool and you'll notice

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.160 
reading in a salt pool and you'll notice
that<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.129> pH<00:01:00.430> will<00:01:01.089> always<00:01:01.390> be<00:01:01.780> on<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.019> high

a check our community at least once a

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.460 
a check our community at least once a
month<00:01:14.759> because<00:01:15.759> by<00:01:16.660> adding<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.929> lot<00:01:17.050> of<00:01:17.080> acid

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
month because by adding a lot of acid

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.580 
month because by adding a lot of acid
people<00:01:17.800> you<00:01:17.890> may<00:01:18.009> drop<00:01:18.280> it<00:01:18.490> really<00:01:18.970> low<00:01:19.179> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
people you may drop it really low and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.870 
people you may drop it really low and
don't<00:01:20.590> assume<00:01:20.860> that<00:01:21.039> because<00:01:21.100> your<00:01:21.520> page<00:01:21.670> is

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
don't assume that because your page is

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.580 
don't assume that because your page is
high<00:01:22.030> in<00:01:22.210> your<00:01:22.240> so<00:01:22.570> cool<00:01:22.869> that<00:01:23.080> your<00:01:23.380> Arkell

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
high in your so cool that your Arkell

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.340 
high in your so cool that your Arkell
entity<00:01:23.830> is<00:01:23.890> high<00:01:24.039> also<00:01:24.899> maybe<00:01:25.899> this<00:01:26.200> the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
entity is high also maybe this the

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.320 
entity is high also maybe this the
opposite<00:01:26.770> by<00:01:27.190> adding<00:01:27.460> acid<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:27.940> drop<00:01:28.149> down

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
opposite by adding acid you drop down

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.980 
opposite by adding acid you drop down
putting<00:01:28.660> you<00:01:28.750> down

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
putting you down

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.169 
putting you down
so<00:01:29.619> always<00:01:29.740> check<00:01:29.890> your<00:01:30.160> equity<00:01:30.490> least<00:01:30.880> once<00:01:31.090> a

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
so always check your equity least once a

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:32.820 
so always check your equity least once a
month<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.630> raise<00:01:32.140> it<00:01:32.350> or<00:01:32.500> lower<00:01:32.530> it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
month and raise it or lower it

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.249 
month and raise it or lower it
accordingly<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.390> if<00:01:34.509> your<00:01:34.659> salt<00:01:34.929> system

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
accordingly and if your salt system

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.300 
accordingly and if your salt system
doesn't<00:01:35.440> have<00:01:35.649> a<00:01:35.679> reading<00:01:35.979> you<00:01:36.190> can

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.070 
doesn't have a reading you can
definitely<00:01:36.729> check<00:01:36.909> it<00:01:36.970> with<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.570> aqua<00:01:37.869> check

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
definitely check it with the aqua check

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.510 
definitely check it with the aqua check
