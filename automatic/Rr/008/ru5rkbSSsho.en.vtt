butter that's how much a cup ended up
needing<00:01:05.990> more<00:01:06.380> because<00:01:07.190> well<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:08.110> just<00:01:09.110> wasn't

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
needing more because well I just wasn't

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.420 
needing more because well I just wasn't
enough<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:10.630> ended<00:01:11.630> up<00:01:11.750> using<00:01:11.960> about<00:01:12.649> a<00:01:13.009> quarter

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
enough I ended up using about a quarter

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.950 
enough I ended up using about a quarter
of<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.610> stick<00:01:14.000> but<00:01:14.360> if<00:01:14.450> you're<00:01:14.570> using<00:01:14.780> a

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
of the stick but if you're using a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.600 
of the stick but if you're using a
different<00:01:15.290> form<00:01:15.500> of<00:01:15.619> cocoa<00:01:15.890> butter<00:01:16.189> I'd<00:01:16.399> say

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
different form of cocoa butter I'd say

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.889 
different form of cocoa butter I'd say
use<00:01:16.790> about<00:01:17.090> two<00:01:17.329> and<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.509> half<00:01:17.540> tablespoons

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
use about two and a half tablespoons

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.679 
use about two and a half tablespoons
worth<00:01:18.560> maybe<00:01:19.070> three<00:01:19.369> it's<00:01:19.939> better<00:01:20.149> to<00:01:20.360> use<00:01:20.509> the

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
worth maybe three it's better to use the

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.170 
worth maybe three it's better to use the
cocoa<00:01:20.990> butter<00:01:21.200> once<00:01:21.469> it's<00:01:21.680> melted<00:01:21.860> I<00:01:22.280> put<00:01:22.939> mine

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
cocoa butter once it's melted I put mine

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.020 
cocoa butter once it's melted I put mine
in<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.869> accra<00:01:24.560> way<00:01:24.649> for<00:01:24.920> 45<00:01:25.369> seconds<00:01:25.789> on<00:01:25.969> a

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
in the accra way for 45 seconds on a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.980 
in the accra way for 45 seconds on a
high

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.230 

it<00:01:31.990> should<00:01:32.200> have<00:01:32.320> an<00:01:32.440> oily<00:01:32.620> consistency<00:01:33.610> next

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
it should have an oily consistency next

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.900 
it should have an oily consistency next
I<00:01:34.330> took<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.690> shea<00:01:34.900> butter<00:01:34.930> which<00:01:35.710> smells<00:01:36.250> so

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
I took the shea butter which smells so

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.680 
I took the shea butter which smells so
good<00:01:37.630> oh<00:01:37.930> my<00:01:38.230> gosh<00:01:38.550> anyways<00:01:39.550> I<00:01:39.790> went<00:01:40.450> ahead<00:01:40.600> and

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
good oh my gosh anyways I went ahead and

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.860 
good oh my gosh anyways I went ahead and
scraped<00:01:41.230> out<00:01:41.410> about<00:01:42.780> two<00:01:43.780> tablespoons<00:01:44.110> of<00:01:45.870> the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
scraped out about two tablespoons of the

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.350 
scraped out about two tablespoons of the
shea<00:01:47.170> butter<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.710> found<00:01:48.160> it<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.400> lot<00:01:48.730> easier<00:01:48.940> to

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
shea butter I found it a lot easier to

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.760 
shea butter I found it a lot easier to
escape<00:01:49.930> route<00:01:50.200> if<00:01:50.410> I<00:01:50.620> like<00:01:50.800> turned<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:51.790> as<00:01:52.770> you

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
escape route if I like turned it as you

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.800 
escape route if I like turned it as you
can<00:01:53.920> see<00:01:54.100> this<00:01:54.250> shape<00:01:54.700> is<00:01:54.730> pretty<00:01:55.270> thick<00:01:55.480> so

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
can see this shape is pretty thick so

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.620 
can see this shape is pretty thick so
I'm<00:01:56.190> gonna<00:01:57.190> put<00:01:57.460> it<00:01:57.580> in<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.820> microwave<00:01:58.000> for

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
I'm gonna put it in the microwave for

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.140 
I'm gonna put it in the microwave for
about<00:01:59.080> 30<00:01:59.650> seconds<00:02:00.160> so<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.460> it's<00:02:00.610> easier<00:02:01.030> to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
about 30 seconds so that it's easier to

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:09.669 
about 30 seconds so that it's easier to
work<00:02:01.300> with

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.400 

you

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.680 

once<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.220> added<00:02:13.550> everything<00:02:13.820> together<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.540> is

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
once I added everything together this is

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.210 
once I added everything together this is
all<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.900> had<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:15.590> I'd<00:02:15.980> repeated<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.790> process

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
all I had so I'd repeated the process

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.010 
all I had so I'd repeated the process
put<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.340> cover<00:02:19.610> on<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:20.030> oil<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.540> put<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.930> in

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
put the cover on the oil and put it in

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.600 
put the cover on the oil and put it in
the<00:02:21.110> freezer<00:02:21.260> for<00:02:21.440> about<00:02:21.680> five<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.220> seven

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
the freezer for about five to seven

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.080 
the freezer for about five to seven
minutes<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.470> wanted<00:02:24.470> my<00:02:24.890> moisturizer<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.880> be

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
minutes I wanted my moisturizer to be

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.240 
minutes I wanted my moisturizer to be
creamy<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.720> got<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.960> hand<00:02:27.230> mixer<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:27.860> mix<00:02:28.040> it

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
creamy so I got a hand mixer and mix it

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.650 
creamy so I got a hand mixer and mix it
on<00:02:28.370> low<00:02:28.610> for<00:02:28.970> about<00:02:29.060> five<00:02:29.810> minutes<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:34.660> decided

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
on low for about five minutes I decided

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.230 
on low for about five minutes I decided
to<00:02:35.930> do<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.110> little<00:02:36.380> hand<00:02:37.010> whipping<00:02:37.580> of<00:02:37.790> my<00:02:38.000> own

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
to do a little hand whipping of my own

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:46.110 
to do a little hand whipping of my own
too<00:02:39.100> just<00:02:40.100> in<00:02:40.310> case<00:02:43.630> now<00:02:44.630> let's<00:02:45.020> cover<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.710> up

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
too just in case now let's cover it up

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.750 
too just in case now let's cover it up
and<00:02:47.120> put<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.750> refrigerator<00:02:47.870> overnight

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
and put it in the refrigerator overnight

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.200 
and put it in the refrigerator overnight
so<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.790> can<00:02:50.060> settle<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:55.220> should<00:02:55.670> be<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.940> little

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
so it can settle so should be a little
