00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720 

two<00:00:00.210> men<00:00:00.450> with<00:00:00.630> HIV<00:00:01.230> were<00:00:01.410> seemingly<00:00:01.800> cured<00:00:02.399> of

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
two men with HIV were seemingly cured of

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.590 
two men with HIV were seemingly cured of
the<00:00:03.000> virus<00:00:03.360> after<00:00:03.570> getting<00:00:04.319> stem<00:00:04.830> cell

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 
the virus after getting stem cell

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.120 
the virus after getting stem cell
transplants<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.660> treat<00:00:06.870> their<00:00:06.990> lymphoma<00:00:07.379> this

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
transplants to treat their lymphoma this

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.970 
transplants to treat their lymphoma this
looks<00:00:08.610> like<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:09.000> may<00:00:09.179> be<00:00:09.620> well<00:00:10.620> they're<00:00:10.769> saying

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
looks like it may be well they're saying

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.499 
looks like it may be well they're saying
right<00:00:11.130> now<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.639> looks<00:00:11.670> like<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.179> might<00:00:12.389> be

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
right now that it looks like it might be

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.180 
right now that it looks like it might be
the<00:00:12.660> cure<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.019> HIV<00:00:13.500> but<00:00:13.650> I'm<00:00:13.769> wondering<00:00:13.950> if

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
the cure to HIV but I'm wondering if

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.980 
the cure to HIV but I'm wondering if
it's<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> little<00:00:14.490> bit<00:00:14.670> too<00:00:14.849> soon<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.240> tell<00:00:15.420> what

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
it's a little bit too soon to tell what

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.560 
it's a little bit too soon to tell what
this<00:00:16.109> was<00:00:16.350> was<00:00:16.740> kind<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.609> host<00:00:17.850> versus

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
this was was kind of the the host versus

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.189 
this was was kind of the the host versus
graft<00:00:19.609> theory<00:00:20.609> which<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.840> these

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
graft theory which was that the these

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.840 
graft theory which was that the these
new<00:00:22.410> strong<00:00:22.740> cells<00:00:23.010> would<00:00:23.130> replace<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
new strong cells would replace the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.609 
new strong cells would replace the
weakened<00:00:24.300> chemotherapy<00:00:25.050> cells<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
weakened chemotherapy cells and

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.580 
weakened chemotherapy cells and
hopefully<00:00:26.609> cure<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.779> host<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> disease

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
hopefully cure the host of the disease

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.890 
hopefully cure the host of the disease
so<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.429> interesting<00:00:29.670> thing<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.300> case<00:00:30.599> is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
so the interesting thing in this case is

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.680 
so the interesting thing in this case is
that<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.619> know<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.250> individuals<00:00:32.790> or<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
that you know the the individuals or the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.080 
that you know the the individuals or the
the<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.440> man<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.980> question<00:00:35.160> yes<00:00:35.550> there's<00:00:36.000> no

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the one man in question yes there's no

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.340 
the one man in question yes there's no
different<00:00:36.420> cases<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.840> meant<00:00:36.989> those<00:00:37.140> very

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
different cases you meant those very

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.110 
different cases you meant those very
yeah<00:00:37.469> there's<00:00:37.680> radically<00:00:38.129> different<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.820> so

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
yeah there's radically different so so

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.729 
yeah there's radically different so so
in<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.540> specific<00:00:39.989> case<00:00:40.110> there<00:00:40.320> are<00:00:40.379> two<00:00:40.559> men

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
in this specific case there are two men

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.010 
in this specific case there are two men
who<00:00:41.370> both<00:00:42.030> had<00:00:42.390> HIV<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.329> leukemia<00:00:45.329> with<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
who both had HIV and leukemia with the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.080 
who both had HIV and leukemia with the
Leukemia<00:00:46.410> Lymphoma<00:00:46.770> right<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
Leukemia Lymphoma right so this is a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.750 
Leukemia Lymphoma right so this is a
cancer<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.809> lymph<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.920> these

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
cancer of the lymph and these

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.610 
cancer of the lymph and these
individuals<00:00:51.420> had<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> stem<00:00:52.170> cell<00:00:52.379> trace

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
individuals had a stem cell trace

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.100 
individuals had a stem cell trace
treatment<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> lymphoma<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.870> seems

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
treatment for the lymphoma and it seems

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.740 
treatment for the lymphoma and it seems
to<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.440> wiped<00:00:55.949> out<00:00:56.160> any<00:00:56.489> traces<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.300> HIV

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
to have wiped out any traces of the HIV

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.860 
to have wiped out any traces of the HIV
now<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.289> previous<00:00:58.859> study<00:00:59.550> it<00:01:00.000> was<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
now in a previous study it was the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.959 
now in a previous study it was the
Boston<00:01:01.079> study<00:01:01.620> there<00:01:02.129> were<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> couple<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
Boston study there were a couple of

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.690 
Boston study there were a couple of
other<00:01:03.090> men<00:01:03.390> who<00:01:03.960> were<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:05.100> know<00:01:05.129> essentially

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
other men who were you know essentially

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.370 
other men who were you know essentially
cured<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.390> want<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> say<00:01:06.689> cured<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.140> quotes

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
cured I want to say cured in quotes

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.350 
cured I want to say cured in quotes
because<00:01:07.590> again<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.549> early<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.000> both

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
because again I really early with both

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.170 
because again I really early with both
cases<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.020> early<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.560> tell<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:11.610> HIV

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
cases it's really early to tell of HIV

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.810 
cases it's really early to tell of HIV
and<00:01:12.390> specifically<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:13.560> they<00:01:13.950> received<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
and specifically there they received a

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.330 
and specifically there they received a
stem<00:01:15.750> cell<00:01:15.960> treatment<00:01:16.380> as<00:01:16.500> well<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:17.189> they

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
stem cell treatment as well because they

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.870 
stem cell treatment as well because they
also<00:01:17.610> had<00:01:18.060> cancer<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.110> HIV<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> stem

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
also had cancer and HIV but the stem

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.700 
also had cancer and HIV but the stem
cells<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:21.390> received<00:01:21.780> were<00:01:22.020> resistant

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
cells that they received were resistant

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
cells that they received were resistant
to<00:01:22.860> HIV<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.520> there<00:01:23.670> were<00:01:23.729> mutated<00:01:24.150> form<00:01:24.509> of

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
to HIV so there were mutated form of

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.990 
to HIV so there were mutated form of
stem<00:01:24.900> cells<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.170> were<00:01:25.320> resistant<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> HIV

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
stem cells that were resistant to HIV

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.160 
stem cells that were resistant to HIV
the<00:01:27.000> interesting<00:01:27.509> thing<00:01:27.720> about<00:01:27.810> these<00:01:28.110> new

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
the interesting thing about these new

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.760 
the interesting thing about these new
cases<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.400> they<00:01:29.729> received<00:01:30.259> regular<00:01:31.259> stem

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
cases is that they received regular stem

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.800 
cases is that they received regular stem
cells<00:01:32.040> they<00:01:32.310> received<00:01:32.610> regular<00:01:33.299> healthy

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
cells they received regular healthy

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.870 
cells they received regular healthy
cells<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.860> bone<00:01:35.040> marrow<00:01:35.280> transplant

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
cells in in this bone marrow transplant

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.649 
cells in in this bone marrow transplant
so<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.590> far<00:01:37.890> ostensibly<00:01:38.700> they<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.420> no

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
so and so far ostensibly they have no

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.770 
so and so far ostensibly they have no
traces<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.259> HIV<00:01:40.799> left<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.790> their<00:01:42.090> system<00:01:42.570> so

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
traces of HIV left in their system so

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.899 
traces of HIV left in their system so
this<00:01:43.560> could<00:01:43.979> be<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.869> beginnings<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.909> you

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
this could be this the beginnings of you

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.969 
this could be this the beginnings of you
know<00:01:48.030> an<00:01:48.180> essential<00:01:48.540> cure<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.710> at<00:01:49.799> least

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
know an essential cure or at least

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.370 
know an essential cure or at least
treatment<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.610> HIV<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.299> problem<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.869> it's

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
treatment for HIV the problem is it's

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.280 
treatment for HIV the problem is it's
prohibitively<00:01:53.280> expensive<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:54.299> extremely

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
prohibitively expensive it's extremely

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.190 
prohibitively expensive it's extremely

they introduced really aggressive

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.100 
they introduced really aggressive
treatment<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.090> her<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.569> seemed<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.930> go

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
treatment to her and it seemed to go

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.059 
treatment to her and it seemed to go
away<00:02:26.230> but<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.010> had<00:02:27.069> read<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:28.380> science<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.560> HIV

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
away but I had read that science of HIV

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.830 
away but I had read that science of HIV
were<00:02:30.220> still<00:02:30.459> present<00:02:30.760> in<00:02:30.790> her<00:02:30.940> blood<00:02:31.239> yeah<00:02:31.630> she

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
were still present in her blood yeah she

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.660 
were still present in her blood yeah she
still<00:02:31.989> had<00:02:32.110> signs<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.470> HIV<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.160> virus<00:02:33.489> like

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
still had signs of HIV of the virus like

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.130 
still had signs of HIV of the virus like
markers<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.239> virus<00:02:34.540> left<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:34.840> her<00:02:34.930> blood

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
markers of the virus left in her blood

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.170 
markers of the virus left in her blood
in<00:02:35.800> these<00:02:35.950> kind<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.220> reservoirs<00:02:36.910> they<00:02:37.060> talk

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
in these kind of reservoirs they talk

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.960 
in these kind of reservoirs they talk
about<00:02:37.360> these<00:02:37.450> HIV<00:02:37.780> reservoirs<00:02:38.500> but<00:02:39.130> but<00:02:39.819> she

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
about these HIV reservoirs but but she

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.890 
about these HIV reservoirs but but she
doesn't<00:02:40.120> actually<00:02:40.330> have<00:02:40.599> any<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.810> the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
doesn't actually have any of the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.539 
doesn't actually have any of the
symptoms<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.379> the<00:02:41.440> disease<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.160> in<00:02:42.400> her

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
symptoms of the disease and in her

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.009 
symptoms of the disease and in her
t-cell<00:02:42.849> count<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.239> fine<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.690> her<00:02:43.780> immune

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
t-cell count is fine and her immune

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.870 
t-cell count is fine and her immune
system<00:02:44.049> seems<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.620> be<00:02:44.739> highly<00:02:45.040> functional<00:02:45.489> so

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
system seems to be highly functional so

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.580 
system seems to be highly functional so
so<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:46.780> interesting<00:02:47.019> there<00:02:47.290> all<00:02:47.440> these

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
so it's interesting there all these

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.559 
so it's interesting there all these
different<00:02:48.130> approaches<00:02:48.640> obviously<00:02:49.180> there<00:02:49.420> are

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
different approaches obviously there are

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.809 
different approaches obviously there are
hundreds<00:02:50.530> of<00:02:50.650> different<00:02:50.709> kind<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.489> research

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
hundreds of different kind of research

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.449 
hundreds of different kind of research
approaches<00:02:52.450> that<00:02:52.989> are<00:02:53.290> looking<00:02:53.680> into<00:02:53.860> curing

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
approaches that are looking into curing

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.000 
approaches that are looking into curing
HIV<00:02:54.970> as<00:02:55.120> well<00:02:55.390> as<00:02:55.660> cancer<00:02:56.170> treatment<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.799> so

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
HIV as well as cancer treatment and so

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.740 
HIV as well as cancer treatment and so
it's<00:02:57.220> interesting<00:02:57.430> how<00:02:57.730> these<00:02:58.269> kind<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.540> two

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
it's interesting how these kind of two

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.110 
it's interesting how these kind of two
worlds<00:02:59.110> have<00:02:59.230> collided<00:02:59.590> in<00:03:00.280> these<00:03:00.760> four

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
worlds have collided in these four

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.380 
worlds have collided in these four
specific<00:03:01.690> patients<00:03:02.319> to<00:03:02.829> show<00:03:03.120> like<00:03:04.120> we<00:03:04.239> said

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
specific patients to show like we said

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.680 
specific patients to show like we said
ostensibly<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:05.470> cure<00:03:06.010> for<00:03:06.160> HIV<00:03:06.310> now<00:03:06.940> these<00:03:07.329> men

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
ostensibly a cure for HIV now these men

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.140 
ostensibly a cure for HIV now these men
who<00:03:08.319> receive<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.220> stem-cell<00:03:09.430> treatments

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
who receive the stem-cell treatments

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.569 
who receive the stem-cell treatments
have<00:03:10.660> been<00:03:10.959> off<00:03:11.260> of<00:03:11.579> antiretroviral

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
have been off of antiretroviral

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.160 
have been off of antiretroviral
treatment<00:03:12.970> now<00:03:13.060> for<00:03:13.269> many<00:03:13.450> many<00:03:13.690> many<00:03:13.900> months

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
treatment now for many many many months

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.020 
treatment now for many many many months
and<00:03:14.470> they're<00:03:14.590> still<00:03:14.829> showing<00:03:15.010> no<00:03:15.160> signs<00:03:15.700> of

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.849 
and they're still showing no signs of
HIV<00:03:16.480> but<00:03:16.600> a<00:03:16.660> lot<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:16.959> doctors<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.680> lot<00:03:17.829> of

HIV but a lot of doctors and a lot of

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.890 
HIV but a lot of doctors and a lot of
researchers<00:03:18.430> are<00:03:18.609> still<00:03:19.150> wary<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.810> they

researchers are still wary and they

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.539 
researchers are still wary and they

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
think that we can't really say that this

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.729 
think that we can't really say that this
is<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.760> cure<00:03:22.030> until<00:03:22.660> we've<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:23.170> know<00:03:23.200> looked<00:03:23.620> at

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
is a cure until we've you know looked at

the HIV does come back because it could

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.460 
the HIV does come back because it could

be stored in these reservoirs that are

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.800 
be stored in these reservoirs that are
very<00:03:32.650> hard<00:03:32.829> to<00:03:33.040> detect<00:03:33.340> now<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.819> third<00:03:34.299> man<00:03:34.540> in

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
very hard to detect now a third man in

very hard to detect now a third man in
the<00:03:34.989> Boston<00:03:35.470> study<00:03:35.769> did<00:03:36.400> die<00:03:36.609> though

the Boston study did die though

the Boston study did die though
so<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.690> this<00:03:38.160> can<00:03:39.160> we<00:03:39.280> count<00:03:39.430> on<00:03:39.579> this<00:03:39.760> as<00:03:40.500> well

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
so is this can we count on this as well

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.830 
so is this can we count on this as well
that's<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.769> difference<00:03:42.370> see<00:03:42.639> this<00:03:42.790> is<00:03:43.030> this

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
that's the difference see this is this

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.509 
that's the difference see this is this
gives<00:03:44.079> me<00:03:44.200> so<00:03:44.350> much<00:03:44.470> hope<00:03:44.530> but<00:03:45.069> when<00:03:45.250> I<00:03:45.280> see

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
gives me so much hope but when I see

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.400 
gives me so much hope but when I see
this<00:03:45.730> one<00:03:45.940> man<00:03:46.120> died<00:03:46.420> yeah<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.139> it's<00:03:47.319> still

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
this one man died yeah and it's still

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.860 
this one man died yeah and it's still
really<00:03:47.739> early<00:03:47.859> on<00:03:48.310> in<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.579> process<00:03:48.870> it's

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
really early on in the process it's

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.420 
really early on in the process it's
still<00:03:50.139> well<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:50.680> makes<00:03:50.829> me<00:03:50.980> filled<00:03:51.160> with<00:03:51.280> hope

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
still well it makes me filled with hope

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.610 
still well it makes me filled with hope
but<00:03:51.730> just<00:03:51.970> just<00:03:52.329> that<00:03:52.540> yeah<00:03:53.079> well<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.530> that's

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
but just just that yeah well and that's

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.839 
but just just that yeah well and that's
the<00:03:53.769> thing<00:03:53.920> that<00:03:53.950> we<00:03:54.130> have<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.310> remember<00:03:54.790> is

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
the thing that we have to remember is

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.240 
the thing that we have to remember is
that<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.150> reason<00:03:55.480> that<00:03:55.510> these<00:03:55.780> men<00:03:56.250> were

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
that the reason that these men were

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.599 
that the reason that these men were
again<00:03:58.030> ostensibly<00:03:58.510> cured<00:03:59.260> of<00:03:59.440> HIV<00:03:59.590> is<00:04:00.160> because

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
again ostensibly cured of HIV is because

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.879 
again ostensibly cured of HIV is because
they<00:04:00.760> were<00:04:00.819> on<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.329> very<00:04:01.750> hardcore<00:04:02.170> treatment

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
they were on a very hardcore treatment

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.030 
they were on a very hardcore treatment
for<00:04:03.370> their<00:04:03.549> cancers<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:05.049> third<00:04:05.290> men<00:04:05.620> man

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
for their cancers so that third men man

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.159 
for their cancers so that third men man
in<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.250> Boston<00:04:06.670> study<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.090> 2007<00:04:07.810> study<00:04:08.019> who

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
in the Boston study the 2007 study who

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.140 
in the Boston study the 2007 study who
had<00:04:08.260> died<00:04:08.440> died<00:04:09.160> because<00:04:09.459> his<00:04:09.579> cancer<00:04:09.940> came

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
had died died because his cancer came

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.659 
had died died because his cancer came
back<00:04:10.389> so<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.780> well<00:04:11.440> is<00:04:11.919> it<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.160> only<00:04:12.340> reason

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
back so the well is it the only reason

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.300 
back so the well is it the only reason
why<00:04:12.819> it<00:04:12.880> works<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.329> host<00:04:13.540> versus<00:04:13.900> Graaff

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
why it works the host versus Graaff

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.039 
why it works the host versus Graaff
treatment<00:04:15.310> only<00:04:16.239> because<00:04:16.599> of<00:04:16.630> the

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
treatment only because of the

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.199 
treatment only because of the
chemotherapy<00:04:17.609> affected<00:04:18.609> cells<00:04:18.880> they<00:04:19.150> were

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
chemotherapy affected cells they were

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.580 
chemotherapy affected cells they were
the<00:04:19.419> weaker<00:04:19.690> ones<00:04:19.900> would<00:04:20.289> it<00:04:20.380> not<00:04:20.530> work

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
the weaker ones would it not work

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.409 
the weaker ones would it not work
without<00:04:21.010> that<00:04:21.370> well<00:04:21.700> it<00:04:21.789> seems<00:04:21.970> like<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.180> strong

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
without that well it seems like a strong

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:22.720 
without that well it seems like a strong
call

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
call

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.420 
call
halation<00:04:23.060> of<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:23.480> so<00:04:23.660> there's<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:25.040> weakened

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
halation of that so there's the weakened

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.700 
halation of that so there's the weakened
cells<00:04:25.700> that<00:04:26.270> chemotherapy<00:04:27.020> was<00:04:27.140> acting<00:04:27.560> on

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
cells that chemotherapy was acting on

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.590 
cells that chemotherapy was acting on
there's<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.250> antiretroviral<00:04:29.210> treatments

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
there's the antiretroviral treatments

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.150 
there's the antiretroviral treatments
that<00:04:29.660> they're<00:04:29.810> taking<00:04:30.140> the<00:04:30.260> entire<00:04:30.620> time<00:04:30.920> and

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
that they're taking the entire time and

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.000 
that they're taking the entire time and
there's<00:04:31.820> these<00:04:32.120> new<00:04:32.180> very<00:04:33.170> healthy<00:04:33.740> cells

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
there's these new very healthy cells

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.590 
there's these new very healthy cells
that<00:04:34.220> they're<00:04:34.340> receiving<00:04:34.640> from<00:04:34.970> a<00:04:35.060> donor<00:04:35.270> in

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
that they're receiving from a donor in

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.360 
that they're receiving from a donor in
the<00:04:35.990> Boston<00:04:36.380> study<00:04:36.620> those<00:04:36.830> cells<00:04:37.040> were

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
the Boston study those cells were

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.610 
the Boston study those cells were
resistant<00:04:38.030> to<00:04:38.120> HIV<00:04:38.300> infection<00:04:38.630> the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
resistant to HIV infection the

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.410 
resistant to HIV infection the
interesting<00:04:40.070> thing<00:04:40.250> is<00:04:40.370> that<00:04:40.760> these<00:04:40.880> two<00:04:40.940> new

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
interesting thing is that these two new

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.600 
interesting thing is that these two new
men<00:04:41.660> receive<00:04:42.350> cells<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.950> don't<00:04:43.250> have<00:04:43.460> that

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
men receive cells that don't have that

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.280 
men receive cells that don't have that
mutation<00:04:43.820> and<00:04:44.390> it<00:04:44.480> still<00:04:44.750> seems<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.200> have

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
mutation and it still seems to have

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.810 
mutation and it still seems to have
wiped<00:04:45.470> out<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:46.100> virus<00:04:46.520> as<00:04:46.760> of<00:04:47.540> today
