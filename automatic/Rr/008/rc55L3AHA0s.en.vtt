00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
that overhand knot just like so now I'm

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.099 
that overhand knot just like so now I'm
going<00:00:48.910> to<00:00:48.969> make<00:00:49.149> that<00:00:49.269> overhand<00:00:49.690> knot<00:00:49.839> just<00:00:50.079> a

going to make that overhand knot just a

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:51.779 
going to make that overhand knot just a
little<00:00:50.379> smaller<00:00:50.679> that<00:00:50.980> way<00:00:51.250> it's<00:00:51.370> not<00:00:51.460> too<00:00:51.640> big

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
little smaller that way it's not too big

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.220 
little smaller that way it's not too big
now<00:00:52.059> I'm<00:00:52.239> just<00:00:52.449> going<00:00:52.600> to<00:00:52.629> pull<00:00:52.809> on<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.050> tag

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
now I'm just going to pull on the tag

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.389 
now I'm just going to pull on the tag
end<00:00:53.469> so<00:00:53.620> it<00:00:53.710> slides<00:00:53.980> down<00:00:54.269> close<00:00:55.269> to<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.570> eye

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
end so it slides down close to the eye

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.680 
end so it slides down close to the eye
now<00:00:57.399> depending<00:00:57.910> on<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.030> thickness<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:58.570> the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
now depending on the thickness and the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.079 
now depending on the thickness and the
material<00:00:59.350> depends<00:00:59.800> on<00:00:59.890> how<00:01:00.070> many<00:01:00.730> wraps

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
material depends on how many wraps

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.299 
material depends on how many wraps
you're<00:01:01.449> going<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.629> do<00:01:01.839> around<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.980> standing

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
you're going to do around the standing

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.120 
you're going to do around the standing
line<00:01:03.489> this<00:01:03.730> is<00:01:03.789> similar<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:05.440> step<00:01:05.950> in<00:01:06.100> the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
line this is similar to the step in the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.220 
line this is similar to the step in the
clinch<00:01:06.430> knot<00:01:06.520> use<00:01:07.240> my<00:01:07.420> ring<00:01:07.660> finger<00:01:07.690> and<00:01:08.050> my

clinch knot use my ring finger and my
middle<00:01:08.260> finger<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:08.890> just<00:01:09.130> twist<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.930> tag<00:01:11.500> end

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
middle finger to just twist the tag end

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.920 
middle finger to just twist the tag end
around<00:01:11.980> the<00:01:12.100> running<00:01:12.370> line<00:01:12.550> now<00:01:13.420> this<00:01:13.570> really

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
around the running line now this really

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.030 
around the running line now this really
thick<00:01:14.140> stuff<00:01:14.350> I'm<00:01:14.530> using<00:01:14.560> it<00:01:14.950> will

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
thick stuff I'm using it will

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.890 
thick stuff I'm using it will
prominently<00:01:15.370> take<00:01:15.550> three<00:01:15.790> four<00:01:15.940> turns<00:01:16.300> if

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
enough turns all I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.370 
enough turns all I'm going to do is I'm
just<00:01:24.820> going<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.120> find<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.660> overhand<00:01:26.170> knot

on the tag end just the staying line I'm
gonna<00:01:46.510> use<00:01:46.660> a<00:01:46.690> table<00:01:47.080> here<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.440> kind<00:01:47.620> of<00:01:47.680> pull

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
gonna use a table here to kind of pull

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.340 
gonna use a table here to kind of pull
down<00:01:48.310> on<00:01:48.550> it<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:49.630> what<00:01:49.840> you'll<00:01:50.020> end<00:01:50.080> up<00:01:50.290> with

down on it and what you'll end up with

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.310 
down on it and what you'll end up with
is<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:50.940> loop<00:01:51.940> knot<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.860> trim<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:55.170> trim<00:01:56.170> the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
is a loop knot just trim the trim the

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.380 
is a loop knot just trim the trim the
tag<00:01:56.530> end<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:57.070> then<00:01:57.310> that<00:01:57.520> knot<00:01:57.730> will<00:01:58.060> let<00:01:58.240> your
