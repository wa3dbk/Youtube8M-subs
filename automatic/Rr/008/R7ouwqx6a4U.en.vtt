00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.399
 hello to all friends of and without a buy 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.889
 as you have today new location 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.960
 outdoors because this period I study 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.480
 of exams and cars therefore between video there is from 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.070
 always at home more or less then today 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.410
 I make a video open right path 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.390
 nice baby is worth it if you are seeing 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.519
 the video with was deafening with the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.109
 headphones probably if you send the other one 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.939
 second from a headset are not headphones 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.220
 i was and i am using a 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.599
 Acre microphone is not that it is not serious 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.730
 then to avoid background noise 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.180
 back of houses in this video I will make a 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.500
 quick vocal comparison between p7 and 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.960
 pis is therefore the previous model 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.430
 this is because thyssen does not 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.080
 you have to ask some friends that me 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.700
 lend it and have a comparison made 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.160
 in a hurry hurt so I prefer 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.840
 have a chat and know that anyway 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.010
 you also like a little more because 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.680
 there is more 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.510
 I don't know there's more eye contact and nothing 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.280
 let 's talk about the features 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.070
 main techniques then both are 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.340
 two things that all 1.8 giga city ​​7.56 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.580
 both 2gb of ram both displays 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:11.120
 psp 7 a 5-inch full hd with you a 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:14.150
 4.7 inch hd for the p 6 camera 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.980
 13 megapixels the p7 against an 8 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.460
 the main megapixel of the p 6 are these 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.200
 the main bait cards as thickness 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.570
 because we have a 6.18 mm that in his 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.860
 time the subtlety record this 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.810
 instead 16.5 mm expandable child ed 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.130
 both sim in micro format for 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.990
 both if the version also seems to me 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.170
 dual singh and in any case of italy is not 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.159
 arrived maybe it will never even arrive 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.050
 well let's talk immediately about child space 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.870
 both are by telephone or in 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.780
 quality coming higher pis is everything 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.180
 in aluminum this is the anti glass 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.680
 behind glass so this is also excellent 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.510
 let's say that professions always reason 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.000
 very simple because it is also light 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.340
 on dreams the back glass does not 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.260
 like it here so much because it always gets dirty 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.120
 I'm a police maniac and when 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.010
 I have always been clean if not limited 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.049
 minimal discomfort on aluminum instead 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.350
 delpy follows I'm a captain and I have to say 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.600
 that actually will like it even more 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.250
 just like general design 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.050
 so maybe as a design I prefer 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.940
 but this busts very nice too 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.200
 piscedda absolutely is one of the most 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.450
 beautiful he had seen so far 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.510
 hats off for this product 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.030
 will be one of the performances and also how 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.380
 performance there is no leap in quality 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.830
 and no but also because this process is 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.620
 true that it is new just you want but not 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.140
 as a bomb with 800 is not comparable 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.690
 but maybe not doing any worse on the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.360
 benchmark is the same as the seventeenth e 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.620
 eight hundred but then found of the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.720
 performance in my opinion is slightly 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.040
 lower super discounted say that i 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.950
 enough games to be said anyway 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.440
 well on the p 6 a few more lakes though 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.510
 even after all , he was good enough 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.250
 to say that both expire a lot 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.110
 let's say that on p 6 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.750
 he felt more because it was precisely the 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.460
 less heat leads from mine and 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.160
 I must say that when it overheated 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.660
 this was pretty hot though 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.690
 however with the glass it remains slightly 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.510
 cooler from bacteria to 30 is a 2000 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.030
 a thousand amps for PI according to 2500 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.340
 for the p7 and I must say that even here not 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.380
 there is a great leap in quality to 72 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.630
 slightly more actually me 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.220
 I remember however also with this I do 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.380
 much effort from the evening and above all 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.630
 with intense use and especially when 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.250
 warms even if the features are 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.040
 this that the 26 optimization of 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.840
 battery very interesting way that if 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.090
 exploited where it allows us to give a 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.930
 serious as they are on the browser 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.490
 comparable 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.620
 here too there was a small one 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.960
 improvement on this p7 but to say 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.520
 that now the pea had reasoned to 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.040
 kit from you maybe there were improvements 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.380
 it is true to make a focus if I will 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.030
 possible 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.800
 what else to say as an exception, etc. 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.420
 they are absolutely comparable 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.490
 that huawei and produces the antennas from 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.470
 I always like the quality even in 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.920
 your payer is also very good 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.270
 will tell me this point of view 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.130
 in short, nothing like general use 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.930
 I must say that they are two excellent brackley 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.280
 surely they are not skilled maybe a 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.440
 according to me it has a g2 s5 other top of 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.090
 however, it does get a lot out of range 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.120
 well not to mention that they cost anyway 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.049
 almost half because they list the p7 with 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.920
 99 state that compared to 6 99 d adda 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.960
 it's definitely much less and anyway 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.320
 some features after all 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.450
 quite similar though with materials 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.700
 even more noble at the top of the range such as 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.960
 cameras here too a little me 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.640
 I liked the whine the most 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.790
 very much like 8 megapixel camera 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.550
 cure 2.0 that made great photos 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.670
 this is an actress always 2.0 it seems to me 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.350
 however, it is also quality paintings 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.760
 lowering 8 megapixels I must say that 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.920
 photos are also a little better because 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.230
 maybe between a block ahead but i 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.720
 megapixels and doing nothing has times 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.010
 lowering megapixel photos of your 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.260
 best judo like this we'll talk about 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.960
 maybe another child 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.810
 Pisa is now at 249 euros this 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.120
 400 euros but I'm already online at 320 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.330
 easily that you do not europe what of 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:14.770
 they go out but it's worth going through one 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.870
 to the other yes and no in the sense that I don't have 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.510
 given such a big jolt as 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.640
 maybe there could be maybe 564 that a 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.430
 my warning is clearer in the ps5 sense more 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.830
 this is definitely the best used 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.630
 process the best yes but not so 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.920
 much 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.610
 they say that up is everything turns enough 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:37.450
 well some more data really is there 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:40.720
 I do not deny, however, worse than worse 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:43.210
 of now of 230 of the p 6 st easily 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.490
 online is slightly very good 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.160
 therefore the excellent times lost but little 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.040
 and I appreciate the size a little 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.230
 also in terms of size, I think there is a bit 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.230
 the better you are because anyway it is a 4 of 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.360
 17 inches thinner lighter 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.760
 in this light way and anyway e 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.890
 angular a little bigger and ex like a 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.600
 limit of usability as we say 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.180
 that I make it to the limit with 5 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.830
 inch mounts two now for me are 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.300
 truly the limit of a kidney broth 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.490
 with of there are enough tuned 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.900
 those on the sides are beautiful roads that 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.730
 top down instead are a little from 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.950
 league but less than the two ways 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.840
 phones that I tried so this a 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.910
 big lines a little with what I think 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.670
 I personally know if I had a pea 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.520
 still has to wait a little while 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:30.889
 means this breeds sa2 by not going 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.710
 9 shop what I think happens 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.479
 a few months and especially now that 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.830
 get started hold the pisa that 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.749
 you know that these are phones yes 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.370
 ruin is suitable so it has been and 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:42.050
 combative maybe if you feel like it 7 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.639
 so this video is everything and if 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.909
 you have any particular questions do me even 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:49.009
 anyway I will try anyway now 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:50.840
 a more 6 is dependent on making his own 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:53.029
 deepened then maybe between an attic 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.039
 but I think I said both 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:56.509
 quietly confirmed us 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.749
 quietly trying your own too 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:01.490
 days simultaneously so nothing 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:03.139
 nice asked two questions you know that 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.270
 instead when more and more difficult for 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:07.430
 I grew up in many that you follow me 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.860
 you ask a lot of questions but there is still of 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.439
 so let's ask for the next videos 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:16.090
 if you like the location of me or a 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:16.090
 greeting from valence presidency hello
