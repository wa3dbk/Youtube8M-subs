00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
notification forever in this video so we

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.660 
notification forever in this video so we
will<00:00:14.880> try<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.210> find<00:00:15.570> these<00:00:15.900> files<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
will try to find these files that the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.970 
will try to find these files that the
windows<00:00:18.000> update<00:00:18.359> installed<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.619> disk

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
windows update installed in the disk

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.519 
windows update installed in the disk
there's<00:00:20.460> no<00:00:20.760> update<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.570> says<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.350> is

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
there's no update that says it is

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.099 
there's no update that says it is
actually<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.189> selling<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.760> files<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.990> is

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
actually in selling this files so it is

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.679 
actually in selling this files so it is
a<00:00:25.140> little<00:00:25.260> bit<00:00:25.590> hiding<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.640> test<00:00:27.029> if<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.539> go

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
a little bit hiding like a test if we go

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.359 
a little bit hiding like a test if we go
to<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.960> test<00:00:28.199> management<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.800> will<00:00:28.980> find<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
to the test management we will find the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.790 
to the test management we will find the
process<00:00:29.789> right<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.230> process

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
process right here this is the process

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.220 
process right here this is the process
get<00:00:32.160> Windows<00:00:32.489> 10<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.450> may<00:00:33.600> think<00:00:33.630> okay

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
get Windows 10 so we may think okay

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.410 
get Windows 10 so we may think okay
let's<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:34.890> stop<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.550> process<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
let's just stop this process and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.180 
let's just stop this process and
everything<00:00:36.899> will<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.410> right<00:00:37.440> well<00:00:37.950> no

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
everything will be all right well no

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.360 
everything will be all right well no
because<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:39.030> will<00:00:39.300> remove<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.649> icon<00:00:41.160> for

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
because you will remove the icon for

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.420 
because you will remove the icon for
this<00:00:42.030> session<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:43.230> once<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.890> restart<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
this session but once you restart the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
this session but once you restart the
computer<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:45.239> will<00:00:45.420> find<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.899> icon<00:00:46.200> there

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
computer you will find the icon there

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.560 
computer you will find the icon there
again<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.980> again<00:00:47.280> because<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.329> always

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
again and again because it is always

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.720 
again and again because it is always
started<00:00:49.200> by<00:00:49.469> task<00:00:50.070> scheduler<00:00:50.820> she<00:00:51.980> xw<00:00:52.980> that's

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
started by task scheduler she xw that's

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.470 
started by task scheduler she xw that's
the<00:00:53.969> folder<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.390> has<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:55.170> these<00:00:55.800> files<00:00:56.480> so

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the folder that has all these files so

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.549 
the folder that has all these files so
we<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.620> erase<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.879> files<00:01:00.239> right<00:01:00.719> well

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
we can just erase this files right well

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.920 
we can just erase this files right well
it<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.430> actually<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:03.090> good<00:01:03.239> idea<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.809> do

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
it is not actually a good idea to do

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.800 
it is not actually a good idea to do
that<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.949> will<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:06.060> disable

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
that but we will do is just disable

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.560 
that but we will do is just disable
those<00:01:07.229> tusk<00:01:08.040> jobs<00:01:09.110> that<00:01:10.159> open<00:01:11.159> these<00:01:11.369> files

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
those tusk jobs that open these files

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.190 
those tusk jobs that open these files
every<00:01:12.570> time<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.439> access<00:01:14.040> your<00:01:14.790> user<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:16.020> that

every time you access your user for that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.100 
every time you access your user for that
we<00:01:16.439> will<00:01:16.590> go<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> third<00:01:17.490> programs<00:01:18.360> accessories

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
we will go to third programs accessories

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.929 
we will go to third programs accessories
system<00:01:19.470> tools<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.580> inside<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.570> folder<00:01:21.930> to

system tools and inside that folder to
task<00:01:23.939> scheduler<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.530> also<00:01:25.680> write<00:01:26.360> down

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
task scheduler you can also write down

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.240 
task scheduler you can also write down
there<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.840> will<00:01:28.020> open<00:01:28.140> instead<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.130> we

then you will have to pay and actually
it<00:02:43.120> will<00:02:43.420> be<00:02:43.750> not<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.470> full<00:02:44.890> version<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.580> is

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
it will be not the full version it is

this<00:03:00.160> idea<00:03:00.580> is<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.510> wait<00:03:01.780> for<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.170> final

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
this idea is to wait for the final

this idea is to wait for the final
release<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.550> do<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.030> clean<00:03:04.510> install<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:05.470> the

release and do a clean install of the

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.000 
release and do a clean install of the
system<00:03:06.160> always<00:03:06.700> do<00:03:07.300> that<00:03:07.450> clean<00:03:08.020> installs
