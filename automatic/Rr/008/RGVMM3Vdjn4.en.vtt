 frankly though his father zeus did it 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.220
 the most beautiful and handsome of the family was 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.500

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.340

 considering that she was not faithful to him 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.479
 same gift was in turn curse for his 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.819
 town because for such infidelity the god 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.039
 apolo cursed her saying that all 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.159
 the prophecies that she said no one 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.560
 would take into account and it was so that she 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.109
 predicted the end of his village with no one 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.479
 wanting to hear him then he went with the 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.700
 acne nymph for making fun of 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.649

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.689
 arrow to the heart of apollo and another to that of 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.670
 the nymph give only that love that 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.579
 I felt polo for this one was 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.890
 passionate and instead the one that felt the 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.440
 nymph for him was of immense contempt 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.780
 it was so from so much running of the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.209
 amorous proposals apollo asked 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.940
 gods help and these in turn the 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.010
 they turned into a green laurel with the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.379
 only woman with whom he was lucky was 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.690
 with the mother of asclepius her son given to 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.579
 care of the centaur quirón who more 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.960
 ahead I would teach him the art of 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.360
 medicine 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.310
 and the skill of asclepius was so great 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.200
 He also learned from his teacher that 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.510
 He even found the cure 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.240
 all diseases and also to the 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.820
 death done that would bother the 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.160
 god hades then went to claim zeus 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.410
 how it was possible that if he had given 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.810
 he dominion of the underground kingdom now 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.970
 the son of apollo all the gods had 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.400
 the dominion over life and death like this 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.319
 who sent one of his rays and killed 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.790
 a 'ccc' I ask 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.400
 enraged apollo by this unfortunate 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.450
 actually went to the place where 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.090
 cyclopes make their father's rays 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.790
 and killed each one of them for the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.940
 revenge that I take apolo against zeus this one 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.980
 banished him from Olympus and as punishment he 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.760
 He sent to work as a slave for the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.010
 humans 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.939
 people many of the qualities and gifts 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.040
 who owned apollo previously named 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:26.170
 is poetry singing and 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.329
 improvisation with the help that had 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.420
 Giving his father Zeus the day of his 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.150
 birth always in the mountain parnassus 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.170
 in the company of all the muses that were 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.990
 your inspiration 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.750
 there was once a come out called macías 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:45.140
 inventor of the double tube flute the 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.760

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.220
 harmoniously his instruments but in 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.300
 definitive lyre of apollo was the one 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.090
 the heart of immense joy waited for him 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.190
 good human this is the summary of 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.100
 chapter 5 but I think it's 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.940
