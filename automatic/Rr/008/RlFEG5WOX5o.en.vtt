00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.230 
once it counts down in five seconds
starts<00:01:39.780> blinking<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.380> come<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.340> okay<00:01:42.180> so

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
starts blinking for come to one okay so

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.030 
starts blinking for come to one okay so
that's<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> front<00:01:43.110> view<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.829> camera

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that's just the front view of the camera

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.130 
that's just the front view of the camera
i<00:01:44.340> guess<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.240> below<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.780> there's<00:01:45.990> also

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
i guess just below that there's also

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.499 
i guess just below that there's also
microphone<00:01:46.740> input<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.149> where<00:01:48.390> you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
microphone input and it's it's where you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.330 
microphone input and it's it's where you
obviously<00:01:49.020> record<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.470> audio<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.070> video

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
obviously record the audio for the video

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.730 
obviously record the audio for the video
on<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:51.659> top<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.140> cabin<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
on the top of the cabin you have the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.200 
on the top of the cabin you have the
shutter<00:01:53.009> button<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.579> like<00:01:53.670> any<00:01:53.909> shutter

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
shutter button just like any shutter

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.730

button<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.570> push<00:01:54.750> halfway<00:01:55.140> down<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.500> pre

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
button you push halfway down and pre

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.880 
button you push halfway down and pre
focused<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.340> fully<00:01:57.119> press<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.259> actually

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
focused and fully press to actually

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.160

capture<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.340> shot<00:01:59.579> okay<00:02:00.030> looking<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:00.899> one<00:02:01.079> of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
capture the shot okay looking at one of

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.139 
capture the shot okay looking at one of
the<00:02:01.259> sides<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.860> camera<00:02:02.369> really<00:02:03.030> it's

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the sides of this camera really it's

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.149 
the sides of this camera really it's
plain<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.229> couple<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.530> screws<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:05.009> that's

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
plain just a couple of screws but that's

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.249 
plain just a couple of screws but that's
all<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:06.210> opposite<00:02:06.600> side<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.049> have<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
all on the opposite side you have the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.320 
all on the opposite side you have the
eyelid<00:02:08.009> where<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.520> actually<00:02:08.670> attach<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
eyelid where you can actually attach the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330 
eyelid where you can actually attach the
strap<00:02:09.750> that's<00:02:09.899> included<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:11.069> camera

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
strap that's included with this camera

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.550 
strap that's included with this camera
so<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.520> don't<00:02:11.730> obviously<00:02:11.910> drop<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.510> camera

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
so you don't obviously drop the camera

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.740 
so you don't obviously drop the camera
on<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:14.069> bottom<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.819> this<00:02:14.849> camera<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.510> have

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
on the bottom of this camera you have

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.220 
on the bottom of this camera you have
the<00:02:16.160> USB<00:02:17.160> connector<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.510> USB<00:02:18.810> connector

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
the USB connector and that USB connector

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.290 
the USB connector and that USB connector
also<00:02:19.500> doubles<00:02:19.860> up<00:02:20.010> as<00:02:20.040> your<00:02:20.580> charger<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.180> it

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
also doubles up as your charger so it

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.290 
also doubles up as your charger so it
does<00:02:21.450> include<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:22.489> sort<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.640> plug<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.180> you

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
does include a sort of a plug that you

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.270 
does include a sort of a plug that you
plug<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.810> wall<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.590> USB<00:02:25.800> cable<00:02:26.130> that

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
plug to the wall and a USB cable that

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.620 
plug to the wall and a USB cable that
connects<00:02:26.610> directly<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.150> Cameron<00:02:27.569> you

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
connects directly to this Cameron you

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.180 
connects directly to this Cameron you
would<00:02:27.750> charge<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.319> way<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.890> battery

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
would charge it that way so the battery

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.550 
would charge it that way so the battery
still<00:02:29.430> stays<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.480> camera<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.319> got<00:02:31.410> your

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
still stays in the camera you got your

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.580 
still stays in the camera you got your
tripod<00:02:32.010> mount<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.910> also<00:02:33.090> got<00:02:33.450> your<00:02:33.720> speakers

tripod mount you also got your speakers

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.380 
tripod mount you also got your speakers
so<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.430> play<00:02:35.610> back<00:02:35.819> your<00:02:36.000> audios
