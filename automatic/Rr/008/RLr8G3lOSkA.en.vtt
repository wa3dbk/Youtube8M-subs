00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.399 
think that women need cars in quite the
same<00:01:08.220> way<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.760> men<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.630> an<00:01:09.720> extension

of<00:01:10.500> their<00:01:10.650> personality<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.610> think<00:01:12.270> women<00:01:12.420> are

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
of their personality I think women are

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
and I think maybe the last consideration

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.190 
and I think maybe the last consideration
or<00:01:16.890> they're<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.520> important

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
or they're just as important

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.550 
or they're just as important
is<00:01:18.439> what<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:18.920> car<00:01:19.100> looks<00:01:19.369> like<00:01:19.659> I<00:01:20.659> suspect<00:01:21.350> men

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
is what the car looks like I suspect men
