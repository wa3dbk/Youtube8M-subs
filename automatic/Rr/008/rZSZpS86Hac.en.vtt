00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.340
 since time immemorial the friezes have fought against the water 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:14.279
 houses destroyed and people drowned in the water 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.289
 they therefore did everything to control the water 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.310
 so it takes a while to stop the water 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.390
 this allowed polders in service than to speak 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.019
 because the excess water had to be taken out 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.899
 on the outer ring two things are needed on the one hand in the next two months 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.680
 your excess water 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.850
 first save i put you in the bosom 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.070
 and then drain 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.450
 or the decision to open this way or have it set up by the consort 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.270
 so that is one side of the story 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.690
 seeing another side of the penalty here is that you end up flying low 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.760
 must protect against the increased with sea water it came down to as one 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.910
 piece of land too often from the water depth others solemnly carried on a plague 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.450
 think your quay is called that 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.910
 and he left it in man from Utrecht to have them hammered in a boat 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.910
 and wash erem and meets 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.110
 the biggest fallers 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.260
 and he demanded function in clogs of water 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.110
 from the pool rober 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.110
 8 you see in the water indicates there are jacks on a low side 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.610
 screw 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.080
 from that knowledge that it is also a kind of babe construction 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.100
 this was discovered in the water with 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.340
 turns where the blows fall 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.340
 as a result, go to the mill and execute it properly 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.600
 there is the last part of this area that the polder 250 went on 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.380
 so that a closed whole 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.190
 if there is too much i hope that out there how can i do that with it 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.870
 pull out the mill 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.450
 the dolls 4 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.590
 this closed 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.870
 this shed is connected to the dike closed at the bottom of the sea dike 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.880
 directly task that connection
