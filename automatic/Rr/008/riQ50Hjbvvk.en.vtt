of course but it just looks kind of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.850 
of course but it just looks kind of
funny<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.490> me<00:02:05.520> okay<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.509> first<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.960> all<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
funny to me okay so first of all the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.550 
funny to me okay so first of all the
color<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.599> weird<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.349> this

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
color is like just so weird like this

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.130 
color is like just so weird like this
baby<00:02:10.860> blue<00:02:11.430> color

baby blue color

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.210 
baby blue color
even<00:02:12.380> though<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:12.530> know<00:02:12.770> that's<00:02:12.980> not<00:02:13.160> the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
even though I know that's not the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.540 
even though I know that's not the
original<00:02:13.520> color<00:02:14.000> it's<00:02:14.870> just<00:02:15.280> kind<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.340> odd

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
original color it's just kind of odd

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.240 
original color it's just kind of odd
it's<00:02:17.480> like<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:17.930> bright<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.650> just<00:02:18.920> kind<00:02:19.190> of

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
it's like so bright and I just kind of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.900 
it's like so bright and I just kind of
don't<00:02:19.370> like<00:02:19.580> it

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
don't like it

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.390 
don't like it
the<00:02:20.690> parts<00:02:21.080> are<00:02:21.320> kind<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.650> weird<00:02:21.860> too<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.250> it

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
the parts are kind of weird too so it

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.310 
the parts are kind of weird too so it
has<00:02:22.550> all<00:02:22.760> these<00:02:22.880> like<00:02:23.150> sharp<00:02:23.570> edges<00:02:23.810> which<00:02:24.290> is

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
has all these like sharp edges which is

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.230 
has all these like sharp edges which is
supposed<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:24.800> represent<00:02:24.890> like<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.430> shark's<00:02:25.940> fin

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
supposed to represent like a shark's fin

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.590 
supposed to represent like a shark's fin
and<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:27.500> name<00:02:28.070> fin<00:02:28.400> itself<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.390> just

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
and the name fin itself and it just

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.780 
and the name fin itself and it just
looks<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:30.020> little<00:02:30.140> weird<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.950> me<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:34.040> doesn't<00:02:34.340> I

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
looks a little weird to me it doesn't I

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.500 
looks a little weird to me it doesn't I
don't<00:02:35.390> feel<00:02:35.720> like<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.290> represents<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.890> shark

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
don't feel like it represents a shark

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.550 
don't feel like it represents a shark
but<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.570> guess<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:38.990> is<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.140> best<00:02:39.350> they<00:02:39.500> could

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
but I guess this is the best they could

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.090 
but I guess this is the best they could
do<00:02:40.480> but<00:02:41.480> yeah<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.140> me<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.410> just<00:02:42.440> looked<00:02:42.740> really

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
do but yeah to me it just looked really

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.550 
do but yeah to me it just looked really
funny<00:02:43.340> like<00:02:43.670> especially<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.180> feet<00:02:44.480> all<00:02:45.290> these

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
funny like especially the feet all these

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.740 
funny like especially the feet all these
this<00:02:46.010> pointed<00:02:46.459> part<00:02:46.640> right<00:02:46.820> here<00:02:47.060> which<00:02:47.330> I

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
this pointed part right here which I

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.920 
this pointed part right here which I
don't<00:02:48.410> know<00:02:48.620> what<00:02:48.950> purpose<00:02:49.340> that's<00:02:49.580> for<00:02:49.940> I

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
don't know what purpose that's for I

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.560 
don't know what purpose that's for I
guess<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:51.980> part<00:02:52.280> down<00:02:52.640> here<00:02:52.790> would<00:02:53.209> be<00:02:53.330> a

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
guess this part down here would be a

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.050 
guess this part down here would be a
nice<00:02:53.780> place<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.440> put<00:02:54.470> your<00:02:54.739> finger<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.850> that

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
nice place to put your finger and that

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.100 
nice place to put your finger and that
works<00:02:56.270> I<00:02:56.540> guess<00:02:56.750> but<00:02:58.510> altogether<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.780> think<00:02:59.870> he

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
works I guess but altogether I think he

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.160 
works I guess but altogether I think he
just<00:03:00.290> looks<00:03:00.470> kind<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.770> funny<00:03:01.090> okay<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:02.170> let's

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
just looks kind of funny okay so let's

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.780 
just looks kind of funny okay so let's
talk<00:03:03.290> about<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.650> core<00:03:03.890> which<00:03:04.070> is<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.250> spin

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
talk about the core which is the spin

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.210 
talk about the core which is the spin
core<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.410> this<00:03:06.410> originally<00:03:06.950> came<00:03:07.160> with

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
core and this originally came with

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.810 
core and this originally came with
thunder<00:03:07.970> leo<00:03:08.180> or<00:03:08.480> spin<00:03:09.230> lyosha<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:10.489> it<00:03:10.640> has

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
thunder leo or spin lyosha so it has

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.270 
thunder leo or spin lyosha so it has
this<00:03:11.090> rubber<00:03:11.450> piece<00:03:11.840> just<00:03:12.290> on<00:03:12.590> this<00:03:12.920> side

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
this rubber piece just on this side

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.370 
this rubber piece just on this side
right<00:03:13.310> here<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:14.570> what<00:03:14.720> that's<00:03:14.900> supposed<00:03:15.320> to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
right here and what that's supposed to

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.490 
right here and what that's supposed to
do<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.890> give<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:16.700> spin<00:03:17.120> like<00:03:18.019> kind<00:03:18.320> of<00:03:18.350> like

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
in bowling and so what that does it will

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.759 
in bowling and so what that does it will
like<00:03:20.930> curve<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:22.610> buta<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.330> betta<00:03:24.110> marble<00:03:24.560> and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
hit two targets or kind of hit around a

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.860 
hit two targets or kind of hit around a
target<00:03:27.769> what's<00:03:28.700> funny<00:03:28.970> about<00:03:29.060> this<00:03:29.420> board<00:03:29.720> is

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
target what's funny about this board is

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.000 
target what's funny about this board is
that<00:03:29.959> it<00:03:30.590> comes<00:03:30.950> with<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:32.350> trigger<00:03:33.350> or<00:03:33.739> like

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
that it comes with the trigger or like

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.120 
that it comes with the trigger or like
these<00:03:34.340> two<00:03:34.549> handles<00:03:35.090> from<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.019> original<00:03:36.799> one

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
these two handles from the original one

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.490 
these two handles from the original one
side<00:03:37.459> core<00:03:37.820> and<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.840> thought<00:03:38.959> that<00:03:39.140> was<00:03:39.290> pretty

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
side core and I thought that was pretty

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.020 
side core and I thought that was pretty
odd<00:03:39.769> I<00:03:39.950> don't<00:03:40.130> know<00:03:40.220> if<00:03:40.280> that<00:03:40.400> was<00:03:40.489> a<00:03:40.519> mistake

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
odd I don't know if that was a mistake

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.990 
odd I don't know if that was a mistake
or<00:03:41.269> if<00:03:41.989> just<00:03:42.410> all<00:03:43.060> Lightning<00:03:44.060> fins<00:03:44.420> or<00:03:44.810> fin

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
or if just all Lightning fins or fin

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.330 
or if just all Lightning fins or fin
beat<00:03:47.000> them<00:03:47.150> on<00:03:47.299> just<00:03:47.570> come<00:03:47.900> with<00:03:48.350> it<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:48.709> I

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
beat them on just come with it so I

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.340 
beat them on just come with it so I
thought<00:03:49.549> that<00:03:49.670> was<00:03:49.790> kind<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.239> weird<00:03:50.510> but<00:03:51.290> I

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
thought that was kind of weird but I

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.620 
thought that was kind of weird but I
guess<00:03:51.620> it<00:03:51.830> works<00:03:52.040> if<00:03:52.820> you<00:03:53.030> just<00:03:53.180> want<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.450> hold

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
guess it works if you just want to hold

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.030 
guess it works if you just want to hold
it<00:03:53.750> like<00:03:53.900> this<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:55.250> kind<00:03:55.640> of<00:03:56.200> turn<00:03:57.200> it<00:03:57.380> and<00:03:57.590> aim

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
it like this and kind of turn it and aim

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
it like this and kind of turn it and aim
this<00:03:58.610> like<00:03:59.090> this<00:03:59.590> but<00:04:00.590> I<00:04:00.739> don't<00:04:00.890> know<00:04:01.030> was<00:04:02.030> that

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
this like this but I don't know was that

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.479 
this like this but I don't know was that
on<00:04:02.269> purpose<00:04:02.299> or<00:04:02.780> by<00:04:02.810> accident<00:04:03.250> that's<00:04:04.250> just<00:04:04.430> a

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
on purpose or by accident that's just a

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.910 
on purpose or by accident that's just a
little<00:04:04.730> odd<00:04:04.880> to<00:04:05.090> me<00:04:05.120> here's<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:05.989> comparison<00:04:06.380> to

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
little odd to me here's a comparison to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.430 
little odd to me here's a comparison to
the<00:04:07.160> original<00:04:07.280> lightning<00:04:08.030> Finn<00:04:08.239> also<00:04:09.049> the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
the original lightning Finn also the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.699 
the original lightning Finn also the
Hasbro<00:04:10.010> version<00:04:10.070> and<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:12.140> one<00:04:12.290> on<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.440> left

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
Hasbro version and the one on the left

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.710 
Hasbro version and the one on the left
definitely<00:04:13.489> has<00:04:13.610> a<00:04:13.640> better<00:04:14.000> color<00:04:14.299> but

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
definitely has a better color but

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.990 
definitely has a better color but
they're<00:04:15.709> pretty<00:04:15.950> much<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.190> same<00:04:16.370> just

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
they're pretty much the same just

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.199 
they're pretty much the same just
different<00:04:17.060> core<00:04:17.540> even<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.290> handles<00:04:19.100> are<00:04:19.489> on

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
different core even the handles are on

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.770 
different core even the handles are on
the<00:04:20.330> trigger<00:04:20.660> are<00:04:21.789> kind<00:04:22.789> of<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.060> same<00:04:23.300> just

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
the trigger are kind of the same just

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.660 
the trigger are kind of the same just
different<00:04:24.020> color<00:04:24.229> so<00:04:24.740> let's<00:04:24.950> do<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.099> couple<00:04:25.460> of

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
different color so let's do a couple of

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.840 
different color so let's do a couple of
test<00:04:25.820> shots<00:04:26.090> for<00:04:26.480> thunder<00:04:27.260> then<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:30.850> he's

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
test shots for thunder then and he's

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:40.170 
test shots for thunder then and he's
actually<00:04:32.090> pretty<00:04:32.720> powerful

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.610 

it's<00:04:41.180> kind<00:04:41.420> of<00:04:41.450> hard<00:04:41.720> demonstrating<00:04:42.440> how<00:04:42.560> the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
it's kind of hard demonstrating how the

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.440 
it's kind of hard demonstrating how the
spin<00:04:43.070> core<00:04:43.400> works<00:04:43.700> because<00:04:44.120> you<00:04:44.150> can't

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
spin core works because you can't

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.160 
spin core works because you can't
actually<00:04:44.630> see<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.320> spin<00:04:45.590> but<00:04:46.840> you<00:04:47.840> notice

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
actually see the spin but you notice

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.130 
actually see the spin but you notice
that<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.670> beta<00:04:49.670> marble<00:04:50.060> keeps<00:04:50.270> coming<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.750> my

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
that the beta marble keeps coming to my

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.110 
that the beta marble keeps coming to my
left<00:04:51.410> side<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:54.520> because<00:04:55.520> it's<00:04:55.730> putting<00:04:55.970> a

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
left side and because it's putting a

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.450 
left side and because it's putting a
spin<00:04:56.360> on<00:04:56.420> it<00:04:56.570> and<00:04:57.410> it's<00:04:57.560> forcing<00:04:57.980> it<00:04:58.100> to<00:04:58.130> come

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
spin on it and it's forcing it to come

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.060 
spin on it and it's forcing it to come
to<00:04:58.790> the<00:04:59.120> left<00:04:59.300> side<00:04:59.510> only<00:04:59.720> so<00:05:00.020> this<00:05:00.440> guy<00:05:00.680> is

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
to the left side only so this guy is

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.540 
to the left side only so this guy is
okay<00:05:01.670> I<00:05:02.480> really<00:05:02.750> don't<00:05:02.960> like<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.350> color<00:05:03.710> on<00:05:04.130> it

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
okay I really don't like the color on it

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.140 
okay I really don't like the color on it
neither<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.570> shape<00:05:06.370> it<00:05:07.370> just<00:05:07.430> looks<00:05:07.880> really

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
neither the shape it just looks really

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.110 
neither the shape it just looks really
weird<00:05:08.480> to<00:05:08.630> me<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:10.460> spin<00:05:10.730> core<00:05:10.940> is

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
weird to me and the spin core is

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.850 
weird to me and the spin core is
actually<00:05:11.450> a<00:05:11.510> pretty<00:05:11.750> powerful<00:05:11.870> core<00:05:12.500> I<00:05:12.530> like

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
actually a pretty powerful core I like

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.230 
actually a pretty powerful core I like
the<00:05:13.010> spin<00:05:13.190> core<00:05:13.430> but<00:05:13.610> if<00:05:13.670> you're<00:05:13.850> going<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.150> get

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
the spin core but if you're going to get

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.220 
the spin core but if you're going to get
the<00:05:14.390> spin<00:05:14.660> core

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
the spin core

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.840 
the spin core
I'd<00:05:15.650> rather<00:05:16.480> suggest<00:05:17.770> getting<00:05:18.770> thunder<00:05:19.550> Leo

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
I'd rather suggest getting thunder Leo

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.120 
I'd rather suggest getting thunder Leo
because<00:05:20.150> thunder<00:05:20.630> leo<00:05:20.810> looks<00:05:21.200> a<00:05:21.380> lot<00:05:21.830> cooler

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
because thunder leo looks a lot cooler

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.560 
because thunder leo looks a lot cooler
and<00:05:22.750> it<00:05:23.750> just<00:05:24.550> yeah<00:05:25.550> it<00:05:25.820> just<00:05:25.850> looks<00:05:26.060> a<00:05:26.300> lot

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
and it just yeah it just looks a lot

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.080 
and it just yeah it just looks a lot
cooler<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:27.340> that's<00:05:28.340> all<00:05:28.490> I<00:05:28.520> got<00:05:28.700> to<00:05:28.820> say<00:05:28.850> about

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
cooler and that's all I got to say about

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.630 
cooler and that's all I got to say about
that<00:05:29.240> so<00:05:29.720> that<00:05:29.960> is<00:05:30.200> my<00:05:30.350> unboxing<00:05:30.500> of<00:05:31.070> Hasbro's
