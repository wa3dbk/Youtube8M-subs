 smartphones are productivity tools but for 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.990
 that these devices achieved maximum efficiency requires applications 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.570

 Smartphones and their business applications

 Andean region that is cousin on stage does not have eternal life chevron 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.980
 mobility services are now deployed in many departments and 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.859
 business critical areas which applications 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.640
 what companies require most 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.210
 the first thing that would make supposedly distinguishable constant between the capital 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.810
 They are for the final consumer 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.900
 and applications of the business sector 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.280
 Anibal the final consumer what we have seen in recent years is 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.470
 effectively issues like email pushed up the 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.820
 mobile device 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.940
 the email sent to any of our users is arrives 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.160
 he is immediately welcomed to our March 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.770
 at the level of business applications where all the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.130
 mobility is just in the sector 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.510
 consumption for sales force automation then that's where 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.180
 greater has been developed 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.720
 It was endorsed that entrepreneurs ask him if those applications should 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.010
 be integrated into the system three years ago 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.580
 Well, just if the application 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.660
 requires that you found the transactionality of business in the mobile point ie 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.750
 in the countryside 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.980
 and that it be integrated so that the business process continued just 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.940
 integrate through interfaces that can also be lived as the 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.910
 communications allow otan offline as they require it simply 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.560
 hear 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.590
 what there is but this time I am ready for activities in cases such as 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.620
 censuses 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.670
 Survey of information surveys is not an exclusive issue and 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.520
 sales automation notice what was initially developed in the sector 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.479
 private 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.780
 but precisely because of the census 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.830
 in Colombia the year 2005 and the rulers realized that the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.670
 mobility contributes a lot to those processes that need to be automated 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.769
 hasenkamp 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.059
 thus 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:31.089
 ee and I love I am by ohl we can see projects from automation to 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:32.399
 Sales force 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:36.569
 transaction and business until you simply take information and data in 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.259
 field for me to continue 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.999
 a process a site in the car 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.209
 but eggs exist 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.709
 Several providers like Nokia Hp Panda Panda and Motorola Motorola lately 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.269
 How does a company properly select its platform 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.040
 for mobile telephony 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.649
 that integrates these solutions 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:59.189
 Well, even though it would seem like a pocket-sized answer to choose the 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.969
 mobile platform 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.589
 just needs the needs that you are not trying to solve 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:08.629
 in a moment to one you can have a user that requires keyboard or in a 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.219
 moment to one wants the transaction that geo-referential 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.809
 then depending on what problem is going to be solved 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:20.299
 in that sense a month with the team the interesting thing of what of all 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.699
 the colors busts sizes and with all kinds of associated devices like 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.009
 Thursday 20th what are the market entities 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:31.089

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:32.660
 criminally mentioned Orlando 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.489
 p initially processed the consumer sector 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.950
