see<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.100> don't<00:01:29.520> know<00:01:29.720> what<00:01:30.720> focus<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:32.689> little

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
see but I don't know what focus a little

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.370 
see but I don't know what focus a little
bit<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.310> obviously<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.840> move<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.200> up

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
bit and then obviously if you move on up

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.319 
bit and then obviously if you move on up
there's<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.680> huge<00:01:38.130> difference<00:01:38.460> starting<00:01:39.150> right

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
there's a huge difference starting right

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.620 
there's a huge difference starting right
here<00:01:39.470> well<00:01:40.470> obviously<00:01:40.590> color<00:01:41.630> definitely

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
here well obviously color definitely

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.859 
here well obviously color definitely
this<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.460> tannish<00:01:44.460> yellow<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.180> it's

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
this is like a tannish yellow and it's

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.960 
this is like a tannish yellow and it's
not<00:01:46.079> showing<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.530> very<00:01:46.799> well<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.189> got<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> huge

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
not showing up very well it's got a huge

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.560 
not showing up very well it's got a huge
glare<00:01:49.250> but<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.640> move<00:01:50.880> up<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.420> is

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
glare but if we move up here this is

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.170 
glare but if we move up here this is
obviously<00:01:51.780> metal<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:53.850> good

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
obviously metal and it's really good

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.469 
obviously metal and it's really good
metal<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.649> we<00:01:55.799> look<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:56.189> right<00:01:56.880> here<00:01:57.180> this

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
metal but if we look on right here this

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.780 
metal but if we look on right here this
has<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.719> flat<00:01:58.170> back<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.219> has<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> curved

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
has a flat back and this has a curved

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.910 
has a flat back and this has a curved
back<00:02:00.060> which<00:02:00.270> allows<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.680> more

back which allows you to have more

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.730 
back which allows you to have more
control<00:02:02.159> when<00:02:02.640> you're<00:02:02.790> going<00:02:03.090> inside<00:02:03.740> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
control when you're going inside the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.590 
control when you're going inside the
pins<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.340> your

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
pins of your

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
this one which would have probably

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.270
