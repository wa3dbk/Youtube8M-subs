00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:06.620
 Hairstyle: an unfamiliar style of fame 

00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:10.171
 This hairstyle has a lot of texture. 

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.668
 Hair is slightly dull and matured. 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.858
 Swim through your hair or your fingers 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.746
 to remove all remnants of the product. 

00:00:21.908 --> 00:00:26.346
 You will need a hair curler. 

00:00:26.523 --> 00:00:29.365
 Make a middle section of the head. 

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:33.711
 Separate the pegs of five centimeters wide. 

00:00:33.873 --> 00:00:36.158
 Use a coat to attach the rest of your hair so it does not bother you. 

00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:38.721
 You will also need simple clasps. 

00:00:38.883 --> 00:00:43.643
 Apply heat-spray spray on the root. 

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:47.240
 Then remove the waistband in the form of a triangle 

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:51.200
 and bend it slightly to the roots. 

00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:55.460
 Set the curl and wrap the wrap 

00:00:55.623 --> 00:01:00.006
 twice about the sequel. Hold the tops firmly. 

00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:04.501
 Pull out the extension, twist the string 

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:07.665
 around the finger and attach it to the scalp. 

00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:14.160
 Continue backward. Sprinkle the root. 

00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:21.216
 Be careful not to wash the appliance. 

00:01:21.378 --> 00:01:24.650
 This is a hairstyle for hair length bob-hairstyles. 

00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:27.465
 If hair is shorter, it will have too much volume. 

00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:30.640
 If you have a very long hair, 

00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:36.601
 wrap it several times around the curls. 

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:40.253
 There is no particular direction in shaping this hairstyle. 

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:43.751
 You can bend it forward or backward. 

00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:46.225
 But twist the front fingers backwards 

00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:49.000
 so that your hair does not fall on your face. 

00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:51.130
 Swing alternately forward and backward 

00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:54.720
 to get more texture. 

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:58.763
 Always tighten the curls with the buckles. 

00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:02.376
 Let the curls completely cool down. 

00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:07.543
 Then pull the buckles 

00:02:07.705 --> 00:02:11.480
 and pass through your hair with your fingers. 

00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:14.960
 Dry the area slightly with a duster 

00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:18.383
 between tilted and straight hair. 

00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:23.733
 During drying, thin the tip of the hair. 

00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:27.080
 For this hairstyle we will not apply anything to the glitter. 

00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:33.341
 Apply a volume powder. 

00:02:33.503 --> 00:02:37.476
 This is a very beautiful, mature hairstyle. 

00:02:37.638 --> 00:02:40.268
 If you want to have the same haircut the next day, 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.733
 curl up some pramen with curl. 

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:45.320
 First apply a dry shampoo.
