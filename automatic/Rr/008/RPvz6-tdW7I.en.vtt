properly<00:02:02.719> with<00:02:03.259> your<00:02:03.289> oculus<00:02:03.829> rift<00:02:04.039> you<00:02:04.219> know

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
properly with your oculus rift you know

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.609 
properly with your oculus rift you know
because<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:05.420> dk2<00:02:05.719> is<00:02:05.990> still<00:02:06.229> a<00:02:06.259> little<00:02:06.499> bit

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
because the dk2 is still a little bit

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.529 
because the dk2 is still a little bit
pixelated<00:02:06.889> you<00:02:07.280> know<00:02:07.399> but<00:02:07.639> they<00:02:07.759> build<00:02:08.390> it

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
way you can aim in the game because your

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.590 
way you can aim in the game because your
crosshair<00:04:38.370> is<00:04:38.580> like<00:04:38.760> moving<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.270> all<00:04:39.480> the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
crosshair is like moving to all the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.230 
crosshair is like moving to all the

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
sites you can move your crosshair to the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.490 
sites you can move your crosshair to the
left<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.720> screen<00:04:42.840> to<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.230> right<00:04:43.260> of

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
left of the screen to the right of

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.620 
left of the screen to the right of
screen<00:04:43.680> it's<00:04:43.860> not<00:04:44.040> being<00:04:45.000> in<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.180> middle<00:04:45.480> all

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
screen it's not being in the middle all

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.330 
screen it's not being in the middle all
the<00:04:45.660> time<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:46.050> can<00:04:46.260> move<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:46.770> all<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.010> sides

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
the time you can move it all the sides

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.730 
the time you can move it all the sides
and<00:04:47.670> that's<00:04:47.850> making<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:48.780> really<00:04:48.960> easy<00:04:49.260> to<00:04:49.440> play

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
and that's making it really easy to play

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.860 
and that's making it really easy to play
a<00:04:49.770> shooter<00:04:50.220> like<00:04:50.250> team<00:04:50.700> fathers<00:04:51.150> for<00:04:51.390> example

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
a shooter like team fathers for example

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.600 
a shooter like team fathers for example
so<00:04:52.290> I'm<00:04:52.440> really<00:04:52.620> happy<00:04:52.830> that<00:04:53.010> foam<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.580> really

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
so I'm really happy that foam is really

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.960 
so I'm really happy that foam is really
involved<00:04:54.510> of<00:04:54.810> course<00:04:54.840> with<00:04:55.320> oculus<00:04:55.770> VR<00:04:56.190> I<00:04:56.370> know

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
involved of course with oculus VR I know

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.690 
involved of course with oculus VR I know
that<00:04:57.270> because<00:04:57.420> they<00:04:57.690> work<00:04:57.960> together<00:04:58.140> right<00:04:58.700> so

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
that because they work together right so

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.120 
that because they work together right so
that's<00:05:00.030> that's<00:05:00.510> really<00:05:00.810> nice<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.350> that's

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
that's that's really nice and that's

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.740 
that's that's really nice and that's
basically<00:05:02.490> everything<00:05:02.700> I<00:05:03.000> want<00:05:03.180> to<00:05:03.270> say<00:05:03.450> about

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
basically everything I want to say about

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.380 
basically everything I want to say about
the<00:05:04.680> heavy<00:05:04.860> because<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.550> heavy<00:05:05.760> is<00:05:05.940> really<00:05:06.360> a

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
the heavy because the heavy is really a

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.390 
the heavy because the heavy is really a
character<00:05:07.380> I<00:05:07.440> would<00:05:07.560> recommend<00:05:08.070> you<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.310> play

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
character I would recommend you to play

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.000 
character I would recommend you to play
with<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:08.880> oculus<00:05:09.420> rift<00:05:09.620> next<00:05:10.620> time<00:05:10.740> I<00:05:10.860> will

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
with the oculus rift next time I will

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.740 
with the oculus rift next time I will
play<00:05:11.160> with<00:05:11.250> scout<00:05:11.700> I'm<00:05:11.970> really<00:05:12.330> afraid<00:05:12.600> of

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
play with scout I'm really afraid of

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.290 
play with scout I'm really afraid of
that<00:05:13.020> one<00:05:13.560> will<00:05:13.770> be<00:05:13.980> a<00:05:14.250> little<00:05:14.550> bit<00:05:14.670> harder<00:05:15.120> to

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
that one will be a little bit harder to

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.970 
that one will be a little bit harder to
play<00:05:15.780> with<00:05:15.990> because<00:05:16.170> that<00:05:16.440> one<00:05:16.590> is<00:05:16.650> like

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
play with because that one is like

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.280 
play with because that one is like
moving<00:05:17.640> like<00:05:18.000> crazy<00:05:18.210> and<00:05:18.600> he's<00:05:18.750> really<00:05:19.080> fast

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
moving like crazy and he's really fast

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.950 
moving like crazy and he's really fast
you<00:05:19.560> know<00:05:19.710> so<00:05:20.220> but<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:20.670> I<00:05:20.970> will<00:05:21.420> just<00:05:21.630> discover

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
you know so but I I will just discover

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.630 
you know so but I I will just discover
that<00:05:22.170> right<00:05:22.440> so<00:05:22.680> we<00:05:22.920> will<00:05:23.040> just<00:05:23.250> test<00:05:23.460> it<00:05:23.580> out

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
that right so we will just test it out

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.190 
that right so we will just test it out
and<00:05:23.910> then<00:05:24.000> see<00:05:24.210> how<00:05:24.330> it<00:05:24.360> goes<00:05:24.630> so<00:05:25.050> that's

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
and then see how it goes so that's

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.930 
and then see how it goes so that's
basically<00:05:25.560> it<00:05:25.770> do<00:05:26.130> you<00:05:26.220> have<00:05:26.370> any<00:05:26.610> tips

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
basically it do you have any tips
