the video the back of the barn is down
about<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.189> foot<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:24.420> needs<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.689> lot<00:00:24.869> more<00:00:24.900> slope

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
about a foot it needs a lot more slope

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.189 
about a foot it needs a lot more slope
to<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.769> need<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.279> get<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.550> water<00:00:26.789> away<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:28.080> we

to it need to get the water away so we

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.380 
to it need to get the water away so we
brought<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.619> some<00:00:28.859> class<00:00:29.189> five<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.880> some<00:00:30.060> sand

this<00:01:07.740> part<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> projects<00:01:08.640> done<00:01:08.790> now<00:01:09.210> we

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
this part of the projects done now we

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.030 
this part of the projects done now we
turned<00:01:09.630> our<00:01:09.780> attention<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.439> inside<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
turned our attention to the inside and

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.399 
turned our attention to the inside and
since<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.880> were<00:01:12.000> already<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.049> dropping

since we were already you know dropping

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.580 
since we were already you know dropping

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
off sand to the pad on the outside we

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.440 
off sand to the pad on the outside we
dropped<00:01:16.830> off<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.220> whole<00:01:17.400> bunch<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.939> sand<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
show it in this video but we spent a day

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.380 
show it in this video but we spent a day
and<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.780> half<00:01:37.020> compact<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.189> sand<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:39.270> know

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and a half compact in the sand you know

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.109 
and a half compact in the sand you know
using<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.990> pounder<00:01:40.500> both<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.070> edges<00:01:41.520> manually

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
using a pounder both of edges manually

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.170 
using a pounder both of edges manually
and<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.930> rented<00:01:43.350> one<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> center<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.970> just

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and a rented one in the center it just

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.999 
and a rented one in the center it just
gets<00:01:45.360> too<00:01:45.509> boring<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.930> show<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.409> basically

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
gets too boring to show but basically

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100 
gets too boring to show but basically
what<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.250> did<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.060> see<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
what we did is as you can see here the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.539 
what we did is as you can see here the
right<00:01:49.350> side<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.799> barn<00:01:50.009> has<00:01:50.189> been<00:01:50.369> leveled

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
right side of the barn has been leveled

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.120 
right side of the barn has been leveled
up<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.450> left<00:01:51.840> side<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.290> barn<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.890> not

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
up the left side of the barn here is not

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.830 
up the left side of the barn here is not
yet<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:53.670> kind<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> difference<00:01:54.659> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
yet see kind of see the difference and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.380 
yet see kind of see the difference and
we<00:01:55.649> made<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> nice<00:01:56.130> fill<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.820> here<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.210> all

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
we made a nice fill so here it is all

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.749 
we made a nice fill so here it is all
filled<00:01:57.689> up<00:01:57.930> with<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> sand<00:01:59.280> now<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
filled up with the sand now the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.060 
filled up with the sand now the
processes<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.689> leveling<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.740> our<00:02:01.920> next

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
processes of leveling this is our next

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.760 
processes of leveling this is our next
step<00:02:02.280> once<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.750> leveled<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.409> then

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
step once we get this leveled and then

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.249 
step once we get this leveled and then
compacted<00:02:05.549> then<00:02:06.119> we're<00:02:06.329> ready<00:02:06.450> for<00:02:06.750> concrete

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
compacted then we're ready for concrete

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.300 
compacted then we're ready for concrete
I<00:02:07.560> chose<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> real<00:02:08.789> fine<00:02:09.239> sand

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
I chose a real fine sand

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.000 
I chose a real fine sand
halfbacks<00:02:10.759> very<00:02:11.090> very<00:02:11.360> hard<00:02:12.010> unfortunately

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
halfbacks very very hard unfortunately

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.530 
halfbacks very very hard unfortunately
sometimes<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.489> can<00:02:13.670> get<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:14.060> know<00:02:14.150> cheaper

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
sometimes you can get you know cheaper

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.420 
sometimes you can get you know cheaper
of<00:02:14.569> course<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.680> doesn't<00:02:15.890> compact

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
of course and and this doesn't compact

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.580 
of course and and this doesn't compact
very<00:02:16.730> much<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:17.750> here<00:02:18.140> we<00:02:18.260> are<00:02:18.290> what<00:02:18.560> the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
very much so here we are what the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.010 
very much so here we are what the
seconds<00:02:19.069> gets<00:02:19.280> gear<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.790> one's<00:02:20.060> got<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.300> laser

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
seconds gets gear this one's got a laser

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.710 
seconds gets gear this one's got a laser
level<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:22.069> kind<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.370> nice<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.420> we<00:02:23.569> can

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
level on it just kind of nice so we can

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.229 
level on it just kind of nice so we can
basically<00:02:23.900> get<00:02:24.349> it<00:02:24.500> as<00:02:24.620> absolutely<00:02:25.550> level<00:02:26.090> as

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
basically get it as absolutely level as

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.770 
basically get it as absolutely level as
we<00:02:26.390> can<00:02:27.280> in<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.459> situation<00:02:29.090> when<00:02:29.239> be<00:02:29.360> pouring

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
we can in this situation when be pouring

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.339 
we can in this situation when be pouring
probably<00:02:30.319> about<00:02:31.780> seven<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.870> eight<00:02:32.930> inch

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
probably about seven to eight inch

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.470 
probably about seven to eight inch
concrete<00:02:33.650> floor<00:02:34.220> at<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.819> entrance<00:02:35.239> of<00:02:35.360> the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
concrete floor at the entrance of the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.150 
concrete floor at the entrance of the
barn<00:02:35.720> where<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.200> tractors<00:02:36.650> will<00:02:36.830> sit<00:02:37.010> the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
barn where the tractors will sit the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.860 
barn where the tractors will sit the
most<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.610> then<00:02:37.910> we're<00:02:38.239> going<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.390> slope<00:02:38.660> it

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
most and then we're going to slope it

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.509 
most and then we're going to slope it
towards<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.290> back<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.800> towards<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.130> back<00:02:40.310> it

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
towards the back and towards the back it

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.420 
towards the back and towards the back it
will<00:02:40.580> end<00:02:40.730> up<00:02:40.819> being<00:02:41.030> four<00:02:41.360> inches<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:43.370> I'm

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
will end up being four inches so I'm

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.680 
will end up being four inches so I'm
guessing<00:02:43.910> we're<00:02:44.060> probably<00:02:44.269> going<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.540> be

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
guessing we're probably going to be

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.620 
guessing we're probably going to be
somewhere<00:02:44.930> between<00:02:45.100> 32<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.130> 40<00:02:46.730> yards<00:02:46.970> to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
somewhere between 32 and 40 yards to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.380 
somewhere between 32 and 40 yards to
focus<00:02:47.989> on<00:02:48.190> once<00:02:49.190> we<00:02:49.280> got<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.580> level<00:02:49.910> we<00:02:50.120> had<00:02:50.239> to

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
focus on once we got it level we had to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.350 
focus on once we got it level we had to
kind<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.660> build<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.290> forms<00:02:51.790> first<00:02:52.790> form<00:02:53.060> there

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
kind of build the forms first form there

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.180 
kind of build the forms first form there
was<00:02:53.510> for<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.750> front<00:02:53.989> door<00:02:54.260> as<00:02:54.769> you<00:02:54.920> can<00:02:55.040> see

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
was for the front door as you can see

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.210 
was for the front door as you can see
the<00:02:55.340> rebar<00:02:55.700> there<00:02:56.319> we<00:02:57.319> decided<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.709> put<00:02:57.890> rebar

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
the rebar there we decided to put rebar

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.190 
the rebar there we decided to put rebar
in<00:02:58.400> about<00:02:58.610> every<00:02:58.910> four<00:02:59.150> feet<00:02:59.420> sweeping<00:02:59.900> four

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
in about every four feet sweeping four

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.190 
in about every four feet sweeping four
foot<00:03:00.470> squares<00:03:00.860> in<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.819> barn<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.269> that's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
foot squares in the barn and that's

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.770 
foot squares in the barn and that's
going<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.500> give<00:03:03.650> us<00:03:03.769> strength<00:03:04.459> we<00:03:04.730> need

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
going to give us strength we need

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.720 
going to give us strength we need
longevity<00:03:05.780> nice<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.860> again<00:03:07.130> this<00:03:07.310> 12-foot

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
longevity nice so again this 12-foot

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.479 
longevity nice so again this 12-foot
rebar<00:03:08.209> we<00:03:08.360> hauled<00:03:08.599> in<00:03:08.810> made<00:03:09.560> our<00:03:09.769> forms<00:03:10.250> for

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
rebar we hauled in made our forms for

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.430 
rebar we hauled in made our forms for
the<00:03:10.549> concrete<00:03:10.580> up<00:03:11.180> front<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.750> door<00:03:12.019> closed

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
the concrete up front so the door closed

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.250 
the concrete up front so the door closed
nicely<00:03:13.099> and<00:03:13.310> then<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.060> course<00:03:14.090> time<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:15.079> pour

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
nicely and then of course time to pour

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.009 
nicely and then of course time to pour
concrete<00:03:15.579> so<00:03:16.579> this<00:03:17.329> is<00:03:17.540> what<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.780> looks<00:03:17.930> like

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
concrete so this is what it looks like

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.949 
concrete so this is what it looks like
with<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.410> rebar<00:03:18.739> in<00:03:18.920> place<00:03:19.390> pretty<00:03:20.390> much<00:03:20.510> like

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
with the rebar in place pretty much like

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.729 
with the rebar in place pretty much like
a<00:03:20.989> four<00:03:21.260> by<00:03:21.380> four<00:03:21.410> square<00:03:23.170> these<00:03:24.170> all<00:03:24.410> had<00:03:24.620> to

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
a four by four square these all had to

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.949 
a four by four square these all had to
be<00:03:24.769> tied<00:03:25.130> together<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:26.150> know<00:03:26.600> some<00:03:26.840> people

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
be tied together I know some people

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.110 
be tied together I know some people
don't<00:03:27.290> do<00:03:27.470> this<00:03:27.650> but<00:03:27.950> we<00:03:28.280> wanted<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.609> be<00:03:28.790> anal

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
don't do this but we wanted to be anal

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.490 
don't do this but we wanted to be anal
and<00:03:29.269> get<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:29.480> tied<00:03:29.690> together<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.230> way<00:03:30.380> it

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
and get it tied together that way it

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.440 
and get it tied together that way it
can't<00:03:30.709> move<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.549> everything<00:03:31.910> can<00:03:32.090> work<00:03:32.120> as<00:03:32.420> a

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
we could as we dropped it that way to

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.379 
we could as we dropped it that way to
save<00:04:37.910> less<00:04:38.210> work<00:04:38.479> with<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.990> mechanical

Charles you did go and rent a mechanical
tall<00:04:44.470> at<00:04:45.470> least<00:04:45.770> at<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.160> beginning<00:04:46.280> because

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
tall at least at the beginning because

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.320 
tall at least at the beginning because
that<00:04:47.210> was<00:04:47.389> the<00:04:47.600> easiest<00:04:48.789> you<00:04:49.789> know<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:50.060> the

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
that was the easiest you know the the

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.969 
that was the easiest you know the the
thing<00:04:50.539> with<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.720> is<00:04:50.900> it's<00:04:51.320> just<00:04:51.380> a<00:04:51.590> noisy

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
thing with that is it's just a noisy

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.379 
thing with that is it's just a noisy
machine<00:04:52.340> that<00:04:52.550> spins<00:04:52.789> around<00:04:53.000> on<00:04:53.330> the

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
machine that spins around on the

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.320 
machine that spins around on the
concrete<00:04:53.750> floors<00:04:54.550> really<00:04:55.550> no<00:04:55.789> reason<00:04:56.210> to

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
concrete floors really no reason to

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.270 
concrete floors really no reason to
continue<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:57.139> show<00:04:57.320> you<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.680> that<00:04:58.039> just

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
continue to show you that that just

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.370 
continue to show you that that just
would<00:04:58.460> have<00:04:58.520> probably<00:04:59.330> bored<00:04:59.599> you<00:04:59.840> even<00:05:00.139> more

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
would have probably bored you even more

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.879 
would have probably bored you even more
so<00:05:01.130> we<00:05:01.610> got<00:05:01.789> everything<00:05:02.150> done<00:05:02.599> that<00:05:02.870> we<00:05:03.530> could

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
so we got everything done that we could

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.930 
so we got everything done that we could
by<00:05:04.099> hand<00:05:04.400> here<00:05:04.789> and<00:05:05.320> we<00:05:06.320> floated<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.400> and<00:05:07.849> oh

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
by hand here and we floated it and oh

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.310 
by hand here and we floated it and oh
there's<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:08.539> rented<00:05:11.080> mechanical<00:05:12.080> trowel

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
there's the rented mechanical trowel

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.950 
there's the rented mechanical trowel
there<00:05:12.530> in<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:13.039> background<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:14.300> then<00:05:14.449> once<00:05:14.780> we

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
there in the background and then once we

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.580 
there in the background and then once we
got<00:05:15.110> that<00:05:15.320> done<00:05:16.300> basically<00:05:17.300> we<00:05:17.539> let<00:05:18.199> it<00:05:18.320> sit

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
got that done basically we let it sit

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.100 
got that done basically we let it sit
about<00:05:19.070> 24<00:05:19.789> hours<00:05:19.909> and<00:05:20.210> then<00:05:20.270> we<00:05:20.419> cut<00:05:20.599> lines<00:05:20.870> in

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
about 24 hours and then we cut lines in

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.680 
about 24 hours and then we cut lines in
it<00:05:21.260> so<00:05:21.770> right<00:05:22.190> here<00:05:22.430> I'm<00:05:22.610> basically<00:05:22.789> taking<00:05:23.599> a

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
it so right here I'm basically taking a

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.800 
it so right here I'm basically taking a
great<00:05:24.409> big<00:05:24.650> you<00:05:24.979> know<00:05:25.099> called<00:05:26.090> float<00:05:26.510> and

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
great big you know called float and

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.360 
great big you know called float and
pulling<00:05:27.110> it<00:05:27.199> back<00:05:27.349> and<00:05:27.380> forth<00:05:27.770> just<00:05:27.860> to<00:05:28.099> try

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
pulling it back and forth just to try

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.339 
pulling it back and forth just to try
and<00:05:28.400> smooth<00:05:29.300> it<00:05:29.449> out<00:05:29.539> the<00:05:29.599> best<00:05:29.930> I<00:05:30.080> can

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
and smooth it out the best I can

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.439 
and smooth it out the best I can
bring<00:05:30.650> that<00:05:30.830> water<00:05:31.130> up<00:05:31.400> to<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:31.669> top<00:05:31.699> get<00:05:32.240> those

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
bring that water up to the top get those

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.230 
bring that water up to the top get those
rocks<00:05:32.780> to<00:05:33.080> sink<00:05:33.349> down<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:33.860> want<00:05:34.639> this<00:05:34.820> floor<00:05:35.000> to

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
rocks to sink down I want this floor to

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.210 
rocks to sink down I want this floor to
be<00:05:35.360> sweepable<00:05:35.990> but<00:05:36.440> I<00:05:36.470> want<00:05:36.770> it<00:05:36.889> to<00:05:37.010> have<00:05:37.190> some

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
be sweepable but I want it to have some

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.450 
be sweepable but I want it to have some
grit<00:05:37.789> on<00:05:38.120> top<00:05:38.360> so<00:05:39.050> even<00:05:39.560> when<00:05:39.680> we<00:05:39.800> mechanically

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
grit on top so even when we mechanically

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.480 
grit on top so even when we mechanically
trawled<00:05:40.760> it<00:05:40.970> we<00:05:41.090> did<00:05:41.210> not<00:05:41.360> go<00:05:41.659> to<00:05:41.720> the<00:05:41.870> point<00:05:42.110> of

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
trawled it we did not go to the point of

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.980 
trawled it we did not go to the point of
smooth<00:05:43.490> I<00:05:43.729> don't<00:05:43.880> want<00:05:44.030> it<00:05:44.120> so<00:05:44.300> it's<00:05:44.479> so<00:05:44.659> smooth

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
smooth I don't want it so it's so smooth

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.149 
smooth I don't want it so it's so smooth
that<00:05:45.139> when<00:05:45.260> we<00:05:45.320> hit<00:05:45.440> it<00:05:45.500> with<00:05:45.650> water<00:05:45.949> it

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
that when we hit it with water it

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.430 
that when we hit it with water it
becomes<00:05:46.280> like<00:05:46.729> glass<00:05:47.030> and<00:05:47.389> here<00:05:48.289> we<00:05:48.409> are

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
becomes like glass and here we are

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.469 
becomes like glass and here we are
finishing<00:05:49.039> the<00:05:49.130> front<00:05:49.400> the<00:05:49.970> front<00:05:50.210> entrance

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
finishing the front the front entrance

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.330 
finishing the front the front entrance
there<00:05:50.720> where<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:50.960> door<00:05:51.169> is<00:05:51.199> you<00:05:52.099> know<00:05:52.190> this

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
there where the door is you know this

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.100 
there where the door is you know this
was<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:52.880> easy<00:05:53.030> part<00:05:53.180> because<00:05:53.599> of<00:05:53.690> course<00:05:53.900> the

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
was the easy part because of course the

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.080 
was the easy part because of course the
the<00:05:54.380> concrete<00:05:54.860> mixing<00:05:55.220> truck<00:05:55.460> could<00:05:55.669> pretty

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
the concrete mixing truck could pretty

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.450 
the concrete mixing truck could pretty
much<00:05:56.180> dump<00:05:56.599> it<00:05:56.750> where<00:05:56.900> we<00:05:57.050> wanted<00:05:57.470> which<00:05:58.039> made

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
much dump it where we wanted which made

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.230 
much dump it where we wanted which made
it<00:05:58.580> nice<00:05:58.789> and<00:05:59.090> then<00:05:59.810> here's<00:06:00.050> that<00:06:00.260> finished

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
it nice and then here's that finished

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.430 
it nice and then here's that finished
version<00:06:02.240> that<00:06:02.419> day<00:06:02.690> you<00:06:02.750> can<00:06:02.990> see<00:06:03.229> we're

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
version that day you can see we're

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.320 
version that day you can see we're
trawling<00:06:04.159> there<00:06:04.520> in<00:06:04.639> the<00:06:04.760> background<00:06:04.940> a

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
trawling there in the background a

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.240 
trawling there in the background a
little<00:06:05.360> bit<00:06:05.570> again<00:06:05.960> I'll<00:06:06.110> skip<00:06:06.440> you<00:06:06.590> the<00:06:06.740> four

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
little bit again I'll skip you the four

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.370 
little bit again I'll skip you the four
hours<00:06:07.580> of<00:06:07.779> trawling<00:06:08.779> it<00:06:09.050> between<00:06:09.229> the

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
hours of trawling it between the

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.239 
hours of trawling it between the
different<00:06:09.710> blades<00:06:10.639> we<00:06:10.849> had<00:06:11.029> on<00:06:11.210> it

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:12.249 
different blades we had on it

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:14.699 
different blades we had on it
but<00:06:12.609> here<00:06:13.149> it<00:06:13.239> is<00:06:13.329> looks<00:06:13.659> good<00:06:13.929> then<00:06:14.229> the<00:06:14.349> next

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:14.709 
but here it is looks good then the next

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:17.939 
but here it is looks good then the next
day<00:06:14.769> we<00:06:15.549> had<00:06:15.699> to<00:06:15.789> cut<00:06:15.969> lines<00:06:16.299> in<00:06:16.659> it<00:06:16.859> and<00:06:17.859> I

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
day we had to cut lines in it and I

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:18.959 
day we had to cut lines in it and I
thought<00:06:18.159> that<00:06:18.369> was<00:06:18.489> going<00:06:18.669> to<00:06:18.729> be<00:06:18.819> more

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:18.969 
thought that was going to be more

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:21.059 
thought that was going to be more
challenging<00:06:19.029> but<00:06:19.809> we<00:06:20.169> snapped<00:06:20.559> down<00:06:20.769> some

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
challenging but we snapped down some

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:24.059 
challenging but we snapped down some
tape<00:06:21.279> lines<00:06:21.609> and<00:06:21.939> we<00:06:22.029> chose<00:06:22.299> to<00:06:22.539> do<00:06:22.689> it<00:06:23.069> about

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
tape lines and we chose to do it about

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.159 
tape lines and we chose to do it about
every<00:06:24.689> four<00:06:25.689> feet<00:06:25.799> but<00:06:26.799> eight<00:06:27.039> feet<00:06:27.399> long<00:06:27.699> so

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
every four feet but eight feet long so

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.649 
every four feet but eight feet long so
squares<00:06:29.169> are<00:06:29.349> kind<00:06:29.529> of<00:06:29.589> four<00:06:29.859> by<00:06:30.039> eight<00:06:30.659> this

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:31.659 
squares are kind of four by eight this

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:33.569 
squares are kind of four by eight this
machine<00:06:32.349> was<00:06:32.499> really<00:06:32.679> quite<00:06:32.889> nice<00:06:33.069> it<00:06:33.339> cut

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:33.579 
machine was really quite nice it cut

00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:36.329 
machine was really quite nice it cut
about<00:06:33.759> a<00:06:33.819> two<00:06:34.449> inch<00:06:34.479> cut<00:06:35.279> considering<00:06:36.279> the

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:36.339 
about a two inch cut considering the

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:38.279 
about a two inch cut considering the
concrete<00:06:36.849> is<00:06:36.999> probably<00:06:37.719> at<00:06:37.839> its<00:06:37.869> thinnest

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
concrete is probably at its thinnest

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:41.789 
concrete is probably at its thinnest
point<00:06:38.559> about<00:06:38.829> four<00:06:39.549> inches<00:06:40.589> should<00:06:41.589> work

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:41.799 
point about four inches should work

00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:44.339 
point about four inches should work
pretty<00:06:42.069> good<00:06:42.189> a<00:06:42.579> little<00:06:42.789> bit<00:06:42.909> noisy<00:06:43.479> but<00:06:44.079> still

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:44.349 
pretty good a little bit noisy but still

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:46.259 
pretty good a little bit noisy but still
a<00:06:44.379> very<00:06:44.619> good<00:06:44.769> tool<00:06:45.369> to<00:06:45.399> work<00:06:45.610> with<00:06:45.759> and<00:06:46.209> a

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:46.269 
a very good tool to work with and a

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:49.319 
a very good tool to work with and a
really<00:06:46.929> good<00:06:47.079> straight<00:06:47.589> lines<00:06:47.829> but<00:06:48.129> this<00:06:49.119> is

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:49.329 
really good straight lines but this is

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:51.539 
really good straight lines but this is
one<00:06:49.479> of<00:06:49.569> these<00:06:49.629> projects<00:06:50.289> that<00:06:50.429> took<00:06:51.429> us

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:51.549 
one of these projects that took us

00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:52.319 
one of these projects that took us
months<00:06:51.729> to<00:06:51.909> do

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:52.329 
months to do

of filling this barn up as you can see

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:06.539 
of filling this barn up as you can see
it<00:07:04.749> turned<00:07:04.989> out<00:07:05.169> great<00:07:05.409> it<00:07:05.769> looks<00:07:06.009> good
