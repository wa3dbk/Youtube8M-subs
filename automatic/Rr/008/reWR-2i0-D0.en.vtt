actually the particular foot that was in

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.849 
actually the particular foot that was in
this<00:00:26.519> radiator<00:00:26.970> ahead<00:00:27.359> at<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.990> my<00:00:28.170> shop<00:00:28.500> here

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
this radiator ahead at in my shop here

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.220 
this radiator ahead at in my shop here
it<00:00:29.580> wasn't<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.269> from<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.539> old<00:00:30.779> valve<00:00:31.050> I

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
it wasn't the one from that old valve I

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.459 
it wasn't the one from that old valve I
showed<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:31.920> again<00:00:32.790> we're<00:00:32.940> gonna<00:00:33.000> use<00:00:33.120> our

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
showed you but again we're gonna use our

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.880 
showed you but again we're gonna use our
imagination<00:00:35.510> what<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.690> now<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.739> this

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
imagination what I do now is that this

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.220 
imagination what I do now is that this
is<00:00:37.950> not<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.460> screw<00:00:38.730> out<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.809> even

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
is not going to screw out you can even

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.880 
is not going to screw out you can even
with<00:00:40.410> use<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.340> spud<00:00:42.030> wrench<00:00:42.590> it's<00:00:43.590> not

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
with use of this spud wrench it's not

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.350 
with use of this spud wrench it's not
going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> screw<00:00:44.309> at<00:00:44.489> because<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.000> has<00:00:45.149> been

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
going to screw at because this has been

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.720 
going to screw at because this has been
welded<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.129> put<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> wrench<00:00:47.550> on

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
welded in and you can put a wrench on

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.850 
welded in and you can put a wrench on
here<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.149> nothing's<00:00:48.420> gonna<00:00:48.539> happen<00:00:48.750> trust<00:00:49.200> me

collapse and sometimes it'll stay

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.849 
collapse and sometimes it'll stay
together<00:03:01.269> in<00:03:01.659> this<00:03:01.810> case<00:03:02.049> it<00:03:02.230> actually<00:03:02.590> broke

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
together in this case it actually broke

protrusions and if you can see these

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.550 
protrusions and if you can see these
little<00:03:33.609> two<00:03:33.790> little<00:03:34.030> love<00:03:34.299> nibs<00:03:35.049> here<00:03:35.199> if<00:03:35.440> you

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
little two little love nibs here if you

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.229 
little two little love nibs here if you
will

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
will

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.759 
will
that<00:03:37.239> allows<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.659> spud<00:03:37.930> wrench<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.290> grab<00:03:38.560> on

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
that allows the spud wrench to grab on

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:45.270 
that allows the spud wrench to grab on
to<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.370> spud<00:03:39.729> here<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:42.629> what<00:03:43.629> happens<00:03:44.049> is<00:03:44.280> it

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
to the spud here and what happens is it

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.909 
to the spud here and what happens is it
allows<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.329> turn<00:03:46.510> so<00:03:47.079> that'll<00:03:47.440> just<00:03:47.620> turn

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
allows that to turn so that'll just turn

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.589 
allows that to turn so that'll just turn
and<00:03:48.280> screw<00:03:48.579> right<00:03:48.669> into<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:48.970> radiator<00:03:49.329> valve

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
and screw right into the radiator valve

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.809 
and screw right into the radiator valve
so<00:03:50.590> we're<00:03:50.769> going<00:03:50.859> to<00:03:50.949> screw<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.340> in<00:03:51.549> we're

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
so we're going to screw that in we're

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.189 
so we're going to screw that in we're
going<00:03:51.909> to<00:03:51.970> Snug<00:03:52.239> that<00:03:52.299> up<00:03:52.569> with<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.720> 14-inch

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
going to Snug that up with a 14-inch

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.619 
going to Snug that up with a 14-inch
wrench<00:03:53.650> here<00:03:54.040> once<00:03:54.760> we<00:03:54.909> get<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.239> good<00:03:55.449> and

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
wrench here once we get that good and
