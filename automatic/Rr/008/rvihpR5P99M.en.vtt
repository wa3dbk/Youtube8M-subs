there we are a few hours later that cat
I<00:00:05.899> put<00:00:06.899> maybe<00:00:08.030> seven<00:00:09.030> or<00:00:09.150> eight<00:00:09.210> bags<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.809> this

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
I put maybe seven or eight bags of this

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.430 
I put maybe seven or eight bags of this
recycled<00:00:12.870> material<00:00:14.599> that's<00:00:15.599> insulation<00:00:16.199> I

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
recycled material that's insulation I

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.439 
recycled material that's insulation I
know<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.430> most<00:00:17.550> perfect<00:00:17.850> way<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.210> do

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
know it's not the most perfect way to do

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.650 
know it's not the most perfect way to do
it<00:00:18.600> but<00:00:19.199> I've<00:00:19.320> used<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.740> really<00:00:20.520> heavy<00:00:20.850> mill

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
it but I've used a really heavy mill

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.679 
it but I've used a really heavy mill
plastic<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.609> should<00:00:23.850> put<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.060> plastic<00:00:24.449> sheet

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
plastic and I should put a plastic sheet

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.089 
plastic and I should put a plastic sheet
over<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.109> top<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.529> I'm<00:00:25.650> not<00:00:25.769> going<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.980> do<00:00:26.070> it

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
over the top and I'm not going to do it

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.460 
over the top and I'm not going to do it
because<00:00:27.000> if<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.510> I'm<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:27.750> gonna<00:00:27.869> my

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
because if I do that I'm just gonna my

plywood is just going to tear it up
but<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.399> insulation<00:00:32.399> comes<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.759> bricks<00:00:33.000> like

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
but the insulation comes in bricks like

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.310 
but the insulation comes in bricks like

and<00:00:59.850> what<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.420> will<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.870> winter

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and what this will do in the winter

and what this will do in the winter
you'd<00:01:01.770> be<00:01:01.980> surprised<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:02.820> much<00:01:02.969> cold<00:01:03.270> air

you'd be surprised at how much cold air

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.200 
you'd be surprised at how much cold air
comes<00:01:04.710> up<00:01:04.920> from<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> ground<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.090> an

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
comes up from the ground if you have an

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.990 
comes up from the ground if you have an
outside<00:01:06.450> building<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.490> if<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.610> insulate

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
outside building and if you insulate

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.760 
outside building and if you insulate
your<00:01:09.740> floorboards<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.159> really<00:01:15.740> have<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770

take<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.910> shed<00:02:32.180> with<00:02:32.360> me<00:02:32.510> but<00:02:33.670> if<00:02:34.670> we<00:02:34.910> happen<00:02:35.120> to

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
take a shed with me but if we happen to

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.819 
take a shed with me but if we happen to
need<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.660> tear<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:35.930> down<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.290> move<00:02:36.380> everything

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
need to tear it down and move everything

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.280 
need to tear it down and move everything
everything<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.459> bolted<00:02:37.790> into<00:02:37.970> where<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.510> can

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
everything is bolted into where that can

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.020 
everything is bolted into where that can
be<00:02:39.320> done<00:02:39.410> just<00:02:39.680> like<00:02:39.860> that<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.730> now<00:02:43.760> I'll

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
be done just like that so now I'll

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.770 
be done just like that so now I'll
finish<00:02:44.209> filling<00:02:45.019> in<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.290> pockets<00:02:45.680> with<00:02:46.780> the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
finish filling in the pockets with the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.900 
finish filling in the pockets with the
insulation<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.680> then<00:02:49.010> I'll<00:02:49.190> start<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.549> put

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
insulation and then I'll start to put

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.890 
insulation and then I'll start to put
the<00:02:50.060> four<00:02:50.299> by<00:02:50.450> eight<00:02:50.480> sheets<00:02:50.870> on<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:52.660> got<00:02:53.660> five

of<00:02:53.930> them<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.320> I<00:02:54.380> hope<00:02:54.530> that'll<00:02:54.920> that'll<00:02:55.220> work

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
of them and I hope that'll that'll work

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.860 
of them and I hope that'll that'll work

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
in America right now and right right at

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.110 
in America right now and right right at
this<00:03:00.110> time<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.680> building<00:03:01.519> materials<00:03:01.970> are

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
this time a building materials are

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.509 
this time a building materials are
extremely<00:03:02.930> expensive<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.530> don't<00:03:03.590> know<00:03:04.070> why<00:03:04.250> I'm

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
extremely expensive I don't know why I'm

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.660 
extremely expensive I don't know why I'm
not<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:05.590> construction<00:03:06.590> or<00:03:06.620> not<00:03:06.739> expert<00:03:07.489> but<00:03:07.640> I

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
not a construction or not expert but I

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.160 
not a construction or not expert but I
guess<00:03:07.850> everything<00:03:08.269> is<00:03:08.329> really<00:03:08.540> expensive<00:03:08.660> now

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
guess everything is really expensive now

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.690 
guess everything is really expensive now
