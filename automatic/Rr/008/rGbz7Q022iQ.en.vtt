simple oracle card deck by sonia
Choquette<00:00:42.580> now<00:00:43.180> I<00:00:43.210> thought<00:00:43.570> what<00:00:43.750> we<00:00:43.900> would<00:00:43.930> do

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
Choquette now I thought what we would do

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.130 
Choquette now I thought what we would do
is<00:00:44.580> I'm<00:00:45.580> going<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:45.790> give<00:00:45.940> you<00:00:46.180> three<00:00:46.540> cards

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
from that deck and then I thought we

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.110 
from that deck and then I thought we
would<00:00:50.199> go<00:00:51.129> on<00:00:51.280> ahead<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.549> get<00:00:51.729> three

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
would go on ahead and get three

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.990 
would go on ahead and get three
additional<00:00:52.690> short<00:00:53.049> messages<00:00:53.710> from<00:00:54.549> three
