00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
obviously the acceleration is pretty

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.649 
obviously the acceleration is pretty
much<00:01:14.389> non-existent<00:01:14.450> being<00:01:15.380> slow<00:01:15.679> as<00:01:15.859> all<00:01:15.979> hell

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
overall speeds are fairly average once

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.709 
overall speeds are fairly average once
you<00:01:20.329> get<00:01:20.479> it<00:01:20.569> going<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.079> the<00:01:21.709> handling<00:01:22.039> ah<00:01:22.719> the

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
handlings crap the end the fact is one

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.389 
handlings crap the end the fact is one
of<00:01:26.749> the<00:01:26.869> longest<00:01:27.200> vehicles<00:01:28.039> in<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.189> game

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:29.919 
of the longest vehicles in the game
doesn't<00:01:28.729> really<00:01:28.999> help<00:01:29.240> much<00:01:29.359> either<00:01:29.420> but

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
doesn't really help much either but

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.249 
doesn't really help much either but
despite<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:31.039> coaches<00:01:31.490> poor<00:01:31.789> stats<00:01:32.209> I<00:01:32.569> find

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
despite the coaches poor stats I find

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.429 
despite the coaches poor stats I find
it's<00:01:33.439> good<00:01:33.679> for<00:01:33.979> one<00:01:34.340> thing<00:01:35.439> mindless

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
it's good for one thing mindless

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.550 
it's good for one thing mindless
rampages<00:01:37.340> now<00:01:38.060> I<00:01:38.119> know<00:01:38.240> it's<00:01:38.659> very<00:01:38.810> slow<00:01:39.229> and

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
rampages now I know it's very slow and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.669 
rampages now I know it's very slow and
it<00:01:39.859> can<00:01:40.039> handle<00:01:40.279> very<00:01:40.639> good<00:01:40.880> but<00:01:41.749> once<00:01:42.560> this

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
it can handle very good but once this

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.800 
it can handle very good but once this
vehicle<00:01:43.099> gets<00:01:43.340> going<00:01:43.729> it's<00:01:43.939> very<00:01:44.479> hard<00:01:44.749> to

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
vehicle gets going it's very hard to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.929 
vehicle gets going it's very hard to
stop<00:01:45.139> and<00:01:45.409> most<00:01:45.889> other<00:01:46.130> cars<00:01:46.459> i'm<00:01:46.669> just<00:01:46.819> going

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
stop and most other cars i'm just going

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.940 
stop and most other cars i'm just going
to<00:01:46.969> bounce<00:01:47.270> right<00:01:47.539> off<00:01:47.599> of<00:01:47.779> it<00:01:48.049> which<00:01:48.679> just

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
to bounce right off of it which just

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.629 
to bounce right off of it which just
makes<00:01:49.099> it<00:01:49.219> a<00:01:49.340> real<00:01:49.549> fun<00:01:49.819> vehicle<00:01:50.209> to<00:01:50.329> drive<00:01:51.639> now

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:52.639 
makes it a real fun vehicle to drive now

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:54.010 
makes it a real fun vehicle to drive now
i<00:01:52.669> guess<00:01:52.909> i<00:01:53.029> should<00:01:53.209> also<00:01:53.389> mention<00:01:53.599> that

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
i guess i should also mention that

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.080 
i guess i should also mention that
whenever<00:01:54.319> you<00:01:54.529> stop<00:01:54.770> by<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:54.979> bus<00:01:55.310> stop<00:01:55.579> you're

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
whenever you stop by a bus stop you're

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.449 
whenever you stop by a bus stop you're
going<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.329> be<00:01:56.419> able<00:01:56.509> to<00:01:56.689> pick<00:01:56.840> up<00:01:56.869> passengers

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
going to be able to pick up passengers

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.620 
going to be able to pick up passengers
however<00:01:58.459> you're<00:01:58.759> only<00:01:58.849> going<00:01:58.999> to<00:01:59.090> get<00:01:59.149> about<00:01:59.329> 5

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
however you're only going to get about 5
