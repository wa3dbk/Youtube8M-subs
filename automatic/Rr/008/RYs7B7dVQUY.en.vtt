00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
that's exactly the argument that white

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.039

that<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:21.200> Rudy<00:04:21.470> Giuliani<00:04:21.919> even<00:04:22.370> though<00:04:22.460> the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
that to Rudy Giuliani even though the

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.630 
that to Rudy Giuliani even though the
statistics<00:04:23.060> for<00:04:23.180> white<00:04:23.300> people<00:04:23.570> are<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.690> same

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
statistics for white people are the same

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.680 
statistics for white people are the same
see<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.760> double<00:04:25.880> standard<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.480> we<00:04:26.540> got

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
see the double standard that we got

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.020 
see the double standard that we got
going<00:04:26.840> on<00:04:27.080> here<00:04:27.140> but<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.010> underlying<00:04:28.580> premise

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
going on here but the underlying premise

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.730 
going on here but the underlying premise
of<00:04:29.420> the<00:04:29.720> people<00:04:30.050> who<00:04:30.170> make<00:04:30.380> that<00:04:30.560> argument

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
of the people who make that argument

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.570 
of the people who make that argument
that<00:04:31.130> Rudy<00:04:31.400> made<00:04:31.610> is<00:04:32.890> come<00:04:33.890> on<00:04:33.920> you<00:04:34.220> know<00:04:34.400> how

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
that Rudy made is come on you know how

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.550 
that Rudy made is come on you know how
they<00:04:34.760> are<00:04:34.790> we<00:04:35.270> know<00:04:35.480> black<00:04:35.810> people<00:04:35.840> are<00:04:36.350> worse

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
they are we know black people are worse

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.760 
they are we know black people are worse
we<00:04:36.830> know<00:04:37.040> black<00:04:37.310> people<00:04:37.700> are<00:04:37.790> more<00:04:38.000> violent

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
we know black people are more violent

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.580 
we know black people are more violent
now<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:42.650> reason<00:04:43.070> for<00:04:43.100> those<00:04:43.460> numbers<00:04:43.880> is<00:04:44.030> that

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
now the reason for those numbers is that

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.370 
now the reason for those numbers is that
black<00:04:45.590> people<00:04:46.150> mostly<00:04:47.150> live<00:04:47.480> around<00:04:48.110> other

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
black people and white people mostly

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.700 
black people and white people mostly
live<00:04:52.010> around<00:04:52.520> other<00:04:52.790> white<00:04:53.270> people<00:04:53.350> so<00:04:54.350> of

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
live around other white people so of

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.850 
live around other white people so of
course<00:04:55.250> you're<00:04:55.670> gonna<00:04:55.850> have<00:04:56.320> 90<00:04:57.320> some<00:04:57.830> odd

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
course you're gonna have 90 some odd

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.650

percent of black people being victims of

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.270 
percent of black people being victims of
crimes<00:05:02.960> from<00:05:03.169> other<00:05:03.380> black<00:05:03.650> people<00:05:03.980> of<00:05:04.040> course

crimes from other black people of course

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.409 
crimes from other black people of course
you're<00:05:04.400> gonna<00:05:04.490> have<00:05:04.580> about<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.180> same<00:05:05.360> number

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
you're gonna have about the same number

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
thing

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.170 
thing
these<00:05:18.080> aren't<00:05:18.290> these<00:05:18.650> things<00:05:18.710> aren't

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
these aren't these things aren't

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.970 
these aren't these things aren't
discussed<00:05:20.180> in<00:05:20.390> context<00:05:21.050> and<00:05:21.140> in<00:05:21.260> perspective

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
discussed in context and in perspective

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.520 
discussed in context and in perspective
now<00:05:22.490> here's<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.060> real<00:05:23.270> reason<00:05:23.300> why<00:05:23.960> blacks

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
now here's the real reason why blacks

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.280 
now here's the real reason why blacks
are<00:05:25.030> disproportionately<00:05:26.030> in<00:05:26.330> jail<00:05:26.750> because

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
are disproportionately in jail because

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.840 
are disproportionately in jail because
that's<00:05:27.590> the<00:05:27.710> argument<00:05:28.220> that<00:05:28.280> that's<00:05:28.700> the

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
that's the argument that that's the

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.310 
that's the argument that that's the
other<00:05:28.970> argument<00:05:29.450> they<00:05:29.540> make<00:05:29.690> just<00:05:29.960> hey<00:05:30.080> look

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
other argument they make just hey look

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.570 
other argument they make just hey look
at<00:05:30.380> the<00:05:30.440> numbers<00:05:30.740> black<00:05:31.010> but<00:05:31.190> there's<00:05:31.340> more

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
at the numbers black but there's more

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.370 
at the numbers black but there's more
black<00:05:31.820> people<00:05:32.000> in<00:05:32.270> jail<00:05:32.450> as<00:05:32.600> a<00:05:32.630> percentage<00:05:33.110> so

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
black people in jail as a percentage so

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.719 
black people in jail as a percentage so
clearly<00:05:34.040> there's<00:05:34.190> a<00:05:34.280> problem<00:05:34.490> in<00:05:34.700> that

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
clearly there's a problem in that

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.469 
clearly there's a problem in that
community<00:05:35.770> but<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:37.010> reason<00:05:37.430> why<00:05:37.610> they<00:05:37.820> are<00:05:38.090> is

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
community but the reason why they are is

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.350 
community but the reason why they are is
because<00:05:38.840> of<00:05:39.020> the<00:05:39.380> drug<00:05:39.710> war<00:05:40.010> that<00:05:40.940> white

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
because of the drug war that white

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.330 
because of the drug war that white
people<00:05:41.540> and<00:05:41.720> black<00:05:41.870> people<00:05:41.930> use<00:05:42.530> drugs<00:05:42.770> at

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
people and black people use drugs at
