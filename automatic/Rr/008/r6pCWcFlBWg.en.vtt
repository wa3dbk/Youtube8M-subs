00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
are taken in combination at the same

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.229 
are taken in combination at the same
time<00:00:58.739> or<00:00:59.579> stack<00:01:00.329> together<00:01:00.510> hence<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.289> name

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
time or stack together hence the name

time or stack together hence the name
and<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.680> dosing<00:01:04.680> nor<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> concentration<00:01:05.670> is

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and the dosing nor the concentration is

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.310 
and the dosing nor the concentration is

the best from it but i'll talk more
about<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.080> later<00:01:10.790> about<00:01:11.790> showing<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.360> how

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
about that later about showing out how

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.840 
about that later about showing out how
actually<00:01:12.810> works

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.600 

okay<00:01:17.689> firstly<00:01:18.250> this<00:01:19.250> product<00:01:19.729> burns<00:01:20.450> away<00:01:20.600> fat

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
okay firstly this product burns away fat

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.399 
okay firstly this product burns away fat
taking<00:01:22.610> effigy<00:01:22.970> kneecap<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:23.479> caffeine<00:01:24.320> in

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
taking effigy kneecap and caffeine in

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.649 
taking effigy kneecap and caffeine in
combination<00:01:25.009> causes<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.119> body<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.360> release<00:01:26.600> a

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
combination causes the body to release a

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.830 
combination causes the body to release a
chemical<00:01:26.869> called<00:01:27.640> noradrenaline<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.840> this

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
chemical called noradrenaline and this

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.789 
chemical called noradrenaline and this
triggers<00:01:30.290> a<00:01:30.320> process<00:01:30.799> called<00:01:31.399> thermogenesis

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
triggers a process called thermogenesis

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.969 
triggers a process called thermogenesis
and<00:01:33.799> thermogenesis<00:01:34.399> is<00:01:34.700> when<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:34.970> body<00:01:35.180> burns

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
and thermogenesis is when the body burns

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.740 
and thermogenesis is when the body burns
stored<00:01:36.979> fat<00:01:37.369> in<00:01:37.549> order<00:01:37.789> to<00:01:37.909> raise<00:01:38.060> its<00:01:38.299> core

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
stored fat in order to raise its core

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.740 
stored fat in order to raise its core
temperature<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:40.850> normally<00:01:41.240> happens<00:01:41.539> when

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
temperature this normally happens when

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.340 
temperature this normally happens when
you<00:01:41.869> you're<00:01:42.860> exposed<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.580> cold<00:01:44.200> but<00:01:45.200> this

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
you you're exposed to the cold but this

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.889 
you you're exposed to the cold but this
generation<00:01:46.070> of<00:01:46.220> heat<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:46.970> uses<00:01:47.420> up<00:01:47.539> a<00:01:47.659> lot<00:01:47.690> of

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
generation of heat it uses up a lot of

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.350 
generation of heat it uses up a lot of
energy<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.590> body<00:01:49.100> uses<00:01:49.520> stored<00:01:49.880> fat<00:01:50.149> to

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
energy and the body uses stored fat to

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.649 
energy and the body uses stored fat to
do<00:01:50.479> this<00:01:54.009> okay<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:56.030> nar<00:01:56.179> adrenaline

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
do this okay the the nar adrenaline

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.809 
do this okay the the nar adrenaline
release<00:01:56.810> it's<00:01:57.590> also<00:01:57.800> gonna<00:01:58.220> kill<00:01:58.670> your

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
release it's also gonna kill your

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.210 
release it's also gonna kill your
appetite<00:01:59.710> basically<00:02:00.710> you're<00:02:00.830> not<00:02:00.950> going<00:02:01.159> to

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
appetite basically you're not going to

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.249 
appetite basically you're not going to
feel<00:02:01.550> like<00:02:01.729> eating<00:02:02.119> when<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.300> take<00:02:03.020> in<00:02:03.170> the

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
feel like eating when you take in the

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.440 
feel like eating when you take in the
stack<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:04.520> you're<00:02:04.640> going<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.789> consume<00:02:05.210> less

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
stack so you're going to consume less

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.880 
stack so you're going to consume less
food<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:06.020> obviously<00:02:06.259> they're<00:02:06.649> far<00:02:06.860> less

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
food and obviously they're far less

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.850 
food and obviously they're far less
calories<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.869> appetite<00:02:09.229> suppression<00:02:09.590> is

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
calories and the appetite suppression is

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.920 
calories and the appetite suppression is
a<00:02:09.890> very<00:02:10.429> important<00:02:10.880> factor<00:02:11.299> in<00:02:11.420> how<00:02:11.630> does<00:02:11.810> that

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
a very important factor in how does that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.800 
a very important factor in how does that
works<00:02:14.890> okay<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.100> FG<00:02:16.580> need<00:02:16.700> caffeine<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:17.390> also

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
works okay the FG need caffeine is also

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.620 
works okay the FG need caffeine is also
going<00:02:18.019> to<00:02:18.140> boost<00:02:18.319> your<00:02:18.470> energy<00:02:18.590> levels<00:02:19.130> and
