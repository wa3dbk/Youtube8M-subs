00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.180 
the easiest way is using a spoon and
just<00:01:58.010> scoop<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.850> out<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.510> voila<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:01.070> we're

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
just scoop it out and voila so we're

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.730 
just scoop it out and voila so we're
gonna<00:02:01.310> use<00:02:01.490> one<00:02:01.850> half<00:02:02.119> of<00:02:02.270> that<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:03.200> then<00:02:03.470> what

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
gonna use one half of that and then what

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.389 
gonna use one half of that and then what
I<00:02:03.920> like<00:02:04.190> to<00:02:04.460> do<00:02:04.640> for<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:06.259> limes<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.830> lemons<00:02:06.890> is

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
I like to do for the limes and lemons is

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.729 
I like to do for the limes and lemons is
actually<00:02:08.119> use<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.330> juicer<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:09.050> could<00:02:09.350> do<00:02:09.590> it

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
actually use a juicer you could do it

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.530 
actually use a juicer you could do it
like<00:02:09.890> that<00:02:10.130> if<00:02:10.520> you're<00:02:10.940> using<00:02:11.150> an<00:02:11.390> actual

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
like that if you're using an actual

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.810 
like that if you're using an actual
juice<00:02:12.140> machine<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.860> could<00:02:13.130> just<00:02:13.340> throw<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.670> in

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
juice machine you could just throw it in

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.470 
juice machine you could just throw it in
but<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.209> I<00:02:14.450> find<00:02:14.750> just<00:02:15.680> works<00:02:15.950> pretty<00:02:16.220> well

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
but this I find just works pretty well

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.310 
but this I find just works pretty well
so<00:02:17.480> I'm<00:02:17.540> gonna<00:02:17.690> do<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> full<00:02:18.530> lime<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:21.110> that's

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
so I'm gonna do a full lime and that's

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.750 
so I'm gonna do a full lime and that's
going<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.530> give<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.860> bit<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.100> zing<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.580> also

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
going to give it a bit of zing it also

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.030 
going to give it a bit of zing it also
adds<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.150> lot<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.510> vitamin<00:02:24.050> C<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.560> if<00:02:24.890> you're

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
adds a lot of vitamin C so if you're

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.620 
adds a lot of vitamin C so if you're
feeling<00:02:25.220> under<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.730> weather<00:02:25.850> this<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.600> a

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
feeling under the weather this is a

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.310
