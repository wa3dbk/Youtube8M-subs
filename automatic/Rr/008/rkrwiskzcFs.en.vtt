into<00:00:41.010> knees<00:00:41.309> into<00:00:41.640> cakes<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.120> that's

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
into knees into cakes and that's

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.270 
into knees into cakes and that's
important<00:00:42.930> too<00:00:43.019> because<00:00:43.170> as<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.010> training

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
important too because as your training

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.170 
important too because as your training
the<00:00:44.370> box<00:00:44.549> once<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.850> become<00:00:45.030> comfortable

the box once you become comfortable

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.149 
the box once you become comfortable
putting<00:00:45.570> together<00:00:45.750> combinations<00:00:46.409> you<00:00:46.559> want

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
putting together combinations you want

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.100 
putting together combinations you want
to<00:00:47.220> work<00:00:47.400> your<00:00:48.150> knees<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.629> your<00:00:48.720> kicks<00:00:48.960> into

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
to work your knees and your kicks into

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.930 
to work your knees and your kicks into
that<00:00:49.320> off<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.769> those<00:00:49.979> boxing<00:00:50.369> combinations

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that off of those boxing combinations

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.850 
that off of those boxing combinations
because<00:00:51.659> that's<00:00:51.869> often<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.229> key<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.650> landing

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
because that's often the key to landing

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.890 
because that's often the key to landing
them<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.760> needs<00:00:53.970> of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.119> cakes<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.540> is<00:00:54.690> so

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
23 I find them in position now close the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.410 
23 I find them in position now close the
full<00:02:45.120> name<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:46.080> then<00:02:46.530> I'm<00:02:46.680> good<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.950> go<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.420> the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
full name and then I'm good to go so the

full name and then I'm good to go so the
idea<00:02:48.540> here<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.990> that<00:02:49.110> you're<00:02:49.350> not<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:49.590> doing

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
idea here is that you're not just doing

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.460 
idea here is that you're not just doing
a<00:02:50.070> tight<00:02:50.310> shallow<00:02:50.970> leave<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.960> 3-2<00:02:52.260> or

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
a tight shallow leave it to a 3-2 or

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.310 
a tight shallow leave it to a 3-2 or
tight<00:02:53.070> shallow<00:02:53.340> leave<00:02:53.550> in<00:02:53.640> two<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.910> three<00:02:54.320> but

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
tight shallow leave in two to three but

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.380 
tight shallow leave in two to three but
you're<00:02:55.440> also<00:02:55.560> seeing<00:02:56.010> where<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.790> can<00:02:57.000> connect

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
you're also seeing where you can connect

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.630 
you're also seeing where you can connect
that<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.840> three<00:02:58.290> into<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> knee<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.370> connect

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
that to three into a knee and connect

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:09.330 
that to three into a knee and connect
that<00:02:59.790> 32<00:03:00.240> in<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.960> week<00:03:01.080> a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.400
