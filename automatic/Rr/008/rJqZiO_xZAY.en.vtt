00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
we were just paranoid the whole time and

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.110 
we were just paranoid the whole time and
we<00:04:41.629> just<00:04:41.840> like<00:04:41.960> left<00:04:42.289> and<00:04:42.710> to<00:04:43.340> finally<00:04:43.669> made<00:04:43.999> it

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
we just like left and to finally made it

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.850 
we just like left and to finally made it
home<00:04:44.240> we<00:04:44.539> didn't<00:04:44.900> like<00:04:45.199> do<00:04:45.319> anything<00:04:45.439> and<00:04:45.770> I

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
home we didn't like do anything and I

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.159 
home we didn't like do anything and I
just<00:04:46.039> got<00:04:46.189> home<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.729> that<00:04:47.330> I<00:04:47.569> just<00:04:47.779> like<00:04:47.930> SAT

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
just got home and that I just like SAT

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.869 
just got home and that I just like SAT
did<00:04:48.469> nothing<00:04:48.919> and<00:04:49.129> I<00:04:49.249> turned<00:04:49.520> my<00:04:49.639> phone<00:04:49.819> off

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:49.879 
did nothing and I turned my phone off

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.159 
did nothing and I turned my phone off
because<00:04:50.000> that's<00:04:50.389> the<00:04:50.509> only<00:04:50.539> way<00:04:50.689> to<00:04:50.840> turn<00:04:51.020> off

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
because that's the only way to turn off

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.809 
because that's the only way to turn off
the<00:04:51.289> tracker<00:04:51.560> so<00:04:51.860> he<00:04:51.949> couldn't<00:04:52.129> track<00:04:52.430> me<00:04:52.639> when

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
the tracker so he couldn't track me when

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.719 
the tracker so he couldn't track me when
