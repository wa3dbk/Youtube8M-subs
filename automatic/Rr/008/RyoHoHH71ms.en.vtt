00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.420

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.740
 they want to have fisherman 6 and some 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.200
 some players then 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.970

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.189
 update good here I bring you the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.800
 solution and good because I searched 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.320
 enough updates 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.300
 I did them, I did not do them because 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.829
 I found but besides that I was 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.460
 making a pack but since I found 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:38.910
 this I have no reason why 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.739
 do it but well this is the good ok 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.809
 question that everything on screen will see 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.260
 what are the updates 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.960
 clearly enough neymar want to see in 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.329
 Real Madrid, as you can tell 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.210
 quite a few players that have so far 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.579
 made transfers in 2014 in the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.909
 screen then I'll show you the transfers 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.460
 ok guys to install this pack 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:10.000
 first of all let's give it to be 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:13.040
 here but we will have this 7 that says 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.810
 hungry ok 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.979
 about the video the video 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.320
 and you can wait because she's not because 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.409
 we are waiting here for speed and 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.170
 good full of folders and download the link 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.850
 in the description of 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.620
 well let's criticize peta 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.490
 but it has left me 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.229
 and we will see what is this 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:45.020
 so to speak of there is nothing but that is 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:49.640
 informing clarifications of this pair 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.500
 there is also the vigo line is the 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.080
 bundesliga because if someone does not 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.800
 I had a detour 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.740

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.640

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:33.760
 I'm going to do it because if it 's because I do not 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.760
 I have nothing in my weight to eliminate it 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.280
 there is no problem with removing it and 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.800

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.890
 things there 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.650
