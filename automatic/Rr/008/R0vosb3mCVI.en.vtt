they do a baked on coating rather than a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.570 
they do a baked on coating rather than a
dip<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.270> similar<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:07.260> Parker<00:01:08.100> ice<00:01:08.220> finish

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
dip so similar to your Parker ice finish

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.640 
dip so similar to your Parker ice finish
on<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:08.850> rifle<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.080> thousandth<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.530> an

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
on your rifle it's a thousandth of an

on your rifle it's a thousandth of an
inch<00:01:10.740> baked<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.189> coating<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.700> actually

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
inch baked on coating that actually

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.820 
inch baked on coating that actually
improves<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> durability<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> bow<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
improves the durability of the bow and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.370 
improves the durability of the bow and
looks<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.580> lot<00:01:14.729> sharper<00:01:15.000> whatever<00:01:15.960> camel

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
looks a lot sharper whatever camel

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.469 
looks a lot sharper whatever camel
pattern<00:01:16.710> they<00:01:16.860> put<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.159> these<00:01:17.369> bows<00:01:17.640> it

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
pattern they put on these bows it

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.510 
pattern they put on these bows it
doesn't<00:01:18.810> look<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.140> skewed<00:01:19.710> version<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.400> it

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
doesn't look like a skewed version of it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.940 
doesn't look like a skewed version of it
it<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.299> pattern<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.930> think<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:22.710> part<00:01:22.890> of

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it is that pattern I think it's part of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.859 
it is that pattern I think it's part of
the<00:01:23.040> reason<00:01:23.189> Gore<00:01:23.880> allowed<00:01:24.210> off<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.570> fade<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the reason Gore allowed off the fade to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.359 
the reason Gore allowed off the fade to
be<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.110> these<00:01:25.290> bows<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.130> looks

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
be on these bows because it looks

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.520 
be on these bows because it looks
exactly<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.450> op<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> fade<00:01:28.080> should<00:01:28.320> look

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
exactly like op the fade should look

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.789 
exactly like op the fade should look
they<00:01:29.220> have<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> dual<00:01:29.810> binary<00:01:30.810> camp<00:01:31.140> system<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
they have a dual binary camp system and

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.260 
they have a dual binary camp system and
so<00:01:31.890> you're<00:01:32.070> shooting<00:01:32.369> an<00:01:32.460> arrow<00:01:32.579> from<00:01:32.820> perfect

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
so you're shooting an arrow from perfect

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.539 
so you're shooting an arrow from perfect
square<00:01:33.570> every<00:01:34.320> shot<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.710> take<00:01:34.920> physically

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
square every shot you take physically

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.690 
square every shot you take physically
the<00:01:35.700> bow<00:01:35.880> has<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.509> has<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.320> shoot<00:01:37.650> an<00:01:37.770> arrow<00:01:37.890> in

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the bow has to has to shoot an arrow in

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.539 
the bow has to has to shoot an arrow in
an<00:01:38.939> incredibly<00:01:39.420> square<00:01:39.780> manner<00:01:40.049> these<00:01:40.829> alloys

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
an incredibly square manner these alloys

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.069 
an incredibly square manner these alloys
also<00:01:41.880> they<00:01:42.060> changed<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.479> flex<00:01:42.720> guard<00:01:42.960> on

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
also they changed the flex guard on

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.510 
also they changed the flex guard on
these<00:01:43.229> alloys<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> little<00:01:43.890> bit<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.159> put<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
these alloys a little bit they put the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.130 
these alloys a little bit they put the
wheels<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.970> them<00:01:45.119> instead<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.420> ceramic<00:01:45.960> rings

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
wheels on them instead of ceramic rings

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.240 
wheels on them instead of ceramic rings
and<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:48.360> know<00:01:48.450> little<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.710> concept

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
and so you know little that concept

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.770 
and so you know little that concept
makes<00:01:50.399> more<00:01:50.610> sense<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.390> that's

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
makes more sense to you so that's

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.179 
makes more sense to you so that's
another<00:01:52.079> change<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.530> they<00:01:52.740> made<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.979> the
