and then right here I like to go on a
downward<00:02:02.970> motion<00:02:11.780> filled<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.959> part<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:14.240> and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
downward motion filled that part is and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.870 
downward motion filled that part is and
then<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.510> lightly<00:02:16.700> will<00:02:17.700> do<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:19.459> go<00:02:20.459> more<00:02:20.760> in

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
then I lightly will do that I go more in

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.350 
then I lightly will do that I go more in
a<00:02:20.970> straight<00:02:21.390> motion<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.910> then<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.150> usually

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
a straight motion and then I usually

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.180 
a straight motion and then I usually
fill<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.290> little<00:02:25.800> bit<00:02:26.100> right<00:02:26.370> above<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:26.850> and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.210 

then<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.459> basically<00:02:32.730> finish<00:02:33.330> with<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.600> light<00:02:34.220> bit

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
then I basically finish with a light bit

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.960 
then I basically finish with a light bit
of<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.489> powder<00:02:35.730> where<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.540> put<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.050> gel<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.970> feel

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
of the powder where I put the gel I feel

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.130 
of the powder where I put the gel I feel
like<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.209> holds<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.690> in<00:02:39.810> place<00:02:41.690> so<00:02:42.690> after<00:02:42.840> that

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
like it holds it in place so after that

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.990 
like it holds it in place so after that
if<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.709> one<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.890> these<00:02:44.070> um<00:02:44.340> eyebrow

just side by side and then again with

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.020 
just side by side and then again with
this<00:03:33.450> side<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:34.440> can<00:03:34.739> use<00:03:34.920> an<00:03:35.070> eyebrow<00:03:35.430> gel<00:03:35.459> at

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
this side you can use an eyebrow gel at

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.420 
this side you can use an eyebrow gel at
the<00:03:36.269> end<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.630> hold<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.680> other<00:03:37.860> side<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.310> we

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
the end to hold the other side that we

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.170 
the end to hold the other side that we
just<00:03:38.640> finished<00:03:42.560> but<00:03:43.560> for<00:03:43.799> me<00:03:43.950> my<00:03:44.790> eyebrows

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
just finished but for me my eyebrows

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.140 
just finished but for me my eyebrows
usually<00:03:45.690> stay<00:03:45.959> in<00:03:46.049> place<00:03:46.260> pretty<00:03:46.739> well

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.050 

like<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.049> said<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.709> upward<00:03:53.159> motion<00:03:53.579> filling

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
like I said that upward motion filling

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.110 
like I said that upward motion filling
in<00:03:54.829> where<00:03:55.829> my<00:03:55.980> eyebrows<00:03:56.340> tend<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.730> be<00:03:56.849> the<00:03:56.970> most

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
in where my eyebrows tend to be the most

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.080 
in where my eyebrows tend to be the most
farce<00:03:57.510> which<00:03:58.110> is<00:03:58.260> right<00:03:58.409> there<00:03:58.909> turn<00:03:59.909> it

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
farce which is right there turn it

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:13.880 
farce which is right there turn it
slanted<00:04:01.250> slightly<00:04:02.250> filled<00:04:02.549> in<00:04:02.760> right<00:04:03.560> here<00:04:12.890> at

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
slanted slightly filled in right here at

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.740 
slanted slightly filled in right here at
the<00:04:14.099> very<00:04:14.340> end<00:04:16.280> this<00:04:17.280> eyebrow<00:04:17.549> isn't<00:04:18.180> as<00:04:18.359> nice

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
the very end this eyebrow isn't as nice

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.469 
the very end this eyebrow isn't as nice
as<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.049> other<00:04:19.229> one<00:04:19.440> either<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:21.150> hair<00:04:21.329> is<00:04:21.449> a

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
as the other one either the hair is a

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.159 
as the other one either the hair is a
little<00:04:21.630> bit<00:04:21.870> more<00:04:22.019> messy<00:04:22.220> so<00:04:23.930> after<00:04:24.930> i<00:04:24.960> placed

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
little bit more messy so after i placed

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.590 
little bit more messy so after i placed
my<00:04:25.500> powder<00:04:25.830> down<00:04:26.130> when<00:04:26.940> i'm<00:04:27.060> brushing<00:04:27.270> out

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
my powder down when i'm brushing out

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.740 
my powder down when i'm brushing out
this<00:04:27.780> eyebrow<00:04:27.990> i<00:04:28.350> really<00:04:28.889> go<00:04:29.010> up<00:04:32.419> and<00:04:33.419> then

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
this eyebrow i really go up and then

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:44.040 
this eyebrow i really go up and then
slightly<00:04:34.710> down

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.110 

and<00:04:45.050> that's<00:04:45.770> basically<00:04:46.280> how<00:04:46.639> I<00:04:46.879> do<00:04:47.030> my

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
and that's basically how I do my

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.909 
and that's basically how I do my
eyebrows<00:04:47.659> I<00:04:47.840> think<00:04:48.080> they<00:04:48.169> look<00:04:48.319> a<00:04:48.499> lot<00:04:48.710> better

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
eyebrows I think they look a lot better

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.480 
eyebrows I think they look a lot better
now<00:04:49.280> I<00:04:49.610> don't<00:04:50.120> believe<00:04:50.360> in<00:04:51.159> like<00:04:52.159> getting

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
now I don't believe in like getting

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.279 
now I don't believe in like getting
really<00:04:52.789> thin<00:04:53.029> eyebrows<00:04:53.479> unless<00:04:53.900> that<00:04:53.930> just

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
really thin eyebrows unless that just

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.260 
really thin eyebrows unless that just
works<00:04:54.469> with<00:04:54.650> your<00:04:54.800> face<00:04:54.979> but<00:04:55.699> I<00:04:55.849> like<00:04:56.090> my

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
works with your face but I like my

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.570 
works with your face but I like my
breasts<00:04:56.569> to<00:04:56.629> be<00:04:56.779> thicker<00:04:57.259> I<00:04:57.680> have<00:04:58.159> blond<00:04:58.460> hair

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
breasts to be thicker I have blond hair

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.239 
breasts to be thicker I have blond hair
so<00:04:59.120> it's<00:04:59.569> a<00:04:59.840> little<00:05:00.139> bit<00:05:00.259> darker<00:05:00.499> too<00:05:00.919> and

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:01.249 
so it's a little bit darker too and

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:03.159 
so it's a little bit darker too and
that's<00:05:01.610> pretty<00:05:02.240> much<00:05:02.389> is<00:05:02.719> how<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:02.900> do<00:05:03.050> my

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
that's pretty much is how I do my

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.649 
that's pretty much is how I do my
eyebrows<00:05:03.590> really<00:05:04.069> simple<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:04.580> fast<00:05:04.819> hardly

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659
