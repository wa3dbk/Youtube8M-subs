00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.599
 I wanted to briefly show you which one 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:14.750
 brush work number 22 yes of the atac 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.750
 he dances and puts on fire 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:30.060
 here it is and this brush is synthetic 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:35.070
 and I use this brush for example for 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:42.180
 make thin lines or even more 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:45.930
 bodied then is the thin one that is 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.460
 the larger one and then volume e 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.920
 lines this brush is synthetic and with 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.449
 every brushstroke as you see returns to the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.609
 his position which is important because 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.829
 when you do the next brushstroke must 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.489
 be ready to cannot be in 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.489
 another position 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.450
 so this brush number one that 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:19.650
 then use this thin number one 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:24.689
 but of ox and this I use it precisely for 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:28.680
 the very thin lines therefore for everything 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.689
 what wants to be more descriptive 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.759
 without going too much on the volume as I have 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:41.430
 made here then I use this certain brush 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.720
 which is also a relative number from vinci 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.689
 always synthetic and I also use this 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.869
 this for large volumes 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:54.390
 so if I have to fill the sheet with a 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:00.299
 more uniform color 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:07.560
 I also use this we can see this 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:12.660
 use thin or more voluminous then from 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:16.590
 win number 40 or even 30 uses and then the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.760
 this thin marten brush 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.000
 it would be a number 7 and this too 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:30.030
 when I put my brushstroke I can 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.989
 put the brush back in position e 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.099
 this made it thin then for 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.340
 they are very elastic 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:46.680
 here it is always used to describe different 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:51.750
 forms this here instead is a brush of 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:55.650
 anchor that I don't use in an absolute way 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:00.150
 this I was given this one 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:06.480
 however, a very expensive brush a 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:09.800
 something that for me is really out 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.470
 discussion that this 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:19.570
 I make my brush the brush 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:23.890
 he remains in his position and does not return 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:26.410
 look see how folded 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.030
 does not return to the new position for the 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.620
 painting which he paints and then he has is so 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.560
 therefore it is no longer straight in the form 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:40.480
 original and for this I do not use 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.730
 but the martorell brush is 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.430
 this is here at the time and now they are 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.430
 past more than ten years 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:53.200
 it certainly cost over 70 euros 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:56.410
 today I don't know how much it costs but I do 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.610
 see you make your shape and he remains 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.700
 nice explained so it is not acceptable 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.380
 this thing because later while you paint 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:12.030
 irritates completely and will not be able 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:15.220
 to work automatically 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.190
 so here we are, paint factory could 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:23.200
 see them, don't buy it, buy it 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:25.720
 synthetic ones cost much less and 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.930
 they do a much better job at 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.930
 next
