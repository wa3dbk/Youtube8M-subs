thing<00:03:19.560> I'm<00:03:19.650> hearing<00:03:19.950> funky<00:03:20.280> about<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.580> is<00:03:20.670> I

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
thing I'm hearing funky about that is I

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.949 
thing I'm hearing funky about that is I
don't<00:03:20.790> think<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.150> thing<00:03:21.330> actually<00:03:21.480> works<00:03:21.720> is

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
don't think this thing actually works is

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.420 
don't think this thing actually works is
external<00:03:22.350> monitor<00:03:22.620> also<00:03:22.830> that'll<00:03:23.160> be<00:03:23.220> kind<00:03:23.400> of

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
external monitor also that'll be kind of

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.710 
external monitor also that'll be kind of
weird<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:23.910> have<00:03:24.000> like<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.150> mini<00:03:24.420> mac<00:03:24.600> or

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
weird so if you have like a mini mac or

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.090 
weird so if you have like a mini mac or
whatever<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.410> want<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.650> get<00:03:25.769> up<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.040> I
