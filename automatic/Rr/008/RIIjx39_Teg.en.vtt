00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.540
 wrap my friends minecraft pocket 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.310
 is finally here again and finally 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.180
 This time it is a covering in with the 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.900
 name vertigo what is your name 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.960
 his 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.520
 he 'll be pretty crazy me 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.020
 I've already activated the whole thing 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.690
 but not only the functions 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.330
 just the perspective looked quite funny 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.400
 I'm giving vertigo stop again 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.340
 in my normal position you see 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.470
 times minecraft player and we start 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.670
 quite simply times with the plug-in what 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.170
 that makes a small one at all 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.970
 plugin you can just say van plugin 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.930
 where we see everything turned over exactly 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.199
 turned around 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.820
 yes you give the command / vertigo 1 then 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.059
 you see everything turned around you realize it 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.690
 even wow what is he going on now 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.830
 the whole pretty crazy and yes then 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.060
 You can also quickly here under 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.619
 water and do not know at all 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.360
 more about how to get out of here at all 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.240
 So I have to show up here again 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.909
 So that's a bit first 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.010
 complicated here reversed cope 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.810
 to find but that fits so if 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.979
 because it's his practice, I think 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.329
 then it will be alright 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.649
 we can of course work 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.420
 also break down blocks underwater and me 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.219
 guess I'll only times briefly 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.020
 make the normal perspective again 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.560
 just to explain the rest 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.899
 vertigo stop it just stop 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.060
 the whole to yes to just the back 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.579
 to have a normal perspective like this 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.990
 now in the case and we can there 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:49.090
 one last and third command 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.439
 that would be tigo player and then go 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.299
 we in other players took and he 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.920
 can not do anything about it 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.560
 and he just sees everything 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.229
 upside down yes then you can do that 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.370
 fellow players punish for a day with 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.710
 vertigo walking around and these new please 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.630
 i'll leave you alone please please me 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.790
 did nothing and then we have completely 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.650
 quickly rest on a server as I said 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.710
 you can also break blocks with it if 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.540
 we just have to turn around now 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.890
 I'm getting along somehow 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.570
 first have to look where I am 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.600
 can ever walk here and now 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.740
 I can see the blocks here 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.930
 let's have a look on the floor 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.560
 yes, exactly as I can destroy everything 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.780
 only you have to think about it first 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.340
 turned over more mouse everything turned over and over 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.300
 if need be, today simply would have to 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.240
 Turn the screen over 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.410
 well, that's exactly how we go vertigo again 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.330
 stop a 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.000
 you would have the whole thing too 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.830
 done and what the plug-in 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.270
 actually just been in the 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.130
 but wrecks 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.530
 I wish you a nice day and 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.530
