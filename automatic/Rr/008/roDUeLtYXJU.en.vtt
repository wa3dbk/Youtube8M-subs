intervention a while back this is

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.019 
intervention a while back this is
because<00:00:16.020> they<00:00:16.170> each<00:00:16.410> had<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.949> rutting<00:00:17.520> suitable

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
because they each had a rutting suitable

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.970 
because they each had a rutting suitable
that<00:00:18.240> needed<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.630> be<00:00:18.750> removed<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.619> we

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
that needed to be removed and we

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.620 
that needed to be removed and we
actually<00:00:20.130> used<00:00:20.490> two<00:00:20.910> different<00:00:20.939> techniques

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
actually used two different techniques

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.810 
actually used two different techniques
to<00:00:22.080> remove<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.500> sort<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.740> Oaks<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.460> let's

orchid is doing fantastically well it
bloomed<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.520> meantime<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.530> this<00:00:52.530> growth

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
bloomed in the meantime and this growth

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.400 
bloomed in the meantime and this growth
right<00:00:53.370> here<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.850> producing<00:00:54.420> another<00:00:55.020> growth

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
right here is producing another growth

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.490 
right here is producing another growth
as<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.579> see<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.629> orchid<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.140> doing

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
as you can see so the orchid is doing

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.770 
as you can see so the orchid is doing
quite<00:00:58.770> well<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.059> affected<00:01:00.570> by<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
quite well and it is not affected by the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.529 
quite well and it is not affected by the
loss<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.199> one<00:01:01.410> suitable<00:01:01.829> now<00:01:02.820> because<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
loss of one suitable now because the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.270 
loss of one suitable now because the
pseudo<00:01:03.750> bulb<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.260> removed<00:01:04.680> may<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
pseudo bulb we removed may the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.730 
pseudo bulb we removed may the
connection<00:01:05.760> between<00:01:05.909> these<00:01:06.689> back<00:01:07.200> bulbs<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
connection between these back bulbs and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.310 
connection between these back bulbs and
the<00:01:07.979> new<00:01:08.250> growth<00:01:08.670> direction<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.869> needed<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the new growth direction we needed to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.460 
the new growth direction we needed to
keep<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.250> rhizome<00:01:11.820> intact<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.659> by<00:01:12.840> twisting

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
keep the rhizome intact and by twisting

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.920 
keep the rhizome intact and by twisting
actually<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.549> removed<00:01:14.939> only<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.540> rotting

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
actually we removed only the rotting

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.289 
actually we removed only the rotting
pseudo<00:01:16.229> bulb<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.070> did<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.430> damage<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
pseudo bulb but we did not damage the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.719 
pseudo bulb but we did not damage the
rhizome<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.740> reason<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.280> orchid

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
rhizome so for this reason the orchid

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.730 
rhizome so for this reason the orchid
continued<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.390> grow<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.110> connection<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
continued to grow and the connection is

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.890 
continued to grow and the connection is
not<00:01:22.770> severed<00:01:23.490> between<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.270> two<00:01:24.450> halves<00:01:24.689> of

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
not severed between the two halves of

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140 
not severed between the two halves of
the<00:01:24.990> orchid<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> other<00:01:26.580> 1b

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the orchid now with the other 1b

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.330 
the orchid now with the other 1b
Stanhope<00:01:27.600> yeah<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.990> actually<00:01:28.110> had<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.950> chop

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
Stanhope yeah we actually had to chop

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.730 
Stanhope yeah we actually had to chop
off<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.880> suta<00:01:30.150> bulb<00:01:30.360> we<00:01:30.810> could<00:01:31.079> not<00:01:31.229> twist<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
off the suta bulb we could not twist it

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.640 
off the suta bulb we could not twist it
because<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.340> was<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.390> mushy<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:34.500> if

about it now this is the place where we

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.780 
about it now this is the place where we
actually<00:01:45.960> cut<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.500> pseudo<00:01:46.799> bulb<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.610> was

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
actually cut the pseudo bulb as I was

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.730 
actually cut the pseudo bulb as I was
saying<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.210> was<00:01:48.450> not<00:01:48.479> able<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.140> twist<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.590> off

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
saying I was not able to twist it off

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.590 
saying I was not able to twist it off
because<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.490> might<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.060> severed<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
because I might have severed the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.440 
because I might have severed the
connection<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.799> orchid<00:01:53.369> had<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.880> growth

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
connection and this orchid had a growth

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.780 
connection and this orchid had a growth
right<00:01:54.780> here<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.979> would<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.310> severed

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
right here so if I would have severed

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.490 
right here so if I would have severed
the<00:01:57.060> connection<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.750> growth<00:01:58.049> would<00:01:58.320> have

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the connection this growth would have

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.590 
the connection this growth would have
been<00:01:58.710> compromised<00:01:59.430> because<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.390> mother

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
been compromised because the mother

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.440 
been compromised because the mother
pseudo<00:02:00.930> bulb<00:02:01.140> was<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> affected<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.210> we

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
pseudo bulb was the affected one so we

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.450 
pseudo bulb was the affected one so we
actually<00:02:03.600> cut<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.439> sterilize<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.250> wound

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
actually cut it and sterilize the wound

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.760 
actually cut it and sterilize the wound
as<00:02:05.670> best<00:02:06.000> as<00:02:06.149> we<00:02:06.180> could<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.530> see

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
as best as we could and as you can see

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.580 
as best as we could and as you can see
there<00:02:08.009> seems<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.910> dry<00:02:09.450> patch<00:02:09.869> instead<00:02:10.440> of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
there seems to be a dry patch instead of

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.800 
there seems to be a dry patch instead of
the<00:02:10.770> wound<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.340> big<00:02:11.550> ugly<00:02:11.849> wound<00:02:12.090> and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the wound the big ugly wound and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.750 
the wound the big ugly wound and
so<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.200> infection<00:02:13.470> did<00:02:13.890> not<00:02:14.099> spread<00:02:14.459> and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so the infection did not spread and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.420 
so the infection did not spread and
because<00:02:15.300> we<00:02:15.450> did<00:02:15.750> not<00:02:15.780> sever<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.920> rhizome

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
because we did not sever the rhizome

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.430 
because we did not sever the rhizome
connecting<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.060> pseudobulbs<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:19.200> new

growth<00:02:19.739> has<00:02:20.069> actually<00:02:20.250> grown<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.599> can<00:02:21.810> show

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
growth has actually grown and I can show

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.660

you<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.470> see<00:02:22.709> on<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.980> tip<00:02:23.160> right<00:02:23.400> here

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
you if you see on the tip right here

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.300 
you if you see on the tip right here
there<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.239> little<00:02:24.540> black<00:02:24.870> spots<00:02:25.349> now<00:02:26.040> this

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
there is a little black spots now this

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.940 
there is a little black spots now this
is<00:02:26.489> where<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.970> old<00:02:27.180> tip<00:02:27.720> used<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.200> be<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
is where the old tip used to be and the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.530 
is where the old tip used to be and the
black<00:02:29.160> spot<00:02:29.519> is<00:02:29.730> actually<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> little<00:02:30.360> bit<00:02:30.510> of

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
black spot is actually a little bit of

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.660 
black spot is actually a little bit of
damage<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.470> it's<00:02:31.620> quite<00:02:31.830> all<00:02:31.980> right<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.459> as

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
damage but it's quite all right so as

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.850 
damage but it's quite all right so as
you<00:02:32.700> can<00:02:33.000> see<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.599> tip<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.319> new<00:02:34.560> growth

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
you can see the tip of this new growth

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.430 
you can see the tip of this new growth
is<00:02:35.099> how<00:02:35.400> much<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.880> grew<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.959> last<00:02:37.170> two

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
is how much it grew in the last two

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.430 
is how much it grew in the last two
weeks<00:02:37.680> since<00:02:38.040> we<00:02:38.310> reported<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.930> again<00:02:40.410> I

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
weeks since we reported it so again I

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.830 
weeks since we reported it so again I
think<00:02:40.620> we<00:02:40.890> did<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.340> good<00:02:41.730> job<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:42.209> sterilizing

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
think we did a good job in sterilizing

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.650 
think we did a good job in sterilizing
this<00:02:43.140> wound<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.709> also<00:02:44.610> not<00:02:44.910> severing<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
this wound and also not severing the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.930 
this wound and also not severing the
rhizome<00:02:46.170> whenever<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.950> remove<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.400> rushing

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
rhizome whenever you remove a rushing

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.030 
rhizome whenever you remove a rushing
pseudo<00:02:48.269> bulb<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.870> most<00:02:49.049> important<00:02:49.530> thing<00:02:49.799> is

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
pseudo bulb the most important thing is

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.070 
pseudo bulb the most important thing is
to<00:02:50.280> not<00:02:50.459> disturb<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.450> connection<00:02:51.930> between

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
to not disturb the connection between

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.020 
to not disturb the connection between
the<00:02:52.380> suitable<00:02:52.799> especially<00:02:53.640> if<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.819> have<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
the suitable especially if you have a

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.850 
the suitable especially if you have a
case<00:02:54.390> like<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.900> with<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.350> new<00:02:55.560> growth

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
case like this with a new growth

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.610 
case like this with a new growth
developing<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.599> relying<00:02:58.230> on<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.590> old

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
developing that is relying on the old

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.830 
developing that is relying on the old
ourselves<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.610> feed<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:00.060> until<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.660> produces

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
ourselves to feed it until it produces

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.130 
ourselves to feed it until it produces
roots<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.519> think<00:03:02.940> these<00:03:03.180> two<00:03:03.450> orchids<00:03:03.959> are

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
roots so I think these two orchids are

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.170 
roots so I think these two orchids are
good<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:04.920> go<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:05.310> think<00:03:05.430> they<00:03:05.670> will<00:03:05.760> do<00:03:05.940> just

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
good to go I think they will do just

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.330 
good to go I think they will do just
fine<00:03:06.269> from<00:03:06.660> now<00:03:06.870> on<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.739> just<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.040> matter<00:03:08.250> of

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
fine from now on it is just a matter of

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.460 
fine from now on it is just a matter of
time<00:03:08.730> until<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.360> new<00:03:09.480> grows<00:03:09.750> produce<00:03:10.170> roots

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
time until the new grows produce roots

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.990 
time until the new grows produce roots
of<00:03:10.650> their<00:03:10.769> own<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.310> everything<00:03:11.790> should<00:03:11.940> be

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
of their own and everything should be

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.530 
of their own and everything should be
fine

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
fine

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.089 
fine
