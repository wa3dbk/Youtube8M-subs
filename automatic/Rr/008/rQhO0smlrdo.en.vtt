400<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.739> then<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.730> course<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:40.030> have<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.390> 3.0

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
400 and then of course you have the 3.0

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.120 
400 and then of course you have the 3.0
liter<00:02:41.200> hybrid<00:02:41.829> and<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:43.000> has<00:02:43.590> 333<00:02:44.590> combined
