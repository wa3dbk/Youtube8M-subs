00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
call and that scenario often causes a

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.070 
call and that scenario often causes a
lot<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.460> confusion<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.180> well<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.689> your<00:01:12.810> team

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080

lot of confusion as well in your team
play<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:14.070> call<00:01:14.460> might<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.880> decent<00:01:15.420> but

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
play as a call might be decent but

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.870 
play as a call might be decent but
someone<00:01:16.290> thinks<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.890> bad<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.759> they

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
someone thinks it's bad and so they

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.520 
someone thinks it's bad and so they
don't<00:01:18.060> listen<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> call<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.049> then<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
don't listen to the call and then the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.469 
don't listen to the call and then the
play<00:01:19.710> ends<00:01:20.009> up<00:01:20.130> failing<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.850> then<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> one

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
play ends up failing and then the one

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.670 
play ends up failing and then the one
who<00:01:21.600> didn't<00:01:21.900> listen<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> call<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
who didn't listen to the call in the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.740 
who didn't listen to the call in the
first<00:01:22.950> place<00:01:23.159> blames<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.180> fact<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
first place blames the fact that the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.170 
first place blames the fact that the
call<00:01:24.960> was<00:01:24.990> bad<00:01:25.380> when<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.159> reality<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.909> call

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
call was bad when in reality the call

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.940 
call was bad when in reality the call
might<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.479> been<00:01:27.630> pretty<00:01:27.900> good<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.860> was

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
might have been pretty good but it was

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.770 
might have been pretty good but it was
the<00:01:29.100> fact<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.759> player<00:01:30.060> didn't<00:01:30.509> listen

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the fact that the player didn't listen

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.050 
the fact that the player didn't listen
that<00:01:31.470> automatically<00:01:32.220> makes<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.670> call<00:01:32.850> bad

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that automatically makes the call bad

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.510 
that automatically makes the call bad
any<00:01:33.509> call<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.409> does<00:01:34.500> not<00:01:34.680> listen<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.460> a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
any call that does not listen to is a

when<00:03:21.780> doing<00:03:22.079> that<00:03:22.229> you<00:03:22.470> need<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.709> play<00:03:22.919> to<00:03:22.949> the

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
when doing that you need to play to the

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.189 
when doing that you need to play to the

could<00:03:29.220> perhaps<00:03:29.370> try<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.819> use<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.449> make<00:03:30.599> a

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
could perhaps try to use that to make a

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.990 
could perhaps try to use that to make a

jungler with a scrying orb or through
good<00:03:49.859> Ward<00:03:50.099> coverage<00:03:50.549> it's<00:03:51.299> things<00:03:51.540> like<00:03:51.599> that

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
good Ward coverage it's things like that

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.569 
good Ward coverage it's things like that
there's<00:03:52.199> a<00:03:52.259> whole<00:03:52.500> realm<00:03:52.769> of<00:03:52.949> possibilities

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
there's a whole realm of possibilities

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.219 
there's a whole realm of possibilities
but<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.209> design<00:03:54.479> these<00:03:54.629> kinds<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:54.989> strategies

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:55.229 
but to design these kinds of strategies

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:56.899 
but to design these kinds of strategies
you<00:03:55.889> just<00:03:56.069> need<00:03:56.219> to<00:03:56.340> look<00:03:56.459> at<00:03:56.579> what<00:03:56.759> your

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
you just need to look at what your

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.580 
you just need to look at what your
players<00:03:57.180> are<00:03:57.359> good<00:03:57.479> at<00:03:57.599> doing<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:57.989> what<00:03:58.409> your

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
players are good at doing and what your

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.530 
players are good at doing and what your
team<00:03:58.739> composition<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.370> good<00:03:59.519> at<00:03:59.669> and<00:03:59.849> then<00:04:00.359> use

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
team composition is good at and then use

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.149 
team composition is good at and then use
the<00:04:00.659> strengths<00:04:00.959> from<00:04:01.049> both<00:04:01.290> together<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:02.009> make

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
the strengths from both together to make

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.360 
the strengths from both together to make
plays<00:04:03.409> other<00:04:04.409> than<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.889> there<00:04:05.099> isn't<00:04:05.340> that

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
plays other than that there isn't that

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.520 
plays other than that there isn't that
much<00:04:05.939> that<00:04:06.209> specifically<00:04:06.750> applies<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.319> team

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
much that specifically applies to team

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.709 
much that specifically applies to team
play<00:04:07.709> only<00:04:07.979> of<00:04:08.370> course<00:04:08.759> having<00:04:09.419> your<00:04:09.539> team

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:09.719 
play only of course having your team

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:11.779 
play only of course having your team
improve<00:04:10.109> their<00:04:10.259> individual<00:04:10.949> play<00:04:11.189> through

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:11.789 
improve their individual play through

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:13.309 
improve their individual play through
all<00:04:11.969> the<00:04:12.180> other<00:04:12.329> strategies<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.019> stuff<00:04:13.199> that

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319
