heard it later on a on a snap that was a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.150 
heard it later on a on a snap that was a
rien<00:00:36.870> jury<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.290> he<00:00:37.440> was<00:00:37.590> actually<00:00:37.950> playing

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
rien jury so he was actually playing

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.690 
rien jury so he was actually playing
with<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> couple<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.540> jammed<00:00:39.840> fingers<00:00:40.290> and

with with a couple of jammed fingers and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.850 
with with a couple of jammed fingers and
so<00:00:41.700> pretty<00:00:42.270> efficient<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.140> know<00:00:43.260> day<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.559> think

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
so pretty efficient you know day I think

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.639 
so pretty efficient you know day I think
for<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:45.090> know<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.390> first<00:00:45.570> day<00:00:45.840> hitting

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
for you know for the first day hitting

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.590 
for you know for the first day hitting
out<00:00:46.739> there<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.010> thought<00:00:47.250> they<00:00:47.570> handled<00:00:48.570> it

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
out there I thought they handled it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.479 
out there I thought they handled it
pretty<00:00:48.809> well<00:00:48.930> there<00:00:49.620> was<00:00:49.770> only<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.219> penalty

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
pretty well there was only one penalty

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.459 
pretty well there was only one penalty
but<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.270> honest<00:00:51.539> they<00:00:51.780> were<00:00:51.899> referees<00:00:52.350> out

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
but to be honest they were referees out

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.020 
but to be honest they were referees out
there<00:00:52.590> real<00:00:52.800> rough<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.160> each<00:00:53.280> other<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:53.910> it

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
there real rough for each other but it

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.910 
there real rough for each other but it
looked<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.480> they<00:00:54.690> might<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.050> kept<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> few

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
looked like they might have kept a few

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.080 
looked like they might have kept a few
flags<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.340> pocket<00:00:56.670> well<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.940> know<00:00:57.059> I

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
flags in the pocket well you know I

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.939 
flags in the pocket well you know I
think<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.629> far<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.960> think<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.379> defense<00:00:58.559> has

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
think so far I think the defense has

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.139 
think so far I think the defense has
gotten<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> better<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.940> know<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
gotten the better and you know the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.880 
gotten the better and you know the
better<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.510> things<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.199> lot<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.469> ways<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:01.620> I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
better of things in a lot of ways but I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.830 
better of things in a lot of ways but I
think<00:01:02.160> today<00:01:02.370> they<00:01:03.090> were<00:01:03.180> screaming<00:01:03.510> because

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
think today they were screaming because

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
think today they were screaming because
they<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.170> they<00:01:04.500> maybe<00:01:04.710> had<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> sack<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:05.519> two

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
they think they maybe had a sack or two

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.820 
they think they maybe had a sack or two
that<00:01:06.090> they<00:01:06.210> didn't<00:01:06.420> get<00:01:06.540> credit<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
that they didn't get credit for it was a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.469 
that they didn't get credit for it was a
lot<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.369> were<00:01:08.640> Cody<00:01:09.180> threw<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
of those were but but I you know I think

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.340

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
they handled it pretty well and in a lot

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.440 
they handled it pretty well and in a lot
of<00:01:28.409> ways<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.340> was<00:01:29.490> probably<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.939> as<00:01:30.119> happy

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
of ways and I was probably just as happy

of ways and I was probably just as happy

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
quarterback play well pretty efficient i

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.090

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
think and Cody was is right i think and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.219 
think and Cody was is right i think and
he<00:01:47.159> said<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.939> big<00:01:48.149> thing<00:01:48.360> he<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:48.810> him<00:01:48.990> was<00:01:49.200> to

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
he said the big thing he for him was to

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.800 
he said the big thing he for him was to
come<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:50.100> get<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> six<00:01:50.909> or<00:01:51.030> seven<00:01:51.329> minute<00:01:51.570> drive

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.170 
come out get a six or seven minute drive
for<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.649> touchdown<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> first<00:01:53.729> series

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
for a touchdown on the first series

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.090 
for a touchdown on the first series
against<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:55.259> know<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> first<00:01:55.680> defense

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
against the you know the first defense

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.499 
against the you know the first defense
its<00:01:56.310> kind<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.610> taking<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.149> him<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> little

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
its kind of taking it to him a little

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.600 
its kind of taking it to him a little
bit<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.810> i<00:01:58.170> think<00:01:58.530> he<00:01:58.619> said<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:59.009> was<00:01:59.189> really

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
bit and i think he said that was really

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.700 
bit and i think he said that was really
important<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.630> was<00:02:00.780> they<00:02:01.049> did<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> lot<00:02:01.680> of

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
important and it was they did a lot of

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.160 
important and it was they did a lot of
different<00:02:02.100> things<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.579> series<00:02:02.850> i<00:02:03.570> think

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
different things in that series i think

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.260 
different things in that series i think
we<00:02:04.259> saw<00:02:04.439> both<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.680> them<00:02:04.979> kind<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:06.060> pretty

think they both were real pleased with
with<00:02:24.840> how<00:02:24.960> they<00:02:25.140> handled<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.530> today<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.100> lane

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
