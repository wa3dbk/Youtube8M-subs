00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.250
 go ahead yes I want me to talk to you a little vein of what we 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.390
 think about the level of training already in the training it takes well 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.490
 know that 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.660
 in europe we talk a lot when we are in 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.820
 what happens 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.149
 it's pretty new 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.399
 who happens to make the 125 of equipment that's part of the 

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:20.099
 training to talk about equipment and with everything then we talked about two 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.839
 airbag proposals may I think we could put on the gloves 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.949
 compulsory it would not be anyway superfluous we could ban madero 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.980
 the short ranks how do we see chasing 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.800
 d this sport 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.359
 in the south of France for example 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:34.930
 that's the basics 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.360
 in europe has too much 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.940
 of 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.519
 the driver of me early two scooters 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:41.560
 extremely poorly equipped 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.150
 so we go all the time in the in the extreme I can say the crossbow but 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.850
 maybe before going to take in the rda which is expensive and eti of blindness 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.550
 means on the Roman side we played we never got the prizes and we got this 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.229
 price is a variable 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.539
 a fork very very wide yes because they have a game announces electric 14 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.849
 euros it's 1,400,500 douala here we were told 700 in the streets at the 

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:07.420
 meets the gold army his giant screen anyway cayenne ya things to och 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.219
 paut-being that are very simple to set up is it useful and 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:11.900
 avoid the extra costs 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.660
 and then of course 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.770
 the dorsal 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.680
 that's all alone 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.890
 I think that just now 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.289
 when we spoke 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.750
 the people who did the scarcity statistics 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.810
 when we arrive on a motorcycle showing little bit of everything allowed in some places it's 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.580
 what stands out I think it's not the hall with the majority 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.150
 we know that people and that's part of training too 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.670
 motorcycle drivers know who are more fragile more fragile and one 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.130
 compare a behavior 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.200
 Consequently 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.540
 except that there a few days or a few irresponsible people but 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.270
 that there is everywhere even by car we can not wait 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.970
 no politician everywhere so what percent 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.760
 luckily you do not like to grow cucumber early when you arrive 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.390
 you are there for you you risk yourself you risk especially percent your life 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.430
 more than a few scenes of the day 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.030
 % so I think it was people who are reasonable and then that's it 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.149
 could almost say 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.159
 when and the general is because specialists in the vast majority of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.950
 road safety why part they come 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.390
 knowingly to train 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.090
 their convoy% and even before the obligation for edf this period 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.599
 many people who came to train 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.529
 and then in post allowed after the license which is already much more complex 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:19.810
 kamke car license because you have to track you try to help 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.279
 braking downshifts 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.529
 but all have stopped that makes sense because it's complicated to drive a 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.529
 motorcycle and then start somehow why harder 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.989
 so important to train they know it they come 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.330
 after her 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.340
 the license 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.280
 train themselves and they are in continuous training we can say in motorcycle and there 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.360
 had things that we can offer for example for their safety that's the 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.640
 decline and modern techniques will have to be developed of course for 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.039
 sure the scouts hours a scooter to stop it make us this list 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.009
 make us this list in the form of a specification 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:58.279
 saying this is done yet it has only one idea the auriverde for 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.919
 the other directors the city of paris in more or less the same who 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.029
 have preferred that this comes from technicians d 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:07.579
 of the two fields of the field that tell us that's where that and 5 who should 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:08.960
 to be a priority 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.719
 or for what type of gear why 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.550
 he might even consider 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.060
 that we can share here that's it and then I just wanted to say something 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.839
 over three months of February either on speed 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:22.759
 % and sometimes speed 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:26.549
 it's still a factor of safety for a motorcycle when we 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.429
 roll on fast lanes with a small 125 we are often doubled on 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:34.079
 for example at high speed the speed that was dead was known 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.709
 the balandrade moment but of 45 kilometers hour for for the the losc 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.630
 where the scooter 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.320
 The 14th with attention it's all we have 45 km because it has nothing 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.099
 does some of you need not 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.189
 to say that we can have a motorcycle that rolls to 250 on circuit 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.369
 heyer duty may have to respect the rax the road no but 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:57.959
 precisely but we can respect the rules we can have a beautiful object 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.549
 and the bike is also fun 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.519
 it's not just brief 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.519
 so we must still keep his pleasure 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.159
 that's because I think it's important 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.109
 d so people have endured long problems like this 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.459
 to be reasonable we can very well have a nice bike and learn to 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.670
 be reasonable to respect the rules have a good behavior on the 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:15.059
 road 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:16.690
 and listen to the case of trying 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.380
 to pull people down in two years why not motorcycles that 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.460
 do not exceed 130 km in any case it's not like that the idea that I am 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.550
 the bike I guess this one issue exceeds 130 km I'm fine 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.050
 so for waters on circuit 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.139
 yes in order to improve that's not laughs but we can very well but most 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.250
 developers there are people in this country that already has a lot of people who 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.330
 go on circuit yes of course you know I was doing open doors 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.260
 net revenues of aircraft 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.289
 of which of course 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:43.779
 we also think 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:45.289
 at this yardstick of things 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.069
 where do they come from 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.050
 the Mormons I I I 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.520
 Geneva the week 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.400
 the Vosges school 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.039
 every eighth in league 1 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.139
 he dismantles the circuit you're talking about 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.069
 it's ecology 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.089
 the ser the collar of the man knows 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:04.449
 the cci to listen to it 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.039
 % and Senate circuits 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.369
 the menu so reduce as much as possible to convince them it takes no 

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:13.550
 yes you have to do a job 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.550
 with the bikers them the same who saw as you do 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.539
 the messages 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.069
 with the gendarmerie and we do not count 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:22.970
 we managed to reduce 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.100
 the number of deaths in the red collar 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.349
 since a year 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.789
 because he had this work in common ok I invite you besides it is 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.289
 the object of the other but hey we see even problem paul ricard in 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.150
 the rise of the fn in the forest because where they do the big roles too quickly his 

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:41.509
 back on the accused bench there is a question that clicked had asked 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:42.979
 which has not been addressed which 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:43.599
 besides the accident
