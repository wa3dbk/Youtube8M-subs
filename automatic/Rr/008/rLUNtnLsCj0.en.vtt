in<00:00:04.590> this<00:00:05.430> tutorial<00:00:05.610> we'll<00:00:06.090> be<00:00:06.150> discussing<00:00:06.660> how

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
in this tutorial we'll be discussing how

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.570 
in this tutorial we'll be discussing how
to<00:00:06.990> add<00:00:07.200> interaction<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.010> your<00:00:08.160> mock-ups

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
to add interaction to your mock-ups

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.030 
to add interaction to your mock-ups
we'll<00:00:09.420> look<00:00:09.540> at<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.720> hypothetical<00:00:10.170> iPhone<00:00:10.800> app

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
we'll look at a hypothetical iPhone app

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.459 
we'll look at a hypothetical iPhone app
and<00:00:11.340> development<00:00:11.790> called<00:00:12.000> yummy<00:00:12.540> food<00:00:12.870> for

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
and development called yummy food for

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.010 
and development called yummy food for
this<00:00:13.590> example<00:00:14.150> we<00:00:15.150> want<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.389> add<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.600> little<00:00:15.840> bit

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
this example we want to add a little bit

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.120 
this example we want to add a little bit
of<00:00:16.049> interaction<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.740> show<00:00:16.890> off<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
of interaction to show off the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.430 
of interaction to show off the
functionality<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.030> app<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:19.140> will

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
functionality of this app this will

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.650 
functionality of this app this will
require<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.980> use<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.130> States<00:00:20.550> hot<00:00:21.120> spots<00:00:21.450> and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
require the use of States hot spots and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.290 
require the use of States hot spots and
demo<00:00:22.230> mode<00:00:22.580> let's<00:00:23.580> say<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.850> want<00:00:24.030> to<00:00:24.090> search

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
demo mode let's say we want to search

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.970 
demo mode let's say we want to search
for<00:00:24.330> them<00:00:24.690> to<00:00:24.810> appear<00:00:25.170> when<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> user<00:00:25.620> clicks

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
for them to appear when the user clicks

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.190 
for them to appear when the user clicks
the<00:00:26.100> find<00:00:26.460> button<00:00:26.700> on<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.240> app<00:00:27.360> interface<00:00:27.750> tab

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200
