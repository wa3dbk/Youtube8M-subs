00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.740
 what is going on like sunflower in 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.629
 solitary it works well in the background 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.619
 you can already see a little bit 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.750
 Christmas tree 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.150
 how come now on this fir tree 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.160
 people because you have it more often 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.539
 asked whether now on youtube or 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.670
 again in the livestream but first 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.369
 what is my favorite drink yes people 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.010
 once the night vision wrestled and once 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.839
 Throw drank the speed so why 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.640
 because it is light work we come 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.629
 before we start through it all 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.640
 house to fly 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.010
 something to be done again 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.290
 So I would like that fir-tree already 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.229
 considered to demolish but again 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.330
 not because you have to do it again every year 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.680
 to reset the fir-tree that's me 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.799
 I just thought it over 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.689
 An art tree with water below 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:03.110
 that looks back on the no 

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:06.479
 but it is a fir-tree 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.680
 For several years forever just says 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.149
 Let's continue this 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.570
 otherwise I would have to 2015 and 2016 and yes 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:19.229
 2017 and so on and so forth 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.700
 to rebuild a fir tree you are 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.359
 crazy you know how long the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.520
 oh my god has taken him like that 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.439
 get it first before I first 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.899
 started here with the gifts 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.049
 or with the little one know that 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:38.579

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.130
 no boots no people that stays that way 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.200
 this place as it is best with it 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.689
 were about eight hours to ten 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.929
 hours of building with the alone 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.600
 electronics and everything so I leave it 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.939
 Just stand hope you are in favor 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.130

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.310

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.230
 choose several videos if you have it 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.510

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.150
 Guest room 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.910

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.790
 Now continue to talk for my active ones 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.519
 outside must say so you are 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.709
 really active so first I was at 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.310

 this series or I really already know 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.010
 But I heard it again 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.299
 to forget 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.269
 then just write in the 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.310
 comments for the people with the 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.840
 Of course , that's what it looked like 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.060
 maybe not now, or yes again 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.610
 So only for the people who know that 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.290
 What is he's writing my comments 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.410
 I would be interested in how 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.950
 name of these has been difficult 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.320
 pretty as say who writes for 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.660
 please avoid comments like this 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.580
 So we still see two dresser two 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.270
 trees now again through two 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.890
 window then in three windows and one 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.560
 in this weather I have it 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.810
 respected that here with the bet 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.370
 mattress with the green bed sheet is 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.190
 you can see that with the 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.760
 bed sheet under this mattress 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.010
 that's what you have of course 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.880
 also determined at home if not start 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.460
 you stand on the ground 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.020
 No, I hope you sleep too 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:39.480
 a bed then we have a red 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:46.150
 carpet here a disabled or 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:48.310
 did not inactivate any activated yet 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.410
 is like him activated but we would be 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.970
 now again milk even drink in 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.910
 I also darken the room 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.730
 because you are not here 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.930
 during the day but when it gets dark around 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.430
 to sleep 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:06.810
 and now we just do the lamp 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:10.330
 again active so activated lamp hua 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.550
 a sweet little lamp now sometimes 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.400
 stops again because the room was still there 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.100
 no lighting here but the game 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.840
 said that comes at the end of the whole 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.500
 house the whole lighting after and 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.070
 after 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.520
 do not worry the light a little better 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.790
 definitely not perfect in here 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.600
 so i hope you have your own share 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.800

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.570

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.860

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.160

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.280
