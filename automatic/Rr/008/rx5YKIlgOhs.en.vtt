00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
this is going to be a little tutorial on

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.270 
this is going to be a little tutorial on
how<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.420> solve<00:00:06.870> 4x4<00:00:07.649> parity<00:00:08.900> um<00:00:10.250> one<00:00:11.250> thing

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
how to solve 4x4 parity um one thing

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.570 
how to solve 4x4 parity um one thing
before<00:00:12.030> we<00:00:12.059> start<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.920> cube<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.280> use

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
before we start is that the cube I use

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.130 
before we start is that the cube I use
is<00:00:15.139> a<00:00:16.550> Shang<00:00:17.550> Shu<00:00:17.840> 4x4<00:00:19.220> um<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.660> don't<00:00:21.660> think<00:00:21.960> that

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
is a Shang Shu 4x4 um I don't think that

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.290 
is a Shang Shu 4x4 um I don't think that
matters<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:23.070> case<00:00:23.279> you're<00:00:23.519> wondering<00:00:23.670> I

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
matters just in case you're wondering I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.769 
matters just in case you're wondering I

I<00:00:34.040> also<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> mini<00:00:35.579> QJ<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.300> hate<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
I also have a mini QJ but I hate it

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.630 
I also have a mini QJ but I hate it
because<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.200> got<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> ball<00:00:37.680> Cormack<00:00:38.250> and

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
because it's got the ball Cormack and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.639 
because it's got the ball Cormack and
yeah<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.350> locks<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.219> lot<00:00:41.629> anyways

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
yeah it just locks up a lot anyways

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.130 
yeah it just locks up a lot anyways
let's<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:43.860> right<00:00:44.040> into<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.989> okay

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
let's get right into it okay

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.040 
let's get right into it okay
so<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.920> right<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.149> first<00:00:48.390> parody

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
so this right here is the first parody

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.740 
so this right here is the first parody
that<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.340> go<00:00:50.520> over<00:00:50.610> there's<00:00:51.059> two<00:00:51.420> there's

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
that I will go over there's two there's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.240 
that I will go over there's two there's
overloan<00:00:52.379> peel<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.680> believe<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> PLL

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
overloan peel I believe this is the PLL

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.209 
overloan peel I believe this is the PLL
parody<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.640> what<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.360> get<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.600> there's<00:00:58.219> this

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
parody so what you get is there's this

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.639 
parody so what you get is there's this
edge<00:00:59.489> right<00:00:59.520> here<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.170> this<00:01:01.170> edge<00:01:01.410> right<00:01:01.440> here

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
edge right here and this edge right here

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.690 
edge right here and this edge right here
are<00:01:02.070> swapped<00:01:02.840> so<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.739> orange<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.309> blue<00:01:05.519> one

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
are swapped so this orange and blue one

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.480 
are swapped so this orange and blue one
should<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.119> over<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.420> right<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.710> this

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
should be over here right here and this

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.539 
should be over here right here and this
orange<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.850> green<00:01:08.970> one<00:01:09.180> should<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.659> over<00:01:09.990> here

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
orange and green one should be over here

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.730 
orange and green one should be over here
so<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.979> mozi<00:01:14.549> would<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.180> solve<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.750> would

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
so the mozi would do to solve this would

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:27.399 
so the mozi would do to solve this would
be<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.270> small<00:01:18.270> R<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:22.790> smaller<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.560> um

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
be a small R to you to smaller to um

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.280 
be a small R to you to smaller to um
small<00:01:28.409> earth<00:01:28.880> U<00:01:29.880> star<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:31.670> small<00:01:32.670> R<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.229> u<00:01:34.229> star

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
small earth U star to small R to u star

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.359 
small earth U star to small R to u star
to<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.640> youtube<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.920> I'm<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
to and then youtube so I'm just going to

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.179 
to and then youtube so I'm just going to
go<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.970> again<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.650> without<00:01:40.650> saying<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
go that again so without saying the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.179 
go that again so without saying the
notation<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.119> don't<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.320> use<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.829> word<00:01:43.950> for

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
notation I don't really use for word for

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.249 
notation I don't really use for word for
notation<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.939> it's<00:01:45.090> probably<00:01:45.479> wrong<00:01:45.869> but

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
notation so it's probably wrong but

00:01:46.259 --> 00:02:01.590 
notation so it's probably wrong but
don't<00:01:46.770> listen<00:01:47.070> feed<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:48.110> with<00:01:49.110> that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:17.030 

and<00:02:02.230> there<00:02:02.620> you<00:02:02.710> have<00:02:02.740> it<00:02:02.940> so<00:02:04.200> one<00:02:05.200> more<00:02:05.409> time

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.870 

okay<00:02:18.070> this<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.180> last<00:02:20.610> parody<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.760> will

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
okay this is the last parody you will

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.820 
okay this is the last parody you will
get<00:02:22.060> it's<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.810> oil

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
get it's the oil

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.900 
get it's the oil
I<00:02:23.860> believe<00:02:25.800> it's<00:02:26.800> where<00:02:27.040> your<00:02:27.190> last<00:02:27.430> ad<00:02:27.670> right

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
I believe it's where your last ad right

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.840 
I believe it's where your last ad right
here<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.330> swapped<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.860> you'll<00:02:30.520> notice<00:02:30.730> that

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
here is swapped so you'll notice that

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.710 
here is swapped so you'll notice that
when<00:02:31.060> you're<00:02:31.209> doing<00:02:31.300> your<00:02:31.450> top<00:02:31.810> or<00:02:32.410> just<00:02:33.100> Olo

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
when you're doing your top or just Olo

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.350 
when you're doing your top or just Olo
that<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:34.930> slop<00:02:35.770> so<00:02:36.040> just<00:02:36.280> pretend<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:37.030> it's

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
that it's slop so just pretend that it's

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.330 
that it's slop so just pretend that it's
right<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:38.170> all<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.500> rest<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.739> cube<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.220> then

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
right it's all the rest a cube and then

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.490 
right it's all the rest a cube and then
when<00:02:39.700> you're<00:02:39.880> done<00:02:40.060> you'll<00:02:40.300> get<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.630> then

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
when you're done you'll get this then

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.140 
when you're done you'll get this then
you<00:02:43.050> repeat<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.290> rest<00:02:44.500> or<00:02:44.920> do<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.340> outcome<00:02:45.970> so

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
you repeat the rest or do the outcome so

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.050 
you repeat the rest or do the outcome so
you<00:02:46.270> do<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.800> small<00:02:47.800> r2<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.780> then<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:49.930> do<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.080> B<00:02:50.440> to

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
you do a small r2 and then you do a B to

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:01.500 
you do a small r2 and then you do a B to
you<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.890> small<00:02:53.890> L<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:57.330> small<00:02:58.330> R<00:02:58.600> prime<00:03:00.510> you

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:10.650 
you to small L you to small R prime you

just<00:03:22.630> going<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.810> say<00:03:23.049> now<00:03:24.040> that<00:03:24.070> all<00:03:24.820> the

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
just going to say now that all the

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.240 
just going to say now that all the
parodies<00:03:25.630> will<00:03:25.870> bir<00:03:26.230> like<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.769> algorithms

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
parodies will bir like the algorithms

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.210 
parodies will bir like the algorithms
will<00:03:28.090> be<00:03:28.269> in<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.540> description<00:03:29.110> so<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.070> can

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
will be in the description so you can

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.610 
will be in the description so you can
write<00:03:30.519> them<00:03:30.670> down<00:03:30.880> on<00:03:31.299> piece<00:03:31.930> of<00:03:31.959> paper<00:03:32.140> and

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
write them down on piece of paper and

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.069 
write them down on piece of paper and
take<00:03:32.799> them<00:03:33.040> wherever<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.760> go<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.420> memorize

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
take them wherever you go and memorize

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:41.720 
take them wherever you go and memorize
them<00:03:35.290> that's<00:03:35.590> what<00:03:35.769> I<00:03:35.829> do<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.900> yeah<00:03:39.900> anyways

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
them that's what I do and yeah anyways
