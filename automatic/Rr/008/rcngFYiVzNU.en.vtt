chicken but that was some bacon added
and<00:00:51.670> according<00:00:52.670> to<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:52.850> commercial<00:00:53.210> if<00:00:53.300> you

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
and according to the commercial if you

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.970 
and according to the commercial if you
haven't<00:00:53.660> seen<00:00:53.780> them<00:00:53.929> we<00:00:54.379> say<00:00:54.530> bacon<00:00:54.710> makes

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
haven't seen them we say bacon makes

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.380 
haven't seen them we say bacon makes
everything<00:00:55.100> better<00:00:55.370> it's<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.000> same<00:00:56.359> old

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
everything better it's the same old

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.389 
everything better it's the same old
stuff<00:00:56.960> that<00:00:57.019> they<00:00:57.230> always<00:00:57.469> have<00:00:57.649> now<00:00:58.219> with

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
stuff that they always have now with

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.610 
stuff that they always have now with
bacon<00:00:58.780> so<00:00:59.780> I<00:00:59.839> guess<00:00:59.899> we'll<00:01:00.170> just<00:01:00.230> go<00:01:00.440> ahead<00:01:00.530> and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
bacon so I guess we'll just go ahead and

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.509 
bacon so I guess we'll just go ahead and
check<00:01:00.920> it<00:01:01.100> out<00:01:01.250> see<00:01:02.239> how<00:01:02.269> it<00:01:02.449> tastes<00:01:03.309> what's<00:01:04.309> up

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.120 
wrong though i absolutely love bacon but
this<00:01:41.479> i'm<00:01:42.079> not<00:01:42.200> really<00:01:42.350> considering<00:01:42.799> it<00:01:42.950> big

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
this i'm not really considering it big

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.859 
this i'm not really considering it big
and<00:01:43.280> it's<00:01:43.430> kind<00:01:43.610> of<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:43.909> convincing<00:01:44.479> it's<00:01:44.689> just

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
and it's kind of a convincing it's just

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.810 
and it's kind of a convincing it's just
a<00:01:44.990> little<00:01:45.140> bit<00:01:45.350> over<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:46.130> top<00:01:46.369> with<00:01:46.700> the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
a little bit over the top with the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.569 
a little bit over the top with the
saltiness<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:48.189> just<00:01:49.189> with<00:01:49.280> all<00:01:49.399> these<00:01:49.520> other

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
saltiness and just with all these other

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.069 
saltiness and just with all these other
flavors<00:01:50.090> i'm<00:01:50.210> not<00:01:50.390> really<00:01:50.540> digging<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:50.930> too

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
flavors i'm not really digging it too

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.319 
flavors i'm not really digging it too

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
bacon on top of it and call it a whole

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.510 
bacon on top of it and call it a whole
new<00:01:56.990> product<00:01:57.409> it's<00:01:57.860> really<00:01:58.039> not<00:01:58.280> all<00:01:58.340> that

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
new product it's really not all that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.999 
new product it's really not all that
great<00:02:00.009> but<00:02:01.009> for<00:02:01.340> only<00:02:01.369> 399<00:02:02.030> in<00:02:02.450> most<00:02:02.600> places

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
great but for only 399 in most places

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.020 
great but for only 399 in most places
it's<00:02:04.009> great<00:02:04.250> bang<00:02:04.460> for<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.700> buck<00:02:04.729> because

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
it's great bang for the buck because

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.880 
it's great bang for the buck because
this<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.420> very<00:02:05.689> hefty<00:02:05.930> and<00:02:06.350> there's<00:02:06.590> quite<00:02:06.859> a

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
this is very hefty and there's quite a

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.940 
this is very hefty and there's quite a
bit<00:02:06.979> going<00:02:07.369> on<00:02:07.490> in<00:02:07.640> here<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.750> for<00:02:08.930> 399<00:02:09.350> it's<00:02:09.740> not

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
bit going on in here so for 399 it's not

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.310 
bit going on in here so for 399 it's not
that<00:02:10.130> bad<00:02:10.280> but<00:02:10.940> taste-wise<00:02:11.420> i<00:02:11.780> mean<00:02:11.930> i<00:02:12.080> would

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
that bad but taste-wise i mean i would

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.720 
that bad but taste-wise i mean i would
just<00:02:12.500> probably<00:02:12.590> get<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.040> regular<00:02:13.400> famous

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
just probably get in the regular famous

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.100 
just probably get in the regular famous
bowl<00:02:13.880> because<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.270> bacon<00:02:14.600> really<00:02:14.840> isn't

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
bowl because that bacon really isn't

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.890 
bowl because that bacon really isn't
doing<00:02:15.320> too<00:02:15.350> much<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:16.580> took<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.180> bite<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.480> nothing

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
doing too much I took a bite of nothing

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.059 
doing too much I took a bite of nothing
but<00:02:18.050> bacon<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.769> was<00:02:18.890> kind<00:02:19.099> of<00:02:19.190> just

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
but bacon and it was kind of just

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.369
