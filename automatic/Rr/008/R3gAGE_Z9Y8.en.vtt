00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 conventional bicycle everything is 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.690
 used only a small 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.580
 equipment makes all the difference 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.309
 marches that were exchanged 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.559
 manual pedal mode now 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.650
 transformed into a mechanism that generates 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.660
 force and boosts the electric bicycle 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.090
 the first studies began ten 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.119
 years by goiano marcos de souza o 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.039
 basic design can always be adapted 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.230
 consumer-style 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.510
 this for example has a sound that does not 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.969
 we found so easy our 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.890
 bicycle carries up to 120 kg in 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.540
 secrets with high performance according to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.390
 people see the need as 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.649
 market charges us different products 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.399
 we can meet your 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.070
 needs 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.500
 electric bikes have speed 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.219
 which can reach 100 kilometers per 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.590
 hour 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.199
 or delivery of canteens julio cesar de 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.199
 lima leverages the ease and does not lose 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.210
 weather on the streets of the sector pedro ludovico 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.910
 the advantage is that in delivering a motorcycle 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.859
 gasoline or fine or in the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.199
 bike is not just back in the energy 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.189
 load make the delivery of bonuses in the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.140
 Speed â€‹â€‹is not 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.450
 another that makes the most of 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.880
 electric bicycle the counter jonata 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.250
 enes that a year and a half ago became an adept 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.100
 of the means of transportation the cost benefit is 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.549
 very good because it 's a great 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.170
 transport 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.810
 I thought a lot about the convenience of 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.939
 locomotion work home consumption of 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.159
 energy per kilometer is less than 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.829
 a penny when you see a coin 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.869
 25 cents for example she 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.450
 represents 25 kilometers in one 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.310
 electric bicycle at the end of the month 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.430
 usually our average customer it 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.770
 has an impact of 3 to 4 reais of energy 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.259
 month, that person left a 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.570
 car in the garage that would cost at least 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.610
 two hundred or three hundred reais in gasoline 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.860
 The electric bicycle engine comes from 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.549
 Germany and the rest is set up here in 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.619
 capital 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.630
 Ninety percent of sales are for 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.700
 internet for all Brazil and some 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.790
 countries of Latin America and 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.520
 commercialization grows by around 30% 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.069
 I'm a little clumsy year old 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.750
 I had to try it and I saw that it is well 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.750
 easy to handle the danadinha
