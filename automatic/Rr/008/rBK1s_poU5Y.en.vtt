00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.469
 improvements made by fifa 15 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.269
 this year our slogan is feed the 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.409
 game we have improved a lot 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.030
 what is related to emotions 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.559
 that we want to feel 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.089
 players the passion of sport the atmosphere 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.159
 of the stadium and the fast food reacts the 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.170
 public the state of mind of the players and the 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.550
 how they impact the party itself 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.150
 even found in the lyrics of 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.260
 comment 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.060
 we used a new 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.040
 technology called physics in lÃ¼beck 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.000
 band the ring just look at the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.660
 game to realize the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.310
 improvements 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.080
 he even had difficulty doing the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.100
 difference with the reality of 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.630
 players' shoes leave 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.680
 traces that the lawn is deteriorating at 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.330
 as the game progresses 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.500
 the brightness and rendering of physics 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.810
 have helped improve with for example 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.670
 the movements of the corner posts or 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.930
 still the deformation of the nets is 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.280
 the whole this motion details that 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.690
 allow to make the game for if 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.730
 visually impressive in terms 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.350
 of gameplay finally the agility the control 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.180
 have been improved for the game to be 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.560
 more reactive it becomes possible to 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.570
 do what you want and when you 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.530
 the new dribbling system 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.090
 His wife 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.290
 new animation and intelligence 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.610
 artificial gives more 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.630
 the impression of playing against another 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.200
 to be human rather than against a 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.729
 computer 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.500
 in the end the result is a game 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.270
 visually very immersive and a lot 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.040
 more fun to play this is center the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.750
 console or another that's what we 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.850
 allows to propose a visual rendering also 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.140
 impressed did you feel a gap 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.940
 important between the old and the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.690
 new generation of consoles for the 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.009
 game development yes there is a 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.390
 big difference in terms of shares must 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.009
 the possibilities for are now 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.360
 open are huge the challenge of 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.980
 work on the first year of a 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.180
 new generation of consoles this is 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.660
 get to be able to operate 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.190
 correctly 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.840
 that's why I'm proud of what 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.160
 we managed with 6 to 14 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.870
 because not only does the game work and 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.700
 if we had also improved 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.200
 graphics and the gameplay was not a 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.239
 simple port of the paper version 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.590
 this year we start to really 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.209
 understand consoles and fired 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.620
 a lot of power that you confirm 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.300
 that there will be a version of fifa 15 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.250
 on older generation consoles 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.780
 and yes absolutely in son each go out 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.610
 be multiple console 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.110
 we talk a lot about ps versions 4x 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.760
 paulson and try but there is also 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.350
 a lot of work devoted to games 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.069
 on the other consoles in the months to 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.269
 come 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.800
 we will unveil the novelties that are 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.030
 planned for the previous generation 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.470
 people might think it's 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.450
 always the same thing but in reality 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.680
 every year it's different that it will be 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.060
 me or the team we have the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.170
 pressure and ambition for that 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.579
 we do we are never 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.140
 satisfied that a move bring of 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.500
 big news make a good game 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.060
 better 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.230
 never miss ideas on what 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.030
 we want and serve without speaking about 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.410
 returns from the community I love this 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.940
 that I do I love coming to do 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.530
 lectures see a partridge with his 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.820
 son we friends who play together 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.320
 these moments are really a source of 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.459
 satisfaction for me we do that 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.989
 for millions of people around the world 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.190
 it's true we do not know lives 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.930
 but the entertainment is the people and 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.730
 I love it maybe it's a question 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.410
 a little vicious but how 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.640
 can fifa attract people who do not 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.870
 are not football fans 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.040
 it's an interesting question and I 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.109
 believe that the game has this ability 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.849
 last year with fees 14 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.109
 we had the highest rated game at the 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.180
 launch of the new generation and 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.930
 consoles so quite a lot of players 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.430
 wanted to try it 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.560
 we had access to results 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.299
 of study and the practice of football 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.620
 develops in the united states thanks to fifa 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.209
 contrary to what one might think 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.950
 so there are people who start with 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.750
 fifa and who are then interested in 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.099
 football is really great to know 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.659
 that such a thing can happen 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.310
 the question is that of 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.900
 the accessibility of the game for those who do not 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.790
 do not know him and those who do not 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.019
 not interested in football I think 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.639
 that this point of view we can still 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.780
 we improve every year me management 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.340
 to make sure that they are not 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.079
 as difficult to get into the game 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.549
 then there are not yet but they 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.870
 benefit from seeing people who service 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.419
 playing together to tell each other is and 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.629
 why not me in your opinion who will 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:11.859
 win the world cup that's 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:13.780
 Argentina I am convinced I am 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.519
 Argentinean and I am sure that Argentina 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.150
 will win in the final against Brazil 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.150
 there is no 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.580
 no 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.600
 the
