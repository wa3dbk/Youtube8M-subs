00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.060
 to recreate part of the winged days 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.330
 hoping to quickly find 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.330
 diamond 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.910
 to undermine you for hours without ever 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.680
 nothing found dead and dozens of 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.629
 cross we would not have this precious 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.910
 Orb and look no further to him all 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.140
 the world its fiefs 3 and today we 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.180
 is found in the video point of view this 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.280
 time here a tutorial videos on 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.900
 minecraft is today I'm going to you 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.680
 give some quick tips for 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.019
 recover diamond quickly so in 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.360
 average five minutes 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.820
 so for us a two sizes I 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.579
 realized this part to test my 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.329
 technical and on these seven parties there are 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.030
 only two in which I have 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.250
 failed to go below 5 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.310
 minutes which is pretty good 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.259
 and here we are, I offer you everything 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.470
 to go ahead as soon as you can 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.410
 to be something rather complete 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.850
 so right now 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.899
 so we will immediately recreate a 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.180
 part then we will call it in very 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.460
 beautiful final I want diamond I'll 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.840
 just show you there is no site 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.610
 so I do not want to know where 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.170
 is the diamond at the base of the map 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.150
 who still does not have 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.320
 have cheating then it's all 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.079
 it will be a place to propose a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.670
 tutorial that does not work after five 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.229
 minutes as I said maybe a 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.960
 little earlier this is an order of 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.549
 size that is to say that 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.329
 it can be two three to ten so the 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.030
 first thing to do is to 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.850
 recover six of guan ie 1 average 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.979
 trees with its 6 of two boards of 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.899
 forgiveness wood logs you wrote a 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.980
 crafting table and that you're going 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:09.970
 pose and to create a pick in 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:13.590
 here is the nozzle after you go dug 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.260
 in the ground to recover stone 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:24.000
 which will enable us in the future 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.000
 eminent to achieve a pickaxe in common 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.230
 once you have 3 google like 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.739
 I said earlier you do your 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.520
 pick and we'll start to lead 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:48.780
 the bottom by pressing the key 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.600
 f3 so why f3 because he's going 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.459
 we need indications of height 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.120
 so there is going to be a menu maybe 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.010
 incomprehensible to you and in fact one 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.470
 has three positions that interests us 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.450
 this is the xy and z and more precisely the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.950
 garrec the greek is the depth to 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.739
 which you are 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.489
 the diamond spawn between layer 0 so 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.080
 y 0 and y twelve the lava lakes get 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.670
 usually form then I have not 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.069
 been checked but that's what I saw 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.470
 this weekend his 50 years it seems to me and 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.549
 so this lava lakes is forming at the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.690
 layer 10 so that with this 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:32.130
 position y 10 with it will have to go 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.630
 we are going to have more easily 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.250
 middle ie that with 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.780
 from the avs will be a little bit less in 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.930
 your restaurant still dangerous to 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.450
 fear then if you find iron 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.190
 take 3 more if it's really 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.790
 cup of doing but I took it 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.310
 four because I made a small fail 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.290
 which you just do to 3 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.750
 do our our teacher who will serve 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.939
 to recover the diamond given 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.549
 that it is possible to recover from 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:01.400
 diamond with a cobol pickaxe which 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.400
 makes it more is more convenient 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.590
 of recovery to do it before we will have to 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.480
 go to lyon look where he is 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.150
 so here I found lava that says 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.790
 the vdi ores and that says ore in 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.609
 below the 12-10 diamond layer and 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.870
 here we have our diamond so that's it 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.810
 will take more or less time before 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.479
 find the cave but it will always be 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.190
 like the methodology will always be the 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.750
 even 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.639
 so we will immediately go crazy 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.250
 with our crafting table 'we had 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:35.349
 in our inventory to do what 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.349
 to do and after them 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.600
 once your three iron are cooked 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.220
 you just have to pick a pickaxe 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.030
 in iron then she is harvested your 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.760
 your precious minerals 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.010
 so I forgot to specify messi or 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.210
 other pice cobol sus because you 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.950
 put a little more tents in 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.420
 this video do not hesitate to redo you 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.240
 ask your table of Christians and then 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:16.320
 emission this is the final time and of 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.730
 pebbles of 52 and 20 hundredths francis 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.990
 this is the first take to do are 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.550
 rather without counting the servants here 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.300
 these two stitches I hope he 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.370
 you will have liked 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.990
 in any case I take pleasure in the 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.890
 to do it's a little bit of a brake 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.390
 but it's not too serious 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.220
 and he endeared video you can 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.140
 watch my last video it's a 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.760
 video presentation of the channel on 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.630
 modern warfare 3 you can also watch 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.670
 the bonus videos 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.290
 you can chain your moan and my track 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.220
 on twitter and I think it's pretty much 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:46.650
 close everything so I tell you see you soon 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.080
 and parents find you very quickly 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:54.920
 yes I know I'm passing you from your voices 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.920
 mans to tu and well it
