whole year that first year studying for
them<00:00:36.239> cat<00:00:37.610> took<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> prep<00:00:38.940> course<00:00:39.239> which<00:00:39.840> I

them cat took a prep course which I
thought<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.379> very<00:00:40.469> helpful<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.570> and<00:00:42.570> I

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109 
thought was very helpful and and I

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.139 
thought was very helpful and and I
ultimately<00:00:43.679> ended<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.129> not<00:00:44.339> doing<00:00:44.609> as<00:00:44.879> well<00:00:44.909> as

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
ultimately ended up not doing as well as

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.950 
ultimately ended up not doing as well as
I<00:00:45.300> had<00:00:45.420> hoped<00:00:45.679> and<00:00:46.789> so<00:00:47.789> at<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.659> end<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
I had hoped and so at the end of that

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.979 
I had hoped and so at the end of that
first<00:00:49.199> year<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.010> working<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.670> lab<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.269> was

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
first year of working in the lab I was

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.969 
first year of working in the lab I was
very<00:00:52.230> nervous<00:00:52.409> because<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.010> wanted<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.909> go<00:00:54.089> to

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
very nervous because I wanted to go to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.349 
very nervous because I wanted to go to
the<00:00:55.979> medical<00:00:56.399> school<00:00:56.699> where<00:00:56.999> I<00:00:57.030> get<00:00:57.239> my

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
the medical school where I get my

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.529 
the medical school where I get my
undergrad<00:00:57.749> at<00:00:57.989> UNC<00:00:58.499> and<00:00:58.769> I<00:00:59.729> was<00:01:00.030> not<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.269> stay

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
undergrad at UNC and I was not a stay

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.270 
undergrad at UNC and I was not a stay
student<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.319> so<00:01:02.269> I<00:01:03.589> knew<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:04.739> chances<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
student and so I knew my chances of

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.000 
student and so I knew my chances of
getting<00:01:05.580> into<00:01:05.940> them<00:01:06.060> at<00:01:06.210> uncle's<00:01:06.510> school<00:01:06.780> were

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
getting into them at uncle's school were

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.789 
getting into them at uncle's school were
much<00:01:08.010> less<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.820> an<00:01:08.940> out-of-state<00:01:09.360> student

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
much less as an out-of-state student

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.050 
much less as an out-of-state student
versus<00:01:10.799> NSA<00:01:11.190> students<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.470> remember<00:01:13.470> being

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
versus NSA students so I remember being

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.690
