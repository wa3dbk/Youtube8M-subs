is on offensive timing now offensive

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.110 
is on offensive timing now offensive
timing<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.679> very<00:00:14.040> very<00:00:14.280> important<00:00:14.849> skill

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
timing is a very very important skill

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.450 
timing is a very very important skill
for<00:00:15.150> all<00:00:15.420> players<00:00:15.900> because<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.830> allows<00:00:17.100> you

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
for all players because it allows you

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.490 
for all players because it allows you
the<00:00:17.490> opportunity<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.449> get<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.840> puck<00:00:19.050> more

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
the opportunity to get the puck more

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.160 
the opportunity to get the puck more
often<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.250> allows<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.390> get<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.660> puck<00:00:21.990> in

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
often and allows you to get the puck in

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.109 
often and allows you to get the puck in
better<00:00:22.439> spots<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.490> can<00:00:23.670> make<00:00:23.880> more

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
better spots so that you can make more

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.269 
better spots so that you can make more
plays<00:00:24.480> now<00:00:25.199> there's<00:00:25.350> three<00:00:25.650> elements<00:00:25.800> that

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
plays now there's three elements that

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.250 
plays now there's three elements that
are<00:00:26.400> important<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.090> offensive<00:00:27.689> timing

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
are important in offensive timing

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.310 
are important in offensive timing
you<00:00:28.410> got<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.650> arrive<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> right<00:00:29.970> place<00:00:30.390> at

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
you got to arrive to the right place at

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.500 
you got to arrive to the right place at
the<00:00:31.410> right<00:00:31.529> time<00:00:31.759> with<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.790> right<00:00:32.940> amount<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the right time with the right amount of

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.700 
the right time with the right amount of
speed<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.020> those<00:00:34.200> are<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> three<00:00:34.590> elements

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
speed so those are the three elements

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.400 
speed so those are the three elements
place<00:00:35.280> time<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.390> speed<00:00:36.690> if<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.110> any

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
place time with speed if you have any

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.650 
place time with speed if you have any
one<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.710> those<00:00:37.800> three<00:00:38.190> elements<00:00:38.340> missing<00:00:38.879> then

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
one of those three elements missing then

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.170 
one of those three elements missing then
you<00:00:39.780> don't<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.140> good<00:00:40.559> offensive<00:00:41.160> timing<00:00:41.610> so

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
you don't have good offensive timing so

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.080 
you don't have good offensive timing so
it's<00:00:42.629> always<00:00:43.260> better<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> little<00:00:44.910> bit

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
it's always better to be a little bit

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.110 
it's always better to be a little bit
late<00:00:45.450> than<00:00:45.960> too<00:00:46.260> early<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:47.039> your<00:00:47.219> timing<00:00:47.550> if

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
late than too early with your timing if

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.700 
late than too early with your timing if
you<00:00:48.270> get<00:00:48.450> there<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> little<00:00:48.989> bit<00:00:49.140> later<00:00:49.410> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
you get there a little bit later you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.170 
you get there a little bit later you
realize<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.460> you're<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> little<00:00:50.789> bit<00:00:51.000> late

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
realize that you're a little bit late

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.060 
realize that you're a little bit late
your<00:00:51.420> time<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.840> always<00:00:52.110> make<00:00:52.559> up<00:00:52.800> time

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
your time you can always make up time

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.029 
your time you can always make up time
with<00:00:53.129> by<00:00:53.910> by<00:00:54.329> accelerating<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:55.620> once

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
with by by accelerating but if once

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.069 
with by by accelerating but if once
you're<00:00:56.190> there<00:00:56.340> too<00:00:56.579> early<00:00:56.640> now<00:00:57.570> you're<00:00:57.809> stuck

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
you're there too early now you're stuck

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.299

opportunity than to make more place so

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.200 
opportunity than to make more place so
it's<00:01:04.949> always<00:01:05.400> better<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> little<00:01:06.090> bit

this<00:01:43.649> way<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.399> don't<00:01:44.549> want<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.790> turn<00:01:45.030> here

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
this way you don't want to turn here

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.910 
this way you don't want to turn here
because<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.140> you're<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.680> by<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
because now you're going to be by the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.130 
because now you're going to be by the
time<00:01:46.979> he<00:01:47.340> gets<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.700> puck<00:01:47.880> when<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
time he gets the puck when you get the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.749 
time he gets the puck when you get the
pass<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:49.649> you're<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.520> too<00:01:50.700> early

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
pass here you're going to be too early

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.210 
pass here you're going to be too early
and<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.229> happens<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:52.920> you're<00:01:53.100> going

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
and so what happens is now you're going

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.010 
and so what happens is now you're going
to<00:01:53.280> get<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> puck<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.240> too<00:01:54.509> late<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
to get the puck here it's too late and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.990 
to get the puck here it's too late and
you're<00:01:55.590> going<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.920> slowed<00:01:56.219> down<00:01:56.520> by<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
you're going to be slowed down by the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.520 
you're going to be slowed down by the
time<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.390> get<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.659> puck<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.380> have

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
time you get the puck and you have

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.100 
time you get the puck and you have
nowhere<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.950> ski<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.340> into<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.240> by<00:02:00.390> taking<00:02:00.689> back

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
nowhere to ski it into so by taking back

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.709 
nowhere to ski it into so by taking back
the<00:02:01.320> ice<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:02.130> now<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.520> an<00:02:02.670> opportunity<00:02:03.540> now

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the ice you now have an opportunity now

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.899 
the ice you now have an opportunity now
to<00:02:03.780> accelerate<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.950> plane<00:02:05.250> now<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
to accelerate on this plane now the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.609 
to accelerate on this plane now the
other<00:02:06.299> advantage<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.930> being<00:02:07.200> able<00:02:07.380> to

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
other advantage of being able to

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.559 
other advantage of being able to
accelerate<00:02:07.979> on<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.520> particular<00:02:08.879> plane<00:02:09.330> is

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
accelerate on that particular plane is

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.830 
accelerate on that particular plane is
now<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.259> give<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.860> puck<00:02:11.190> carrier<00:02:11.840> multiple

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
now you give this puck carrier multiple

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.680 
now you give this puck carrier multiple
opportunity

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
opportunity

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.390 
opportunity
to<00:02:13.870> get<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.350> puck<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:14.830> he<00:02:15.010> could<00:02:15.160> give<00:02:15.310> you

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
to get you the puck so he could give you

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.460 
to get you the puck so he could give you
the<00:02:15.520> puck<00:02:15.760> really<00:02:16.180> at<00:02:16.270> any<00:02:16.480> point<00:02:16.900> during<00:02:17.200> this

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
the puck really at any point during this

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.060 
the puck really at any point during this
particular<00:02:18.120> route<00:02:19.120> when<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:19.840> go<00:02:19.990> this<00:02:20.290> way<00:02:20.560> he

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
particular route when you go this way he

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.860 
particular route when you go this way he
only<00:02:21.310> has<00:02:21.430> one<00:02:21.460> crack<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.270> give<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.660> puck

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
only has one crack to give you the puck

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.720 
only has one crack to give you the puck
what<00:02:23.410> if<00:02:23.500> he<00:02:23.560> misses<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.130> on<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.460> time

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
what if he misses you on that time

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.940 
what if he misses you on that time
you're<00:02:25.270> not<00:02:25.450> going<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.750> get<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.050> so<00:02:26.230> that's<00:02:26.680> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
you're not going to get it so that's the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.650 
you're not going to get it so that's the
idea<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.310> control<00:02:27.790> skating<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.390> what<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.630> use

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
idea of control skating and what you use

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.310 
idea of control skating and what you use
is<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.230> use<00:02:29.410> dips<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:30.160> taking<00:02:31.030> back<00:02:31.210> ice<00:02:31.540> in

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
is you use dips and taking back ice in

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.140 
is you use dips and taking back ice in
order<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.680> control<00:02:33.250> your<00:02:33.550> skating<00:02:33.910> and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
order to control your skating and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.360 
order to control your skating and
control<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.630> space<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.380> use<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:36.130> order

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
control the space that you use in order

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.250 
control the space that you use in order
to<00:02:36.610> get<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.910> puck<00:02:37.120> now<00:02:37.690> let's<00:02:37.840> take<00:02:38.020> a<00:02:38.050> look

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
to get the puck now let's take a look

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.130 
to get the puck now let's take a look
maybe<00:02:38.500> at<00:02:38.710> the<00:02:38.830> other<00:02:38.980> side<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:43.810> you're<00:02:44.110> a

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
maybe at the other side if you're a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.350 
maybe at the other side if you're a
winger<00:02:44.530> let's<00:02:45.520> say<00:02:45.670> you're<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.970> weakside

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
winger let's say you're the weakside

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.870 
winger let's say you're the weakside
winger<00:02:46.720> here<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.860> weakside<00:02:48.250> winger<00:02:48.610> here

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
winger here and the weakside winger here

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.690 
winger here and the weakside winger here
is<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.210> in<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:49.990> middle<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.410> ice<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.920> they

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
is is in the middle of the ice and they

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.730 
is is in the middle of the ice and they
got<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.970> winger<00:02:52.240> here<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.840> now<00:02:53.020> again<00:02:53.170> he

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
got the winger here and now again he

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.110 
got the winger here and now again he
gets<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.100> pocket<00:02:54.520> now<00:02:54.610> you're<00:02:54.820> trying<00:02:55.090> to

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
gets the pocket now you're trying to

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.660 
gets the pocket now you're trying to
provide<00:02:55.480> some<00:02:56.140> offensive<00:02:56.860> support<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.520> this

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
provide some offensive support to this

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.910 
provide some offensive support to this
particular<00:02:58.030> player<00:02:58.510> now<00:02:59.380> most<00:02:59.650> players

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
particular player now most players

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.800 
particular player now most players
they're<00:03:00.640> gonna<00:03:00.760> come<00:03:01.060> right<00:03:01.240> through<00:03:01.510> here

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
they're gonna come right through here

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.230 
they're gonna come right through here
like<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.740> again<00:03:02.830> if<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.550> run<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:04.030> risk

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
like this and again if you run the risk

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.410 
like this and again if you run the risk
here<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.960> one<00:03:05.380> getting<00:03:06.340> there<00:03:06.460> too<00:03:06.730> early<00:03:06.760> and

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
here of one getting there too early and

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.500 
here of one getting there too early and
to<00:03:07.990> one<00:03:08.800> if<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.220> do<00:03:09.430> get<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.850> puck<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.330> got

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
to one if you do get the puck you got

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.410 
to one if you do get the puck you got
nowhere<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:11.020> ski<00:03:11.410> into<00:03:11.710> and<00:03:12.310> that<00:03:12.640> may<00:03:12.880> be<00:03:12.940> a

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
nowhere to ski into and that may be a

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.960 
nowhere to ski into and that may be a
bigger<00:03:13.780> problem<00:03:14.050> then<00:03:14.830> just<00:03:15.190> only<00:03:15.460> given<00:03:15.880> the

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
bigger problem then just only given the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.670 
bigger problem then just only given the
guy<00:03:16.090> one<00:03:16.360> opportunity<00:03:16.990> to<00:03:17.050> get<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.470> puck

guy one opportunity to get you the puck

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.040 
guy one opportunity to get you the puck
it's<00:03:18.220> not<00:03:18.400> enough<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.910> get<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.239> puck<00:03:19.450> it's

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
it's not enough to get the puck it's

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.290 
it's not enough to get the puck it's
what<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.680> can<00:03:20.860> do<00:03:21.040> once<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.550> get<00:03:21.820> it<00:03:22.000> that's

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
what you can do once you get it that's

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.380 
what you can do once you get it that's
what<00:03:22.660> defines<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:23.320> as<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.530> player<00:03:23.890> so<00:03:24.360> what<00:03:25.360> I

want you to do is in order to get
improve<00:03:28.060> your<00:03:28.239> timing<00:03:28.690> is<00:03:28.810> if<00:03:29.020> you<00:03:29.230> read<00:03:29.530> that

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
improve your timing is if you read that

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.110 
improve your timing is if you read that
the<00:03:29.830> play<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:30.070> coming<00:03:30.489> this<00:03:30.610> way<00:03:30.820> you're<00:03:31.030> going

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
the play is coming this way you're going

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.900 
the play is coming this way you're going
to<00:03:31.209> take<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:31.420> step<00:03:31.780> this<00:03:32.560> way<00:03:32.800> take<00:03:33.580> a<00:03:33.610> step<00:03:33.880> away

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
to take a step this way take a step away

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.970 
to take a step this way take a step away
from<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.540> puck<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.959> then<00:03:35.590> you're<00:03:35.800> going<00:03:35.920> to

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
from the puck and then you're going to

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.979 
from the puck and then you're going to
come<00:03:36.250> back<00:03:36.489> across<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.000> ice<00:03:37.330> and<00:03:37.630> when<00:03:37.720> you<00:03:37.840> do

come back across the ice and when you do

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.380 
come back across the ice and when you do
that<00:03:38.020> you<00:03:38.410> improve<00:03:38.950> your<00:03:39.130> ability<00:03:39.580> to<00:03:39.730> give

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
that you improve your ability to give

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.410 
that you improve your ability to give
this<00:03:40.630> guy<00:03:41.220> multiple<00:03:42.220> pass<00:03:42.489> options<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:43.239> can

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
this guy multiple pass options you can

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.990 
this guy multiple pass options you can
hit<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.900> multiple<00:03:44.830> times<00:03:44.890> instead<00:03:45.730> of<00:03:45.820> only

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
hit you multiple times instead of only

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.240 
hit you multiple times instead of only
getting<00:03:46.209> one<00:03:46.570> crack<00:03:46.900> once<00:03:47.620> you<00:03:47.769> get<00:03:48.010> it<00:03:48.130> you

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
getting one crack once you get it you

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.130 
getting one crack once you get it you
now<00:03:48.430> have<00:03:48.459> a<00:03:48.700> lot<00:03:48.940> more<00:03:48.970> room<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.450> skate<00:03:49.930> into

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
now have a lot more room to skate into

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.850 
now have a lot more room to skate into
and<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:51.550> have<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.820> great<00:03:52.180> opportunity<00:03:53.019> here<00:03:53.050> to

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
and you have a great opportunity here to

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.680 
and you have a great opportunity here to
build<00:03:54.370> speed<00:03:54.820> because<00:03:55.300> you're<00:03:55.480> putting

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
build speed because you're putting

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.509 
build speed because you're putting
yourself<00:03:56.200> at<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.470> bit<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.830> disadvantage<00:03:57.220> you

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
yourself at a bit of a disadvantage you

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.970 
yourself at a bit of a disadvantage you
go<00:03:57.940> away<00:03:58.239> from<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.540> puck<00:03:58.750> first<00:03:59.050> so<00:03:59.769> now<00:03:59.920> you

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
go away from the puck first so now you

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.190 
go away from the puck first so now you
feel<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.580> pressure<00:04:00.820> to<00:04:01.150> accelerate<00:04:01.720> back<00:04:01.959> to

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
feel the pressure to accelerate back to

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.830 
feel the pressure to accelerate back to
the<00:04:02.290> play<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.830> that's<00:04:03.250> what's<00:04:03.580> important<00:04:04.120> one

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
the play and that's what's important one

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.660 
the play and that's what's important one
of<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.959> biggest<00:04:05.290> elements<00:04:05.440> of<00:04:06.010> offensive

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
of the biggest elements of offensive

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.640 
of the biggest elements of offensive
timing<00:04:07.150> is<00:04:07.300> understanding<00:04:08.200> whether<00:04:08.380> you're

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
timing is understanding whether you're

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.280 
timing is understanding whether you're
the<00:04:08.800> hound<00:04:09.070> or<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:10.090> spider<00:04:10.450> now<00:04:11.230> the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
the hound or the spider now the

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.630 
the hound or the spider now the
difference<00:04:11.739> between<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:12.160> hound<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.519> the

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
difference between the hound and the

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.850 
difference between the hound and the
spider<00:04:12.970> is<00:04:13.180> very<00:04:13.390> significant<00:04:14.230> in<00:04:14.410> how<00:04:14.800> you

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
spider is very significant in how you

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.920 
spider is very significant in how you
would<00:04:15.340> be<00:04:15.519> projected<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.390> play<00:04:16.630> at<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.900> next

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
would be projected to play at the next

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.199 
would be projected to play at the next
level<00:04:17.200> so<00:04:18.130> you're<00:04:18.310> a<00:04:18.340> pretty<00:04:18.519> good<00:04:18.760> player<00:04:19.000> at

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
level so you're a pretty good player at

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.120 
level so you're a pretty good player at
the<00:04:19.330> level<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.750> you're<00:04:19.930> at<00:04:19.989> now<00:04:20.320> but<00:04:20.980> you

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
the level that you're at now but you

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.830 
the level that you're at now but you
tend<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.549> get<00:04:21.789> the<00:04:22.000> puck<00:04:22.240> because<00:04:22.660> you're

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
tend to get the puck because you're

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.730 
tend to get the puck because you're
chasing<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.410> puck<00:04:23.680> down<00:04:23.950> you're<00:04:24.280> winning

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
chasing the puck down you're winning

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.070

to<00:04:25.190> loose<00:04:25.400> pucks<00:04:25.729> you're<00:04:26.330> getting<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.930> because

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
to loose pucks you're getting it because

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.680 
to loose pucks you're getting it because
of<00:04:27.470> your<00:04:27.650> hard<00:04:27.919> work<00:04:27.979> if<00:04:28.759> that's<00:04:29.090> how<00:04:29.389> you're

of your hard work if that's how you're

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.719 
of your hard work if that's how you're
