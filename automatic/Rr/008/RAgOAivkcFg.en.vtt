00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
 no no 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.950
 the bride's toque what she offers is a 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.320
 very wide variety of all 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.180
 add-ons that the 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.700
 Bride without forgetting absolutely nothing 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.580
 I mean we have from the 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.559
 umbrella in case it rains to the bamba or 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.170
 the espadrille for later for the dance 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.840
 and thus passing through all the gloves the 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.610
 tiaras earrings lingerie all 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.559
 type of lingerie for all kinds of 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.320
 necklines of dresses or is absolutely 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.350
 all we try is to have all 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.100
 the products and a very wide range of 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.100
 prices too 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.839
 I think the first one and maybe it's the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.070
 more forgotten because there is not much 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.559
 people and many girls who do not give 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.239
 importance to this lingerie and for me 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.270
 I think it's the first one because it's the base 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.310
 where the dressmaker is going to work the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.290
 dress that is made with which a 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.960
 good lingerie is basic that makes you a 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.149
 good chest that makes you a good and a 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.260
 good figure to be able to model what 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.720
 is the dress then we will go 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.650
 to look at the shoe shoe theme 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.900
 it is also very important 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.970
 It is true that many times in 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.360
 function of what dresses the shoe is 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.910
 can go unnoticed but people 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.800
 is then fixed if the shoe does not go very 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.570
 well coordinated with the dress sometimes 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.840
 that can also be complicated can 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.420
 be a failure then come would come what 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.720
 are the headdresses are worth the headdresses 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.040
 then there is everything from headbands 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.320
 more vintage style more current things 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.570
 feather headdresses flower headdresses 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.240
 strass swarovski headpieces then 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.670
 we would go down we would go to what 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.270
 are the pending pending issues and 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.149
 bracelets and we would finish with the little ones 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.979
 complements that the bride does not wear but 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.140
 yes, they are essential, as they are 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.800
 the baskets as are the arras as they are 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.800
 the cushions
