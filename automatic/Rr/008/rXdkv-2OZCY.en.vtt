00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the horrors of the internet that is an

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.950 
the horrors of the internet that is an
excellent<00:01:17.130> choice<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.880> feel<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.690> that<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.900> an

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
excellent choice I feel like that is an

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.720 
excellent choice I feel like that is an
acceptable<00:01:19.140> replacement<00:01:19.640> for<00:01:20.640> it's

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
acceptable replacement for it's

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.000 
acceptable replacement for it's
typically<00:01:21.060> there<00:01:21.330> yeah<00:01:21.870> so<00:01:22.620> anyway<00:01:22.890> our

that the air dash slide whatever it

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.640 
that the air dash slide whatever it
doesn't<00:03:41.030> really<00:03:41.060> add<00:03:41.389> too<00:03:41.900> much<00:03:42.139> to<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.470> game

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
doesn't really add too much to the game

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.159 
doesn't really add too much to the game
on<00:03:42.889> its<00:03:43.009> own<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.639> mean<00:03:43.790> maked<00:03:44.449> you<00:03:44.689> can<00:03:44.870> traverse

on its own I mean maked you can traverse

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.020 
on its own I mean maked you can traverse
short<00:03:45.859> distances<00:03:46.220> pretty<00:03:46.459> quickly<00:03:46.669> no<00:03:46.879> matter

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
short distances pretty quickly no matter

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.300 
short distances pretty quickly no matter
what<00:03:47.269> your<00:03:47.419> scenario<00:03:47.840> is<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.199> mean<00:03:49.069> you<00:03:49.129> did<00:03:49.280> a

what your scenario is I mean you did a

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.490 
what your scenario is I mean you did a
really<00:03:49.489> short<00:03:49.759> dash<00:03:50.060> just<00:03:50.389> then<00:03:50.599> you<00:03:51.349> can

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
really short dash just then you can

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
but I mean the game really hasn't

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.909 
but I mean the game really hasn't
changed<00:03:55.819> to<00:03:56.509> accommodate<00:03:56.959> board<00:03:57.650> really

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
changed to accommodate board really
