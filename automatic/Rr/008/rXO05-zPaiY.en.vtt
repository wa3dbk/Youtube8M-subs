who<00:00:03.590> here<00:00:03.739> has<00:00:03.770> been<00:00:03.980> in<00:00:04.100> a<00:00:04.160> helo<00:00:04.370> crash<00:00:04.700> before

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:15.110 

hey<00:00:09.059> we're<00:00:09.510> all<00:00:09.660> good

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.780 

well<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.870> stealth<00:00:16.170> helicopters<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.220> created

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 
well the stealth helicopters we created

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.200 
well the stealth helicopters we created
with<00:00:17.970> avionics<00:00:18.870> technical<00:00:19.500> 72nd<00:00:20.280> birthday

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.850 

looks<00:00:24.210> as<00:00:24.480> authentic<00:00:25.050> as<00:00:25.140> possible<00:00:25.170> in

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
looks as authentic as possible in

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.290 
looks as authentic as possible in
Hollywood<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.369> can<00:00:26.490> build<00:00:26.670> anything<00:00:26.910> really

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
Hollywood you can build anything really

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.570 
Hollywood you can build anything really
but<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> biggest<00:00:28.200> challenge<00:00:28.439> was<00:00:28.860> to<00:00:28.980> figure

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
but the biggest challenge was to figure

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.100 
but the biggest challenge was to figure
looked<00:00:29.850> like<00:00:29.940> talk<00:00:30.510> about<00:00:30.539> classified

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
looked like talk about classified

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.720 
looked like talk about classified
information<00:00:31.320> everybody<00:00:32.189> knows<00:00:32.400> that<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
information everybody knows that the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.150 
information everybody knows that the
stuff<00:00:32.940> helicopters<00:00:33.540> exist<00:00:34.260> because<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
stuff helicopters exist because the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.770 
stuff helicopters exist because the
seals<00:00:35.430> left<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.850> chunk<00:00:36.150> of<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> tail<00:00:36.540> line

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
seals left a chunk of the tail line

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.930 
seals left a chunk of the tail line
arguably<00:00:37.650> you<00:00:37.860> could<00:00:37.950> extrapolate<00:00:38.430> from<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
arguably you could extrapolate from the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.030 
arguably you could extrapolate from the
tail<00:00:39.150> section<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.809> was<00:00:40.110> left<00:00:40.559> behind<00:00:40.830> at<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
tail section that was left behind at the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950 
tail section that was left behind at the
compound<00:00:41.489> what<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> rest<00:00:42.150> of<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> helicopter

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
compound what the rest of the helicopter

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.590 
compound what the rest of the helicopter
might<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.800> looked<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.160> using<00:00:44.640> avionics

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
might have looked like using avionics

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.009 
might have looked like using avionics
experts<00:00:46.320> who<00:00:47.010> basically<00:00:47.610> built<00:00:48.239> onto<00:00:48.900> that

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
experts who basically built onto that

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.960 
experts who basically built onto that
tail<00:00:49.350> section<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:50.070> might<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.790> most

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
tail section what might be the most

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.060 
tail section what might be the most
logical<00:00:51.170> conclusion<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> stealth

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
logical conclusion for the stealth

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.880 
logical conclusion for the stealth
helicopter<00:00:53.640> itself

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.170 

the<00:01:01.890> infrastructure<00:01:02.370> happens<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.970> be<00:01:03.060> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the infrastructure happens to be the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.570 
the infrastructure happens to be the
Sikorsky<00:01:03.660> helicopter<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.890> created<00:01:05.340> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
Sikorsky helicopter so we created the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.370 
Sikorsky helicopter so we created the
armature<00:01:06.120> on<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> outside<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.840> was

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
armature on the outside that was

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.890 
armature on the outside that was
designed<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.370> defeat<00:01:08.850> radar<00:01:09.300> people<00:01:09.750> that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
designed to defeat radar people that

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.660 
designed to defeat radar people that
have<00:01:10.050> seen<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.590> helicopter<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.520> have

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
have seen the helicopter that that have

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.250 
have seen the helicopter that that have
also<00:01:11.880> seen<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> stealth<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.900> told<00:01:13.140> me<00:01:13.230> that

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
also seen the stealth and told me that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.080 
also seen the stealth and told me that
we<00:01:13.410> did<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.620> pretty<00:01:14.010> good<00:01:14.160> job<00:01:16.850> ship<00:01:17.850> them<00:01:18.000> in

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
we did a pretty good job ship them in

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.150 
we did a pretty good job ship them in
three<00:01:18.300> pieces<00:01:18.480> the<00:01:18.930> containers<00:01:19.800> they<00:01:19.980> took

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
three pieces the containers they took

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.860 
three pieces the containers they took
forever<00:01:20.460> not<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.120> fun<00:01:21.360> thing<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.600> get<00:01:21.690> your

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
forever not a fun thing to get your

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.400 
forever not a fun thing to get your
customs<00:01:22.260> into<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.120> helicopter<00:01:24.120> stealth<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
customs into the helicopter stealth and

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.950 
customs into the helicopter stealth and
no<00:01:25.530> one's<00:01:25.680> ever<00:01:25.770> seen<00:01:25.980> and<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.660> arrived<00:01:27.660> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
no one's ever seen and they arrived and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
no one's ever seen and they arrived and
we<00:01:28.320> got<00:01:28.470> them<00:01:28.590> debates<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.190> we<00:01:29.400> got<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.640> nuts

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
we got them debates and we got the nuts

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:41.070 
we got them debates and we got the nuts
under<00:01:30.090> two<00:01:30.420> nerd<00:01:30.570> ton<00:01:30.780> crane<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.320> some<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> shot

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.970 

we<00:01:41.680> lock<00:01:41.920> power<00:01:42.820> I<00:01:43.470> couldn't<00:01:44.470> leave<00:01:44.590> that

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
we lock power I couldn't leave that

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.680 
we lock power I couldn't leave that
helicopter<00:01:45.550> in<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.760> hands<00:01:46.060> of<00:01:46.120> the<00:01:46.240> enemy<00:01:46.390> top

46<00:01:47.320> we<00:01:47.560> are<00:01:47.650> demoing<00:01:47.860> 51<00:01:48.580> they<00:01:48.940> put<00:01:49.210> on<00:01:49.300> these

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
46 we are demoing 51 they put on these

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.630 
46 we are demoing 51 they put on these
giant<00:01:49.660> magnesium<00:01:50.290> strips<00:01:50.620> into<00:01:50.890> turning<00:01:51.250> dust

giant magnesium strips into turning dust

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.540 
giant magnesium strips into turning dust
I've<00:01:52.030> never<00:01:52.300> seen<00:01:52.540> so<00:01:52.720> much<00:01:53.040> quickly
