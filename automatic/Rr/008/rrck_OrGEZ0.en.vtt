00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
 In another region of the state in the Midwest, rain 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.269
 harvest of potatoes is still crystal clear the producers are 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.479
 satisfied with the price of potatoes 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:14.999
 is 60% better than last year when I heard an oversupply 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.390
 this line is the largest potato producer in the state 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.810
 given the levels of emotion and area planted in the municipality this Friday near 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.730
 reaches four thousand four hundred and that afternoon only on this property were planted 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.649
 900 here tahrir of the Arabica variety 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.690
 without details unless in 2008 the reduction the fear that the rain 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.530
 development, and it is not that the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.909
 manager of the farm but says the rain has delayed harvesting 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.190
 must end in the first half of November 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.680
 if the rains should donate a little later that ended up slowing down a bit 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.980
 our schedule we should be finishing the harvest until October 30 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.580
 but due to this delay ended up bringing in the 15 days hence the total 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.500
 Bolivians 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.530
 the expectation is to collect 10 thousand tons 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.110
 the harvest on the farm is mechanized and also manuel 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.460
 the tractor passes in the beds and with more loose footprint the potatoes that are still 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.060
 earthbound london after that hands down 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.880
 the best 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.920
 hands on the ground is time for farmers to step in to collect potatoes 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.790
 There are 80 people on account of the work. Dona Zenit is one of them. 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.180
 six thirty in the morning and comes home at five in the afternoon she says she likes 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.110
 of what does 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.180
 per month can be taken up to one thousand eight hundred reais and better still 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.330
 work with a formal contract 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.229
 I think it's great that it's a safe thing. 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.329
 it was not this time the story is made to favor this is the prudent routine 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.690
 world cup, good day 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.960
 It is possible to fill 510 and it is these large bags each have capacity 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.710
 to store 600 kilos of potato all day leaving field 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.140
 trucks that take the tuber directly to the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.140
 processing 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.249
 Alexis potato arrives from the fields are dumped in this box 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.639
 where do they spend the first time earlier 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.639
 on the treadmill nothing more to leave the program 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.719
 it is possible to wash 45 tons per hour 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.860
 right here 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.090
 the potato is selected by size and quality fifty people work 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.090
 in the production line 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.920
 the best potatoes already fall straight into the 50-kilogram bag of steel sew 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.549
 on a treadmill 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.089
 everything is already going to the truck 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:57.310
 and left loaded with three hundred product poster and is sold for all the country 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.290
 the administrative manager account 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.310
 and last year and reached the top of 22 reais 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.429
 you can trade the product for 35 reais 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.109
 Last year was not a good year for potato farming 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.099
 with a large supply of the product and prices fell short of the cost of 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.279
 production of wines 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:19.329
 but all that we have seen so far is produced in very crystalline 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.340
 is to deploy 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.810
 also handles the production of seedlings in the next specialized laboratory 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.319
 farm 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.429
 go to stew where they go through a process of pruning and adaptation to potatoes 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:34.649
 seed that goes into the field is produced here in this protected crop 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:40.279
 The objective is to offer a product with more quality some varieties 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:42.559
 three years to reach the final consumer
