absolutely<00:01:52.389> ages<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:53.109> then<00:01:54.069> you've<00:01:54.189> got<00:01:54.310> the

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
absolutely ages and then you've got the

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.910 
absolutely ages and then you've got the
world<00:01:54.639> cup<00:01:54.850> as<00:01:54.999> well<00:01:55.179> so<00:01:55.959> I'm<00:01:56.469> just<00:01:56.740> trying<00:01:56.889> to

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
world cup as well so I'm just trying to

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.489 
world cup as well so I'm just trying to
say<00:01:57.069> don't<00:01:57.340> don't<00:01:58.149> expect<00:01:58.689> there<00:01:58.899> to<00:01:58.929> be<00:01:59.049> q<00:01:59.380> and

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
say don't don't expect there to be q and

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.230

or martinez or some of the other smaller
sort<00:02:48.920> of<00:02:48.980> players<00:02:49.159> that<00:02:49.280> potentially<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.060> may

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
sort of players that potentially you may

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.369 
sort of players that potentially you may
not<00:02:50.299> have<00:02:50.420> even<00:02:50.510> heard<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:50.989> because<00:02:51.170> there

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
not have even heard of because there

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.830 
not have even heard of because there
will<00:02:51.470> be<00:02:51.620> it's<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.430> mixture<00:02:52.790> of<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.390> know<00:02:53.510> the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
will be it's a mixture of you know the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.910 
will be it's a mixture of you know the
European<00:02:54.319> leagues<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.650> there's<00:02:54.799> also

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
European leagues and there's also

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.890 
European leagues and there's also
arrested<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.549> world<00:02:55.909> one<00:02:56.359> as<00:02:56.510> well<00:02:56.659> I<00:02:56.720> think

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
arrested the world one as well I think

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.009 
arrested the world one as well I think
so<00:02:57.260> hopefully<00:02:58.159> i'll<00:02:58.280> be<00:02:58.310> getting<00:02:59.120> out<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.540> the

so hopefully i'll be getting out the the

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.839 
so hopefully i'll be getting out the the
player<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.230> use<00:03:00.560> left<00:03:00.980> right<00:03:01.159> center<00:03:01.220> but<00:03:01.790> uh
