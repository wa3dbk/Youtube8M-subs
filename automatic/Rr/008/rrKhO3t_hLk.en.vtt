likely<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.250> attack<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.059> following

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
likely to attack you for the following

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.319 
likely to attack you for the following
reasons<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:40.379> their<00:00:40.770> widespread<00:00:41.040> -<00:00:41.940> they're

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
reasons one their widespread - they're

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.479 
reasons one their widespread - they're
large<00:00:42.690> enough<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.110> human<00:00:43.770> beings<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.340> look

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
large enough that human beings can look

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.479 
large enough that human beings can look
like<00:00:44.700> prey<00:00:45.059> three<00:00:45.660> they're<00:00:46.350> super<00:00:46.829> powerful

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
like prey three they're super powerful

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.279 
like prey three they're super powerful
and<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> first<00:00:48.090> bite<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.600> cause<00:00:48.809> fatal

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
and the first bite can cause fatal

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.290 
and the first bite can cause fatal
damage<00:00:49.890> next<00:00:50.190> they're<00:00:50.520> top<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> food

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
damage next they're top of the food

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.580 
damage next they're top of the food
chain<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:52.079> means<00:00:52.379> they're<00:00:52.559> not

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
chain this means they're not

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.380 
chain this means they're not
instinctively<00:00:53.399> afraid<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.969> anything

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
instinctively afraid of anything

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.270 
instinctively afraid of anything
other<00:00:54.660> shark<00:00:55.050> species<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.739> course<00:00:55.949> are<00:00:56.160> not

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
other shark species of course are not

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.500 
other shark species of course are not
completely<00:00:56.760> innocent

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
completely innocent

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.630 
completely innocent
so<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.960> humans<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.160> sharks<00:00:59.460> are

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
so if humans are not what sharks are

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.310 
so if humans are not what sharks are
looking<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.840> they<00:01:00.989> looking<00:01:01.140> for

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
looking for what are they looking for

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560 
looking for what are they looking for
let's<00:01:01.829> think<00:01:02.039> about<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.520> from<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.180> Sharks

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
let's think about it from the Sharks

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.780 
let's think about it from the Sharks
point<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.989> view<00:01:04.140> okay<00:01:04.350> many<00:01:04.949> attack<00:01:05.369> victims

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
point of view okay many attack victims

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.539 
point of view okay many attack victims
are<00:01:06.000> surfers<00:01:06.720> or<00:01:06.960> people<00:01:07.439> riding<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:08.010> boogie

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
are surfers or people riding on boogie
