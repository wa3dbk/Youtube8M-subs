 since 98 are Japan over ten years with 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:30.410
 The drummer has worked practically 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.730
 with all styles samba black music 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:46.140
 Brazilian 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:48.300
 the shell ó and also the side b is the union 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.800
 of my friends since childhood and who 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.079
 we are friends 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.710
 we started practically all together 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.309
 playing the night and joined our opinion 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:15.540
 the overload that gave that one there that is then 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:16.740
 then there today that this corridor 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.979
 public side 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.320
 the agent then make a sound and conversed 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.409
 our day to day than to geely friends 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.200
 our day to day of musicians people 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.420
 also normal people who work with 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.700
 other things but out of curiosity 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.400
 dark side of music 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.140
 the dark side of the artist is not only 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.479
 that buriti business that we see a 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.549
 shelf everyone political né 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.850
 we show the other side also in the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.850
 eyes 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:55.359
 the guy when I knew he was researching 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:59.259
 I'm electronic, I get angry, the sad time. 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:05.280
 at the same time of crisis and puto is and not 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.280
 I accepted the challenge of course and accepted 20 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.269
 so we started to lose that bacteria 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.000
 15 at first so I did not believe 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.900
 But we went to study and met 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.660
 knowing the timbres knowing the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.230
 the sensitivity of the touch is 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.530
 surreal is the timbre that this 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.760
 it provides bacteria chips are 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.579
 very real 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.280
 The lethal one I can speak of this bacterium 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:42.220
 are the dishes is to have the sensitivity of 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.160
 attacks possibility to touch the dome 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.920
 in case you handle the dish he 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.170
 he replies, he cursed him at the time 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.389
 interesting that you have two commands 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.540
 who is obliged to let it be of a 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:58.389
 battery pack acoustic battery is time 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.340
 that opens and closes you will hear the sound and 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.980
 when you are the sensitivity to touch 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.030
 in it a weakest dome in the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:12.700
 The tip he answers to perfection 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:15.910
 o The feet are basically and drums more 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.660
 only the answer is equal rebound is very 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:24.880
 equal is much the same that was not the same 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.829
 It is very much but very close to 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.910
 normal skin from a battery of 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.910
 normal banner 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.230
 today my design fight 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.930
 radically electronic 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.780
 so much that today he is already talking 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.970
 future to produce something with 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.739
 this bacteria if even more people 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.430
 is having the support of holland here in 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.620
 our program and we have this 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.200
 idea in the head should I do some 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.200
 work with companies that already exist
