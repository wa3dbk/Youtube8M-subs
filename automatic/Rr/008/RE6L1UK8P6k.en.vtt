00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.940
 the 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:13.250
 on the occasion of Christmas we will do 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.259
 together a chicken stuffed with chestnuts 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.300
 for that we need a good chicken 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.130
 sure is a stuffing made of chestnuts for 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.680
 to realize this farce we need 10 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.830
 centilitres of liquid cream a little bit 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.019
 cognac chives chopped 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.939
 chopped parsley too so here we have to 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.070
 about half a bunch each time 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.010
 chives and 1/2 bouquet so 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.260
 parsley we will also use a 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.489
 fortnight of brown then a carrot 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.110
 we will have detailed in very small 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.330
 pieces as well as 2 shallots 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.519
 will also chisel a glass of wine 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.630
 and so the rest of chestnuts that you 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.000
 have when you use 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.250
 a jar you will use them for 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.660
 put in the bottom of the dish so we go 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.820
 start by making the stuffing based 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.540
 of chestnuts so for that you take the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.540
 fifteen of my job 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.850
 write to you 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.369
 you really need unlimited 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.130
 so once we did that we 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.100
 add the elements of the stuffing this is to 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.300
 say the cream then the iem the cognac the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.300
 carrot and chopped shallots 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:42.060
 so we put some cognac for 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.060
 flavor our stuffing we added 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.820
 and we do not forget to reason with salt and 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.820
 pepper 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.310
 and so it's a farce you have to 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.520
 so the maxi by hand to get a 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.520
 dough 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.920
 and so we're just going last 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.569
 chicken with stuffing 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.800
 so for that if you ever have 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.239
 bought a chicken in a supermarket 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.819
 you would have removed labarde 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.630
 so we open well and put the stuffing in 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.630
 inside the chicken 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.290
 so we can also bardet the chicken 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.570
 to prevent the stuffing from escaping 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.000
 so for that we pass a string of 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.650
 butchery under the thighs of the job 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.820
 we serve very well there is another 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.400
 method that consists of sewing 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.910
 the interior allows the device to 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.910
 stay in place 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.540
 then we go under the chicken and 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.540
 Are lost 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.700
 There you go 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.569
 now we will prepare the cooking of 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:34.090
 chicken so we will install starts at 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:35.170
 bottom of the dish so we started we had 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.349
 a dozen whose stuffing 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.650
 there I simply use the rest of the 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.829
 Butter 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.829
 so if we were according to your tastes 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.500
 then we can put two scales 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.500
 as much cheese 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.569
 and glass of white wine at the bottom of the dish 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.569
 the pink a little chicken also 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.319
 we spray with olive oil 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.659
 our chicken 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.659
 but we season it's the hope 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.350
 then our group is well stocked will 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.580
 spend about an hour 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.580
 oven at 170 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.090
 and for the duration of the cooking 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.720
 we will not forget to water time in 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.160
 time the chicken 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.780
 to water the chicken we can do it 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.190
 with a little white wine and 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.190
 also recovering the cooking juices 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.510
 this is our chicken spent an hour at 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.070
 oven at 160 degrees we sprayed it with time 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.700
 in time it's time to take it out of 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.530
 oven then we can cut it apart 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.510
 by putting each time a little stuffing 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.190
 on the part one can also use 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.050
 the cooking juices to make a 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.190
 little sauce so for that actually it 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.380
 just filter the cooking juices 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.870
 add chestnuts and shallot 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.100
 that we will have previously crushed we can 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.110
 also add some cream to bind 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.570
 all and I advise you to serve 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.320
 this with for example green beans 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.320
 Anyway 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.280
