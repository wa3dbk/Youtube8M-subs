these<00:00:19.890> joysticks<00:00:20.310> may<00:00:20.490> look<00:00:20.670> kind<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.970> rough

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
these joysticks may look kind of rough

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.920 
these joysticks may look kind of rough
but<00:00:21.960> they've<00:00:22.140> got<00:00:22.320> exactly<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.070> feel<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.310> want

I made them

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.380 
I made them
there's<00:00:28.050> another<00:00:28.349> video<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.800> made<00:00:29.160> earlier

there's another video I made earlier
I<00:00:33.290> took<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.469> joysticks<00:00:34.950> off<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.360> just<00:00:36.420> I

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
I took the joysticks off and you just I

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.959 
I took the joysticks off and you just I
dipped<00:00:37.649> each<00:00:38.489> joystick<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:41.040> cap<00:00:41.340> full<00:00:41.730> of

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
dipped each joystick and I cap full of

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.959 
dipped each joystick and I cap full of
this<00:00:42.360> liquid<00:00:42.629> tape<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:44.280> then<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.640> set<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
this liquid tape and then I set the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.400 
this liquid tape and then I set the
joystick<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.879> grill<00:00:47.899> which<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.289> an

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
joystick on this grill which was just an

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.889 
joystick on this grill which was just an
old<00:00:49.559> knockout<00:00:50.010> from<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> laptop<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.719> mean<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
old knockout from a laptop I mean a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.420 
old knockout from a laptop I mean a
tower<00:00:52.969> for<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> funky<00:00:54.420> Drive<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.860> got<00:00:56.280> this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
tower for a funky Drive and I got this

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.229 
tower for a funky Drive and I got this
nice<00:00:57.859> tactile<00:00:58.859> feel<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.370> them<00:00:59.489> they're<00:00:59.879> very

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
nice tactile feel on them they're very

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
nice tactile feel on them they're very
very<00:01:00.660> grippy<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.350> barely<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.070> duck<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
very grippy I barely have to duck and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.969 
very grippy I barely have to duck and
almost<00:01:02.670> blow<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.930> work<00:01:04.019> get

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
almost blow on and get it to work get

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.190 
almost blow on and get it to work get
the<00:01:05.100> move<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> way<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.549> would<00:01:06.080> clean<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the move the way I would clean the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.500 
the move the way I would clean the
joystick<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.070> video

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
joystick up for this video

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.730 
joystick up for this video
and<00:01:10.640> this<00:01:11.640> last<00:01:11.909> mod<00:01:12.180> was<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.990> same<00:01:13.260> kind

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and this last mod was the the same kind

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.700 
and this last mod was the the same kind
of<00:01:14.600> liquid<00:01:15.600> tape<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.200> basically<00:01:16.619> just

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
of liquid tape but it's basically just

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.030 
of liquid tape but it's basically just
an<00:01:17.009> aerosol<00:01:17.430> spray<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.590> took<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> bottom

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
an aerosol spray can and took the bottom

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.420 
an aerosol spray can and took the bottom
cover<00:01:20.280> off<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.820> said<00:01:21.060> him<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:22.310> taped<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
cover off like I said him and taped it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.190 
cover off like I said him and taped it
off<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.820> paint<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.180> also<00:01:24.689> paying<00:01:24.900> debate

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
off and paint it also paying debate

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.560

good rubbery bottom I can place it down
and<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.799> tell<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.159> barely<00:01:32.400> skates<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.119> all

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and you can tell it barely skates at all

on this pretty smooth desktop so I like
what<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.680> got<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.820> tactility<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.840> my

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
what I got the tactility of it in my

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.649 
what I got the tactility of it in my
hand<00:01:40.229> isn't<00:01:40.439> impressive<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:42.000> tight

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
hand isn't impressive it's really tight

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.630

with it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.690 
with it
and<00:01:45.470> that's<00:01:46.470> that's<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.250> pretty<00:01:47.579> cool

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
and that's that's just pretty cool

and that's that's just pretty cool
little<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:49.100> tactility<00:01:50.100> mine<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.820> what<00:01:51.000> I'm

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
little of tactility mine is what I'm

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.060 
little of tactility mine is what I'm
going<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.299> call<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:52.439> rubberized

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
going to call it just rubberized

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.190 
going to call it just rubberized
undercoating<00:01:53.329> could<00:01:54.329> stand<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.750> dry<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> little

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
undercoating could stand to dry a little

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.139 
undercoating could stand to dry a little
bit<00:01:55.439> more<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:56.280> right<00:01:56.430> now<00:01:56.670> I'm<00:01:56.880> going<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.119> use

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
bit more but right now I'm going to use

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.679 
bit more but right now I'm going to use
it<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.630> then<00:01:57.990> tomorrow<00:01:59.329> I'm<00:02:00.329> going<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.600> go

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
it and then tomorrow I'm going to go

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.539 
it and then tomorrow I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.930> put<00:02:01.020> another<00:02:01.200> coat<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.799> because

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
ahead and put another coat on it because

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.630 
ahead and put another coat on it because
of<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.140> streaking<00:02:04.140> from<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> sanding<00:02:05.520> is

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
of the streaking from the sanding is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.930 
of the streaking from the sanding is
still<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> test<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.320> out<00:02:07.439> now<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:08.670> point

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
still on so I test it out now the point

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.969 
still on so I test it out now the point
is<00:02:09.090> don't<00:02:09.239> overdo<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:10.379> like<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.800> would<00:02:10.950> a

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
is don't overdo it do like you would a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.150 
is don't overdo it do like you would a
typical<00:02:11.250> really<00:02:11.849> good

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
typical really good

a job about five to ten inches away from
what<00:02:17.230> you're<00:02:17.320> painting<00:02:17.710> probably<00:02:18.250> more<00:02:18.340> like

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
what you're painting probably more like

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.400 
what you're painting probably more like
ten<00:02:18.760> would<00:02:18.970> be<00:02:19.000> good<00:02:19.270> for<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:20.050> do<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.200> in

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
ten would be good for this and do it in

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.020 
ten would be good for this and do it in
broad<00:02:20.620> sweeping<00:02:21.100> motions<00:02:21.520> don't<00:02:21.820> worry<00:02:21.940> about

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
broad sweeping motions don't worry about

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.240 
broad sweeping motions don't worry about
wasting<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.540> little<00:02:22.810> as<00:02:23.110> long<00:02:23.260> as<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:23.500> check

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
wasting a little as long as you check

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.340 
wasting a little as long as you check
your<00:02:24.370> overspray<00:02:24.910> do<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.570> an<00:02:25.720> area<00:02:26.080> with

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
your overspray do it in an area with

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.070 
your overspray do it in an area with
ventilation<00:02:26.950> but<00:02:27.490> not<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.790> lot<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.090> wind

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
ventilation but not a lot of wind

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.410 
ventilation but not a lot of wind
blowing<00:02:29.410> around<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.760> can<00:02:30.970> cut<00:02:31.240> down

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
blowing around so that you can cut down

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.380 
blowing around so that you can cut down
on<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.660> overspray<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:33.370> loss<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.240> this

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
on the overspray and the loss of this

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.530 
on the overspray and the loss of this
stuff<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.680> I'm<00:02:36.460> really<00:02:36.640> happy<00:02:36.880> with<00:02:37.180> what<00:02:37.390> I've

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
stuff so I'm really happy with what I've

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.800 
stuff so I'm really happy with what I've
got

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
got

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.720 
got
and<00:02:38.080> I'm<00:02:38.680> hoping<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.100> somebody<00:02:39.400> out<00:02:39.550> there

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
and I'm hoping that somebody out there

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.000 
and I'm hoping that somebody out there
does<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.030> little<00:02:40.270> bit<00:02:40.420> better<00:02:40.630> you<00:02:40.930> know<00:02:41.230> and

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
does a little bit better you know and

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.210 
does a little bit better you know and
draws<00:02:42.250> their<00:02:42.490> own<00:02:42.610> version<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.060> it
