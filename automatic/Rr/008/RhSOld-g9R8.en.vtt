00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.369
 this time I bring you a new video 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.210
 about the games that they will give this month 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.279
 with the xbox game with gold we started 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.460
 Well, let's start with the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.250
 lego one games in which will be 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.050
 adding the super time force and good 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.629
 guys this how can you see is of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.550
 background a small gameplay trailer is not 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.989
 they think it 's good but it's what 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.760
 I found with this I can give myself a 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.469
 little idea of what we have to do 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.960
 as you can see it is a game of 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.089
 platforms where we are moving is not 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.159
 a game that looks like action me 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.589
 remember a lot the type of the game type of 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:55.769
 against is a game that I had 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:01:00.059
 I liked it a lot but I 'm not going to win 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.710
 in a long time so good here you can 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.420
 say that we can manipulate a bit the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.479
 time since it seems that we are 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.270
 traveling I do not know if to the future and to the past 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.399
 tico be passed to prevent some 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.730
 events that should not have 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.580
 happened but I really am not 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.890
 very sure of what is this game itself 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.330
 but that is more or less like a small 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.420
 introduction of what I can tell you 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.040
 about this game I hope it's not 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.530
 leave us in the comments if you know of 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.550
 what is this game about and if it is recommended 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.410
 or not 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.630
 the other game that is free for the 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.160
 ebook john is end are dragon and good 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.190
 this is the game that had already given the 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.270
 last month but leave it just in case 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.010
 and well this is a pilot type game 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.950
 about pilots but instead of driving 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.009
 planes, we are driving dragons 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.299
 this game to me and I already downloaded it and 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.759
 I played it but I did not like it much anymore 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.580
 It's been a while since the games went 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.560
 turn on my xbox 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.020
 already in three the school there is a lot of homework 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.900
 but anyway later on in a 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.720
 passable game nothing else is not good is not 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.970
 bad but it's not very good either 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.970
 let's say so it's good to pass the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.340
 What do you think? 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.480
 Well now people are going with what 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.570
 it's being facebook games 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.340
 presents those that the first game that 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.200
 will be available from the first 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.290
 September will be Monaco was your east 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.280
 main if well guys according to what I can 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.350
 see in the trailer we are like some 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.650
 character but first it looks like a cat and 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.750
 it seems kind as pork is packman 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.000
 we have to collect coins and not 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.790
 I know how much more it really seems like a 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 fun game but I'm not sure I 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.860
 I do not know where it is but it looks 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.930
 passable this game was one of the most 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.910
 we liked it but unfortunately I do not have 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.400
 facebook 360 so I could not prove it 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.380
 it's a real pity you 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.480
 think about this game 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.790
 well in people this is the last 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.670
 game of you in this that will be 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.530
 available from September 16 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.780
 which is a game that surprises me that 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.420
 are giving but good go and take 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.970
 It has a long time but it is the halo reach 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.070
 this is the common good to me 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.290
 personally I have never been 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.900
 liked the history of the halo is not no 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.300
 they trap me more than the multiplayer is 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.340
 more it's quite addictive but 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.630
 Well, I 'm not sure what's going on with the 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.890
 story so I'm not going to mess with 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.960
 this is a game of schÃ¼rrer 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.580
 Really 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.060
 this game was one of the most 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.380
 boost to the xbox 360 the halo and the rhythm 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.010
 of disappointment I am made to be a 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:45.810
 game that has that has potential and 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.810
 Well, what do you think about this game? 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.010
 well folks this has been the games 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.320
 of this month I hope you liked it 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.000
 I have served you if it was so please do not 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.790

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.810
 low life
