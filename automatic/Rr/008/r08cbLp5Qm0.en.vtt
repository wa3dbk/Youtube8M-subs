00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.140
 punks you put him to you Pasha cerus 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.630
 direct ali the less direct uneasy 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.010
 nerve warriors still at the gate and missing 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.559
 tank were moments of the world 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.160
 hard ken sevka your comments whose 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.840
 then she was just today but she is not 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.630
 could differently why footstool 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.250
 boys lost with volynyu 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.670
 the more we knew that the new one came 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.780
 coach and new team how to play 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.740
 we took apart but 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.800
 respectively, of course there are such 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.780
 moments yes everyone gets the barbell 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.960
 we have not brought such moments there 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.559
 logical conclusion but a win on the price 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.129
 victories 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.410
 we now just had to win on 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.870
 think for poland half 2 hungry for evil 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.879
 forgot yet changed at the moment when your 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.370
 the brush team was his shield on the English 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.019
 moves up to no but i don't think these are mine 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.470
 moves it's just the team felt 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.660
 what can play i think we are second 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.239
 time controlling completely but 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.879
 penalty I do not know was a penalty was not 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.240
 also such a thing but this is nervousness and 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.150
 there is the fact that overlock almost from 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.440
 nothing but problems for us why 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.490
 because the second half we completely 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.960
 controlled had moments thought 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.940
 more more finish if you scored 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.490
 the third ball and stunner would have ended 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.400
 took out want to congratulate congratulate good 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.340
 the swarm they did too could otherwise you 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.650
 comments this assistance should be soldered 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.850
 nervosa too big on your 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.590
 judging i will not comment i 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.690
 most likely I will deal with my 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.210
 footballers who received cards 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.960
 no matter how the judge judges he is still the judge 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.450
 and he is right 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.090
 his decision, he will not be canceled so we can 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.800
 you can not argue 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.110
 why because you can say that 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.660
 after hitting after whistle when watermelon 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.670
 scored wow he had to give a card 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.070
 and the second card we would stay 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.789
 the tester hacheridi went to talk 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.800
 the judge will also be punished this discipline 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.229
 team discipline from which not 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.319
 I have to step away from the carcasses and judge suede 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.000
 how can he and judging is not an absurd song 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.039
 poland match expressed not yet complete 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.580
 unbalance form grand theft auto 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.930
 but brane today their condition 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.880
 interactive us kicks for 1 t imbalance 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.650
 speech you had a chance and level and condition 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.780
 siggraph type double back banner 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.270
 but you understand that it's probably hard 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.000
 still do why the second 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.150
 some crayfish came from different systems 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.820
 football probably one knocked given others 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.830
 Holland and lead to a common 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.470
 the neuro denominator is most likely necessary 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.350
 understanding of their and which is fast and 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.220
 so someone manages it faster yes 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:49.150
 to someone it is harder but drow ways we have 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:54.640
 no, we made beautiful notes which 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:57.280
 I count and write that count will increase 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.980
 team and team since the days of zaire core and 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.810
 football and you can say about the goods 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.180
 want your jo cash into my team 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.780
 rich and claims a little yes for the Crimea 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.180
 Adam and the form but because too but 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.680
 wrong was the center back has not 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.780
 right to err so much if extreme 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.390
 wrong date can be hedged if 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.740
 central already failing with us 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.570
 spend the central zone and some 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.250
 moments they did not have time to block 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.910
 center hitters where broke out 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.180
 Lysenko 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.060
 And this already tactical this pure razu 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.700
 opposition and probably all the same 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.680
 claims need a statement from this not 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.019
 it happens but I do not hear the mind played worse 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.940
 all their account vetkin is the result 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.830
 I still understand others and teremok excerpt 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.550
 For centuries, he will match you dynamo bilsa 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.890
 honored 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.820
 and why in Poland muzlo anything contagion 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.160
 another custard 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.930
 Yes, I think I liked it when 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.730
 team played 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.280
 I announce the tournament when it was possible to do 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.579
 8 instead it could be rebuilt 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.019
 the team the team played good football 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.760
 why because other teams 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.739
 given outfit after all for Spartak and 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.219
 Zenith its role is played by football and give 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.200
 play when you come across that Volyn 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:09.110
 11 people in their half of the field 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.090
 goverly leaves 11 people need 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.980
 hide this massive defense 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.320
 Always not always succeed when hum 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.570
 you score as you can see immediately the team 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.299
 runs down but it will be from them too short 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.400
 here in the give flowers buy nike teams 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.900
 you will become anal that cotton for Spartak for 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.490
 draws still on goverla teams 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.970
 jealous and no one jacket on me 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.370
 finish soda level in Volyn 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.490
 probably all the same and talk and harder 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.470
 tune up because many 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.360
 football players who came overseas 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.640
 championship they don't even know 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.220
 but football and football players do not understand how 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.650
 plays these teams Spartak and Zenith they 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.150
 still played against the team they 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.120
 understand as an opponent of faith 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.770
 now I'm in the middle, and congratulations on your long 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.390
 my success in the available subway matches on 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.180
 Oleg Dynamo Blokhin in the mouth 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:01.630
