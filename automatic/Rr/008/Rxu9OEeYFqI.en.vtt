it's<00:00:23.950> not<00:00:24.190> so<00:00:24.460> difficult<00:00:24.730> to<00:00:25.120> do<00:00:25.360> a<00:00:25.390> car<00:00:25.810> that

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
it's not so difficult to do a car that

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.290 
it's not so difficult to do a car that
is<00:00:26.350> extreme<00:00:26.890> in<00:00:27.310> a<00:00:27.520> particular<00:00:28.120> direction

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
is extreme in a particular direction

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.510 
is extreme in a particular direction
what<00:00:29.200> is<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.410> balance<00:00:29.620> of<00:00:29.950> the<00:00:30.100> whole<00:00:30.130> thing

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
what is the balance of the whole thing

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.819 
what is the balance of the whole thing
is<00:00:30.730> all<00:00:30.940> the<00:00:31.150> bits<00:00:31.330> and<00:00:31.420> pieces<00:00:31.539> come<00:00:32.110> together

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.500 

in<00:00:35.829> context<00:00:36.190> on<00:00:36.579> the<00:00:36.940> skills<00:00:37.210> that<00:00:37.300> are

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
in context on the skills that are

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.689 
in context on the skills that are
required<00:00:37.539> for<00:00:38.079> each<00:00:38.320> spot<00:00:38.699> completely

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
required for each spot completely

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.959 
required for each spot completely
different<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:41.079> just<00:00:41.920> a<00:00:41.980> volume<00:00:42.190> diversity

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
different it's just a volume diversity

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.860 
different it's just a volume diversity
of<00:00:43.089> requirements

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.750 

there<00:00:48.870> are<00:00:48.989> cars<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.649> class<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.280> c-class

there are cars in this class a c-class
category<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:52.260> might<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.769> better<00:00:52.949> in

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
category that might be better in

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.579 
category that might be better in
particular<00:00:53.610> attributes<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:54.809> much<00:00:55.019> but<00:00:55.440> maybe

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
particular attributes not much but maybe

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.549 
particular attributes not much but maybe
just<00:00:55.890> subtly<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.089> whole<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.960> more<00:00:58.350> than

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
just subtly but the whole is more than

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.439 
just subtly but the whole is more than
the<00:00:58.680> sum<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.309> pieces<00:00:59.519> putting<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.329> those

the sum of the pieces putting all those

the sum of the pieces putting all those
things<00:01:00.510> together<00:01:00.899> leaves<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.710> impressions

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
things together leaves the impressions

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
capable vehicle for me it's a sports car

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.700 
capable vehicle for me it's a sports car

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.400 

given<00:01:18.400> that<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:19.240> Ford<00:01:19.510> Focus<00:01:20.020> is<00:01:20.170> the

best-selling nameplates globally you can
easily<00:01:24.010> imagine<00:01:24.220> it<00:01:24.550> was<00:01:24.730> quite<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.210> bit<00:01:25.480> of<00:01:25.600> a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
easily imagine it was quite a bit of a

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.570 
easily imagine it was quite a bit of a
challenging<00:01:26.110> task<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.890> make<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.220> new<00:01:27.370> one

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
challenging task to make the new one

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.260 
challenging task to make the new one
even<00:01:28.210> better<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:30.220> you<00:01:30.340> drive<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.760> car<00:01:30.790> you

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
even better then you drive the car you

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.020 
even better then you drive the car you
will<00:01:31.420> feel<00:01:31.720> that<00:01:32.050> we<00:01:32.860> are<00:01:32.890> not<00:01:33.010> only<00:01:33.280> promising

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
will feel that we are not only promising

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.200 
will feel that we are not only promising
it<00:01:34.150> we<00:01:34.630> really<00:01:34.930> have<00:01:35.110> delivered

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.500 

it's<00:01:39.750> quite<00:01:40.440> easy<00:01:40.800> to<00:01:41.370> do<00:01:41.580> in<00:01:41.730> a<00:01:41.790> car<00:01:42.030> for

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
it's quite easy to do in a car for

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.200 
it's quite easy to do in a car for
optimal<00:01:43.080> handling<00:01:43.530> performance<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.030> this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
optimal handling performance but in this

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.630 
optimal handling performance but in this
case<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:46.080> vehicle<00:01:46.440> also<00:01:46.560> needs<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.280> very

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
case the vehicle also needs to be very

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.090 
case the vehicle also needs to be very
comfortable

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
comfortable

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.830 
comfortable
I<00:01:49.130> think<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.700> we<00:01:49.880> found<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.330> right<00:01:50.540> balance

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
I think that we found the right balance

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.550 
I think that we found the right balance
between<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.500> sporty<00:01:52.130> car<00:01:52.729> but<00:01:53.299> also<00:01:53.479> a<00:01:53.930> very

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
between a sporty car but also a very

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.230 
between a sporty car but also a very
comfortable<00:01:55.280> family<00:01:55.909> car

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
comfortable family car

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.270 
comfortable family car
when<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.870> thriver<00:01:59.200> has<00:01:59.470> a<00:01:59.500> smile<00:01:59.860> on<00:02:00.100> his<00:02:00.250> face

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
when a thriver has a smile on his face

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.600 
when a thriver has a smile on his face
by<00:02:01.119> enjoying<00:02:01.510> his<00:02:01.869> right<00:02:02.170> we<00:02:02.950> know<00:02:03.100> we<00:02:03.400> did<00:02:03.580> a

good<00:02:03.909> job

I'm not as fast as Usain Bolt I say yes

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.110 
I'm not as fast as Usain Bolt I say yes
you're<00:02:12.300> right<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.680> he<00:02:13.739> swim<00:02:13.980> can<00:02:14.310> he<00:02:14.489> ride

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
you're right but can he swim can he ride

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.360 
you're right but can he swim can he ride
a<00:02:15.150> horse<00:02:15.360> can<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.750> shoot<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.080> gun<00:02:16.200> can<00:02:16.770> he<00:02:16.980> win

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
a horse can you shoot a gun can he win

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.600 
a horse can you shoot a gun can he win
in<00:02:17.489> fencing<00:02:17.700> against<00:02:18.120> me<00:02:19.190> then<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.340> answer<00:02:20.580> is

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
in fencing against me then the answer is

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.260 
in fencing against me then the answer is
no<00:02:20.880> I'm<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.989> better<00:02:22.170> one
