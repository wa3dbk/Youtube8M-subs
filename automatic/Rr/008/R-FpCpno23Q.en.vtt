so<00:01:11.159> rightly<00:01:11.430> States<00:01:11.880> removing<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> water

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
so rightly States removing the water

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.600 
so rightly States removing the water
from<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.110> cooling<00:01:13.470> system<00:01:14.010> will<00:01:14.130> remove<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
from the cooling system will remove the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.860 
from the cooling system will remove the
problems

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.260 

let's<00:01:18.870> fill<00:01:19.080> Bayliss<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.100> tell<00:01:20.340> me<00:01:20.460> what<00:01:21.150> you

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
let's fill Bayliss and tell me what you

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.960 
let's fill Bayliss and tell me what you
got<00:01:21.510> and<00:01:21.720> why<00:01:21.870> use<00:01:22.110> Evans<00:01:22.500> got<00:01:22.979> td5<00:01:23.640> tune

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
got and why use Evans got td5 tune

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
got and why use Evans got td5 tune
recent<00:01:24.450> defender<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.320> we're<00:01:25.500> having<00:01:25.650> trouble

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.340 
brilliant stuff well Phil's talking
about<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.940> power<00:02:02.970> call<00:02:03.450> which<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.140> for

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
about is the power call which is for

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.200 
about is the power call which is for
performance<00:02:04.890> racing<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.550> as<00:02:05.640> he<00:02:05.789> says<00:02:06.030> it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
performance racing and as he says it

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.990 
performance racing and as he says it
doesn't<00:02:06.420> boil<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.899> 180<00:02:07.380> degree<00:02:07.619> centigrade

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
doesn't boil to 180 degree centigrade

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.190 
doesn't boil to 180 degree centigrade
okay<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.390> benefit<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.810> basically

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
okay so the benefit is basically

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.320 
okay so the benefit is basically
eliminating<00:02:11.100> overheating<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.820> it<00:02:11.940> reduces

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
eliminating overheating and it reduces

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.640 
eliminating overheating and it reduces
pressure<00:02:12.600> because<00:02:13.080> it's<00:02:13.230> very<00:02:13.410> little

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
pressure because it's very little

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.040 
pressure because it's very little
pressure<00:02:13.920> with<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.670> system<00:02:15.050> prevents

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
pressure with this system prevents

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.250 
pressure with this system prevents
corrosion<00:02:16.580> increases<00:02:17.580> bhp<00:02:18.269> by<00:02:18.690> improving

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
corrosion increases bhp by improving

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.740 
corrosion increases bhp by improving
combustion<00:02:20.070> by<00:02:20.220> efficiency<00:02:20.790> cavitation

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
combustion by efficiency cavitation

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.240 
combustion by efficiency cavitation
which<00:02:21.930> comes<00:02:22.170> under<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.590> title<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.950> erosion

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
which comes under the title of erosion

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.979 
which comes under the title of erosion
where<00:02:23.820> air<00:02:23.970> bubbles<00:02:24.360> will<00:02:24.480> cause<00:02:24.660> damage

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
where air bubbles will cause damage

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.289 
where air bubbles will cause damage
that's<00:02:25.680> actually<00:02:26.040> eliminated<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.209> you

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
that's actually eliminated and you

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.420 
that's actually eliminated and you
freeze<00:02:27.540> protection<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:28.200> down<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.590> minus<00:02:28.950> 40

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
freeze protection is down to minus 40

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.090 
freeze protection is down to minus 40
and<00:02:29.459> it's<00:02:29.970> non-toxic<00:02:30.540> surprisingly<00:02:31.440> we<00:02:31.950> have

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
and it's non-toxic surprisingly we have

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.160 
and it's non-toxic surprisingly we have
had<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.910> gauge<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.329> 220<00:02:33.959> degrees

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
had it on the gauge of 220 degrees

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.860 
had it on the gauge of 220 degrees
that's<00:02:34.350> what<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.530> gauge<00:02:34.680> stops<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:36.630> was

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
that's what the gauge stops and it was

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.420 
that's what the gauge stops and it was
still<00:02:37.049> fine<00:02:37.260> we<00:02:37.440> didn't<00:02:37.680> lose<00:02:37.890> now<00:02:38.070> sort<00:02:38.400> of

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
still fine we didn't lose now sort of

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.780 
still fine we didn't lose now sort of
coolant<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:39.709> what<00:02:40.709> he<00:02:40.769> says<00:02:40.950> under<00:02:41.160> 10

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.190
