00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Cook the other day I was given to use it 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.500
 Here is such a cool thing you of course 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.320
 do you know what it is right this 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.630
 peanut baking mold means 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.500
 today we will cook nuts with 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.359
 condensed milk for cooking I'll take 3 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.939
 cup flour a little salt sugar 2 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.630
 chicken eggs 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.119
 butter soda vinegar to 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.969
 put out the soda 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.969
 walnuts and condensed milk 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.760
 just before cooking 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.770
 put cook condensed milk for this 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.430
 big pot pour a lot of water 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.500
 throw a jar in there and boil water 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.489
 boiled condensed milk will be two hours on 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.489
 low heat 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.150
 it is very important to pour water into the pot 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.290
 because if condensed milk is over 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.090
 water may explode 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.160
 while condensed milk is cooking 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.520
 directly nuts 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:23.800
 and the nuts are not simple all the shells 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.770
 for the lacquer and go do the melt 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.450
 butter and then can be done or in 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.450
 microwave or fire 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.479
 add half a glass of sugar 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:55.120
 add quite a bit of salt at the tip 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:57.970
 knife for example add 2 eggs now 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.720
 take half a teaspoon of soda and quench 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.720
 her vinegar 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:21.230
 and 3 cups of flour, knead well 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:32.140
 dough until homogeneous 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:34.459
 consistency dough laid aside and 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.400
 now we prepare this 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.650
 pan for baking nuts to 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.440
 prepare a baking dish and u need 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.739
 first a little oil with all 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:54.730
 the surface all the nuts all the bulges and 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:57.680
 in bulk we grease only once 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.049
 before laying the dough form is very 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.600
 it is important that this thing is good 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:07.910
 calcined on the stove now from dough 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.060
 form the balls a little less than the walnut 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.060
 walnut 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:20.019
 we lay in dimples and close the lid 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.019
 and set to fry 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.010
 on a well-roasted nuts pan 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.910
 roast very quickly literally 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.910
 minute and a half 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.180
 when we bake a bunch of shells you can 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.160
 go to the stuffing 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.160
 put condensed milk in some container 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:59.780
 in a blender a good grind walnuts 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:04:02.030
 nuts are still a must during baking 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.530
 we will not very high quality 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.480
 shells do not offer shells 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:14.090
 throw and grind in a blender too 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:26.150
 and add them condensed milk the whole thing 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:28.610
 shuffle and filling is ready now 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.530
 it remains only to form nuts in 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.690
 half nut put the stuffing 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:37.090
 in the second half also put a little 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.090
 fillings and close the nut 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:49.749
