00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.060
 one of the thought processes studied but at this point the relationship 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.120
 in one of the cognitive processes is that they are actually the way we perceive 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.120

 without mentioning the awareness that mental models

 do not occur in isolation in people's minds and structural form 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.699

 to love to store that it would record 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.010
 and our brain 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.329
 from experiences with the world around us. 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.430
 individual differences 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.240
 the individual capacities that each 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.250
 must be taken into account in the process of developing an interface 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.200
 different groups have different personality abilities 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.250
 very different characteristics 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.760
 and these skills in fundamental personality traits 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.859
 development of a range of seven 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.680
 and maximum accommodation 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.530
 harry visitors have been in the accumulation of sitting and doing the maximum 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.979
 of possible lives 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.069
 the combination of these factors

 individual nerter 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.310
 can present until they present the difference between success or just being 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.359
 one more on the web 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.479
 emotions 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:50.319
 the interaction of people with your system can take the generates removals 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.659
 it raises the possibility of success of your enterprise and acceptance of the 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.969
 your product exposed on the web 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.659
 the person observes interesting city the text gives strength 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:07.650
 if you look at the words they are not spelled correctly 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.290
 but with what I read zhaoxing according to the research of an English university 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.340
 I do not mind on good travel and tourism the word 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.249
 They are 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:21.399
 The only important thing is that the first and last law brings 

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.069
 first and last law 3 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:24.970
 be in the right place 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.560
 the rest can be 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.980
 a total mess you can 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.229
 still the problem 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.659
 this is because 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:37.569
 we gather each letter - it gathers in search of the law and the reading in isolation 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.569
 but the word as a whole 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.520
 the person unipê kasami segregation 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.789
 we have the personal tendency of organized things 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.699
 according 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.340
 eleven characteristics 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.650
 related objects in crisis when they will be exposed 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.900
 he comes close to each other and they help the recognition 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.900
 is that the burial was of a system as a whole 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:12.129
 the closeness of personal resemblance is very close to that of unification and 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:13.060
 segregation 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.150
 the selection of songs segregation she works more 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.050
 this distinction between elements by the idea of ​​contrast and world costumes and 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.220
 proximity and similarity and just as the name says the similarity 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.220
 between related objects and crisis 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:31.720
 with personal dignity 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.460
 note that we should have real investments of 3

 teenager 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.690
 dot com dot b I talk more 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.990
 on each of these topics is just one way to 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.160
 he stipulated term 6 1 points mitchell the personal closing 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.860
 closure demonstrates our ability to observe 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.389
 the tour than the upas alone holding it all 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.689
 note that in the frame on the left the official image the trimmed list 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.210
 she was full of our tendency 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.300
 is to close this image notes that when looking at the image of the closed left you 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.380
 get close to her in your mind 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.380
 and realize that this is in the square 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:36.689
 people that 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.310
 What a decided aspect I'm going to do 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.830
 character at first may seem 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.600
 to have a bit 'sensual' but in fact is a great sequence 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:52.759
 of dolphins notice when we apply beyond unification segregation 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.559
 which is common in racing 

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:58.460
 we can see dolphin forming 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.750
 and with the rest of the image as everything loses a little of its focus the union of all 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.319
 these laws are applied it gives us a better understanding of the impact 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.619
 these concepts can help us 

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:12.490
 Hanging threads
