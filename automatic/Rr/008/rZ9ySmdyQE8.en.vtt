its darkest I would prefer I know this
cardboard<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:01.040> not<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.459> best<00:03:02.290> way<00:03:03.290> but<00:03:03.350> it

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
cardboard is not the best way but it

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.380 
cardboard is not the best way but it
still<00:03:03.950> gives<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.459> little<00:03:04.700> bit<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.090> an<00:03:05.209> idea

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
still gives you a little bit of an idea

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.420 
still gives you a little bit of an idea
see<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.110> goes<00:03:06.319> on<00:03:06.620> very<00:03:07.360> sort<00:03:08.360> of<00:03:08.450> sheer<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:09.430> want

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
see it goes on very sort of sheer I want

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.979 
see it goes on very sort of sheer I want
it<00:03:10.519> darker<00:03:10.940> than<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.450> I'm<00:03:11.540> going<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.810> add

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
it darker than that so I'm going to add

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:25.130 
it darker than that so I'm going to add
more<00:03:12.350> color

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:33.710 

very<00:03:25.770> nice

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:43.210 

ok<00:03:34.500> let's<00:03:34.740> try<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.010> again

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.990 

that's<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:43.940> little<00:03:44.150> better

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
that's a little better

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.480 
that's a little better
with<00:03:46.420> just<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:46.810> little<00:03:47.350> more

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.840 

that<00:03:53.420> should<00:03:53.630> do<00:03:53.750> it<00:03:54.520> well<00:03:55.520> it's<00:03:55.670> getting

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
that should do it well it's getting

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.309 
that should do it well it's getting
thicker

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.929 

you<00:03:59.890> want<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.099> make<00:04:00.219> sure<00:04:00.249> there<00:04:00.670> are<00:04:00.790> no

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
you want to make sure there are no

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:07.080 
you want to make sure there are no
clumps<00:04:01.299> though<00:04:01.769> you<00:04:02.769> might<00:04:02.950> have<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.249> few<00:04:05.969> but<00:04:06.969> I

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
clumps though you might have a few but I

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.470 
clumps though you might have a few but I
think<00:04:07.389> this<00:04:07.599> is<00:04:07.749> such<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:07.989> neat<00:04:08.379> idea<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:09.489> a

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
think this is such a neat idea and a

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.170 
think this is such a neat idea and a
great<00:04:10.719> way<00:04:10.959> to<00:04:10.989> use<00:04:11.469> your<00:04:11.499> polishes<00:04:12.310> okay

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
great way to use your polishes okay

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.979
