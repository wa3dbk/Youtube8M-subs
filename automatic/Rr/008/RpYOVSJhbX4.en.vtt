phone now ironically we're using a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.130 
phone now ironically we're using a
galaxy<00:00:28.320> s4<00:00:28.590> which<00:00:28.859> did<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.810> however<00:00:30.810> was

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
galaxy s4 which did this however was

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.900 
galaxy s4 which did this however was
using<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> camera<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.579> different

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
using the camera this is a different

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.330 
using the camera this is a different
situation<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.600> now<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> outside<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.190> see

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
situation and now on the outside you see

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.370 
situation and now on the outside you see
a<00:00:35.370> box<00:00:35.640> around<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.180> phone<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.989> again<00:00:37.260> this

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
a box around the phone and again this

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.330 
a box around the phone and again this
would<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.620> something<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.190> will<00:00:38.280> be

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
would be something that will be

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.280 
would be something that will be
installed<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> phone<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.540> there's<00:00:39.989> four

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
installed in the phone and there's four

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.590 
installed in the phone and there's four
microphones<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.700> see<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.030> I'm<00:00:42.180> moving<00:00:42.300> my

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
microphones you can see as I'm moving my

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.869 
microphones you can see as I'm moving my
finger<00:00:42.960> around<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.440> picking<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.250> you

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
finger around is picking it up and you

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.700 
finger around is picking it up and you
don't<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.390> directly<00:00:45.870> over<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.379> you

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
don't have to be directly over it you

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.490 
don't have to be directly over it you
could<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.129> decide<00:00:47.719> in<00:00:48.719> order<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.469> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
could be to decide in order for it to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.650 
could be to decide in order for it to
detect<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.180> obviously<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
detect and this is just obviously a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.840 
detect and this is just obviously a

simple we're scrolling through the
gallery<00:00:54.649> yes<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:55.949> actually<00:00:56.070> make<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.340> even

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
gallery yes we can actually make it even

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.439 
gallery yes we can actually make it even
smaller<00:00:56.850> beep<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.320> also<00:00:58.469> look<00:00:58.770> at

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
smaller beep and we can also look at

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.630 
smaller beep and we can also look at

up<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.230> few<00:02:07.470> things<00:02:08.450> that's<00:02:09.450> right<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.080> we

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
up for a few things that's right so we

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.700 
up for a few things that's right so we
have<00:02:10.500> released<00:02:10.830> our<00:02:11.040> SDK<00:02:11.490> for<00:02:11.760> Android<00:02:12.710> in

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
have released our SDK for Android in

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.150 
have released our SDK for Android in
this<00:02:14.570> application<00:02:15.570> developers<00:02:16.050> or<00:02:16.350> OMS<00:02:16.980> can

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
this application developers or OMS can

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.100 
this application developers or OMS can
customize<00:02:17.640> notifications<00:02:18.480> now<00:02:18.870> they<00:02:18.960> need

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
customize notifications now they need

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.080 
customize notifications now they need
four<00:02:19.320> microphones<00:02:19.740> as<00:02:20.130> we<00:02:20.250> said<00:02:20.490> they<00:02:20.910> can

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
four microphones as we said they can

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.050 
four microphones as we said they can
utilize<00:02:21.270> existing<00:02:21.750> microphones<00:02:22.820> in<00:02:23.820> their

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
utilize existing microphones in their

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.550 
utilize existing microphones in their
product<00:02:24.480> but<00:02:24.570> they<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.990> be<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.350> front

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
product but they have to be in the front

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.010 
product but they have to be in the front
of<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.830> device<00:02:26.240> ready<00:02:27.240> in<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.540> front<00:02:27.810> during

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
of the device ready in the front during

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.320 
of the device ready in the front during
the<00:02:28.260> science<00:02:28.650> at<00:02:29.040> least<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.970> corner

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
the science at least and in the corner

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.370 
the science at least and in the corner
so<00:02:30.570> we<00:02:30.690> say<00:02:30.870> right<00:02:31.050> they<00:02:31.110> have<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.290> be

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
so we say right they have to be

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.010 
so we say right they have to be
separated<00:02:32.120> enough<00:02:33.120> for<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> whole<00:02:33.570> thing<00:02:33.750> for

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
separated enough for the whole thing for

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.750 
separated enough for the whole thing for
it<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.200> work<00:02:34.380> correctly<00:02:34.560> right<00:02:35.100> there<00:02:35.610> should

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
it to work correctly right there should

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.690 
it to work correctly right there should
be<00:02:35.910> some<00:02:36.180> difference<00:02:36.660> between<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.080> mic<00:02:37.700> but

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
be some difference between the mic but

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.820 
be some difference between the mic but
we<00:02:39.450> can<00:02:39.630> only<00:02:39.840> really<00:02:40.020> use<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.380> microphones

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
we can only really use the microphones

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.350 
we can only really use the microphones
that's<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.490> end<00:02:41.820> of<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.000> Wiseman

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
that's you know the end of the Wiseman

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.380 
that's you know the end of the Wiseman
report<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.680> what<00:02:44.010> do<00:02:44.130> we<00:02:44.280> do<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.730> tackle<00:02:45.090> an

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
report so what do we do is tackle an

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.150 
report so what do we do is tackle an
additional<00:02:45.810> microphone

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
additional microphone

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.780 
additional microphone
and<00:02:47.670> this<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.030> using<00:02:48.240> ultrasound<00:02:49.190> it's<00:02:50.190> using

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
and this is using ultrasound it's using

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.460 
and this is using ultrasound it's using
alcohol<00:02:51.030> zone<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:51.570> it's<00:02:51.720> like<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.110> plastic

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
alcohol zone so it's like in a plastic

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.790 
alcohol zone so it's like in a plastic
radar<00:02:52.890> we<00:02:53.790> transmit<00:02:54.570> both<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:55.050> sonic<00:02:55.260> signals

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
radar we transmit both a sonic signals

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.340 
radar we transmit both a sonic signals
they<00:02:56.100> reflected<00:02:56.670> from<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.990> they<00:02:58.170> pick

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
they reflected from that and they pick

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.230 
they reflected from that and they pick
up<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.530> signals<00:02:58.950> using<00:02:59.340> travel<00:02:59.850> bans

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
up the signals using travel bans

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.330 
up the signals using travel bans
marketed<00:03:00.810> all<00:03:01.530> right<00:03:01.650> well<00:03:01.830> great<00:03:01.950> we're
