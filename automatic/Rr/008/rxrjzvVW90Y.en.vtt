00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
man at times black breakers in terms of

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.270 
man at times black breakers in terms of
AI<00:01:22.870> and<00:01:23.870> got<00:01:24.110> it<00:01:24.290> right<00:01:24.470> you<00:01:24.830> know<00:01:24.950> for<00:01:25.190> the

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
AI and got it right you know for the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.210 
AI and got it right you know for the
most<00:01:25.430> part<00:01:25.760> as<00:01:26.240> far<00:01:26.480> as<00:01:26.630> on<00:01:26.840> film<00:01:27.260> you<00:01:28.010> know<00:01:28.160> of

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.290 
because there's nothing like it in terms
of<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.050> physical<00:02:03.530> aspect<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.580> point<00:02:04.940> of<00:02:05.060> view

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
of the physical aspect the point of view

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.710 
of the physical aspect the point of view
and<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:06.200> arm<00:02:06.410> felt<00:02:06.680> action<00:02:07.330> as<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.479> take<00:02:08.690> a

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
and the arm felt action as you take a

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.830 
and the arm felt action as you take a
look<00:02:08.959> at<00:02:09.050> this<00:02:09.170> double<00:02:09.560> hit

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
look at this double hit

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.570 
look at this double hit
this<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:12.050> football<00:02:12.470> man<00:02:12.740> there<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.190> no<00:02:13.400> other

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
this is football man there is no other

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.490 
this is football man there is no other
way<00:02:13.820> to<00:02:14.720> say<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.390> football<00:02:17.500> I'm

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
way to say that this is football I'm

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.900 
way to say that this is football I'm
going<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.710> show<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.010> he<00:02:19.130> had<00:02:19.280> several<00:02:19.580> times

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
going to show it he had several times

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.820 
going to show it he had several times
you<00:02:20.210> know<00:02:20.360> just<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:21.020> can<00:02:21.260> really<00:02:21.470> get<00:02:21.680> the

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
you know just so you can really get the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.300 
you know just so you can really get the
gist<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.190> is<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.720> tell<00:02:24.020> me<00:02:24.260> man<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
gist that is but you tell me man the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.250 
gist that is but you tell me man the
question<00:02:25.730> still<00:02:25.940> remains<00:02:26.360> will<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.840> accept

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
question still remains will you accept

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.510 
question still remains will you accept
another<00:02:27.920> football<00:02:28.250> game<00:02:28.640> without<00:02:28.940> physics

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
another football game without physics

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.010 
another football game without physics
you<00:02:31.520> know<00:02:31.550> like<00:02:31.850> I<00:02:31.880> said<00:02:32.210> before<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.750> for

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
you know like I said before you for

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.620 
you know like I said before you for
years<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.320> technology<00:02:34.100> no<00:02:34.670> created<00:02:35.120> by<00:02:35.210> natural

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
years a technology no created by natural

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.810 
years a technology no created by natural
motion<00:02:36.020> so<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.590> don't<00:02:36.800> expect<00:02:36.890> any<00:02:37.370> other<00:02:37.550> game

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
motion so I don't expect any other game

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.350 
motion so I don't expect any other game
to<00:02:38.240> have<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.050> exact<00:02:39.530> type<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.370> physics<00:02:40.910> but<00:02:41.210> it

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
to have the exact type of physics but it

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.800 
to have the exact type of physics but it
needs<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.780> be<00:02:41.870> very<00:02:42.290> close<00:02:43.450> you<00:02:44.450> know<00:02:44.570> for

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
needs to be very close you know for

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.180 
needs to be very close you know for
those<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.170> watching<00:02:45.350> this<00:02:45.620> video<00:02:45.920> can<00:02:46.130> you

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
see this in your game of choice your

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.960 
see this in your game of choice your
favorite<00:02:51.230> game<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:52.370> know<00:02:52.490> let's<00:02:52.640> take<00:02:52.850> the

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
favorite game you know let's take the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.750 
favorite game you know let's take the
company<00:02:53.360> out<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.660> equation<00:02:54.370> we<00:02:55.370> do<00:02:55.520> not

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
company out of the equation we do not

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.840 
company out of the equation we do not
want<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.090> see<00:02:56.270> this<00:02:56.390> from<00:02:56.630> 2k<00:02:57.520> would<00:02:58.520> you<00:02:58.640> not

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
want to see this from 2k would you not

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.060 
want to see this from 2k would you not
want<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.150> see<00:02:59.330> this<00:02:59.450> in<00:02:59.660> NC<00:02:59.990> double-a<00:03:00.470> would

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
want to see this in NC double-a would

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.580 
want to see this in NC double-a would
you<00:03:01.190> not<00:03:01.400> want<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.670> see<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.090> mad<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.660> even

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
you not want to see it in mad and even

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.770 
you not want to see it in mad and even
back<00:03:03.800> breaker<00:03:04.100> going<00:03:04.430> forward

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
back breaker going forward

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.290 
back breaker going forward
that's<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.440> question<00:03:07.100> will<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:07.940> accept

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
that's the question will you accept

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.250 
that's the question will you accept
another<00:03:08.750> football<00:03:09.170> game<00:03:09.410> without<00:03:09.860> physics<00:03:11.260> we

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
another football game without physics we

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.450 
another football game without physics we
gotta<00:03:12.440> keep<00:03:12.620> we<00:03:12.770> got<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.010> be<00:03:13.100> real<00:03:13.310> with

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
gotta keep we got to be real with

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.660 
gotta keep we got to be real with
ourselves<00:03:13.520> in<00:03:14.180> man<00:03:14.450> this<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.710> football<00:03:15.980> if<00:03:16.430> you
