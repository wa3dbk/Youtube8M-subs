this<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.380> replacement<00:00:01.709> of<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.280> 2005<00:00:03.290> f-150s

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029 
this is the replacement of a 2005 f-150s

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.900 
this is the replacement of a 2005 f-150s
VCT<00:00:06.049> solenoid<00:00:07.049> which<00:00:07.589> regulates<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.670> flow<00:00:08.700> of

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
VCT solenoid which regulates the flow of

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.490 
VCT solenoid which regulates the flow of
oil<00:00:09.170> from<00:00:11.179> essentially<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> oil<00:00:12.480> pan<00:00:12.840> through

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
oil from essentially the oil pan through

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.900 
oil from essentially the oil pan through
the<00:00:13.620> oil<00:00:13.769> pump<00:00:14.330> up<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.839> camp<00:00:16.080> phasers<00:00:16.500> and

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
the oil pump up to the camp phasers and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.310 
the oil pump up to the camp phasers and
adjust<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> timing<00:00:18.180> based<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.810> various

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
adjust the timing based on various

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.160 
adjust the timing based on various
engine<00:00:19.650> parameters<00:00:19.859> anyway<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.840> wanted

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
engine parameters anyway I just wanted

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.580 
engine parameters anyway I just wanted
to<00:00:22.230> post<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.920> video<00:00:23.100> because<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.750> didn't

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
to post this video because I didn't

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.349 
to post this video because I didn't
really<00:00:25.800> see<00:00:26.039> any<00:00:26.160> videos<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.760> YouTube<00:00:27.090> showing

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
really see any videos on YouTube showing

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.929 
really see any videos on YouTube showing
how<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> replace<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.199> VC<00:00:28.590> T's<00:00:28.769> solenoid<00:00:29.640> it's

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
how to replace the VC T's solenoid it's

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:30.830 
how to replace the VC T's solenoid it's
actually<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.420> easy

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
actually really easy

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.659 
actually really easy
but<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.500> couple<00:00:31.890> little<00:00:32.099> tricks<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.460> might

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
but a couple little tricks that might

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.860 
but a couple little tricks that might
make<00:00:33.059> your<00:00:33.239> life<00:00:33.390> easier

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
make your life easier

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.500 
make your life easier
so<00:00:34.340> I've<00:00:35.340> already<00:00:35.579> replaced<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.000> solenoid<00:00:36.390> so

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
so I've already replaced the solenoid so

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.150 
so I've already replaced the solenoid so
I<00:00:36.540> won't<00:00:36.660> be<00:00:36.809> showing<00:00:37.079> exactly<00:00:37.350> how<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:37.980> did

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
I won't be showing exactly how I did

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.360 
I won't be showing exactly how I did
that<00:00:39.079> but<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.140> will<00:00:40.320> basically<00:00:40.980> point<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.340> in

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
that but I will basically point you in

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.530 
that but I will basically point you in
the<00:00:41.460> right<00:00:41.520> direction<00:00:41.790> I'll<00:00:42.149> show<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.390> some

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the right direction I'll show you some

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.869 
the right direction I'll show you some
of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> tools<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.500> found<00:00:44.489> particularly

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
of the tools that I found particularly

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.470 
of the tools that I found particularly
useful<00:00:45.980> so<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.430> guess<00:00:47.789> I'll<00:00:47.940> start<00:00:48.030> off<00:00:48.239> by

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
useful so I guess I'll start off by

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.680 
useful so I guess I'll start off by
showing<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.980> old<00:00:50.550> solenoid<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
showing you the the old solenoid and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.200 
showing you the the old solenoid and
seal<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.340> see<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.730> seal<00:00:54.000> is

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
seal and so as you can see the seal is

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.590 
seal and so as you can see the seal is
pretty<00:00:54.449> banged<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:55.460> my<00:00:56.460> truck<00:00:56.640> has<00:00:56.730> 180,000

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
pretty banged up my truck has 180,000

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.250 
pretty banged up my truck has 180,000
miles<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.989> it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
miles on it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.040 
miles on it
so<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:59.699> seal<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.000> actually<00:01:00.239> very<00:01:00.420> difficult

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
so the seal is actually very difficult

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.710 
so the seal is actually very difficult
to<00:01:01.350> remove<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.630> actually

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
to remove and you know it's actually

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840 
to remove and you know it's actually
pretty<00:01:07.170> hard<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.830> found<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.250> useful<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
pretty hard and I found it as useful to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.480 
pretty hard and I found it as useful to
have<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> couple<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.020> these<00:01:10.290> items<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.799> hand

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
have a couple of these items on hand

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.399 
have a couple of these items on hand
first<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.000> all<00:01:12.060> oiled<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> little

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
first of all oiled it up with a little

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.670 
first of all oiled it up with a little
bit<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.560> wd-40<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.020> I<00:01:16.020> use<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.409> big

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
bit of wd-40 and I use this big

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.130 
bit of wd-40 and I use this big
screwdriver<00:01:17.450> along<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> sledge<00:01:18.900> hammer

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
screwdriver along with a sledge hammer

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.999 
screwdriver along with a sledge hammer
to<00:01:19.259> kind<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.700> poke<00:01:20.700> away<00:01:21.000> around<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.530> seal<00:01:22.770> I

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
to kind of poke away around the seal I

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.830 
to kind of poke away around the seal I
found<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.909> be<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.119> easiest<00:01:24.390> technique

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
found that to be the easiest technique

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.320 
found that to be the easiest technique
you<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.159> be<00:01:26.280> careful<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.790> bang

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
you just have to be careful not to bang

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.850 
you just have to be careful not to bang
up<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> valve<00:01:27.810> cover<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.320> you're<00:01:28.470> doing<00:01:28.710> this

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
up the valve cover as you're doing this

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.730 
up the valve cover as you're doing this
and<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.520> could<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:29.820> get<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.119> close<00:01:30.329> shot<00:01:30.740> you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and so I could just get a close shot you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.530 
and so I could just get a close shot you
can<00:01:31.890> see<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.070> did<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> pretty<00:01:32.549> good<00:01:32.729> job<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.060> not

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
can see I did a pretty good job of not

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.840 
can see I did a pretty good job of not
harming<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> valve<00:01:34.650> cover<00:01:36.259> right<00:01:37.259> about<00:01:37.470> here

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
harming the valve cover right about here

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.280 
harming the valve cover right about here
you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.030> see<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.840> kind<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.140> where<00:01:40.259> I

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
you can see this is kind of where I

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.580 
you can see this is kind of where I
started<00:01:41.150> and<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.270> chipped<00:01:42.750> away<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.320> piece

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
started and I chipped away just a piece

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.289 
started and I chipped away just a piece
hardly<00:01:44.100> anything<00:01:44.490> really<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.119> valve

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
hardly anything really of the valve

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.230 
hardly anything really of the valve
cover<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.860> once<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.950> realized<00:01:47.280> how<00:01:47.490> easy<00:01:47.759> it

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
cover and once I realized how easy it

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.550 
cover and once I realized how easy it
was<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.780> didn't<00:01:49.320> do<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.439> anymore

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
was to do that I didn't do that anymore

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.520 
was to do that I didn't do that anymore
they<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.549> maintain<00:01:51.180> focus<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
they just maintain focus on this on the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.260 
they just maintain focus on this on the
rubber<00:01:52.710> part<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.070> seal<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:54.119> work

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
rubber part of the seal and just work

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.209 
rubber part of the seal and just work
your<00:01:54.420> way<00:01:54.570> through<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:57.619> then<00:01:58.619> product<00:01:59.100> would

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
your way through and then product would

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.539 
your way through and then product would
be<00:01:59.250> something<00:01:59.939> like<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:01.070> basically<00:02:02.070> once<00:02:02.430> I

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
be something like this basically once I

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.719 
be something like this basically once I
got<00:02:02.759> towards<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.450> area

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
got towards this area

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.139 
got towards this area
over<00:02:05.030> here<00:02:05.799> it<00:02:06.799> was<00:02:06.890> very<00:02:06.979> easy<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.340> just<00:02:07.670> use

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
over here it was very easy to just use

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.759 
over here it was very easy to just use
the<00:02:08.330> vice<00:02:08.479> grips<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:09.489> extract<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.610> seal<00:02:11.769> to

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
the vice grips to extract the seal to

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.050 
the vice grips to extract the seal to
reveal<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:14.239> VCT<00:02:14.690> solenoid<00:02:15.410> which<00:02:15.800> is<00:02:16.760> held<00:02:16.970> on

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
reveal the VCT solenoid which is held on

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.520 
reveal the VCT solenoid which is held on
by<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.300> t25<00:02:17.900> torx<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:19.930> didn't<00:02:20.930> go<00:02:21.050> out<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.349> buy<00:02:21.500> a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
by a t25 torx I didn't go out and buy a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.380 
by a t25 torx I didn't go out and buy a
special<00:02:21.830> tool<00:02:22.190> for<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:22.700> had<00:02:22.940> some<00:02:23.120> torques

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
special tool for that I had some torques

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.080 
special tool for that I had some torques
on<00:02:23.510> hand<00:02:23.750> what<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.440> did<00:02:24.650> do<00:02:24.800> though<00:02:25.040> was<00:02:25.310> tape

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
on hand what I did do though was tape

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.610 
on hand what I did do though was tape
together<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.569> extensions<00:02:27.080> because<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.500> is

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
together the extensions because it is

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.839 
together the extensions because it is
very<00:02:27.860> very<00:02:28.190> easy<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.930> drop<00:02:29.930> your<00:02:30.170> tool

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
very very easy to drop your tool

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.009 
very very easy to drop your tool
especially<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:31.880> skinny<00:02:32.150> extension<00:02:32.599> like<00:02:32.750> this

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
especially a skinny extension like this

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.160 
especially a skinny extension like this
from<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.129> from<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.209> head<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.690> ratchet

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
from the from the head of the ratchet

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.789 
from the from the head of the ratchet
into<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.480> timing<00:02:38.480> set<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.349> be<00:02:39.620> very

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
into the timing set so that be very

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.710 
into the timing set so that be very
annoying<00:02:40.069> and<00:02:40.400> obviously<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.269> be<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.420> pain<00:02:41.599> in

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
annoying and obviously that be a pain in

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.170 
annoying and obviously that be a pain in
the<00:02:41.750> ass<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:42.530> want<00:02:42.769> to<00:02:42.829> avoid<00:02:42.920> doing<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.400> so

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
the ass so I want to avoid doing that so

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.360 
the ass so I want to avoid doing that so
go<00:02:44.480> ahead<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:44.660> either<00:02:45.500> buy<00:02:45.680> yourself<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.130> nice

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
go ahead and either buy yourself a nice

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.660 
go ahead and either buy yourself a nice
big<00:02:46.430> screwdriver<00:02:48.190> or<00:02:49.190> if<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.370> have<00:02:49.489> something

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
big screwdriver or if you have something

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.979 
big screwdriver or if you have something
like<00:02:49.880> this<00:02:50.000> just<00:02:50.060> go<00:02:50.390> ahead<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:50.599> use<00:02:50.840> some

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
like this just go ahead and use some

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.479 
like this just go ahead and use some
duct<00:02:51.170> tape<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.739> make<00:02:51.890> sure<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.099> tape<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.310> on

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
duct tape and make sure you tape it on

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.789 
duct tape and make sure you tape it on
both<00:02:52.579> directions<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.420> made<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.410> mistake<00:02:54.769> of

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
both directions I made the mistake of

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.410 
both directions I made the mistake of
actually<00:02:55.720> removing<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.900> ratchet<00:02:57.489> as<00:02:58.489> as<00:02:58.849> the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
actually removing the ratchet as as the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.170 
actually removing the ratchet as as the
bolt<00:02:59.720> broke<00:02:59.989> loose<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.500> use<00:03:00.650> my<00:03:00.769> hands<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.190> to

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
bolt broke loose to use my hands to to

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.150 
bolt broke loose to use my hands to to
loosen<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.019> realize<00:03:03.349> as<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.680> was<00:03:03.799> doing<00:03:04.040> this

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
loosen and I realize as I was doing this

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.180 
loosen and I realize as I was doing this
that<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.430> could<00:03:04.489> easily<00:03:04.760> just<00:03:05.500> drop<00:03:06.500> the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
that I could easily just drop the

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.009 
that I could easily just drop the
extension<00:03:07.730> into<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.120> timing<00:03:08.720> set<00:03:08.900> and

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
extension into the timing set and

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.180 
extension into the timing set and
nothing<00:03:09.230> would<00:03:09.380> prevent<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.799> from<00:03:09.859> falling

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
nothing would prevent it from falling

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.180 
nothing would prevent it from falling
down<00:03:10.489> so<00:03:10.880> I<00:03:11.120> quickly<00:03:11.829> put<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:12.859> right<00:03:13.040> chair

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
down so I quickly put the right chair

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.680 
down so I quickly put the right chair
back<00:03:13.310> on<00:03:13.459> anyway

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
back on anyway

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.379 
back on anyway
I<00:03:15.010> definitely<00:03:16.010> don't<00:03:16.100> want<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.370> do<00:03:16.549> that<00:03:16.700> at

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
I definitely don't want to do that at

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.770 
I definitely don't want to do that at
this<00:03:17.600> time<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:18.319> am<00:03:18.980> planning<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.579> replace<00:03:20.420> the

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
this time I am planning to replace the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.379 
this time I am planning to replace the
phasors<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.620> timing<00:03:21.980> set<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.700> guides<00:03:23.030> and

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
phasors the timing set the guides and

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.930 
phasors the timing set the guides and
the<00:03:23.450> tensioner<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:23.930> very<00:03:24.290> soon<00:03:24.620> I'm<00:03:25.519> just<00:03:25.579> not

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
the tensioner is very soon I'm just not

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.460 
the tensioner is very soon I'm just not
looking<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.359> do<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:26.630> work<00:03:26.780> in<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.079> immediate

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
looking to do that work in the immediate

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.039 
looking to do that work in the immediate
future<00:03:28.040> so<00:03:31.000> anyway<00:03:32.000> once<00:03:32.209> you've<00:03:32.389> got<00:03:32.900> the

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
future so anyway once you've got the

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.900 
future so anyway once you've got the
seal<00:03:33.230> out<00:03:33.440> that's<00:03:33.650> actually<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.549> bulk<00:03:34.730> of

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
seal out that's actually the the bulk of

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.090 
seal out that's actually the the bulk of
the<00:03:35.060> work<00:03:36.370> once<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.459> seal<00:03:37.730> is<00:03:37.760> out<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:39.530> you've

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
the work once the seal is out and you've

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.770 
the work once the seal is out and you've
removed<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.730> t25<00:03:42.130> or<00:03:43.130> loosen<00:03:43.639> the<00:03:43.730> t25<00:03:44.299> as<00:03:44.630> you

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
removed the t25 or loosen the t25 as you

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.379 
removed the t25 or loosen the t25 as you
can<00:03:44.900> see<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.139> t25<00:03:45.680> won't<00:03:45.920> actually<00:03:46.400> fall<00:03:47.359> out

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
can see the t25 won't actually fall out

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:48.789 
can see the t25 won't actually fall out
so<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:47.989> don't<00:03:48.049> have<00:03:48.139> to<00:03:48.260> worry<00:03:48.380> about<00:03:48.560> that

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
so you don't have to worry about that

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.900 
so you don't have to worry about that
it's<00:03:49.069> it's<00:03:49.970> fitted<00:03:50.359> to<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.829> solenoid<00:03:51.829> so<00:03:52.250> my

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
it's it's fitted to the solenoid so my

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.250 
it's it's fitted to the solenoid so my
solenoid<00:03:53.389> came<00:03:53.540> with<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.720> brand<00:03:53.900> new<00:03:53.959> bolt

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
solenoid came with a brand new bolt

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.789 
solenoid came with a brand new bolt
already<00:03:55.130> fitted<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.670> it<00:03:55.849> so<00:03:56.500> like<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:57.620> said

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
already fitted to it so like I said

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.900 
already fitted to it so like I said
that's<00:03:57.920> already<00:03:58.220> installed

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.490 

once<00:04:01.270> you<00:04:01.360> have<00:04:01.480> it<00:04:01.599> installed<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:02.170> found<00:04:02.379> it

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
once you have it installed I found it

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.059 
once you have it installed I found it
very<00:04:03.220> easy<00:04:03.370> to<00:04:03.610> get<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.819> new<00:04:03.970> seal<00:04:04.480> in<00:04:05.440> I

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
very easy to get the new seal in I

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.309 
very easy to get the new seal in I
simply<00:04:06.760> used<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.150> little<00:04:07.330> bit<00:04:07.450> of<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.599> wd-40

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
simply used a little bit of the wd-40

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.490 
simply used a little bit of the wd-40
just<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:09.400> lube<00:04:09.580> it<00:04:09.700> up<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.940> bit

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
just to lube it up a bit

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.890 
just to lube it up a bit
I<00:04:11.580> found<00:04:12.580> this<00:04:12.849> tool<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.360> be<00:04:14.280> essential

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
I found this tool to be essential

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.909 
I found this tool to be essential
essentially<00:04:16.900> this<00:04:17.049> looks<00:04:17.290> like<00:04:17.410> a<00:04:17.440> 24

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
essentially this looks like a 24

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.400 
essentially this looks like a 24
millimeter<00:04:18.100> deep<00:04:18.639> socket<00:04:19.419> impact<00:04:19.959> socket

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
millimeter deep socket impact socket

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.810 
millimeter deep socket impact socket
with<00:04:21.010> an<00:04:21.130> extension<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:22.690> use<00:04:23.110> this<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.820> very

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
with an extension I use this to very

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.480 
with an extension I use this to very
very<00:04:24.940> gently<00:04:25.860> hammer<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.960> seal<00:04:29.500> in<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:30.190> fits

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
very gently hammer the seal in it fits

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.090 
very gently hammer the seal in it fits
perfectly<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:32.050> just<00:04:32.560> want<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.770> make<00:04:32.860> sure<00:04:32.919> you

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
perfectly I just want to make sure you

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.940 
perfectly I just want to make sure you
have<00:04:33.220> something<00:04:33.580> deep<00:04:33.850> enough<00:04:34.229> so<00:04:35.229> that<00:04:35.260> if

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
have something deep enough so that if

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.420 
have something deep enough so that if
you<00:04:36.130> go<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.520> little<00:04:36.850> too<00:04:37.889> too<00:04:38.889> hard<00:04:39.130> on<00:04:39.280> this

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
you go a little too too hard on this

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.730 
you go a little too too hard on this
feel<00:04:39.790> that<00:04:40.090> you<00:04:40.210> don't<00:04:40.330> somehow<00:04:40.870> damage<00:04:41.440> the

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
feel that you don't somehow damage the

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.040 
feel that you don't somehow damage the
electronic<00:04:42.520> component<00:04:43.000> of<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.810> solenoid

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
electronic component of the solenoid

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.950 
electronic component of the solenoid
which<00:04:44.530> is<00:04:44.680> this<00:04:44.830> part<00:04:45.160> here<00:04:45.250> so<00:04:46.210> obviously<00:04:46.780> it

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
which is this part here so obviously it

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.920 
which is this part here so obviously it
should<00:04:47.110> clear<00:04:47.440> perfectly<00:04:48.310> and<00:04:48.820> as<00:04:49.720> you<00:04:49.840> can

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
should clear perfectly and as you can

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.110 
should clear perfectly and as you can
see<00:04:49.990> this<00:04:50.260> is<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.500> little<00:04:50.800> on<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.760> short<00:04:52.000> end

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
see this is a little on the short end

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.850 
see this is a little on the short end
even<00:04:52.450> but<00:04:52.630> I<00:04:52.660> don't<00:04:52.900> think<00:04:53.020> it<00:04:53.229> has<00:04:53.410> to<00:04:53.440> even<00:04:53.770> go

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
even but I don't think it has to even go

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.260 
even but I don't think it has to even go
in<00:04:53.979> that<00:04:54.100> far<00:04:54.280> it<00:04:54.400> probably<00:04:54.729> has<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:54.910> go<00:04:55.060> in

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
in that far it probably has to go in

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.450 
in that far it probably has to go in
like<00:04:55.450> this<00:04:55.750> far<00:04:56.080> they<00:04:56.800> could<00:04:56.919> do<00:04:57.040> a<00:04:57.070> test<00:04:57.220> run

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
like this far they could do a test run

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.510 
like this far they could do a test run
which<00:04:57.700> is<00:04:57.850> what<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.030> did<00:04:58.150> just<00:04:58.510> to<00:04:59.139> make<00:04:59.290> sure

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
which is what I did just to make sure

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.580 
which is what I did just to make sure
you<00:05:00.520> don't<00:05:00.729> bottom<00:05:01.090> out<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:01.450> somehow<00:05:01.630> mangle

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
you don't bottom out and somehow mangle

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.760 
you don't bottom out and somehow mangle
the<00:05:03.660> component<00:05:04.660> at<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.169> end

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
the component at the end

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.080 
the component at the end
so<00:05:06.310> once<00:05:07.120> you've<00:05:07.300> hammered<00:05:08.050> that<00:05:08.350> end<00:05:09.090> you

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
so once you've hammered that end you

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.029 
so once you've hammered that end you
should<00:05:10.150> be<00:05:10.419> good<00:05:10.570> to<00:05:10.720> go<00:05:10.750> guys<00:05:11.169> so<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.740> hope<00:05:11.889> this

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
should be good to go guys so I hope this

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.430 
should be good to go guys so I hope this
video<00:05:12.190> helps<00:05:12.610> you<00:05:12.669> guys<00:05:13.260> sort<00:05:14.260> out<00:05:14.410> your

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
video helps you guys sort out your

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.830 
video helps you guys sort out your
issues<00:05:14.740> with<00:05:14.770> your<00:05:15.010> f150<00:05:15.639> and<00:05:15.880> I<00:05:16.450> hope<00:05:16.720> this
