themselves as to how these tactics works
they're<00:01:32.579> almost<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.970> football<00:01:33.540> plays<00:01:33.840> they

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
they're almost like football plays they

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.840 
they're almost like football plays they
have<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> kind<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.860> rule<00:01:35.310> book<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.700> these

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
have a kind of a rule book of these

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.850 
have a kind of a rule book of these
which<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.240> managed<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.630> hold<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.530> then

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
which we managed to get hold of and then

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770 
which we managed to get hold of and then
play<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.970> my<00:01:39.119> guys<00:01:39.329> are<00:01:39.479> now<00:01:39.540> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> be

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
play so my guys are now going to be

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.390 
play so my guys are now going to be
moving<00:01:39.869> over<00:01:40.110> there<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.040> I'm<00:01:41.159> going<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> use

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
moving over there and I'm going to use

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.999 
moving over there and I'm going to use
them<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.820> flank<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.390> position<00:01:42.810> here<00:01:42.890> we<00:01:43.890> got

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
them to flank this position here we got

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.330 
them to flank this position here we got
some<00:01:44.130> bad<00:01:44.310> guys<00:01:44.490> coming<00:01:44.850> up

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.190 

that<00:01:48.340> was<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.460> hit<00:01:48.700> that's<00:01:48.880> good<00:01:49.119> so<00:01:50.020> now<00:01:50.049> i'm

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
that was a hit that's good so now i'm

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.050 
that was a hit that's good so now i'm
going<00:01:50.290> to<00:01:50.409> get<00:01:50.500> my<00:01:50.530> guys<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:51.070> order<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.909> i'm

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
going to move around this way see if I

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.840 
going to move around this way see if I
can<00:02:02.409> outflank<00:02:02.799> them<00:02:03.039> you<00:02:03.429> can<00:02:03.580> see<00:02:03.700> all<00:02:03.820> the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
can outflank them you can see all the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.669 
can outflank them you can see all the
tracer<00:02:04.149> fire<00:02:04.479> there<00:02:04.780> one<00:02:05.289> thing<00:02:05.470> that<00:02:05.500> we<00:02:05.649> have

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
tracer fire there one thing that we have

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.109 
tracer fire there one thing that we have
in<00:02:05.830> flash<00:02:06.009> point<00:02:06.280> we<00:02:06.429> have<00:02:06.520> real<00:02:06.729> bullets

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
in flash point we have real bullets

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.089 
in flash point we have real bullets
they're<00:02:07.570> actual<00:02:07.899> physics<00:02:08.259> objects<00:02:08.649> they<00:02:08.860> fly

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
they're actual physics objects they fly

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.499 
they're actual physics objects they fly
through<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.399> air<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.789> if<00:02:10.090> they<00:02:10.179> hit<00:02:10.330> anything

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
through the air and if they hit anything

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.809 
through the air and if they hit anything
hard<00:02:10.630> you'll<00:02:11.019> see<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.230> real<00:02:11.470> ricochet<00:02:12.040> those

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
hard you'll see a real ricochet those

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.160 
hard you'll see a real ricochet those
ricochets<00:02:13.300> can<00:02:13.630> be<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.840> little<00:02:13.959> dangerous

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
ricochets can be a little dangerous

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.509 
ricochets can be a little dangerous
though<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:14.769> you've<00:02:14.890> got<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.069> keep<00:02:15.160> an<00:02:15.250> eye<00:02:15.370> up

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
though so you've got to keep an eye up

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.920 
though so you've got to keep an eye up
with<00:02:15.700> them<00:02:17.099> ok<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:19.269> I'm<00:02:19.390> just<00:02:19.540> laying<00:02:19.810> down

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
with them ok so I'm just laying down

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.690 
with them ok so I'm just laying down
some<00:02:20.260> suppressing<00:02:20.799> fire<00:02:20.980> here<00:02:21.280> try<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:21.610> keep

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
some suppressing fire here try and keep

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.690 
some suppressing fire here try and keep
these<00:02:21.850> guys<00:02:22.060> heads<00:02:22.630> down<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.980> hole<00:02:24.190> location

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
these guys heads down this hole location

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.699 
these guys heads down this hole location
is<00:02:24.819> just<00:02:24.850> off<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.360> air<00:02:25.450> coast<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.870> Japan<00:02:26.230> the

is just off the air coast of Japan the
backstory<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.400> game<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> China

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
has invaded this small island because of

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.160 
has invaded this small island because of
his<00:02:30.160> oil<00:02:30.370> resources<00:02:30.880> so<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.660> Marines<00:02:31.959> have

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
his oil resources so the Marines have

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.680 
his oil resources so the Marines have
come<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:32.799> here<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.099> help<00:02:33.280> kick<00:02:34.269> a<00:02:34.360> bit<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.569> up

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
come in here to help kick a bit of up

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.199 
come in here to help kick a bit of up
basically<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.290> saw<00:02:35.410> this<00:02:35.530> stuff<00:02:35.739> out<00:02:36.209> there

basically and saw this stuff out there

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.539 
basically and saw this stuff out there
you<00:02:37.360> go<00:02:37.480> he's<00:02:37.690> down<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.099> be<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.310> safe

explosive grenade one of my favorite
weapons<00:02:44.530> bang<00:02:45.400> there<00:02:45.700> we<00:02:45.790> go<00:02:49.049> let's<00:02:50.049> try<00:02:50.260> again

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
weapons bang there we go let's try again

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.930 
weapons bang there we go let's try again
see<00:02:50.829> if<00:02:50.859> I<00:02:50.980> can<00:02:51.100> get<00:02:51.190> these<00:02:51.310> guys

okay<00:02:54.780> back<00:02:54.960> to<00:02:54.990> my<00:02:55.140> normal<00:02:55.230> bullets<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.770> can

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
okay back to my normal bullets you can

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:05.030 
okay back to my normal bullets you can
see<00:02:55.980> my<00:02:56.100> guys<00:02:56.280> all<00:02:56.520> going<00:02:56.700> in<00:02:56.880> there

so this guy's down we've got a really
really<00:03:10.319> good<00:03:10.560> damage<00:03:10.920> system<00:03:11.219> in<00:03:11.340> flash<00:03:11.549> point

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
really good damage system in flash point

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.209 
really good damage system in flash point
there's<00:03:12.299> no<00:03:12.599> health<00:03:13.140> or<00:03:13.439> hit<00:03:13.680> points<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.099> this

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:14.219 
there's no health or hit points in this

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.009 
there's no health or hit points in this
game<00:03:14.310> what<00:03:15.030> you've<00:03:15.150> got<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.359> eight<00:03:15.569> points<00:03:15.930> of

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
game what you've got is eight points of

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.869 
game what you've got is eight points of
