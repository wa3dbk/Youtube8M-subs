reveal my thinking is there's gonna be
quite<00:04:44.880> a<00:04:44.940> logical<00:04:45.540> officer<00:04:45.900> color<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:46.260> here

quite a logical officer color in here
hope<00:04:47.220> what<00:04:48.440> in<00:04:49.440> theory<00:04:49.860> there<00:04:50.100> should<00:04:50.280> because

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
hope what in theory there should because

00:04:50.640 --> 00:05:10.520
