00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello friends and in this video we 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.189
 consider the model mercedes-benz actros 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.700
 and the trailer that comes with 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.420
 this model and this model it goes like 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.630
 the toy is made of plastic itself 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.460
 the car comes with an inertial motor but 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.310
 however, the model fits perfectly 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.160
 scale 1 to 43 and I have a feeling 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.539
 that the prototype of this model was taken 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.340
 real scale model from 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.010
 producer of skins and just do 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.210
 a simplified version of such a truck and 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.899
 manufacturers of this model if I 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.989
 not mistaken 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.030
 or din chinese or simba unfortunately u 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.809
 I'm not short from the model but on 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.780
 the bottom of the manufacturer model is not specified but 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:59.329
 consider the model first consider 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 tractor very well developed model 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.739
 how do you see the model completely 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.140
 made of plastic it is not painted 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.240
 plastic but nevertheless it is good 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.860
 looks 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.549
 model has rubber wheel tires 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.200
 plastic wheel 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.590
 disc center is a separate part 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.030
 well worked and rear wheels 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.030
 the model has separate rear lights 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.579
 well-designed cabin available 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.799
 rear view mirrors 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.689
 aerodynamic visor wipers on 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.450
 models are molded with the body model 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.200
 the model has a separate icon separate 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.329
 headlights and this model also 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.970
 has an imitation of the engine she has 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.280
 opens the cabin see there is 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.270
 imitation of the motor is of course very simple but 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.899
 nevertheless on there and under this cover 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.049
 is the inertial engine itself and it 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.219
 very well done because in general 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.750
 you don't see him 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.160
 and this is such an engine that is not like you 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.690
 roll back the model and then it rolls 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:20.090
 just a model can roll backwards 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.540
 and forward as detailed 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.660
 bottom 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:30.170
 there is a spare tire as you can see 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:33.220
 well hidden motor model such 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.870
 truck and no less interesting trailer 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.410
 which comes with this 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.840
 by truck it also hits the scale 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:48.350
 made of plastic and 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:53.720
 the trailer has a shop that can 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:58.810
 recline so he stood and also 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.430
 trailer can raise the tank itself 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:08.150
 I understand that this is a tank for 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:11.480
 transport of various chemicals see with 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.940
 the other side of the model has a sleeve 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.000
 also made a separate piece of hoses 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:22.790
 made rubber in the model open 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:29.630
 all the handles you can open and 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:32.840
 want to fill even the tank here 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.720
 such a wonderful model which 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.300
 goes for the price of toys 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.470
 but for the most part is 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.880
 collectible models and thanks for 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.680
 attention this was a review of the model 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.470
 mercedes-benz actros 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.950
 and the trailer that comes with this 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.120
 models
