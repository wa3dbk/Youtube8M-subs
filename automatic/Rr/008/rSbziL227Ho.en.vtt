00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.309
 want to come back as welcome today 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.799
 me a bit with the topic or 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.280
 once again probably trainings 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.960
 to deal with booster and always finds 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.330
 free under the video a bit 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.940
 your workout booster experiences too 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.230
 post or what their use 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.320
 what has the experience good bad 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.520
 general experience so so yes, too 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.080
 let's see maybe there's more 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.270
 things that I may not yet 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.370
 know or have not tried and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.739
 So on and on he says tricks bus 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.899
 a bit in the last few years 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.030
 have come in fashion and are getting younger and younger 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.690
 We do not have to do it this way either 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.579
 do as if somehow would know a little 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.200
 that it is now forbidden 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.149
 Books are forbidden 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.800
 fabrics have whether they are only in 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.570
 Germany are prohibited or worldwide 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.120
 does not matter we do not have to do that now 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.250
 Do not really do that completely 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.500
 easy to order on the internet So yes 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.709
 each of the jec 3d version 1.0 the one 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.499
 knocked off the stool or something 

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:13.889
 would like to order similar finds it 

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:15.929
 also to order on legal ways too 

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:17.670
 if it is forbidden as I said meanwhile 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:19.350
 that 's why you're all just skin 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.139
 booster in a pot that exists both 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.289
 the legal as well as the illegal because im 

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:27.450
 end effect, even if I say evil now 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.829
 pictures do not buy evil yes he does something 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.200
 So you want me too 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.810
 honestly not really if you 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.189
 Look something out of that as well as that 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.329
 you can end up with a 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.039
 Legal booster to the hospital quasi 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:45.509
 Because of that, yes, mine is mine 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.549
 publisher very important should be aware 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.169
 his 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.729
 Why training booster one uses 

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:56.279
 or why you use them 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.469
 and the first and most important is 

00:01:56.279 --> 00:02:01.049
 Training posters are not around 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.700
 somehow to promote muscle development or 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.439
 so you better trained in better 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.119
 quotes could train 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.900
 but like the name of course already 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.760
 she says blow or should you in the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.790
 training 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.799
 So that means when you're almost in cough 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.360
 a deep since if so out 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.890
 any reasons because the day 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.390
 maybe so long because of the stress in 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.790
 school or at work 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.159
 little sleep or just general 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.290
 a bad day homes then occur 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.140
 They should almost make you feel that deep 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.970
 get out and make sure that you 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.989
 still in training still the 100th 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.459
 We can provide training services 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.790
 maybe it would not bring 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.890
 because you just go there and go 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.810
 somehow not in the pushes yes 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.120
 and they are there for them 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.310
 I would say it is 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.370
 is just a motivation if that 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.930
 motivation is not there 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.489
 it just happens because there 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.019
 Different fabrics are used 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.000
 from the very commercial 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.799
 things like caffeine for what 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.290
 Everyone from the café knows in high doses 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.760
 to any things the no 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.519
 can pronounce human where no human 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.470
 because they are unexplored or 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.200
 some things meanwhile 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.310
 of course, but where are you exploring 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.659
 figured out it's okay 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.989
 probably not so good because I do that 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.849
 best thing you can do to the body and 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.739
 accordingly, of course, that is 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.040
 effect also different yes started from 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.530
 the normal on awake effect here 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.699
 For example, caffeine what we now from 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.310
 Of course, she has to get to know her 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:39.889
 all this amphetamine-like 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.510
 effects yes our whole focus comes where 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.449
 It's such a trance 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.669
 state feels and so on and so forth 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.680
 all those weird stuffs and everything 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.959
 that, of course, goes with that as soon as possible 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.940
 simply in training motivates 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.260
 feeling meant cheeks more power jamann 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.730
 you could just keep coach 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.540
 imagine is already long ago and 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.250
 so on and so forth 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.940
 Hungary of which you must be aware 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.829
 that the whole stuff in high quantities 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.949
 always natural for the body one 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.599
 represents extreme stress if you 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:14.329
 not used to that 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.190
 for example, were quite normal café 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.049
 know your fight is used to you 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.349
 a cup on the same day 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.060
 but the more coffee you drink 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:26.800
 more often one uses it eg daily 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.389
 you more the body gets used to 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.440
 You need swing all the more and exactly 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.090
 which also happened a little bit all over 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.370
 Buchsteiner may be enough in the beginning 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.919
 such a scoop or spoon to the pact 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.020
 and at the latest after the fourth 50 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.520
 sixth time which uses every day 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.410
 or whatever go to workout 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.060
 then I chose my body underneath 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.030
 always needs more and more and more 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.350
 and then you just have to think 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.370
 not only with these illegal ones 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.850
 but now with the normal ones 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.190
 whether that really boost in relation to 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.490
 price of course stands and whether you 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.810
 really in the end is so used 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.479
 actually should use because I 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.430
 believe if anyone really in each 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.200
 training unit is not motivated 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.389
 is broken and says I need it now 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.070
 a workout booster of power 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.510
 Generally something falls and the problem lies 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.150
 not at the training book it is easy 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.919
 somewhere else for example sleeping 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.450
 regeneration diet and so on and 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.889
 so on and you might be there sooner 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.350
 look instead of books in which to 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.979
 buy every day with it fully 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.720
 Plug 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.940
 especially at some point I have too 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.479
 has eyes for a long time leads to it 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.979
 a dependency if you then just 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.330
 Before going into training, just go 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.950
 says where do I need my music now 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.440
 you do not have to and edge not 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.580
 Decent training for the head 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.190
 it's just burning 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.460
 it just can not be that way 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.580
 my tip to you, yes, just use it 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.800
 for what they are for, namely for 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.330
 for example, if you have special hard 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.039
 have workouts where he says 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.110
 I have to be very excited right now 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.910
 be focused yes my focus must be 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.130
 Now in this exercise in engineering very much 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.260
 hard or if he really does 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.030
 a bad day you could then yes 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.580
 Definitely definitely use it 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.440
 Of course, only the legal stuff, yes, yes 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.669
 Do not move away from illegal things 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.300
 that someone now says I'm listening now 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.530
 say buys you in other shit because 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.450
 the lega do not say it in vain 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.100
 forbidden 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.590
 and that is the only benefit 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.380
 why you have all the blood and there you have 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.479
 always the whole effect and was 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.340
 it will be over the topic if 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.630
 give a maximum of one unit at all 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.039
 the week that looks like this 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.229
 really say must be infected 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.229
 and that certainly is not the biceps 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.099
 triceps or shoulder unit but 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.449
 understandably maybe one leg 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.819
 day has the bank 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:39.069
 very hard and of course also said 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:41.139
 if only once in a while 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.800
 happen that the day shit 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.960
 ran 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.370
 generally shit feels and speak 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.199
 you can then just with the booster 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.960
 pushing a bit is also 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:51.580
 the only effect will be you 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.020
 It does not make you muscles better 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.240
 world by not bad pattern not 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.860
 not fast muscle building or what 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.479
 Of course, including then of course 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.610
 He takes the puck effect of future 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:03.520
 better then playing for such act 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.039
 or lemons with it is so writes 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.240
 behind the ears so covers the 

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:09.610
 next time before I have any 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.199
 booster and no matter what it is why you 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.389
 Of course, you wanted to get this too 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:16.180
 accordingly expensive and then if you 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:18.729
 decide to go shopping then 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.749
 Use each case wisely 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:22.240
 when do you always have to use 

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:23.770
 this effect is needed and not 15 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.249
 Drink the stuff this week because he 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:30.520
 Sometime you know what I mean 

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:32.439
 did not really fulfill his benefit 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.399
 that was it from me 

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:35.399
 Thank you for watching
