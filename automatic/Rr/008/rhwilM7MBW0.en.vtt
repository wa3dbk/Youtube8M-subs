00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.280 

this<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.370> me<00:02:26.520> doing<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.940> few<00:02:27.540> real<00:02:27.720> polls<00:02:27.930> not

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
this is me doing a few real polls not

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.410 
this is me doing a few real polls not
actually<00:02:28.560> used<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.890> having<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.280> spotter<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:30.390> a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
actually used to having a spotter so a

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.090 
actually used to having a spotter so a
lot<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.840> times<00:02:31.050> my<00:02:31.290> positive<00:02:31.770> might<00:02:31.920> be<00:02:32.070> a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
lot of times my positive might be a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.710 
lot of times my positive might be a
little<00:02:32.310> bit<00:02:32.460> sloppy<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.210> I<00:02:33.270> can<00:02:33.360> get<00:02:33.660> a

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
little bit sloppy just so I can get a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.410 
little bit sloppy just so I can get a
full<00:02:34.460> contraction<00:02:35.460> for<00:02:35.700> all<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.910> fibers<00:02:36.300> from

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
full contraction for all the fibers from

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.030 
full contraction for all the fibers from
these<00:02:36.630> licenses<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.170> negative<00:02:37.650> which<00:02:37.860> is

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
these licenses that negative which is

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.310 
these licenses that negative which is
what<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.400> care<00:02:38.580> most<00:02:38.730> about<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.330> actually<00:02:39.960> drops

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
what I care most about I actually drops

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.840 
what I care most about I actually drops
out<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.650> rope<00:02:40.920> down<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.460> started<00:02:41.700> off

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
out of this rope down and I started off

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.310 
out of this rope down and I started off
pretty<00:02:42.060> damn<00:02:42.300> heavies<00:02:42.630> heavies<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.020> could<00:02:43.170> go

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
pretty damn heavies heavies I could go

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.080 
pretty damn heavies heavies I could go
four<00:02:43.560> by<00:02:43.650> eight<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.010> ten<00:02:44.190> reps<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.760> then<00:02:45.000> I

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
four by eight to ten reps and then I

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.240 
four by eight to ten reps and then I
switched<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.720> up<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.500> really<00:02:46.650> works<00:02:46.950> on<00:02:47.100> my

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
switched it up it really works on my

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.430 
switched it up it really works on my
form<00:02:47.610> then<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.450> did<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.630> exact<00:02:48.990> same<00:02:49.020> thing

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
form then you did the exact same thing

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.770 
form then you did the exact same thing
that<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.620> did<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:50.130> then<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:51.060> just<00:02:51.360> did<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.540> on<00:02:51.720> a

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
that I did and then I just did it on a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.960 
that I did and then I just did it on a
concentration<00:02:52.530> girl<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.250> can<00:02:53.550> just<00:02:53.670> really
