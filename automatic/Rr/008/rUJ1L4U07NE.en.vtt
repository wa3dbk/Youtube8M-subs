00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.970
 in contrast to EM celebration and fitting to the scenario fight intensely after the find 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.209
 were two wars powerful sailing ships can be fuller 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.209
 but plain clothes are well-disposed 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.220
 my fleet consists of small ones 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.499
 in Cuba year and larger 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:23.680
 unlike a threesome 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.270
 because it would also be good and could not be more on the wind direction 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.050
 respect, think highly of 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.259
 In addition, there are no different uses 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.179
 The naval battles are so less complex that is even better than 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.090
 less chips Marko Management requires 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.170
 but that does not mean that it does not use tactical moves 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.350
 The Boku Bayers, for example, are not cannon fodder but damned 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.239
 dangerous 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.710
 because they can shoot in front of him, so do the little things 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.340
 even the plate off 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.479
 However Brandenstein ships should also reduce the rent 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.919
 for the fire can spread to neighboring Kenya who does not pay attention 

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:58.490
 loses its own risk dar so with the same 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.260
 good also that the fire needs to be rechargeable for a long time you need to recharge 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
 «Shoring ships» formats that is undisputed 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.590
 the law little Schleck goes big in Shogun 2 so not always especially 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.390
 not with the important information about 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.090
 because the larger the ship, the more soldiers it has on board 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.870
 my nausea increases 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.250
 a drop in the millions but they are meant to be toddlers 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.880
 already got five times stronger grip on the basic idea to schnetzeln 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.030
 In the meantime, such offices may take up areas 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.540
 Participants meet to move and are further bombarded by the enemy 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.880
 However, if I'm a ship conqueror it can be a fleet then and 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.150
 after the battle against the former owners use 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.120
 but that's not to say the dick ship in Dubai parents over 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.909
 are dangerous 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.869
 They can also free McKellen with their archers heat up the moment 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.780
 wrong word big ships have no fire arrow 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.330
 Nevertheless, you can see their old bullets are even in the ground 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.979
 stuck stuck critical heads 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.139
 this shows how offenders kept dandruff second they represented battles 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.980
 I can behave like Napoleon during the battle of the damaged ships 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.540
 Crew the lessen 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.700
 The DRK have as long as I can fight is clear so should as possible of 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.949
 Keep club away 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:15.209
 and what does school ship crews do after all they have nothing to do at least 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.450
 exactly the boys they sing well as long as they can not Xing I have nothing 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.629
 on the other hand
