moved to collecting fish helicopters for
the<00:00:42.329> very<00:00:42.510> first<00:00:42.719> time<00:00:42.899> my<00:00:43.440> first<00:00:43.770> helicopter

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the very first time my first helicopter

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.700 
the very first time my first helicopter
was<00:00:44.610> Falken<00:00:45.239> 3d<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> 400<00:00:46.530> sites

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
helicopter from our tent and it sucks

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.639 
helicopter from our tent and it sucks
actually<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.449> wasn't<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> helicopters

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
actually but it wasn't the helicopters

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.529 
actually but it wasn't the helicopters
fault<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.219> was<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:53.670> fault<00:00:53.910> because<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.329> was<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
fault it was my fault because I was a

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.630 
fault it was my fault because I was a
beginner<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.620> crashed<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.340> number<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
beginner and I crashed it a number of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.189 
beginner and I crashed it a number of
times<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.180> took<00:00:57.300> me<00:00:57.449> very<00:00:57.629> long<00:00:57.840> time<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
times and took me very long time to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.110 
times and took me very long time to
learn<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.590> realize<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.609> need<00:00:59.879> a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
learn and realize that I need a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.229 
learn and realize that I need a
simulator<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.199> practice<00:01:01.590> well<00:01:02.399> anyway<00:01:02.879> here

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
simulator to practice well anyway here

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.450 
simulator to practice well anyway here
is<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.719> full<00:01:04.170> control<00:01:04.559> 15<00:01:04.860> our<00:01:05.070> tech<00:01:05.280> has

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
is the full control 15 our tech has

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.700 
is the full control 15 our tech has
improved<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.970> helicopters<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> lot<00:01:06.869> my<00:01:07.439> old

plate<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.100> fifth<00:01:11.369> server<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> city

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
plate and a fifth server for the city

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.100 
plate and a fifth server for the city
being<00:01:13.530> set<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.400> one<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.540> different

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
