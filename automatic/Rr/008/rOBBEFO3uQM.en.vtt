00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.870 
place of the linseed oil no other
ingredients<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:59.009> obviously<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.610> lot

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
ingredients so it's obviously a lot

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.760 
ingredients so it's obviously a lot
simpler<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.440> to<00:02:01.979> mix<00:02:02.190> up<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.670> lot<00:02:02.909> less<00:02:03.119> trouble

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
simpler to to mix up a lot less trouble

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.039 
simpler to to mix up a lot less trouble
and<00:02:04.770> then<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.640> your<00:02:05.880> original<00:02:06.450> Johnny

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
and then this is your original Johnny

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.930 
and then this is your original Johnny
clay<00:02:07.259> one<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.920> PVA<00:02:08.220> glue<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.819> is

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
clay one with the PVA glue so this is

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.270 
clay one with the PVA glue so this is
your<00:02:09.090> actual<00:02:09.420> original<00:02:09.750> recipe<00:02:10.289> here<00:02:10.500> apart

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
your actual original recipe here apart

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.500 
your actual original recipe here apart
from<00:02:11.340> mineral<00:02:11.760> oil<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.120> place<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
from mineral oil and place of the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.630 
from mineral oil and place of the
linseed<00:02:12.840> oil<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.760> results<00:02:15.270> are<00:02:16.459> both<00:02:17.459> of

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
linseed oil so the results are both of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.220 
linseed oil so the results are both of
these<00:02:17.730> clays<00:02:18.090> work<00:02:18.450> quite<00:02:18.750> well<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:20.220> Johnny

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
these clays work quite well the Johnny

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.759 
these clays work quite well the Johnny
clay<00:02:22.230> plus<00:02:22.739> riches<00:02:23.610> homemade<00:02:24.000> glue<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.739> what<00:02:25.739> I

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
clay plus riches homemade glue is what I

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.830 
clay plus riches homemade glue is what I
use<00:02:25.950> for<00:02:25.980> most<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.000> project<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:29.840> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
use for most of this project and the the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.780 
use for most of this project and the the
paper<00:02:31.050> pulp<00:02:31.290> plus<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.890> joint<00:02:32.250> compound<00:02:32.640> is

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
paper pulp plus the joint compound is

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.020 
paper pulp plus the joint compound is
what<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:32.970> used<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.630> hand<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.190> can't<00:02:35.190> find

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
what I used for the hand I can't find

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.600 
what I used for the hand I can't find
any<00:02:36.360> difference<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.830> function<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.459> these

any difference in the function of these

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.610 
any difference in the function of these
two<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.030> growth<00:02:39.209> easy<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.810> spread<00:02:40.080> they<00:02:40.440> work

two the growth easy to spread they work

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.240 
two the growth easy to spread they work
quite<00:02:40.890> well<00:02:42.500> they're<00:02:43.500> not<00:02:43.760> as<00:02:44.760> strong<00:02:45.150> as<00:02:45.980> as<00:02:46.980> I

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
quite well they're not as strong as as I

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.100 
quite well they're not as strong as as I

expected<00:02:49.230> from<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.920> descriptions<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.549> your

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
expected from the descriptions on your

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.100 
expected from the descriptions on your
website<00:02:51.090> there's<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.360> couple<00:02:51.510> places<00:02:51.690> where

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
website there's a couple places where

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.199 
website there's a couple places where
you<00:02:52.200> say<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:53.010> extremely<00:02:53.519> hard<00:02:53.910> and

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
you say it's extremely hard and

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.500 
you say it's extremely hard and
extremely<00:02:54.390> strong<00:02:55.850> when<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:56.940> has<00:02:57.090> an<00:02:57.239> armature

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
extremely strong when it has an armature

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.130 
extremely strong when it has an armature
behind<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:59.690> it's<00:03:00.690> all<00:03:00.810> dry<00:03:01.110> and

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
behind it and it's all dry and

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.289 
behind it and it's all dry and
especially<00:03:01.590> once<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.310> covered<00:03:02.730> with<00:03:02.760> gesso

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
especially once it's covered with gesso

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.259 
especially once it's covered with gesso
and<00:03:03.329> then<00:03:03.720> painted<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.410> then<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:06.090> has

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
and then painted and then this has

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.580 
and then painted and then this has
sparked<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.570> varnish<00:03:06.900> on<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.140> other<00:03:07.260> side<00:03:07.470> of

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
sparked a varnish on the other side of

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.800 
sparked a varnish on the other side of
it<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.799> can<00:03:07.920> see<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.250> it's<00:03:08.519> quite<00:03:09.000> solid<00:03:09.269> and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
it you can see it it's quite solid and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.470 
it you can see it it's quite solid and
it's<00:03:10.709> hard<00:03:10.950> for<00:03:11.100> me<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.250> think<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.609> a<00:03:11.790> situation

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
it's hard for me to think of a situation

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.630 
it's hard for me to think of a situation
where<00:03:12.900> where<00:03:13.560> either<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:14.040> these<00:03:14.160> two<00:03:14.400> plays

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
where where either of these two plays

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.220 
where where either of these two plays
wouldn't<00:03:15.120> be<00:03:15.410> strong<00:03:16.410> enough<00:03:16.470> or<00:03:17.280> hard<00:03:17.579> enough

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
wouldn't be strong enough or hard enough

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.990 
wouldn't be strong enough or hard enough
but<00:03:19.230> as<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.620> can<00:03:19.739> see<00:03:19.799> when<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.549> mean<00:03:20.670> it

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
but as you can see when you I mean it

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.360 
but as you can see when you I mean it
these<00:03:21.329> samples<00:03:21.989> kind<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.620> swatches<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.190> the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
these samples kind of swatches of the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.050 
these samples kind of swatches of the
Johnny<00:03:23.579> clay<00:03:23.820> it's<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:25.260> does<00:03:25.470> snap<00:03:26.310> pretty

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
Johnny clay it's it does snap pretty

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.460 
Johnny clay it's it does snap pretty
easily

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
easily

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.740 
easily
both<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.220> these<00:03:29.310> they're<00:03:29.790> they're<00:03:30.329> about<00:03:30.600> the

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
both of these they're they're about the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.270 
both of these they're they're about the
same<00:03:30.989> maybe<00:03:31.170> this<00:03:31.380> one<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.650> even<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.980> little<00:03:32.010> bit

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
same maybe this one is even a little bit

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.130 
same maybe this one is even a little bit
easier<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.730> snap<00:03:33.060> than<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.450> stuff<00:03:33.630> at<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.840> PVA

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
easier to snap than the stuff at the PVA

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.610 
easier to snap than the stuff at the PVA
glue<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:35.480> because<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.630> run<00:03:37.079> across<00:03:37.170> your

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
glue so because I run across your

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.780 
glue so because I run across your
descriptions<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.280> couple<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.519> different

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
descriptions a couple of different

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.840 
descriptions a couple of different
places<00:03:38.940> about<00:03:39.390> how<00:03:39.690> strong<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.380> hard<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.650> was

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
places about how strong and hard it was

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.250 
places about how strong and hard it was
that's<00:03:41.850> why<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.150> went<00:03:42.480> back<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.959> made<00:03:43.109> this

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
that's why I went back and made this

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.250 
that's why I went back and made this
original<00:03:43.739> recipe<00:03:44.040> with<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.280> PVA<00:03:44.579> glue<00:03:45.260> it's

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
original recipe with the PVA glue it's

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.490 
original recipe with the PVA glue it's
quite<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.250> bit<00:03:47.519> stronger<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.299> can<00:03:48.480> see<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.870> it

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
quite a bit stronger you can see it it

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.710 
quite a bit stronger you can see it it
takes<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.920> lot<00:03:50.069> more<00:03:50.100> force<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.880> break<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.600> and

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
takes a lot more force to break it and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.880 
takes a lot more force to break it and
when<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:51.959> does<00:03:52.109> break<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.440> doesn't<00:03:52.709> really

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
when it does break it doesn't really

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.659 
when it does break it doesn't really
snap<00:03:53.720> so<00:03:56.090> here's<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.329> bottom<00:03:57.780> line<00:03:57.959> for<00:03:58.470> me

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
frugality maybe it would be a nice word

for<00:04:08.099> us<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:10.620> like<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.040> avoid<00:04:11.280> using<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.910> great

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
for us and I like to avoid using a great

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
big cup full of PVA glue when I can just

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.650 
big cup full of PVA glue when I can just
because<00:04:15.270> it's<00:04:15.450> fairly<00:04:15.630> expensive<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:18.090> unless

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
because it's fairly expensive so unless

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.509 
because it's fairly expensive so unless

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
I was looking for a situation where I

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.909 
I was looking for a situation where I
need<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:20.700> really<00:04:21.419> strong<00:04:21.450> play<00:04:22.019> maybe<00:04:22.380> if<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.770> was

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
need a really strong play maybe if I was

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.890 
need a really strong play maybe if I was
maybe<00:04:23.760> if<00:04:23.880> there<00:04:24.060> wasn't<00:04:24.300> much<00:04:24.389> of<00:04:24.660> an

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
maybe if there wasn't much of an

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.980 
maybe if there wasn't much of an
armature<00:04:25.260> or<00:04:25.590> something<00:04:26.250> like<00:04:26.400> that<00:04:26.810> or<00:04:27.810> there

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
armature or something like that or there

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.210 
armature or something like that or there
was<00:04:28.080> going<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.260> be<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.410> lot<00:04:28.590> of<00:04:28.620> stress<00:04:28.950> on<00:04:29.100> the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
was going to be a lot of stress on the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.350 
was going to be a lot of stress on the
project<00:04:29.580> I<00:04:29.669> was<00:04:29.700> making<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.150> seemingly

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
project I was making that seemingly

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.150 
project I was making that seemingly
situation<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:30.960> think<00:04:31.080> of<00:04:31.290> where<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:31.740> would

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
situation I think of where I would

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.219 
situation I think of where I would
suggest<00:04:32.460> using<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:34.310> PVA<00:04:35.310> glue<00:04:35.840> in<00:04:36.840> terms

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
suggest using the the PVA glue in terms

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.030 
suggest using the the PVA glue in terms
of<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.560> other<00:04:37.680> two<00:04:37.950> recipes<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:40.530> can't<00:04:40.800> beat

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
of the other two recipes you can't beat

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.120 
of the other two recipes you can't beat
simplicity<00:04:41.850> so<00:04:42.419> the<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:43.139> paper<00:04:43.380> pulp<00:04:43.710> plus

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
simplicity so the the paper pulp plus

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.190 
simplicity so the the paper pulp plus
the<00:04:44.310> joint<00:04:44.580> compound<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.210> just<00:04:45.419> so<00:04:45.690> easy<00:04:45.720> to

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
the joint compound is just so easy to

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.750 
the joint compound is just so easy to
mix<00:04:46.380> up<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.830> was<00:04:46.919> just<00:04:47.780> 50/50<00:04:49.280> paper<00:04:50.280> pulp<00:04:50.550> 2

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
mix up it was just 50/50 paper pulp 2

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.640 
mix up it was just 50/50 paper pulp 2
joint<00:04:50.970> compound<00:04:51.479> and<00:04:51.840> then<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.080> little<00:04:52.290> splash

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
joint compound and then a little splash

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.340 
joint compound and then a little splash
of<00:04:52.919> mineral<00:04:53.250> oil<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:54.300> smooth<00:04:54.720> things<00:04:55.110> out<00:04:55.290> I

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
of mineral oil to to smooth things out I

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:01.010 
of mineral oil to to smooth things out I
guess<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:59.490> still<00:04:59.940> think<00:05:00.300> there's<00:05:00.570> there's

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
guess I I still think there's there's

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.110 
guess I I still think there's there's
some<00:05:01.350> chance<00:05:01.770> that<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.430> presence<00:05:02.820> of<00:05:02.970> the

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
some chance that the presence of the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.020 
some chance that the presence of the
sugar<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:03.720> flour<00:05:04.110> in<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.889> in<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.700> homemade

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
sugar and flour in the in the homemade

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.380 
sugar and flour in the in the homemade
glue<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.600> in<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.900> this<00:05:07.410> recipe<00:05:08.400> will<00:05:09.240> be<00:05:09.360> a

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
glue and in the this recipe will be a

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.440 
glue and in the this recipe will be a
little<00:05:10.320> more<00:05:10.440> attractive<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:11.280> to<00:05:11.729> microbes

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
little more attractive to to microbes

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.510 
little more attractive to to microbes
and<00:05:12.720> moles<00:05:12.900> and<00:05:13.169> so<00:05:13.320> forth<00:05:13.680> this<00:05:14.220> stuff

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
and moles and so forth this stuff

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.310 
and moles and so forth this stuff
doesn't<00:05:14.760> have<00:05:14.970> anything<00:05:15.210> edible<00:05:15.750> in<00:05:15.900> enter<00:05:16.200> or

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
doesn't have anything edible in enter or

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.110 
doesn't have anything edible in enter or
at<00:05:16.380> least<00:05:16.560> nothing<00:05:16.830> tasty<00:05:17.460> there's<00:05:17.729> no<00:05:17.880> sugar

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
at least nothing tasty there's no sugar

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.180 
at least nothing tasty there's no sugar
and<00:05:18.360> no<00:05:18.419> flour<00:05:18.810> in<00:05:19.169> this<00:05:19.710> recipe<00:05:21.350> so<00:05:22.350> I<00:05:22.979> think

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
and no flour in this recipe so I think

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.130 
and no flour in this recipe so I think
I'm<00:05:23.550> I'm<00:05:24.000> gonna<00:05:24.270> be<00:05:24.419> sticking<00:05:24.660> with<00:05:24.840> this

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
I'm I'm gonna be sticking with this
