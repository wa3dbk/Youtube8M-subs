00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.349
 beautiful all the boys are the clothing 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.929
 but of the canal as you can see 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.830
 we are finally after so many months that it 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.570
 expected 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.689
 arrived on the jailbreak dante video 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.910
 rds 7.1.1 the latest versions 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.009
 released then as you can see 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.779
 from the background this is my ipod 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.480
 fifth generation touch on which today 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.360
 I will perform the jailbreak and I am 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.430
 prepared various passages written for non 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.710
 make nothing wrong because you have to do 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.420
 of things detailed step by step 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.489
 then how can you read the first step 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.469
 disable the block with the code 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.449
 we went into settings as you can 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.949
 see these here are and I have the block 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.750
 with code this during the procedure 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.010
 jailbreak is not good so it goes 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.719
 disabled 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.730
 so let's go into settings let's go 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.230
 on code we insert our code e 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.120
 click on disable code 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.370
 click on off and then the king 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.560
 enter our code again 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.790
 expect the node to load slowly 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.900
 and we continue to use the 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.299
 filling of passwords 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.159
 this is the first step the second step 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.509
 is to remove the automatic block as 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.860
 you can see I no longer have the block 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.780
 with the code 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.040
 now the second step is to set place 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.810
 automatic on ever 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.840
 let's go down in general on the block 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.610
 automatic and for a minute we never put 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.470
 now we have completed the two parts 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.430
 most important before making the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.229
 jailbreak 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.960
 I naturally forgot to remember 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.579
 make a backup then we open the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.619
 program 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.840
 now a computer is opening it 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.460
 really very fast questore rome 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.140
 will have writing in Chinese as you can 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.180
 see our computer not having i 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.450
 Japanese kanji as the light points 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.039
 of questions other things my could like 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.869
 ipod 5s 7.1.1 has been recognized and for 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.369
 first thing first thing before 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.740
 Click on the button with the four points 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.630
 of question we have to click on that 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.820
 check that there is at the bottom and remove the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.649
 check from that exact black dot like 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.659
 he is doing so right now 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.630
 we can slowly proceed to click 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.429
 on the jailbreak button 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.810
 nothing now the jailbreak will not start 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.400
 immediately on its own it will be necessary to do something 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.870
 first here the instructions were in a Chinese 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.049
 but don't worry I tell you what 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.730
 go to general settings 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.260
 date and time is gone and brought back 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.140
 the date until the jailbreak does not 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.000
 will start if this does not happen you have to 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.980
 set the date as you can read 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.540
 allow back several months until 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.110
 does not start as an alternative go to 6 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.239
 February Thursday 6 February 2014 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.560
 as you can see it will be slightly 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.480
 stop now there is simply da 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.310
 wait a little bit for the jailbreak 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.019
 part I see I'm not doing 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.670
 absolutely nothing and now I wait 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.560
 simply that the morra brings 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.260
 should when it starts from the various bales 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.370
 about up to half and then stop 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.739
 this means that it is completed 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.109
 precisely in the middle of the median jailbreak 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.069
 ok as you can see the bar is of 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.350
 new stopped in half 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.030
 now I from ipod vesco why 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.739
 we will find a new application from 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.329
 There will be available the first hole seemed 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.430
 the mud application which is the name of 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.049
 this program will not stay there if you 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.220
 people who click on it and continue 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.350
 on the security warning then 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.760
 waiting for this process is a lot 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.260
 speeded up as you can see also 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.659
 by men 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.310
 in the hands of even a handsome 400 percent 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.769
 to say how much to speed up 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.420
 so four times as much because not 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.280
 the teams will be a quick thing 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.709
 it opens I recommend close it because 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.480
 you don't need the ipad right now 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.189
 will start the ipod in my case but with 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.790
 any device on any 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.079
 different and will restart and now yes 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.239
 wait for you to see 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.610
 if I reconnect here now I'm waiting 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.680
 start because we should make a release 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.500
 just the ipod and it will be started 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.329
 then we unlock the video let's say you were 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.819
 accelerated because without touching him he will 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.310
 reboot once again my ipod is 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.230
 an ipod so it takes a while 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.180
 iphone will do all sorts much sooner 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.739
 share because it is more for more 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.760
 fast more for is more handsome with the 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.590
 device 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.900
 once the black bar will be 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.400
 disappearance of the program means 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.590
 that will have ended we could close the 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.940
 our our computer program 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.709
 he was just waiting for ours 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.150
 side is restarted 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.519
 as you can see the ipod has rebooted 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.720
 but my some are gone where they are 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.730
 all my applications there 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.959
 worried we are still in the 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.030
 phone only they have to be 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.720
 so now load now a 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.519
 difference of as a tartasso file of 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.590
 blocks of blocks I left him a 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.820
 moment locked for a few minutes e 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.410
 after a few 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.120
 after a few minutes you will come back to have 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.310
 all your applications as you can 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.110
 see me now unlocking it or again 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.910
 all the apps so slam 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.220
 when the camera because I was 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.050
 forget that it was and how you can too 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.300
 see excessive and finally guys 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.919
 there is also music there are all 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.169
 things since I 'm showing that I have 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.050
 again all my important data 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.190
 they lost nothing so we open up Syria 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.780
 let them prepare the file system is 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.199
 an operation that will last about three 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.910
 minutes 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.979
 Now we have nothing to do nothing 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.150
 simply wait for the preparation 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.110
 of the file system 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.420
 at the end of this preparation 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.970
 at the end this preparation is the ipod 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.490
 and it will reboot itself and once 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.320
 unlocked the ipod this time 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.150
 we will have completed the jailbreak 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.580
