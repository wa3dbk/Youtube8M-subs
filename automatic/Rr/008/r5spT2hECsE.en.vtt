00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.900
 hello i'm at michel haag the 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.380
 creator born guitar mike we are 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.050
 in front of the new range of roxane 25 c 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.020
 this is the historical model of the night this 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.870
 than 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.809
 He drew 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.699
 at 12 o'clock the late eighties and then 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.460
 in the following of the history of the sapling 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.309
 was so absorbed 1 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.900
 cdd that table that if we had left the 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.420
 roxane a little bit 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.920
 in sleep but from afar told us but 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.390
 finally where are the roxane 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.190
 still the mythical model of there 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.019
 there is no question that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.489
 try to sleep too long and there are 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.940
 came to add several ideas 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.890
 firstly the need 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.280
 also vintage definition in the range e 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.770
 beautiful shows what and where the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.590
 need sober colors 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.359
 came first then the meeting on 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.060
 is going to say in quotation marks had the 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:24.880
 passion that we all have gÃ©rard garnier en 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.570
 first and the whole team for the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.159
 beautiful cars 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.719
 so we said to ourselves but here we are 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.609
 maybe something to do that will not 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.920
 as far as the guitars of the years 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.329
 30 and the cars of the 30s so we 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.460
 stayed in the period can leave 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.479
 most contented 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.479
 then came to graft 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.850
 who are in the detail it's not the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.850
 their 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.890
 these guides to take there the real 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.390
 start and there we are really in 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.460
 racing spirit since we have no 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.290
 only the bands with the numbers 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.170
 like cars from when cars 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.060
 race but we pushed the cap a 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.310
 little further we worked for 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.880
 passive nullity plates that are 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.130
 milling and lakes and carei see tonight are 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.320
 in black and then these plates were me 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.930
 parked cuckoo nest currency to stay 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.570
 in the industrial spirit and it's going very 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.220
 well but the concept and the cars we 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.320
 has crom equipment 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.350
 of course like on cars with 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.310
 seymour duncan usa pickups in easel and 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.830
 in mechanics 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.800
 we are on heat we try to 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.420
 stay European for what we can 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.100
 no there we have imperial buttons that 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.590
 are buttons that go very well to 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.900
 spirit level 50 60 of all these 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.150
 guitars the superb talent at the atomic 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.890
 which allows accessibility in 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.100
 treble very particular and a 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.220
 breathing in the sound and then especially 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.990
 end up there never sure no guitar 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.090
 there is a protective back plate 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.250
 electronics also work it's 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.650
 always passive aluminum milling 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.810
 is serious and all these guitars are 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.120
 made in our workshop 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.430
 top of the range of bedarieux in the south 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.830
 of France in the Herault in the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.050
 scrubland of environment it's the 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.610
 olive trees cypresses but here there are also 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.710
 rallies in somewhere we went 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.090
 said it was entirely consistent there 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.730
 will only have guitars made in France 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.920
 and we have two series the series 15 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.220
 200 ie this one with the bad 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:26.610
 ass and body dishes 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.610
 and we have the series 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.220
 to live that she still shapely 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.220
 and me 2
