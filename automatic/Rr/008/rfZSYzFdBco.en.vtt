00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 after 18 years of waiting finally the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.089
 moment has arrived 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.090
 Akira Toriyama returns with a new 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.070
 project called dragon ball super la 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.290
 continuation of dragon ball z that all 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.910
 we want to see or at least that 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.830
 we hope hello little magicians 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.080
 welcome to the channel many thanks 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.029
 for being here I am abrupt and there 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.340
 seen the first episode of the new 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.410
 super dragon ball series I'm not going to 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.970
 say how I did it but if you look for a 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.260
 little bit out there they will find it 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.990
 you too 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.090
 obviously subtitled we start with the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.149
 opening uses a song that we had already 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.950
 could hear in one of the trailers 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.110
 that they had shown us in this series 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.360
 since I heard it in that trailer 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.940
 liked it I did not know it was going to be used in 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.160
 the opening that in fact the opening is what 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.260
 what else reveals about the post that 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.050
 we can see in dragon ball super by 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.969
 example we see a portal that seems to be 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.539
 another dimension something that has already been 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.820
 talked about the virus sandwich as well as wish 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.000
 girl that we still do not know her name and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.920
 Champa this version of chubby bills by 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.750
 another side we can also see a fight 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.180
 of goku and vegeta against 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.580
 an army similar or at least one 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.370
 pair of elements that assimilate to 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.990
 freezer army also advocate 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.370
 fighting something that excites me a lot 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.040
 because he also does not have a 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.350
 transformation of super series link in the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.450
 ribbon the resurrection of frizer one of 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.690
 the elements that bothered me the most 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.600
 I said in my video review liviu was 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.280
 that they catch, it seemed very weak, I have the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.010
 hope that in dragon ball super 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.950
 gohan have a leading role and 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.080
 be strong again let's not forget that the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.570
 things with gohan always work a 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.460
 little further backwards not transformed 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.920
 in super sayayin with what he gives us 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.560
 understand that maybe he's still in his way 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.330
 that liberated him the supreme kai osama 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.880
 What do you think about the other side of 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.700
 characters like jacko and mister satan that 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.440
 apparently they will have some relevance or 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.840
 At least we can see stories 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.270
 parallel and also the one that I get excited 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.910
 a lot of new on screen was koetting 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.070
 one of my favorite characters is 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.280
 fusion is between trunks and got in 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.890
 excellent again see it on screen 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.010
 start the episode remembering the fight 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.230
 against something very nostalgic bug and 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.420
 done they use the original images they 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.310
 note on the quality of the animation the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.800
 history of episode number 1 is 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.800
 practically the same as the manga does not 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.810
 there are many surprises however the 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.660
 moments that we have been most moved by 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.340
 I will comment for example the 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.319
 appearance of bills and wish as they are 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.230
 characters that we have not been able to see much 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.930
 I'm very excited to see new 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.480
 animated images about these 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.540
 characters his appearance is practically 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.730
 the same as in the manga however not 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.620
 I finish understanding and in fact I am 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.410
 making up the idea that the battle of 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.209
 the gods is going to be written that is to say that 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.670
 for dragon ball super very possibly 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.370
 the events of the battle of the gods 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.430
 there is not something that does not finish me 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.950
 please but I think they can maybe with 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.650
 this exploit more the history of these 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.140
 two characters I also tell you that 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.940
 have fun times and dedicate 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.040
 its time to each character something that I 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.300
 it was quite pleasant to remember that this is 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.900
 episode number one 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.550
 we can ask for great battles and 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.770
 transformations should also be noted 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.830
 that in the opening it's funny that we can 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.140
 see the transformation of goku in mode 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.660
 god for a second only then 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.970
 it's a nod to maybe we'll see more 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.150
 go ahead and the episode ends with the 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.460
 supreme callous more with the appearance of 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.950
 bills or feeling the presence of bills 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.020
 and wish practically in the same way 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.390
 which starts the battle of the gods 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.730
 I very possibly insist the battle of 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.620
 the gods will disappear inside the 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.360
 canon since I do not understand how it 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.880
 could accommodate all these events 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.250
 as I mentioned earlier maybe 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.500
 be that all this is happening 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.600
 be the dream cei that mentions bills 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.880
 and suddenly he mentions the Indian super cdi 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.650
 super seiji the truth I have no idea 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.290
 What do you think about the episode? 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.710
 they liked we go with the greetings of this 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.540
