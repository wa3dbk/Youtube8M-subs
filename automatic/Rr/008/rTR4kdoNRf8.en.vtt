00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.049
 All right, I 'm here as a personal 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.710
 moto x I'll give you a tip that 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.509
 It worked for me to improve the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.230
 battery performance 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.500
 day-to-day income and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.660
 applications on the bike x and possibly 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.310
 also other models and high school with 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.099
 android kitkat and install the good is that I 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.730
 I will show you one way using 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:37.280
 that the new boat is you go there in 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:42.140
 settings and set up in case 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.140
 Are you going on the developer side? 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.890
 real programmer and programmer here 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.410
 you will have that option here O 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:59.270
 select government run time with 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:03.140
 two choices using dalvik uses art is the 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.600
 what is this execution time here is one is 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.600
 a method is developed by google 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.360
 still in the experiment phase that 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:16.220
 manages better and from memory 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.640
 of the entire system thus making a 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.500
 improvement in performance and 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.020
 adjustments in battery saving in the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.470
 optimization so it is still in phase 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.970
 and a few applications 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.039
 google play are not yet supported 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.320
 with this art module 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.470
 your phone and by default it is 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.759
 marked and using military dalvik for 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.180
 standard and dalvik mode which is the way 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.460
 comes the factory cell phone is not the way 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.440
 experimental is the already concrete and 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.810
 with the way everyone there has 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.659
 cell phone with android is using without 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.240
 know for who already has the kit installed 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.460
 on the phone especially here on the bike x 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.340
 that my example worked for me 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.229
 I recommend you install it to change 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.830
 and appears to use art 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.600
 the art module I have used it some 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.090
 days 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.860
 some day there is not a week and a half he 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.540
 says I've noticed performance in the 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.380
 Battery worship time is here 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:26.370
 66% and now only one 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.720
 I feel one of the afternoon I did a 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:36.750
 phone including I recorded video is 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.940
 with this phone and I think you're selling 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.320
 there the percentage of battle far from 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.880
 according to the time of day 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.590
 You can see that there is an improvement. 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.860
 quite significant 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.410
 good let's get past the art module is only you 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.210
 see here in this programmer option is 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.730
 click to use art 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.720
 Then your there will ask to start 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.200
 this reboot automatically lasts longer. 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.210
 or less than 25 minutes is because he 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.820
 will start and will be installing all 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.700
 the applications again as if it were a 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.770
 system update stays there 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.870
 installing applications in my case 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.880
 had 200 and few applications it was 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.810
 installed by a drone around 25 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.910
 minutes 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.760
 It's a process that when I got back there 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:25.410
 to the home screen 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.540
 I did not have any mistakes, it's still there 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.880
 during these ten days, the duration of the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.140
 battery life has improved and 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.420
 google normal operation is working 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.300
 play down here app just underneath 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:44.100
 games without any problems 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:46.080
 the application has stopped and do so for 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.170
 account and risk but here is my 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.550
 example my bike x models on change 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.230
 no change of back occurs an original 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.540
 motorola unlocked 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.260
 I never did any multi process in 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.930
 The process of changing his firm is 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.600
 yours if you have already done any 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.910
 I can not tell you if it's worth it or 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.700
 Do not change the art way I know 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.640
 who has not made any changes 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.620
 It's my case I went there cute and 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.660
 configure here has scheduler option 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.740
 and I simply changed it here to use 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.140
 the art mode 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.040
 and it is working perfectly there until 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.760
 the moment 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.700
 I'll tell you guys, what's up? 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.380
 do a test on your own if 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.870
 right and wrong is like 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.510
 I'm commenting on the comment field 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.050
 So that you will be helping me to 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.830
 more ideas on the subject and 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.000
 It will also help in the future 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.190
 testers of this option 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.390
 Good Lets Tip For You Species 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.740
 have enjoyed personal 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.250
 Thank you so much for watching the video. 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.250
 until the next
