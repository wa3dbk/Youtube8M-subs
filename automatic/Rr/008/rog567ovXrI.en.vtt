00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.220 
sound out of and I also owned a 79 JMP
Marshall<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.660> we're<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:52.050> we're

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
Marshall and so as we're as we're

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.439 
Marshall and so as we're as we're
testing<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.649> lot<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> amps<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.789> record<00:00:54.149> and

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
testing a lot of amps for the record and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.670 
testing a lot of amps for the record and
at<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.660> point<00:00:54.899> we'd<00:00:55.020> made<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.199> decision

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
at this point we'd made the decision

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.560 
at this point we'd made the decision
that<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.860> had<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.520> one<00:00:57.059> guitar<00:00:57.210> track

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
that it had to be just one guitar track

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.319 
that it had to be just one guitar track
for<00:00:57.780> each<00:00:57.809> song<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> knew<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.059> that<00:01:00.059> tone

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
for each song so I knew that that tone

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.840 
for each song so I knew that that tone
better<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.719> really<00:01:00.989> good<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:02.129> know<00:01:02.160> because

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
better be really good you know because

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.310 
better be really good you know because
in<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> past<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.449> would<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.690> gone<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.140> would

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
in the past I would have gone in I would

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.600 
in the past I would have gone in I would
have<00:01:04.409> had<00:01:04.500> rhythm<00:01:04.680> tracks<00:01:05.040> maybe<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.489> would

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
have had rhythm tracks maybe that would

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.160 
have had rhythm tracks maybe that would
be<00:01:05.700> double<00:01:06.060> then<00:01:06.180> play<00:01:06.360> melodies<00:01:06.720> oh<00:01:06.990> let's

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
be double then play melodies oh let's

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.740 
be double then play melodies oh let's
double<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.500> let's<00:01:07.830> triple<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
double that let's triple that so the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.149 
double that let's triple that so the
tone<00:01:09.960> could<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.200> good<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.920> know<00:01:11.070> you

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
tone could be good but you know you

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.010 
tone could be good but you know you
started<00:01:11.549> thinking<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.970> thinking<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.750> with

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
started thinking and thinking it with

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.410 
started thinking and thinking it with
with<00:01:13.470> additional<00:01:13.799> tracks<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:15.150> makes<00:01:15.330> it

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
with additional tracks and it makes it

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.450 
with additional tracks and it makes it
easier<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> seat<00:01:16.020> large<00:01:16.200> sound<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.710> but

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
easier to have a seat large sound so but

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.460 
easier to have a seat large sound so but
the<00:01:17.549> Credo<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.330> guitar<00:01:18.630> track<00:01:18.930> whole

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the Credo was one guitar track whole

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.700 
the Credo was one guitar track whole
record<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.990> what<00:01:22.110> ended<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.290> happening<00:01:22.350> we

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
record and so what ended up happening we

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.090 
record and so what ended up happening we
just<00:01:22.740> finally<00:01:23.670> went<00:01:23.850> got<00:01:24.030> down<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.860> running<00:01:25.860> to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
just finally went got down to running to
