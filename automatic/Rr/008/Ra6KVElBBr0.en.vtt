00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
egg has its own individual rate if you

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.730 
egg has its own individual rate if you

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
same chance no matter what even if you

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.260 
same chance no matter what even if you
take<00:04:08.310> out<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.490> pokemon<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:08.880> put<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.090> new

one each egg has a one out of 1200

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.080 
one each egg has a one out of 1200
chance<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.350> becoming<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.830> shiny<00:04:14.070> actually<00:04:15.030> i

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
chance of becoming a shiny actually i

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.199 
chance of becoming a shiny actually i
think<00:04:15.120> it's<00:04:15.390> one<00:04:15.660> out<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.959> 465<00:04:16.919> but<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:18.120> many

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
think it's one out of 465 but so many

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.840 
think it's one out of 465 but so many
people<00:04:18.299> say<00:04:18.660> different<00:04:19.080> you<00:04:19.470> know<00:04:19.560> rates<00:04:19.850> mine

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
but I'm EV training it so yeah that's

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.570 
but I'm EV training it so yeah that's
basically<00:05:15.500> all<00:05:15.830> you<00:05:16.040> have<00:05:16.130> to<00:05:16.190> know<00:05:16.220> but

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
basically all you have to know but

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.430 
basically all you have to know but
remember<00:05:16.850> there<00:05:17.030> is<00:05:17.060> no<00:05:17.450> chain<00:05:17.810> don't<00:05:18.290> worry

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
remember there is no chain don't worry

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.750 
remember there is no chain don't worry
about<00:05:18.590> taking<00:05:18.920> a<00:05:19.100> Pokemon<00:05:19.400> out<00:05:19.580> of<00:05:19.700> the

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
about taking a Pokemon out of the

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.000 
about taking a Pokemon out of the
daycare<00:05:20.150> most<00:05:20.990> importantly<00:05:21.410> just<00:05:21.650> run<00:05:21.860> back

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
daycare most importantly just run back

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.120 
daycare most importantly just run back
and<00:05:22.070> forth<00:05:22.250> stack<00:05:23.180> eggs<00:05:23.510> and<00:05:23.860> make<00:05:24.860> sure<00:05:24.890> you

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
and forth stack eggs and make sure you

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.790 
and forth stack eggs and make sure you
do<00:05:25.280> what<00:05:25.520> I<00:05:25.760> told<00:05:26.120> you<00:05:26.450> to<00:05:26.600> which<00:05:27.140> is<00:05:27.410> you<00:05:27.620> get

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
do what I told you to which is you get

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.530 
do what I told you to which is you get
your<00:05:27.920> bike<00:05:28.070> and<00:05:28.280> you're<00:05:28.850> gonna<00:05:28.940> run<00:05:29.150> to<00:05:29.210> one<00:05:29.480> of

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
your bike and you're gonna run to one of

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.300 
your bike and you're gonna run to one of
the<00:05:29.630> ends<00:05:29.900> i<00:05:29.990> think<00:05:30.170> this<00:05:30.290> end<00:05:30.500> might<00:05:30.740> usually

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
the ends i think this end might usually

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.930 
the ends i think this end might usually
be<00:05:31.610> faster<00:05:32.060> you're<00:05:32.870> gonna<00:05:32.960> run<00:05:33.350> to<00:05:33.670> the<00:05:34.670> bush
