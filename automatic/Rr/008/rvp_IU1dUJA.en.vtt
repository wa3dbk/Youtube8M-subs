00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.500
 times already 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.650
 my name is michael i'm doing peak bay 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.560
 biceps Kiev city with his trainer 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.079
 alexander 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.689
 Hunting here today we have Mikhail 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.630
 training your arms directly biceps and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.279
 triceps we picked the optimal 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.829
 set of exercises according to the method of Yuri 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.200
 Spasokukotsky for training Mikhail 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.620
 there are those exactly planes those exercises in 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.230
 which 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.480
 joints especially and so on all this 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.010
 felt comfortable in which he 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.680
 may work not be injured and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.560
 get the result cyclically stable 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.270
 principle glad to see from the face there is no room 6 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.030
 half a kilogram before after gent 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.160
 ridicule I was not entirely pleased in 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.560
 Moscow triceps so we decided 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.310
 choose suitable exercises for 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.309
 to make a bas-relief of his trainer 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.070
 attentive and competent feels 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.939
 your personal touch and feel 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.060
 a technique that adapts specifically 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.010
 the stones 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.410
 the technique itself is in principle excluded 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.750
 the work of the super sets tones sites and 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.120
 like 3 sites but only when working 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.400
 on muscle mass today's training 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.660
 will be devoted entirely to acquiring 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.770
 the belt today we allow work 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.630
 particular supersets this will be average 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.030
 triceps head and outer head 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.470
 biceps it will be a french bench press 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.470
 Russian bending 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.909
 my 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.200
 I noticed that I became much better 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.250
 feel more power will make more 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.569
 energy in everyday life 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.959
 Michael came to me about nine 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.879
 months ago a full 9 before initially 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.099
 Mikhail's weight was 72 kilograms 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.739
 today on preliminary examples of it 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.010
 weight is already 70 80 half this 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.720
 after one set under then it was drying 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.790
 now we are gaining weight again 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.590
 In principle, all working weights 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.590
 now fall back a little 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.690
 Ryazan 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.200
 on pounds 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.350
 but 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.260
 key indicators of all you exercise 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.330
 were order when we came started 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.140
 engage 2 in my 40 kilogram on 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.020
 six times something like that today 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.630
 Mikhail work 80 kilogram barbell 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.270
 money is working such a site let's say there 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.850
 68 repeat three sets 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.160
 today he did so in principle 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:27.060
 cycling work he when goes on 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.060
 force we get 95 by 1 is 40
