00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
a full moon and an eclipse I mean this

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.930 
a full moon and an eclipse I mean this
one<00:00:30.570> really<00:00:30.779> packs<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.320> wallop<00:00:31.940> absolutely

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
one really packs a wallop absolutely

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.420 
one really packs a wallop absolutely
that<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.329> really<00:00:33.690> touch<00:00:34.260> us<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.010> many<00:00:35.070> ways

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
that can really touch us in so many ways

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.819 
that can really touch us in so many ways
first<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:36.059> all<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.780> emotional<00:00:37.350> moon<00:00:37.590> in

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
first of all the emotional moon in

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.030 
first of all the emotional moon in
Scorpio<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.610> very<00:00:39.270> emotional<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.410> intense

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
Scorpio is very emotional it's intense

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.270 
Scorpio is very emotional it's intense
it's<00:00:41.309> deep<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.210> complex<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.829> full

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
it's deep and it's complex but this full

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.510 
it's deep and it's complex but this full
moon<00:00:44.610> eclipse<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.210> scorpio<00:00:45.239> today<00:00:46.520> involves

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
moon eclipse in scorpio today involves

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.200 
moon eclipse in scorpio today involves
Mars<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.750> Saturn<00:00:49.289> too<00:00:49.950> tough<00:00:50.280> play<00:00:50.550> yeah<00:00:50.969> too

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
Mars and Saturn too tough play yeah too

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.819 
Mars and Saturn too tough play yeah too
tough<00:00:51.480> planets<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.110> they're<00:00:52.230> interesting<00:00:52.739> I

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
tough planets and they're interesting I

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.250 
tough planets and they're interesting I
mean<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.550> fixed<00:00:54.000> eclipse<00:00:54.780> because

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
mean this is a fixed eclipse because

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.500 
mean this is a fixed eclipse because
it's<00:00:55.469> Scorpios<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.430> fix<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.180> moon<00:00:57.360> in

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
it's Scorpios a fix on the moon in

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.779 
it's Scorpios a fix on the moon in
Scorpio<00:00:57.989> Taurus<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> fix<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> sun<00:00:59.760> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
Scorpio Taurus is a fix I and the sun is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.360 
Scorpio Taurus is a fix I and the sun is
in<00:00:59.910> Scorpio<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.140> there's<00:01:01.350> fixed<00:01:01.739> energy<00:01:01.920> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
in Scorpio so there's fixed energy and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.579 
in Scorpio so there's fixed energy and
there's<00:01:02.699> also<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> fixed<00:01:03.449> energy<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:04.080> Saturn

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
there's also the fixed energy of Saturn

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.280 
there's also the fixed energy of Saturn
and<00:01:04.769> Mars<00:01:04.979> involved<00:01:05.640> Mars<00:01:06.150> going<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.960> know<00:01:07.049> do

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and Mars involved Mars going you know do

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.230 
and Mars involved Mars going you know do
it<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.619> Saturn<00:01:07.979> holding<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.580> back<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
it and Saturn holding it back that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.300 
it and Saturn holding it back that
Scorpio<00:01:09.840> intensity<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> moon<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.070> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
Scorpio intensity for the moon that you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.300 
Scorpio intensity for the moon that you
talked<00:01:11.580> about<00:01:11.869> can<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:13.049> very<00:01:13.350> intense<00:01:13.770> but

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
talked about can be very intense but

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.510 
talked about can be very intense but
often<00:01:14.909> Scorpio<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.780> intense<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.920> I'm

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
often Scorpio is so intense if I'm

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.210 
often Scorpio is so intense if I'm
frozen<00:01:17.909> yeah<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.659> now<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:19.259> Saturn<00:01:19.860> right

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
frozen yeah and now with Saturn right

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.850 
frozen yeah and now with Saturn right
there<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.820> moon<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:22.110> doubles<00:01:22.650> that

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
there on the moon it like doubles that

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.399 
there on the moon it like doubles that
down<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.960> hold<00:01:25.259> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
down it's like it really can hold that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.590 
down it's like it really can hold that
energy<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.460> yet<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.150> other<00:01:27.180> side<00:01:27.570> of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
energy in and yet on the other side of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.350 
energy in and yet on the other side of
the<00:01:27.810> coin<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.560> some<00:01:28.920> drive<00:01:29.579> behind<00:01:29.970> it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the coin we have some drive behind it

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.420 
the coin we have some drive behind it
very<00:01:30.840> powerful<00:01:31.140> yeah<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.920> think<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> point

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
very powerful yeah and I think the point

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.359 
very powerful yeah and I think the point
is<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.450> isn't<00:01:33.840> Eclipse<00:01:34.259> about<00:01:34.890> perhaps

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
is that this isn't Eclipse about perhaps

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.810 
is that this isn't Eclipse about perhaps
changing<00:01:35.939> our<00:01:36.090> values<00:01:36.710> reexamining

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
changing our values reexamining

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.200 
changing our values reexamining
financial<00:01:38.820> issues<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.590> making<00:01:40.590> long-term

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
financial issues and making long-term

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.910 
financial issues and making long-term
commitments<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.390> deep<00:01:42.600> change<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.290> easy<00:01:43.560> to

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
commitments to deep change it's easy to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.639 
commitments to deep change it's easy to
get<00:01:44.070> caught<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.610> short-term<00:01:45.090> fear<00:01:45.840> or<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
get caught in short-term fear or in a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.560 
get caught in short-term fear or in a
struggle<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.939> you're<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.360> bother

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
struggle and if you're going to bother

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.749 
struggle and if you're going to bother
putting<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.380> much<00:01:49.770> energy<00:01:50.009> make<00:01:50.729> sure

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
putting out that much energy make sure

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.639 
putting out that much energy make sure
it's<00:01:51.149> for<00:01:51.329> something<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.840> really<00:01:52.049> counts

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649
