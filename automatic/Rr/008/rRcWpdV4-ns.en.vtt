00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.680
 a question of how are they even if 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.750
 I bring you how to make the explosion more 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.990
 epic that can be done minecraft 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.910
 without any way for these little balls I do not 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.400
 they stop being good this thing like if 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.009
 you are epileptic does not do this to me 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.750
 let me eat all these balls I think 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.619
 that I hear very strange that but good and 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.960
 I said it does not happen anything this and well 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.550
 I tell you it's the most epic explosion that 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.860
 it can be done in minecraft without any 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.719
 way and you already know how is the theme 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.550
 of the codes let me explain a 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.829
 little because not like that 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.050
 no no no no know we're not going to do it like that 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.059
 they already know about the codes 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.479
 has come a way of doing that you can 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.129
 plan a monster without life or with 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.530
 zero of life then you already know that the 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.719
 dragon leander when he is with zero 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.609
 life as it explodes does not have an animation 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.189
 and everything you want we will put a 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.159
 dragon so you can notice we were 

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:02.269
 here is the explosion of a dragon 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.970
 exploiting flotillas you know more or less 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.899
 what is this very nice the explosion 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.689
 Well if it looks good or looks good but one 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.819
 search more not a search one seeks to have 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:18.140
 something else not something else but I'm going to something else 

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:20.780
 Well, with this little watch this 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.000
 Well, it's going to repeat the signal, not then 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.580
 they are going to start planning a lot and 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.799
 very many in the dragon that are 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.780
 dying not that they died then 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.720
 let's put good here we can put 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.580
 the delay so they have the stroke 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.040
 let's put him 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.280
 30 the delay let's start with three of 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.780
 delay this let's put this and how 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.930
 can notice is repeating and they are 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.250
 starting to separate what are the 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.270
 dragon teachers are not going to remove 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.410
 this and how you can notice is having 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.960
 a super epic explosion once this one and 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.370
 remember this is without any way this 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.380
 the code can be left in the 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.120
 description so they can use them from 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.800
 themselves and this is where comes 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.990
 epilepsy so I'm going to put it like that for 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.869
 that does not feel so bad because even me 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.630
 my eyes hurt then well then 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.740
 Now let's try to do the same 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.240
 but this one with the maximum that there is here of 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.370
 I mean that there is nothing delayed, so that 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.620
 many will appear then 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.200
 I finished sucking these balls 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.510
 strange that they are raping me this one 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.390
 we will continue because we are already 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.340
 turn now so this has been put in 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.500
 well let's put it at the minimum 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.920
 delay and we will try to make them last 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.440
 how many seconds about seven seconds do not 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.910
 It is putting on the Mannes like crazy 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:48.440
 notice yourself vain 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:50.870
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and yesterday because I think that 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.230
 comes here comes 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.400
 my god see this the examples is that 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.200
 but I have 25 months This is the ugliest 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.989
 when the balls fall there is no when 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.780
 they completely lower me this way 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.760
 appreciate how they saw or is this 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.930
 explosion is great the only 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.000
 problem is that all these balls fall 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:18.909
 oh god oh god m now 10 fps 12 fps is 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.410
 14 is going up a bit working another 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.350
 my god time 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.020
 my god 11 fps is good with care not 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.170
 fall down alen because there is if there is lacquered 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.170
 and 9 fps for good good I will take 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.360
 here I will remove from here god let me 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.050
 leave me even though it has already gone up 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.140
 a few months through and good this is 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.360
 basically the whole most epic explosion 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.310
 what can be done in minecraft 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.400
 currently without any way this 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.050
 I'm doing in 1.7 then already 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.040
 you know if they want to prove it they blame 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.050
 in 1.7 to do it is not before 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.850
 finish I want to tell you to go see 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.460
 this video so you can see how 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.080
 put these these little cupcakes 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.120
 so you can see how these are made 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.240
 web cupcakes and also a small 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.710
 trick that I did around here this can 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.480
 leave a note and if you forget me 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.690
 please remember me because many times 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.980
 He does it again for new entries 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.230
 they are also in the channel not then 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.530
 you know then I'm going to finish this 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.680
 here remember to support for this super 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.110
 Explosion machine without mods then 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.950
 Well, well, this here, so 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.540
 I hope you like it 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.540
 and see you until next time
