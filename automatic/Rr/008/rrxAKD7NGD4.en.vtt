well<00:01:50.640> as<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> little<00:01:51.030> more<00:01:51.149> experience<00:01:51.329> per

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
well as a little more experience per

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.590 
well as a little more experience per
hour<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.990> levels<00:01:52.979> 1<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.189> 20<00:01:53.460> shrimp<00:01:53.700> loves<00:01:54.329> 20

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
hour so levels 1 to 20 shrimp loves 20

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.080 
hour so levels 1 to 20 shrimp loves 20
to<00:01:54.689> 40<00:01:54.899> trout<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:55.829> lolz<00:01:56.009> 40<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.909> 80

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
to 40 trout and then lolz 40 to 80

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.429 
to 40 trout and then lolz 40 to 80
you're<00:01:57.329> gonna<00:01:57.420> want<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.689> lobsters<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you're gonna want to do lobsters and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.069 
you're gonna want to do lobsters and
then<00:01:59.250> from<00:01:59.460> moval<00:01:59.729> 8299<00:02:00.540> you're<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
then from moval 8299 you're going to

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.080 
then from moval 8299 you're going to
want<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.290> do<00:02:01.380> sharks<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.610> reason<00:02:02.820> I'm<00:02:02.909> saying

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
want to do sharks the reason I'm saying

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.440 
want to do sharks the reason I'm saying
that<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.320> because<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.909> know<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.270> when<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
that is because you know if when the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.380 
that is because you know if when the
with<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.869> cooking<00:02:07.049> all<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:08.099> drastically

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
with the cooking all is it drastically

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.330 
with the cooking all is it drastically
decreases<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> amount<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.869> burn<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.340> as

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
decreases the amount you burn and as

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.030 
decreases the amount you burn and as
well<00:02:11.940> as<00:02:12.260> like<00:02:13.260> it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
well as like it

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.360 
well as like it
lowers<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:15.019> minimum<00:02:16.019> required<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.590> stop

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
lowers the minimum required to stop

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.640 
lowers the minimum required to stop
burning<00:02:17.579> so<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:18.569> they're<00:02:18.840> super<00:02:19.109> useful<00:02:19.230> and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
burning so it's they're super useful and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.920 
burning so it's they're super useful and
you<00:02:20.370> know<00:02:20.459> even<00:02:20.670> if<00:02:20.909> you<00:02:21.599> know<00:02:21.689> you<00:02:21.750> stopped

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
you know even if you know you stopped

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.199 
you know even if you know you stopped
burning<00:02:22.109> sharks<00:02:22.409> at<00:02:22.530> 94<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.280> rarely<00:02:23.640> burn<00:02:24.000> any

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
burning sharks at 94 you rarely burn any

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.319 
burning sharks at 94 you rarely burn any
at<00:02:24.480> like<00:02:24.689> 80<00:02:24.959> like<00:02:25.500> 80<00:02:25.739> 85<00:02:26.579> you<00:02:26.939> know<00:02:27.030> whatever

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
at like 80 like 80 85 you know whatever

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
you you don't burn very many you might

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:30.920 
you you don't burn very many you might
