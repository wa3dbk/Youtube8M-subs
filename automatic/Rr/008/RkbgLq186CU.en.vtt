built Windows OS in this case it is
Windows<00:00:13.469> XP<00:00:14.190> which<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> little<00:00:14.969> bit

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
Windows XP which is a little bit

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.830 
Windows XP which is a little bit
outdated<00:00:15.299> but<00:00:15.740> yeah<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.520> first<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.359> all<00:00:18.420> we

outdated but yeah so first of all we

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.050 
outdated but yeah so first of all we
will<00:00:18.990> use<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> bundle<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.189> package<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.880> install

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
will use a bundle to package to install

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.710 
will use a bundle to package to install

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.490 
little prior versions is now deeply
embedded<00:02:43.819> in<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.299> system<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.049> it<00:02:45.170> will<00:02:45.319> be

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
embedded in the system so it will be

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.920 
embedded in the system so it will be
much<00:02:45.680> easier<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:46.190> create<00:02:46.670> some<00:02:47.030> special

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
much easier to create some special

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.600 
much easier to create some special
models<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:50.349> analysis<00:02:51.349> which<00:02:51.799> is<00:02:52.040> maybe<00:02:52.489> a

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
models and analysis which is maybe a

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.080 
models and analysis which is maybe a
little<00:02:52.700> bit<00:02:53.030> more<00:02:53.799> difficult<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.989> yeah<00:02:56.989> so<00:02:58.090> it

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
little bit more difficult and yeah so it

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.270 
little bit more difficult and yeah so it
is<00:03:00.040> more<00:03:01.040> or<00:03:01.160> less<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.930> biggest<00:03:03.500> open

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
is more or less the the biggest open

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.259 
is more or less the the biggest open
source<00:03:06.400> geographical<00:03:07.400> information<00:03:07.549> system

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
source geographical information system

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.990 
source geographical information system
you<00:03:08.360> will<00:03:08.480> find<00:03:08.540> on<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:08.989> market<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:10.000> it's

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
you will find on the market and it's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.430 
you will find on the market and it's
getting<00:03:11.420> better<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:11.930> better<00:03:11.989> with<00:03:12.260> each

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
getting better and better with each

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.789 
getting better and better with each
version<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:14.000> is<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.209> major<00:03:14.780> competitor<00:03:15.590> to

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
version and it is a major competitor to

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.280 
version and it is a major competitor to
