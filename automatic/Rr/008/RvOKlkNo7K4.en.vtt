mine cart yep for the mine carts okay

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:32.060 
mine cart yep for the mine carts okay
that's<00:01:17.310> working<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:30.530> two-stroke<00:01:31.530> engine<00:01:31.950> so

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
that's working and two-stroke engine so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.280 
that's working and two-stroke engine so
it's<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:33.210> very<00:01:33.329> compact<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
it's a little bit it's very compact and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.230 
it's a little bit it's very compact and
it<00:01:34.470> uses<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.009> third<00:01:35.490> piston<00:01:35.820> year<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.090> update

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
it uses this third piston year to update

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.109 
it uses this third piston year to update
I<00:01:36.930> don't<00:01:37.590> know<00:01:37.650> maybe<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.640> maybe<00:01:38.790> want<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
I don't know maybe do you maybe want to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.490 
I don't know maybe do you maybe want to
build<00:01:39.299> up<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> separate<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.930> these<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.350> that

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
build up a separate one of these so that

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:52.130 
build up a separate one of these so that
we<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.710> quickly<00:01:40.860> show<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.490> people<00:01:41.880> out<00:01:51.140> at

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
we can quickly show the people out at

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.569 
we can quickly show the people out at
