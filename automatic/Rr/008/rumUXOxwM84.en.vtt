it off and destroying its ambition which
is<00:02:13.810> okay<00:02:14.080> because<00:02:14.110> we<00:02:14.349> eat<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.530> chart<00:02:14.769> but

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
is okay because we eat the chart but

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.770 
is okay because we eat the chart but

this is a call to both lengthy that's a

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.640 
this is a call to both lengthy that's a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
leaves and the genetics of these two are

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.620 
leaves and the genetics of these two are
hopelessly<00:02:37.000> entangled<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:39.450> what<00:02:40.450> will<00:02:40.599> happen

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
hopelessly entangled so what will happen

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.100 
hopelessly entangled so what will happen
is<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.290> some<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.130> beats<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.580> come<00:02:42.819> up

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
is that some of the beats that come up

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.330 
is that some of the beats that come up
even<00:02:44.110> from<00:02:44.260> this<00:02:44.410> plant<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.950> looks<00:02:45.160> like<00:02:45.310> a

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
even from this plant it looks like a

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.360 
even from this plant it looks like a
yellow<00:02:45.549> beet<00:02:46.140> will<00:02:47.140> be<00:02:47.349> yellow<00:02:47.920> some<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.280> them

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
yellow beet will be yellow some of them

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.940 
yellow beet will be yellow some of them
will<00:02:48.519> be<00:02:48.610> purple<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.120> some<00:02:49.269> of<00:02:49.390> them<00:02:49.510> will<00:02:49.660> be

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
will be purple and some of them will be

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.550 
will be purple and some of them will be
somewhere<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.220> between<00:02:54.989> these<00:02:55.989> as<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.380> can

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
somewhere in between these as you can

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.800 
somewhere in between these as you can
see<00:02:56.769> they're<00:02:57.579> good<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.239> juicy<00:02:58.360> but<00:02:58.690> they're

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
see they're good and juicy but they're

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.930 
see they're good and juicy but they're
not<00:02:58.930> ready<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.349> go<00:02:59.470> because<00:02:59.860> these<00:03:00.069> stems<00:03:00.549> are

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
not ready to go because these stems are

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.000 
not ready to go because these stems are
still<00:03:02.160> flexible<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:04.019> still<00:03:05.019> still<00:03:05.560> going<00:03:05.890> to

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
still flexible and still still going to

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:15.090 
still flexible and still still going to
beat<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.220> seat<00:03:06.670> has<00:03:06.880> not<00:03:07.090> matured<00:03:07.269> yet

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.550 

and<00:03:15.640> once<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:15.880> take<00:03:16.060> these<00:03:16.210> guys<00:03:16.390> in<00:03:16.660> you

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
and once you take these guys in you

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.870 
and once you take these guys in you
don't<00:03:17.740> have<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:18.010> process<00:03:18.250> them<00:03:18.580> at<00:03:18.670> all<00:03:18.760> you

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
don't have to process them at all you

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.880 
don't have to process them at all you
just<00:03:18.910> sit<00:03:19.270> them<00:03:19.420> outside<00:03:19.810> let<00:03:20.350> them<00:03:20.440> dry<00:03:20.650> for<00:03:20.680> a

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
just sit them outside let them dry for a

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.210 
just sit them outside let them dry for a
while<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:21.370> week<00:03:22.180> or<00:03:22.270> so<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:23.100> when<00:03:24.100> they're

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
while a week or so and when they're

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.010 
while a week or so and when they're
dried<00:03:24.550> out<00:03:24.580> then<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.180> just<00:03:25.420> put<00:03:25.810> them<00:03:25.900> in<00:03:25.990> a

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
dried out then you just put them in a

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.160 
dried out then you just put them in a
labeled<00:03:26.380> envelope<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.890> you're<00:03:27.010> done
