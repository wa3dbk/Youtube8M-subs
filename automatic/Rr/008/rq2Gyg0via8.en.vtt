00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.600
 hi to all and now of windows blog 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.430
 Italy today we have an exclusive 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.680
 Italian an accessory that is not yet 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.110
 released on the market will in fact be released 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.630
 next summer we are talking about the 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.220
 kinect air for windows and of course the 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.900
 new version is the same as 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.440
 we find on xbox one 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:40.620
 this is the package and let's go to send it 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:40.620
 to open to cut 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.910
 let's see the developer preview immediately 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:18.590
 obviously it's a version i 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:30.140
 very nice developers the box 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:33.140
 this design and here is here kinect then 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.770
 let's see what the box contains 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:46.510
 on this that the feeder why 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.510
 able the door and then on the bottom 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.180
 various documentation documentation 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.430
 varies 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:01.490
 another feeder then this 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.990
 let's see what is still from 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:10.390
 revenues 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.390
 obviously two different power supplies 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:18.290
 that I informed American with 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.640
 German surprise American outlet like us 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.580
 they are all a bit all cables 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.870
 power supply for the aj is finally the 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:30.830
 usb cable that to this very strange port 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:34.340
 you see what I must sb 3.0 then 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.470
 we see the blue color so let's go to 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.370
 see move the shot from a moment 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.370
 this is kinect 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:55.400
 this color can not be understood if 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.290
 that is, you can remove the other 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.290
 plastichina to remove 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.500
 lecce we must have all the plastic 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.319
 the dimensions are more or less the same 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.109
 of that for xbox one does not change not 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.459
 they change, there is a first sight than later 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:25.849
 maybe we have this support base e 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:30.939
 the camera we will try then with 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.939
 we see the connector the connector 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:37.370
 looks the same as on xbox one 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.319
 obviously the comparison having no sky 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.750
 so he admits we can't do it though 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.470
 it looks very similar if not equal 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.599
 we will then go on to make a comparison 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.829
 direct forward we see the 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:53.569
 coloring with the mind to this reason 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.189
 black and white then with these strips 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.470
 black and white and probably stands to 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.810
 indicate that the device is a device is 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.879
 still in alpha phase so it's not that 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.980
 definitive 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:07.069
 and these the colonists shows launch 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:14.840
 these colors then we have this 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:22.299
 another accessory that probably 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:22.299
 will serve to which it will be connected 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.240
 the kinect from which the port is connected will be connected 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:40.570
 usb 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:42.880
 here we connect the connector e 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.800
 from here we connect the usb cable and then 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.070
 power instead on this side 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.160
 with the hold of course for the country of 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:55.810
 of residence in Italy we have the la 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:05:03.720
 here the various cables the one with the socket 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:03.720
 Italian we are going to open it we find 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.590
 so from here we will go to connect then no 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.070
 water goes to the full-blown air 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.070
 the power supply 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:36.020
 and this has made 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.620
 and then the power supply we're going to connect 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:49.409
 then we have the grip then 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.680
 Italian and from which to connect the 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:55.650
 current here instead of the USB 3.0 socket 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.759
 to connect to the computer he said 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.319
 this is what we can conclude here 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.990
 also because in short there is not much else 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:07.889
 to say of course we will do tests with 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.199
 various sdk released and we will do 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:14.099
 know as soon as expected launch of the 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:17.460
 device this summer so before 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:19.379
 precisely this summer if not who it is not 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.270
 a developer who managed to 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:24.659
 enter the microsoft program not 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.610
 will be able to access this device 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:29.569
 a greeting from grandparents decorated for windows 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.569
