00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
plants are in buckets I got marigold

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:25.030 
plants are in buckets I got marigold
with<00:04:16.730> an<00:04:20.680> experiment<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:23.050> got<00:04:24.050> this<00:04:24.620> teed<00:04:25.010> off

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
with an experiment I got this teed off

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:37.710 
with an experiment I got this teed off
into<00:04:25.670> two<00:04:25.910> buckets

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.820 

their<00:04:38.720> plants<00:04:39.410> are<00:04:39.530> going<00:04:39.770> really<00:04:40.070> well<00:04:40.570> in

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
their plants are going really well in

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:52.180 
their plants are going really well in
that<00:04:42.830> system<00:04:50.500> before<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:51.530> put<00:04:51.770> that<00:04:51.890> in<00:04:52.070> the

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
that system before I put that in the

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.860 
that system before I put that in the
water<00:04:52.340> was<00:04:52.640> green<00:04:55.270> now<00:04:56.270> it's<00:04:56.600> a<00:04:58.630> lot<00:04:59.630> more

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
water was green now it's a lot more
