00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.710
 mister black how are you on the idea 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.960
 come now over part of her 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.590
 exhibition here at the art cologne too 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.480
 dedicate 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.130
 the main reason is his jubilee 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.230
 eightieth birthday this 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.449
 important German artist after 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.580
 1945 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.340
 he is one of the few in his life 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.160
 life's work so consistently its way 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.570
 gone like he barely exists in the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.910
 German art good which euro that 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.100
 means today and applies today to mine 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.660
 personal feelings today to the whole 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.180
 big of the zero movement with fontana with 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.730
 manzoni with all the big ones 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.320
 category on a level which of 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.910
 this work shown is the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.110
 earliest and the finals 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:56.449
 this is this year's work 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:59.449
 In 1964 where he subtly nails the nails 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.449
 stringing together 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.520
 and the nails in such a calm in one 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.850
 equality as one hardly ever 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.189
 to find this work of this early period 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.470
 That's the earliest work then 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.540
 but here is a significant chair 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.539
 so-called the mosque 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.100
 has called is down photo us 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:25.960
 I think that's just work 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.820
 a very important job because he is 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.090
 also 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.940
 the pianos nailed the theme 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.120
 He has chairs that have municipal cash 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.260
 so in his artistic freedom 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.150
 that is really so for me 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.800
 very wonderful work very wonderful 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.650
 and then the highlight of course for 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.000
 me because in rarity calls 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.210
 the self-portrait from the year 1967 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.690
 what is really the timeline in 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.600
 düsseldorf peoples judge and therefore 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.940
 also no white no white sail what 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.850
 typical was in this time but just 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.149
 times the free so unprocessed nails 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.910
 if you really want the pointillism 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.360
 Looked the basis is a foto what 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.060
 he painted over with black paint and 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.670
 then just characterize this grid 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.890
 yes, that's what the dotted through them 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.930
 dark nails he would have white 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.590
 Nails never taken this effect 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.430
 originated and it was in several major 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.050
 Museums exhibited in the time 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.510
 and maybe it's ours 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.510
 a piece of paradise here in our show 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.670
 it is actually the second one now 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.879
 art market in cologne in the time 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.920
 from daniel hug and i am the view 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.920
 that this fair is already on again 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.459
 is a very high level and everyone 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.780
 there is a lot of trouble the corresponding 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.380
 to make a good exhibition 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:11.680
 We are here in a room of Jesus 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:14.530
 soto whose space has the 1967 in krefeld 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.799
 shown in my gallery and if you are 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.200
 Today one has stayed in the room 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.049
 the feeling that is absolutely the time now 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.459
 so made by an artist of 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:31.209
 today actively involved with art and 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:36.750
 but deals with visual problems 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:40.810
 is really just 45 years old and 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:45.760
 still very up to date has one 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:48.519
 big big talk to the people and solve 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.819
 really enthusiasm also out there 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:56.290
 the documentation 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:58.959
 why does 1965 did that in 67? 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.560
 was an art exhibition 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.829
 and architecture the 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.410
 ceiling construction is still 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.660
 original so the time from the bars 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.389
 are also currently the only thing 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.840
 the pearls have been made new 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:20.910
 threads and there is a certificate of it 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:24.760
 and soto is one of the most important 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:28.500
 South American artists worldwide 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:33.010
 have a great view actually next to it 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:36.610
 reli albers max bill and water of 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:42.189

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:45.759
 Male from the last 50 years came 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:49.289
 comes from venezuela and has his has 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:53.349
 but in Paris, the artist lived too 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.610
 1956 with objects but not with 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:58.150
 installation 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.960
 tönis rené in which one as historical 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:05.879

 museum in basel is exhibited and 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:13.180
 one of the really big ones was 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.449
 actually always if such 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.039

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:22.779
 played and have this whole somewhere 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.270
 sides or even with guitars 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:27.789
 the guitar was actually always 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.000
 that breaks play when he was tired and 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:34.590
 but not wider wanted then but guitar 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.590
