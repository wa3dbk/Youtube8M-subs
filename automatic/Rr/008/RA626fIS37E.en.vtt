go so that's that placed close that and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.330 
go so that's that placed close that and
now<00:02:09.540> go<00:02:09.720> straight<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.229> bed<00:02:10.260> fair<00:02:10.710> and<00:02:11.160> we're

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
now go straight to bed fair and we're

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.980 
now go straight to bed fair and we're
going<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.490> lay<00:02:12.950> rochdale<00:02:13.950> at<00:02:14.390> 1.84<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.780> we

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
going to lay rochdale at 1.84 so we

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.070 
going to lay rochdale at 1.84 so we
backed<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.470> at<00:02:16.710> 1.75<00:02:17.660> so<00:02:18.660> what<00:02:18.780> would<00:02:18.900> do

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
backed it at 1.75 so what would do

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.570 
backed it at 1.75 so what would do
quickly<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:19.830> get<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.100> online<00:02:20.400> link

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
quickly is just get the online link

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.550 
quickly is just get the online link
pulse<00:02:20.730> calculator<00:02:21.300> up<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:22.050> Commission<00:02:22.470> is

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
pulse calculator up the Commission is

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.230 
pulse calculator up the Commission is
five<00:02:22.800> percent<00:02:23.340> there<00:02:23.580> you'll<00:02:23.760> see<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.060> better

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
five percent there you'll see it better

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.240 
five percent there you'll see it better
that's<00:02:24.660> what<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.900> starts<00:02:25.200> out<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.010> backed

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
that's what it starts out so we backed

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.770 
that's what it starts out so we backed
at<00:02:26.400> 1.75<00:02:27.110> we're<00:02:28.110> going<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.290> lay<00:02:28.440> at<00:02:28.560> 1.8<00:02:29.100> 4<00:02:29.430> and

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
at 1.75 we're going to lay at 1.8 4 and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.210 
at 1.75 we're going to lay at 1.8 4 and
4<00:02:30.780> 10<00:02:30.960> pounds<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.530> will<00:02:31.650> tell<00:02:31.860> us<00:02:31.890> it's

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
4 10 pounds and this will tell us it's

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.800 
4 10 pounds and this will tell us it's
exactly<00:02:32.550> how<00:02:32.670> much<00:02:32.880> delay<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:33.630> whatever

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
exactly how much delay so whatever

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.930 
exactly how much delay so whatever
happens<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.590> match<00:02:34.770> we<00:02:34.980> return<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.370> exact

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
happens in the match we return the exact

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.660 
happens in the match we return the exact
same<00:02:36.150> amount<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:37.430> 9.78<00:02:38.430> here's<00:02:39.120> what<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.480> is

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
same amount so 9.78 here's what it is

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.530 
same amount so 9.78 here's what it is
nine<00:02:41.670> point<00:02:41.970> seven<00:02:42.150> eight<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:43.100> there<00:02:44.100> we<00:02:44.220> go

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
nine point seven eight and there we go

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.850 
nine point seven eight and there we go
and<00:02:45.540> what<00:02:45.780> we<00:02:45.870> can<00:02:45.990> do<00:02:46.170> now<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:46.350> just<00:02:46.470> place

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
and what we can do now is just place

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.800 
and what we can do now is just place
that<00:02:46.890> lay<00:02:47.660> place<00:02:48.660> pet<00:02:49.050> ad<00:02:49.290> confirm<00:02:50.040> and

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
that lay place pet ad confirm and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.030 
that lay place pet ad confirm and
successfully<00:02:51.810> matched<00:02:52.020> so<00:02:52.680> there<00:02:52.830> we<00:02:52.920> go

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
successfully matched so there we go

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.890 
successfully matched so there we go
that's<00:02:53.280> that's<00:02:53.640> all<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:54.210> need<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.450> do<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:54.780> just

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
that's that's all you need to do so just

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.600 
that's that's all you need to do so just
wait<00:02:55.080> for<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.380> match<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.800> take<00:02:55.980> place<00:02:56.220> and

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
wait for that match to take place and

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.820 
wait for that match to take place and
with<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.820> rochdale<00:02:57.360> win<00:02:58.110> or<00:02:58.320> bristol<00:02:58.680> rovers

with a rochdale win or bristol rovers

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.650 
with a rochdale win or bristol rovers
win<00:02:58.980> or<00:02:59.280> it's<00:02:59.460> a<00:02:59.580> draw<00:02:59.790> we<00:03:00.000> return<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.360> same
