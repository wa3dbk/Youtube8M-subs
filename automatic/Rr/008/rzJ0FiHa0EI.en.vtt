 we will learn new things and we will 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.280
 We spent very well make up ourselves etc 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.280
 etc but good guys 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.670
 the tutorial of how to do an elevator os 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.900
 I'm going to show you a bit how it works 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.630
 what we have to do is simply 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.630
 click here 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.940
 and we're on top of everything in three 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.770
 blocks we have climbed practically about 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.780
 30 blocks I believe above and the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.790
 truth that is a pass and well let's go 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.350
 to see how it is done later with some 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.120
 guys we are back and good what 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.250
 I wanted to say let's not say the first step 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.720
 would be to make a wall, let's not say 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.310
 would do four for four or three for 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.979
 three the truth of equality for let's say 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.720
 have a base for our elevator 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.950
 not as it says here the height does not matter anymore 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.530
 It's a little to your liking 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.690
 let's say the like the great long 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.119
 You want me to be your your sun 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.190
 no and well then already being here now 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.479
 let's do the next part, not so 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.850
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.619
 is to go as a platforms of agreement 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.180
 and now you will see under each platform 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.330
 that will have to be percent in three of 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.940
 three four non 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.130
 of three by four blocks not so 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.820
 then what we will do then is here 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.160
 down just below the ones on the stairs 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.810
 here it does not matter if it is right or 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.730
 left we can do it in both 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.470
 sides we can do this an elevator 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.060
 two what are we going to do now 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.600
 to try a bit like that and then 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:14.160
 on top of this, we will not put 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.120
 two rails as you see there and two of these 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.250
 do not 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.769
 that have moved but we will 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.489
 only one so that we have installed 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.360
 and then if you want to try 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.040
 after having this what we will do 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.739
 will break the block under the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.450
 rail and then then this one will fall down and not 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.980
 because it is the ladder will leave us 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.500
 that falls completely with which it 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.390
 will stay there subject we will not be able to go 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.540
 to try to do the same for the other 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.540
 side 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.520
 it's going to be superchulo 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.950
 if you do not put this what happens from 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.290
 I know 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.290
 this falls and then no longer no longer no longer 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.950
 works but a good example of what 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.440
 we put this in there there is no agreement 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.390
 then we put the ladder down is this 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.819
 mouse is not very good and stays like that 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.500
 and this and then some old age written already 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.170
 having this then we see this as 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.910
 we want we can do floors no 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.920
 which is very good for example me that 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.090
 we have them around here and not all of that 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.610
 but good now what interests us is 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.780
 repeat the process again and that is what 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.240
 let's do so let's go the 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.860
 stairs 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.450
 we put this here 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.520
 the truth is that this elevator is 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.640
 very well is very original and I think I'm going 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.470
 to put in my series survival because 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.470
 I think you could help me a lot 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.749
 if you do not wait, be there 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.720
 in a hurry 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.879
 and we remove it that is below and then 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.879
 we repeat the same process here 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.980
 The truth is that it is one of the three 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:04:00.260
 I like it more because it is very original and 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.230
 well then for when we want to leave 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.150
 of the elevator we do not want to be loved 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.830
 be in this aquino plant and not 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.500
 we can 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.770
 now you will see what I mean and not 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.300
 we can this 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.590
 what we can not get out of here 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.400
 because if we click above we 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:22.620
 we bring down we are interested up 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.229
 what will be d 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.260
 what we will do will be this we will put auto 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.030
 rail up here will not be subject by 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.530
 two blocks agree for example what 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.530
 let here be a yes 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.530
 a no way and then the rail over and through 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.970
 example me that I know all over and if 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.070
 we want for this floor with what we do 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.050
 click on the rail we click on the rail 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.090
 and since we go outside there is no fall 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.280
 because it's not all covered like 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.280
 I should, but if not, well, let's do 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.350
 you will see what you do click and you no longer have 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.660
 or the guys we have liked the 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.250
 tutorial let's try it here that other 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.780
 Once it is very cool and with its porch 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.310
 give to the layman and please me 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.350
 then love the cool as you want here 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.810
 you have a good example of how 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.820
 invest a while trying to cover 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.680
 things like that and then I know about the 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.740
 the base of plants also as 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:19.440
 you organize as you want you can do 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.440
 until a hotel not that tried 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.310
 but good forgiveness so as not to improve 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.639
 dynastics let's try this here 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.639
 as I said 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.430
 come on, it's very cool of vÃ©lez no 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.430
