00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.040
 these names it will not soon 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.960
 Forget the neuwied kujala there were times 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.970
 a very successful petri kujala in 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.240
 the dike city this is janne 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.190
 kujala who played from 2002 to 2006 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.260
 Neuwied is still four years old 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.270
 today a public favorite even if he 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.859
 now in bad nauheim plays but 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.990
 first of all the personalities on the part of the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.850
 defend keeper tim cool fit and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.410
 between the posts also alexander 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.750
 Rodens was back on the bench 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.820
 due to injury, renÃ© sting was missing 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.460
 Stefan Kaltborn and Andreas Halfmann 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.590
 the bears against the red devils 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.420
 were once great duels at the end of the 90s 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.850
 years as navi twice the championship 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.219
 won in the first Bundesliga once 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.230
 of it in the final against bad nauheim the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.149
 times have changed and the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.710
 today's power relations were found 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.440
 faster on the display board again 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.449
 as feared first game minute eddy 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.640
 Rinke meets the 1 0 for the guests 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.379
 until this time had no 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.750
 new player again touches the disc 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.920
 Nevertheless, the one ahead shows the while 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.960
 in a performance increase in the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.940
 compared to 1 0 against dortmund am 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.650
 friday evening but bernd arnold 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.570
 also criticized after this game the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.430
 lack of cleverness of his team in 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.200
 this top league west you can also 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.020
 with a performance boost nonetheless 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.430
 there are not enough chances to resist 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.240
 seldom was the enemy on the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.710
 laces 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.470
 already in the first third of the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.330
 red devil for clear relationships 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.000
 konstantin firsanov met for the 2 0 daniel 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.369
 ketter makes the minute 13 the 13 0 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.060
 Harry Long increased in the 19 minute 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.950
 4 0 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.540
 and because it sounds kind of weird 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.310
 if one says that the keeper nevertheless 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.229
 did a good job here 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.329
 chance the tim cool could parry 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.460
 in sum, but the nauheimer 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.930
 simply to think about the devil fans 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.180
 could be satisfied 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.770
 in the second section of the classes 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.960
 distinguished even more clearly visible 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.579
 bad nauheim combined strongly convinced 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.770
 by skates technically showed 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.000
 just really nice ice hockey that 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.470
 you have to admit without jealousy 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.509
 but who is surprised at one 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.159
 such a squad goalkeeper thomas ober zum 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.200
 example was best in the season before 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.170
 Keeper of the second Bundesliga striker 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.369
 Chris Stanley topscorer in league two 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.350
 other actors changed from the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.329
 bundesliga to the hessian oberligisten 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.280
 Since you may be against a newcomer 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.420
 the regionalliga quite so superior 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.220
 be the one at this 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.990
 and six gates made the red devils 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.360
 in the second third daniel oppolzer 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.270
 alexander tree the ex again patrick 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.980
 shrub daniel ketter tim may and again 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.810
 oppolzer increased to ten to zero 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.670
 the latter cashed in for it 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.800
 mischievous smile of his trainer 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.420
 frank carnevale who buys the tenth 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.370
 he usually shoots a box 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.600
 buy beer 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.370
 Nevertheless, there was also in this third 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.989
 once again bright spots like for example 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.410
 in this account of harry long the 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.120
 parade of ehc keeper tim cool us 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.830
 jump into the last third and start 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.170
 This time with a bright spot namely the 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.450
 honorable strike the bear market flowers hofen 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.459
 prepares for stephan petry meets 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.410
 44 minutes to the 110th 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.120
 even more remarkable was the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.920
 Reaction of fans in the stands 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.569
 not just because of that hit the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.370
 team celebrated loudly 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.560
 a recognition for the tangible 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.330
 the sake of the team against one like that 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.030
 strong opponents like bad nauheim to the 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.040
 Last minute to give everything if so 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.780
 as now, the fans behind us are the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.330
 really made me totally happy that we 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.250
 but still lose the fans 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.410
 reward the fire then have fought 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.370
 I'm not afraid that we will then 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.650
 a few weeks, too 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.109
 success experiences here in points 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.670
 can present the last gates of the 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.280
 guests must not be missing 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.980
 here you are minute 52 alexander tree 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.769
 makes that eleven to one a little later in 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.890
 the 54 minute michael meets to measure 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.269
 12 21 and the last gate this evening 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.489
 went back to the account of 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.890
 defender alexander tree in this 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.019
 match three times hit 13 to one 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.450
 also earned in the amount and absolutely in 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.459
 order bath nauheim was allowed to cheer and 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.160
 on top of that, well , give the praise 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.630
 which bear again and again 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.480
 we have a self-sacrificing 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.799
 Fighting team seen that want 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.060
 we with credit 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.799
 We have fought to the end 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.329
 did not stop playing with what 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.870
 safety not all teams in 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.880
 make the league and we were ready 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.500
 happy with our game we have 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.880
 almost more defenders scored goals 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.650
 as striker scored goals 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.370
 therefore we must continue our 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.980
 exploited opportunities 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.900
 work as usual for good luck 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.180
 This will take care of you and if that is your way 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.070
 go on then will be successful 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.049
 have something for bad nauheim of course 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.639
 if they continue like that 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.250
 the very next sunday the next 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.990
