00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.700
 a very intense match is not 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.559
 indeed I was very high up in the 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.179
 tribune in a box and I do not know you do not live 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.530
 the same as from below with the 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.330
 intensity looks different football 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.759
 from above it is much more spaces 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.829
 you have a much clearer picture of 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.200
 positions or tactical development of the 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:23.400
 match but it 's game intensity not 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.510
 the not life is the same 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.039
 and the one who has not seen the match 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.210
 you can simply say why bored 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.009
 any but what a boring game 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.829
 but I did not get bored lost 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.140
 because we've had I counted 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.720
 up to six clear situations of goal in 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.829
 the glass arch 6 and by the sporting 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.300
 crystal has had like four 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.030
 clear situations of goal in our 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.190
 bow also up to 5 well a match 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.879
 the two teams have come out to propose and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.370
 attack and good at the end the bad aim 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.230
 or the wave or the little efficiency that we have 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.690
 had both sets made that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.869
 I will finish 0-0 I think the more we 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.299
 Strengthen this as a team by giving us 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:02.280
 mind at least I realize that from 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:03.690
 that I can count on the guys from 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.190
 that the boys give the face that the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.380
 guys dare to do things in 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.180
 the court nor to speak of christopher 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.400
 gonzález who made flowers that are also 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.020
 guys because they have audacity but 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.760
 other players are appearing as 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.250
 jordan or mendoza appearing more than 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.390
 real and a central with 18 years that has 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.060
 a great future 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.200
 and that today we have faced one of the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.979
 best equipment that is within 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.540
 our means 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.090
 sporting crystal is one of the best 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.850
 teams and has a template from very 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.560
 good players then that that to me 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.580
 gratifies me and makes me believe that what 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.990
 we are training what we are 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.880
 doing well in that the figures that 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.770
 they are appearing they have conditions 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.630
 to be able to develop in 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.220
 this football and that 's the truth that I 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.950
 leave me quiet we pose 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.290
 a game waiting for the opponent in three 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.210
 there are no rooms trying to take advantage of 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.420
 speed that we have ahead with that 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.890
 flowers and with ramón roig days were 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.810
 that gave him a very clear function and 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.190
 yosimar vargas that was the one to throw is a 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.910
 little bit to the right to cover the 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.750
 exit and youtube 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.520
 I think that YouTube is the player that 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.679
 appears always free on the left 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.479
 that created a lot of danger and the truth that 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.040
 them and margall vargas who meet 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.409
 many very well their function 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.290
 and the team did not change much of a time 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.569
 to another the team and I plan to stop 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.700
 in three quarters waiting to recover the 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.560
 ball in the middle of the court to 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.840
 come out with with cons actions 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.510
 fast seize the speed of both 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.209
 of both forwards that we had and I think 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.250
 me that there are a couple of plays ruiz díaz 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.049
 very clear one to one that goes by 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.640
 right that I concentrated back and that 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.680
 values ​​out that put stressed that the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.329
 ball is passed between the legs and 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.909
 there is another action also a pass from Jason 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.609
 flowers to space that today wins the 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:50.620
 position and it goes towards the area and tops 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.620
 crossed that ends up pulling out not
