00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.169
 that many people like and a 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.810
 character that I love and is the one 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:26.480
 my band and with this clothes I feel very 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.820
 comfortable comes a truck globito the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.669
 balloon if you want to know how to do this 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.989
 Makeup so cool stay 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.430
 with the makeup I think you already know 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.380
 that first thing and expose yourself to 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.570
 contact lenses you know bc4 for the lens 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.570
 the eyes cry then right now I 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.960
 I'm as if I finished the appointment 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.960
 you know 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.640
 Well, I know how and when I was 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.960
 one of those curiosities that have the 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.999
 world in plan how he lived when I 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.190
 then I had to pathetic half but 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:58.579
 yes as panda hero is from a song of 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.929
 mouth like well you do not know very sure that 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.519
 the color of eyes has boom and yes that 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.319
 there are people who put them pink there are people 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.269
 that makes them purple like I do not have 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:07.490
 pink contact lenses because the antilles purple 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.229
 after crying we dry ourselves a little 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.150
 the face that is his thing go and we 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.770
 we put a little baby cream clarita the 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.420
 baby cri we put it all over the face and 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.130
 also by the lips because in panda 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.270
 I turn like and it does not have the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.929
 very lips 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.030
 the deputies have simple then 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:25.039
 as I have them relatively of a 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.120
 strong color strong lips or that 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.460
 cover them a bit 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.040
 let's go with the eyeliner take it and l'armÃ©e 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.290
 very very very finite and you have to do 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.700
 on top eye stripe enteritas 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.090
 He begins doing fine and after 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.090
 thickness 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.960
 exactly the same with the other eye 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.600
 let the corners come out a little 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.350
 because from there, then you're going to open the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.350
 panda ojera 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.840
 your wings to your liking you will like that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.090
 closures like it's not too 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.070
 exaggerated in the end that depends on what 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.990
 you feel like we are going to take a bit of 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.710
 gray shadow clarita and we're going to put it 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.940
 on the part where the eye ends and 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.670
 start the nose I do not know very well 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.980
 explain it let's say that over the 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.080
 tear part because there starts to 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.550
 act and treat and paint in the way that 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.780
 I indicate in the video that a 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.700
 little bit to the nose because that's the way it is now 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.740
 as deep in the face as a gesture of 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.810
 bad jewels to see now we take a gray 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.410
 a little bit darker and we take for the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.410
 same place 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.170
 if you can get a Christian have 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.849
 Glitter like mine, so what's better 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.349
 happens is that my mother said we're going 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.459
 to buy the girl's glitter and that 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.290
 all my eye shadows have 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.510
 glitter or because if you are going to download a 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.240
 little by the eye and you give yourself a little bit 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.920
 the finger if you have a lot 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.410
 now let's take an eye pencil 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.790
 black and let's do the drawing of the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.350
 way where we want the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.970
 dark circles and then does not draw with the 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.470
 skin is that if you want them to be more 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.730
 great because then they simply paint it 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.440
 bigger and if you want it to be more 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.270
 small with a little remove with 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.770
 a washcloth if you see we will be where 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.870
 there was the corner that came out of the eye 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.580
 once we have the two dark circles we take 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.160
 what I think is called eyeliner in 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.660
 gel I found it in a supermarket that 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.760
 there was next to my house in a mercadona 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.140
 but I do not know if Latin America and Mercadona 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.700
 I do not think so then in 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.050
 any supermarket you know how there 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.420
 with a small brush 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.440
 all the eyecups are retained and drawn 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.440
 even under the eyelashes 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.939
 it's not that I've been perfect 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.219
 of the ojera but it is that I have done the 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.109
 makeup and I'm going to take it away 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.549
 to take it from me then it's not the same 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.889
 that like when you go to a manga room 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.540
 they review it a lot that you look 20 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.209
 times and there is the makeup of a post 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.530
 it's like for you to see how it's done 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.630
 from simple 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.490
 and this is what I meant, you can leave 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.180
 little and so you just do more 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.000
 big 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.190
 total if back turn now goo rich 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.490
 and how good we repeat the same with the 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.490
 another eye 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.330
 You see I have not done it very well 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.950
 but in reality they go to the turn is not it 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.800
 that has perfect circles under you if you 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.390
 you look good in the photo is more like 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.550
 that will be painted there we started about 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.500
 rebels as we are fed up with the turn of 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.900
 the false eyelashes you already know the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.390
 process is a little bit of glue 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.070
 for eyelashes the fans well with much 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.360
 art and flamenco and is the eye 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.610
 has seen that these are a little more 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.080
 striking and it's because in panama turns and 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.600
 that has a very high upper lashes 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.680
 like wow amazing once you put the 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.160
 two false eyelashes 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.710
 let's catch pig with the pig 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.250
 pencil the black pencil and we are going to draw 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.600
 the bottom line on the inside that is that 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.919
 I got a bit out of plan this is not 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.900
 I had noticed going to take 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.850
 green shadow and then I realized 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.620
 that this green shadow was too much 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.509
 clear for my wig but I realize 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.250
 then when I had done it like that 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.380
 I said good because this one already holds 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.729
 but look carefully at the color of yours 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.729
 wig to catch the shadows 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.850
 this theory even of gomis can be 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.140
 apply for any character from 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.670
 vocal icon that if for example wanted 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.320
 to do it of my quota is to put blue shadow 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.140
 if I wanted to wear a luca making 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.820
 pink in the end that you like 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.800
 my wig of a and how was a little more 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.760
 dark then this green that was very 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:20.540
 comfortable my god what the hell happened to me 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.310
 but go repeat the essence is mine 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.290
 I have beautiful, she gave us a little 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.110
 of mascara for the eyelashes and now only 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.350
 you need to wear the wig you wear your 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.640
 accessory and ready 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.500
 you know what the cap is 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.450
 because as the wig itself is stubborn to 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.830
 the cap that narrows it touches me to 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.360
 the doubles and I feel the head a 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.360
 super interesting pressure 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.180
 and now 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.710
 astana 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.660
 life 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.970
 for the video of the lay maybe for some 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.159
