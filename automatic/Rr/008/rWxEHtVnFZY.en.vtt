tamaak<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.719> think<00:00:10.530> it's<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.769> hunt<00:00:10.920> for<00:00:11.010> the

tamaak I think it's a hunt for the
decepticons<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:12.210> think<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.320> what<00:00:13.530> it's

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
decepticons I think is that what it's

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.700 
decepticons I think is that what it's
called<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.040> don't<00:00:14.610> know<00:00:14.730> generations<00:00:15.710> there

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
called I don't know generations there

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.640

missiles<00:01:35.450> saw<00:01:37.729> already<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:40.590> transformation

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
missiles saw already the transformation

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.270 
missiles saw already the transformation
is<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:42.450> know<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:43.380> confused<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:44.009> I'm

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
is you know I get confused because I'm

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.090 
is you know I get confused because I'm
nice<00:01:44.490> /<00:01:44.729> 2020<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.479> easy<00:01:46.290> transformations

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
nice / 2020 and easy transformations

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.050 
nice / 2020 and easy transformations
often<00:01:47.759> confuses<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.390> hell<00:01:48.509> out<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.689> me<00:01:50.060> so

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
often confuses the hell out of me so

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.450 
often confuses the hell out of me so
let's<00:01:51.810> go<00:01:51.899> ahead<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.590> collapses<00:01:53.250> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
let's go ahead and you know collapses I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.649 
let's go ahead and you know collapses I
think<00:01:53.850> that's<00:01:54.060> how<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.240> was<00:01:54.299> supposed<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.570> be

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
think that's how it was supposed to be

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.060 
think that's how it was supposed to be
in<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.810> first<00:01:54.960> place<00:01:55.170> these<00:01:55.439> up<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.860> that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
in the first place these up like that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.070 
in the first place these up like that
right<00:01:56.840> collapse<00:01:57.840> ease

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
right collapse ease

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.560 
right collapse ease
and<00:01:59.200> uh<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:02.730> go<00:02:03.730> ahead<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:03.970> raise<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.300> wings

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
and uh and go ahead and raise the wings

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.820 
and uh and go ahead and raise the wings
here<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.230> then<00:02:05.590> when<00:02:06.040> we<00:02:06.660> start<00:02:07.830> pulling

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
here and then when we start pulling

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.150 
here and then when we start pulling
stuff<00:02:09.869> start<00:02:10.869> pulling<00:02:11.020> stuff<00:02:11.230> yeah<00:02:11.950> that's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
stuff start pulling stuff yeah that's

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.400 
stuff start pulling stuff yeah that's
what<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.310> do<00:02:12.810> it's<00:02:13.810> pretty<00:02:13.930> much<00:02:14.080> what<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.320> do

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
what I do it's pretty much what I do

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.320 
what I do it's pretty much what I do
when<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.680> get<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.220> transform<00:02:16.030> around<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.270> the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
when I get the transform around of the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.780 
when I get the transform around of the
packager<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.840> start<00:02:17.050> bawling<00:02:17.320> stuff<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
packager to start bawling stuff and

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:29.370 
packager to start bawling stuff and
eventually<00:02:19.860> eventually<00:02:24.480> ya<00:02:28.110> get<00:02:29.110> haters

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
eventually eventually ya get haters
