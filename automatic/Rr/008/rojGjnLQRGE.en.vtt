00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
straight this curved like a movement I

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.209 
straight this curved like a movement I
will<00:01:57.299> admit<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.200> part<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.860> getting<00:01:59.070> it

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
will admit this part of it getting it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.209 
will admit this part of it getting it
off<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.549> very<00:01:59.790> tight<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:01.530> was<00:02:01.710> at<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.950> time

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
off is very tight it was at this time

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.039 
off is very tight it was at this time
and<00:02:03.380> sometimes<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:05.570> one<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.689> these<00:02:06.810> bits

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
and sometimes this one of these bits

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.040 
and sometimes this one of these bits
keeps<00:02:07.320> popping<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:07.860> which<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.250> annoying<00:02:08.520> but

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
keeps popping up which is annoying but

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.440 
keeps popping up which is annoying but
yeah<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.830> connects<00:02:11.250> by<00:02:11.550> two<00:02:11.610> pegs<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
yeah so it connects by two pegs on the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.210 
yeah so it connects by two pegs on the
top

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
top

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.010 
top
and<00:02:14.220> two<00:02:14.400> holes<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:15.000> will<00:02:15.270> slide<00:02:15.780> between

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
and two holes it will slide between

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.089 
and two holes it will slide between
these<00:02:16.440> two<00:02:16.650> yellow<00:02:16.980> bits<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.550> then<00:02:17.580> peg<00:02:18.510> in

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
these two yellow bits and then peg in

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.970 
these two yellow bits and then peg in
that<00:02:20.099> becomes<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.520> weapon<00:02:20.640> later<00:02:21.709> very<00:02:22.709> nice

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
that becomes a weapon later very nice

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.979 
that becomes a weapon later very nice
transformation<00:02:23.730> it's<00:02:23.880> quite<00:02:24.030> quite<00:02:24.569> decent

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
transformation it's quite quite decent

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.270 
transformation it's quite quite decent
really<00:02:25.940> these<00:02:26.940> are<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.330> robot<00:02:27.630> legs<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:28.280> they

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
really these are the robot legs but they

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.979 
really these are the robot legs but they
do<00:02:29.340> look<00:02:29.610> different<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.180> straighten<00:02:30.840> up

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
do look different you just straighten up

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.120

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.320 
the knees like so then these two panels
are<00:02:35.190> pegged<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.610> with<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> peg<00:02:36.720> just<00:02:37.680> there<00:02:38.330> you

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
are pegged in with a peg just there you

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.290 
are pegged in with a peg just there you
bring<00:02:39.569> it<00:02:39.600> out<00:02:40.250> rotate<00:02:41.250> round<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:41.970> back<00:02:42.090> of

same with a toe on this one we rotate it

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.680 
same with a toe on this one we rotate it
further<00:03:29.100> than<00:03:29.340> rotate<00:03:29.730> at<00:03:29.820> 0<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.239> there<00:03:30.570> we

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
further than rotate at 0 and there we

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.170 
further than rotate at 0 and there we
have<00:03:32.690> we<00:03:33.690> have<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.079> robot<00:03:34.290> legs<00:03:34.940> minus<00:03:35.940> and

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
these claws come out the fans do rotate

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.750 
these claws come out the fans do rotate
some<00:04:29.020> reason<00:04:29.380> I<00:04:29.470> don't<00:04:29.530> know<00:04:29.770> why<00:04:29.889> they<00:04:30.699> do

in there and then once you've got them
out<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.040> outfits<00:04:36.490> rotates<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.300> then<00:04:37.389> you<00:04:37.540> can

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
out the outfits rotates and then you can

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.439 
out the outfits rotates and then you can
have<00:04:37.840> to<00:04:38.530> close<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:39.130> but<00:04:39.430> I<00:04:39.699> don't<00:04:40.150> know<00:04:40.300> what

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
have to close that but I don't know what

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.050 
have to close that but I don't know what
that's<00:04:40.690> for<00:04:41.699> God<00:04:42.699> knows<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:45.460> then<00:04:45.639> I<00:04:45.820> pushed

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
that's for God knows and then I pushed

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.240 
that's for God knows and then I pushed
it<00:04:46.180> back<00:04:46.330> in<00:04:46.510> and<00:04:46.900> basically<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.740> final<00:04:48.070> thing

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
it back in and basically the final thing

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.840 
it back in and basically the final thing
is<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.850> just<00:04:49.060> gently<00:04:50.160> unclip<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.310> head<00:04:51.520> and

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
is to just gently unclip the head and

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.070 
is to just gently unclip the head and
then<00:04:52.360> bring<00:04:52.840> it<00:04:52.930> round<00:04:54.180> like<00:04:55.180> so<00:04:55.479> it<00:04:55.750> doesn't

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
then bring it round like so it doesn't

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.390 
then bring it round like so it doesn't
go<00:04:56.169> right<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.530> way<00:04:56.620> in<00:04:56.770> because<00:04:57.010> as<00:04:57.220> well<00:04:57.340> as

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
go right the way in because as well as

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.940 
go right the way in because as well as
you<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.550> pull<00:04:57.910> these<00:04:58.270> pegs<00:04:58.660> out<00:04:58.900> here<00:04:59.139> and

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
you and pull these pegs out here and

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.070 
you and pull these pegs out here and
basically<00:05:00.160> that's<00:05:01.000> it<00:05:01.300> sits<00:05:01.600> a<00:05:01.690> little<00:05:01.780> bit<00:05:01.990> in

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
basically that's it sits a little bit in

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.590 
basically that's it sits a little bit in
the<00:05:02.169> way<00:05:02.350> but<00:05:03.340> that's<00:05:03.639> the<00:05:03.790> robot<00:05:04.150> mode<00:05:04.330> these

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
the way but that's the robot mode these

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.719 
the way but that's the robot mode these
arms<00:05:05.080> on<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.229> back<00:05:05.500> and<00:05:05.800> just<00:05:05.919> go<00:05:06.130> every<00:05:06.520> like

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
arms on the back and just go every like

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.510 
arms on the back and just go every like
and<00:05:07.020> then<00:05:08.020> it's<00:05:08.169> got<00:05:08.380> a<00:05:08.410> feature<00:05:08.800> where<00:05:09.160> you

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
and then it's got a feature where you

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.300 
and then it's got a feature where you
just<00:05:10.210> rotate<00:05:10.600> at<00:05:10.720> once<00:05:10.930> and<00:05:11.410> you<00:05:12.040> get<00:05:12.190> the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
just rotate at once and you get the

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.440 
just rotate at once and you get the
maximal<00:05:12.760> sign<00:05:13.060> then<00:05:13.600> rotate<00:05:14.050> it<00:05:14.169> again<00:05:15.450> and

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
maximal sign then rotate it again and

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.100 
maximal sign then rotate it again and
you<00:05:16.539> get<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:17.610> Predacons<00:05:18.610> sign<00:05:18.970> which<00:05:19.870> can't

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
you get the Predacons sign which can't

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.710 
you get the Predacons sign which can't
really<00:05:20.320> see<00:05:20.500> that<00:05:20.620> well<00:05:20.740> it's<00:05:20.860> purple<00:05:21.720> because

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
really see that well it's purple because

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.279 
really see that well it's purple because
he's<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:22.900> predator<00:05:23.430> maximum<00:05:24.430> mexitil<00:05:25.150> sign<00:05:25.389> so

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
he's a predator maximum mexitil sign so

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:27.779 
he's a predator maximum mexitil sign so
there<00:05:26.530> is<00:05:26.560> it<00:05:26.889> robot<00:05:27.160> mode<00:05:27.340> with<00:05:27.550> various

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
there is it robot mode with various

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:33.029 
there is it robot mode with various
weapons<00:05:29.789> this<00:05:30.789> thing<00:05:31.120> you<00:05:31.360> just<00:05:31.600> um<00:05:32.470> peg<00:05:32.889> the

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
weapons this thing you just um peg the

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.270 
weapons this thing you just um peg the
two<00:05:33.220> panels<00:05:33.789> and<00:05:34.780> then<00:05:35.260> this<00:05:35.380> one<00:05:35.440> comes<00:05:35.919> down

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
two panels and then this one comes down

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.680 
two panels and then this one comes down
like<00:05:37.000> so<00:05:37.330> fold<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:38.160> nubbin<00:05:39.160> in<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:39.700> basically

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
like so fold the nubbin in and basically

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.370 
like so fold the nubbin in and basically
that's<00:05:41.229> a<00:05:41.410> gun<00:05:42.150> and<00:05:43.150> this<00:05:43.660> piece<00:05:43.960> is<00:05:44.139> the

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
that's a gun and this piece is the

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.230 
that's a gun and this piece is the
trigger<00:05:44.680> that<00:05:44.800> fires<00:05:45.250> out<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.639> missile<00:05:46.030> and

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
trigger that fires out the missile and

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.040 
trigger that fires out the missile and
to<00:05:47.050> hold<00:05:47.260> it<00:05:47.530> just<00:05:47.889> you<00:05:48.220> just<00:05:48.720> move<00:05:49.720> the<00:05:49.870> claw

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
to hold it just you just move the claw

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.240 
to hold it just you just move the claw
back<00:05:50.349> then<00:05:50.560> you<00:05:50.650> just<00:05:50.830> slide<00:05:51.450> there's<00:05:52.450> to<00:05:52.660> like
