 good morning everyone welcome to this 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.050
 new video in which we will see how 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.540
 publish an application completely 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.090
 free on the ios platform in the 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.610
 appstore let's go blank 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.220
 puntocom and we will go to the section 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.019
 plans and prices here will appear 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.239
 all the plans and the money that we 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.980
 we will spend a month there is a plan totally 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.949
 free that is the one that I am going to comment 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.980
 what is creating an application with a 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.110
 update to the month with advertising is 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.860
 say all the others are without advertising 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.780
 but this one will be with advertising 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.629
 part of the developer in this case 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.530
 white dotcom and also no limit of 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.300
 downloads and without push notifications 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.280
 We will be able to send notifications to 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.780
 the people who see us there are also 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.289
 to keep in mind that we will not have 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.320
 purchases in app on the other hand we can 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:09.330
 publish it in the ones that I'm going to 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.840
 explain now to android and amazon 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.460
 and we can use our own account of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.590
 developer let's see what 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.690
 conditions ask us to have this 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.370
 totally free application we have to 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.220

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.400

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.550
 the matter free plan within 48 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.659
 hours the plan will be activated by the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.460
 white team 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.200

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.270
 will solve them and any 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.100

 contact through their social networks and little 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.640
 thing more to tell this is a way 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.920
 very simple so we have to do 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.140
 look at the username that we 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.090
 we have configured to look at the name of the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.250
 application in this case because as you are 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.500
 watching here is already a android copping 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.989
 we would say that we have the account via 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.289
 tf to abbiate android copy and our plan 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:09.849
 would be activated few things more to say
