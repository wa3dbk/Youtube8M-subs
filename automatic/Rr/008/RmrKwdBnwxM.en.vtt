00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
of the stand as well so you can take a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.280 
of the stand as well so you can take a
look<00:00:37.200> at<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.219> first<00:00:38.430> legs<00:00:38.820> open<00:00:39.329> up<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.690> PG

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.610 
42 does look quite nice such a legendary
performance<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.450> I'm<00:00:45.660> hoping<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.590> a

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620

performance so I'm hoping that is a
legendary<00:00:47.160> because<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510

legendary because I do like the
legendary<00:00:48.960> things<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.610> very<00:00:50.789> easy<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
legendary things so this is very easy to

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.410 
legendary things so this is very easy to
open<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.539> slide<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:53.270> there<00:00:54.270> are

part<00:02:24.629> of<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.900> yet<00:02:25.049> taken<00:02:25.739> we've<00:02:26.190> got<00:02:26.489> this<00:02:26.910> spot

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
part of it yet taken we've got this spot

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.460 
part of it yet taken we've got this spot
with<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.569> mic<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.110> then<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.410> be

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
with a mic in and then it can be

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.800 
with a mic in and then it can be
adjusted<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:31.129> you<00:02:32.129> can<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:32.970> different

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
adjusted so you can have it different

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.470 
adjusted so you can have it different
angles<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.650> see<00:02:34.799> they<00:02:34.950> which<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.060> really<00:02:36.329> nice

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
angles and see they which is really nice

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.030 
angles and see they which is really nice
because<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.840> was<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:37.140> like<00:02:37.290> one<00:02:37.560> angle<00:02:37.980> and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
because it was just like one angle and

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.830 
because it was just like one angle and
it's<00:02:38.670> gonna<00:02:38.819> be<00:02:38.910> irritating<00:02:39.390> at<00:02:39.480> times<00:02:39.510> I

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
it's gonna be irritating at times I

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.089 
it's gonna be irritating at times I
don't<00:02:40.019> know<00:02:40.079> how<00:02:40.140> good<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.440> thing<00:02:40.500> picks<00:02:40.950> up

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
don't know how good this thing picks up

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.270 
don't know how good this thing picks up
sound<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.120> voice<00:02:42.359> but<00:02:42.720> I'm<00:02:43.319> guessing<00:02:44.040> that

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
sound and voice but I'm guessing that

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.089 
sound and voice but I'm guessing that
this<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.790> pretty<00:02:45.209> good<00:02:45.389> model<00:02:45.950> they<00:02:46.950> don't

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
this is a pretty good model they don't

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.140 
this is a pretty good model they don't
keep<00:02:47.310> though<00:02:47.459> I'm<00:02:47.609> sure<00:02:47.790> there's<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:47.970> lot<00:02:48.060> of

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
