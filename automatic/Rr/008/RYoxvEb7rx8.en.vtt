had<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.590> kind<00:03:43.860> of<00:03:43.950> like<00:03:44.900> English<00:03:45.900> team<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.350> you

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
had a kind of like English team and you

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.690 
had a kind of like English team and you
find<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:46.680> they've<00:03:46.890> got<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.220> most<00:03:47.370> pious

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
find that they've got the most pious

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.509 
find that they've got the most pious
players<00:03:48.300> especially<00:03:48.510> Darren<00:03:48.959> Bent<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.519> Defoe

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
players especially Darren Bent and Defoe

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.970 
players especially Darren Bent and Defoe
though<00:03:50.790> just<00:03:51.420> really<00:03:52.170> solid<00:03:52.680> players

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
though just really solid players

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.820 
though just really solid players
and<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:54.269> think<00:03:54.510> he<00:03:54.690> goes<00:03:54.900> for<00:03:55.230> nila<00:03:55.530> doesn't

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
and I think he goes for nila doesn't

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.560 
and I think he goes for nila doesn't
have<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:55.950> really<00:03:56.340> nice<00:03:56.459> shot<00:03:56.760> from<00:03:57.150> him<00:03:57.360> there

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
have a really nice shot from him there

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.540 
have a really nice shot from him there
in<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.870> first<00:03:58.560> half<00:03:58.830> all<00:03:59.040> that's<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.459> the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
in the first half all that's in the

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.170 
in the first half all that's in the
second<00:03:59.910> half<00:04:00.090> then<00:04:00.450> I<00:04:01.489> get<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.519> goal<00:04:02.730> in<00:04:02.940> the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
second half then I get a goal in the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.940 
second half then I get a goal in the
it's<00:04:03.989> not<00:04:04.110> a<00:04:04.170> close<00:04:04.350> game<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.590> was<00:04:04.769> wrong

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950

shin-bi the shooting and stuff were

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.020 
shin-bi the shooting and stuff were
quite<00:04:17.859> equal<00:04:18.190> butted<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:18.729> that<00:04:18.880> doesn't

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
quite equal butted that that doesn't

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.819 
quite equal butted that that doesn't
really<00:04:19.239> make<00:04:19.389> a<00:04:19.449> difference<00:04:19.660> then<00:04:20.530> into

really make a difference then into

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.980

another<00:04:20.889> game<00:04:21.430> against<00:04:22.000> this<00:04:22.150> guy<00:04:22.300> who's<00:04:22.690> got

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
another game against this guy who's got

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.460 
another game against this guy who's got
a<00:04:23.820> mix<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:25.030> players<00:04:25.300> he's<00:04:25.570> got<00:04:25.750> a<00:04:25.780> gaku

a mix of players he's got a gaku

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.909 
a mix of players he's got a gaku
footprint<00:04:26.979> and<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:27.850> see<00:04:28.090> here<00:04:28.330> he<00:04:28.810> pauses<00:04:29.560> it

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
footprint and you see here he pauses it

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.480 
footprint and you see here he pauses it
and<00:04:30.729> I<00:04:30.820> speed<00:04:31.150> this<00:04:31.300> up<00:04:31.540> and<00:04:32.169> he<00:04:32.620> brings<00:04:32.949> on

scores kind of annoying but then I go to
the<00:04:48.100> other<00:04:48.250> end<00:04:49.229> Derek<00:04:50.229> gets<00:04:50.470> ahead<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.860> his

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280

massive<00:04:51.639> head<00:04:52.030> which<00:04:52.389> he<00:04:52.539> seems<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.810> be

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
massive head which he seems to be

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.230 
massive head which he seems to be
scoring<00:04:53.139> quite<00:04:53.320> a<00:04:53.350> lot<00:04:53.500> of<00:04:53.590> those<00:04:53.880> to<00:04:54.880> make<00:04:55.030> it

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
scoring quite a lot of those to make it

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.610 
scoring quite a lot of those to make it
1-all<00:04:56.820> ham<00:04:57.820> Dow<00:04:58.000> he<00:04:58.060> gets<00:04:58.419> through<00:04:58.720> stops<00:04:59.380> and

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
1-all ham Dow he gets through stops and

1-all ham Dow he gets through stops and
finishes<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:00.310> in<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:00.699> make<00:05:00.850> it<00:05:01.060> 2-1<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:03.490> and

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
finishes it in to make it 2-1 and and

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.150 
finishes it in to make it 2-1 and and
this<00:05:04.510> is<00:05:04.720> just<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:05.139> proof<00:05:05.410> that<00:05:05.650> if<00:05:05.800> you<00:05:05.949> do

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
this is just a proof that if you do

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.129 
this is just a proof that if you do
bring<00:05:06.400> on<00:05:06.550> those<00:05:06.669> players<00:05:06.940> it's<00:05:07.180> not<00:05:07.360> gonna<00:05:07.570> be

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
bring on those players it's not gonna be

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.320 
bring on those players it's not gonna be
an<00:05:08.229> instant<00:05:08.650> win<00:05:08.830> I<00:05:08.860> don't<00:05:09.190> see<00:05:09.370> why<00:05:09.520> people<00:05:10.000> do

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
an instant win I don't see why people do

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.640 
an instant win I don't see why people do
bring<00:05:10.720> on<00:05:10.840> playing<00:05:11.110> like<00:05:11.260> that<00:05:11.380> it's<00:05:11.470> kind<00:05:11.620> of

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
bring on playing like that it's kind of

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.000 
bring on playing like that it's kind of
a<00:05:11.710> cheap<00:05:11.949> way<00:05:12.160> of<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:13.770> pretending<00:05:14.770> to<00:05:14.919> have

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
a cheap way of the pretending to have

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.560 
a cheap way of the pretending to have
bad<00:05:15.250> players<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:15.789> then<00:05:15.880> bringing<00:05:16.060> on<00:05:16.270> all<00:05:16.389> the

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
bad players and then bringing on all the

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.260 
bad players and then bringing on all the
good<00:05:16.720> ones<00:05:17.460> but<00:05:18.460> there's<00:05:18.850> nothing<00:05:19.120> that<00:05:19.240> can

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
good ones but there's nothing that can

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.460 
good ones but there's nothing that can
do<00:05:19.450> and<00:05:19.570> then<00:05:19.660> he<00:05:19.720> brings<00:05:19.840> out<00:05:20.050> his<00:05:20.110> keeper

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
do and then he brings out his keeper

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.560 
do and then he brings out his keeper
there<00:05:20.620> I<00:05:20.650> have<00:05:20.740> no<00:05:21.010> idea<00:05:21.190> why<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:21.849> was<00:05:22.090> in<00:05:22.180> the<00:05:22.270> 90

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
there I have no idea why I was in the 90

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.820 
there I have no idea why I was in the 90
minute<00:05:22.720> doesn't<00:05:23.169> make<00:05:23.260> much<00:05:23.349> difference<00:05:23.410> but

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
minute doesn't make much difference but

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.089 
minute doesn't make much difference but
that<00:05:23.919> was<00:05:24.039> fall<00:05:24.250> on<00:05:25.020> another<00:05:26.020> quite<00:05:26.889> good

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
that was fall on another quite good

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.570 
that was fall on another quite good
scoring<00:05:27.460> game<00:05:28.320> and<00:05:29.320> I<00:05:29.830> think<00:05:30.220> there's<00:05:30.370> one

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
scoring game and I think there's one

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.089 
scoring game and I think there's one
more<00:05:30.760> game<00:05:31.030> this<00:05:31.240> episode<00:05:31.690> yes<00:05:32.680> against
