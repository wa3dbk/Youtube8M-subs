his email and posted to Twitter now keep
in<00:00:28.050> mind<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.529> not<00:00:28.560> confirmed<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.429> any<00:00:29.640> way

in mind this is not confirmed in any way

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.120 
in mind this is not confirmed in any way
possible<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.449> don't<00:00:30.660> interpret<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.619> video<00:00:31.890> as

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
possible so don't interpret the video as

possible so don't interpret the video as
being<00:00:32.489> confirmed<00:00:33.030> now<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> assignment<00:00:34.320> is

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
being confirmed now the assignment is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.430 
being confirmed now the assignment is
called<00:00:35.100> bad<00:00:35.520> new<00:00:35.940> world<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> icon<00:00:37.260> for

called bad new world and the icon for

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.290 
called bad new world and the icon for
this<00:00:37.559> assignment<00:00:37.860> was<00:00:38.250> scratched<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:39.000> which

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
this assignment was scratched out which

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.209 
this assignment was scratched out which
seems<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.690> little<00:00:39.930> suspicious<00:00:40.350> but<00:00:40.829> again<00:00:41.070> we

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
seems a little suspicious but again we

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.220 
seems a little suspicious but again we
don't<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.460> any<00:00:41.790> confirmation<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.629> how<00:00:42.840> legit

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
don't have any confirmation on how legit

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.650 
don't have any confirmation on how legit
this<00:00:43.379> actually<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.940> Jack<00:00:45.149> thinks<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.570> a

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
this actually is now Jack thinks it's a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.750 
this actually is now Jack thinks it's a
fake<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.200> looks<00:00:46.350> fake<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.770> me<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.129> well<00:00:47.399> but

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
fake and it looks fake to me as well but

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.520 
fake and it looks fake to me as well but
it<00:00:47.850> got<00:00:48.000> me<00:00:48.180> thinking<00:00:48.210> about<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.899> possible

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it got me thinking about a possible

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.040 
it got me thinking about a possible
nuclear<00:00:49.829> scenario<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.940> final<00:00:51.360> stand<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
nuclear scenario in final stand and

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.290 
nuclear scenario in final stand and
other<00:00:52.199> features<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.800> another<00:00:53.039> bomber<00:00:53.399> so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
other features like another bomber so

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.779 
other features like another bomber so
the<00:00:54.629> requirements<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.559> bad<00:00:55.890> new<00:00:56.340> world

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the requirements for bad new world

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.389 
the requirements for bad new world
consist<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.719> surviving<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> nuke<00:00:58.710> detonation

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
consist of surviving the nuke detonation

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.360 
consist of surviving the nuke detonation
ten<00:00:59.730> times<00:01:00.059> destroy<00:01:00.660> 20<00:01:01.140> b-52<00:01:02.039> with<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
ten times destroy 20 b-52 with the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
ten times destroy 20 b-52 with the
stinger<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.000> destroy<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> enemy<00:01:04.320> drone

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
stinger and destroy the enemy drone

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.340 
stinger and destroy the enemy drone
command<00:01:05.220> now<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:05.970> exactly<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.840> these<00:01:06.990> mean

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
command now what exactly do these mean

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.590 
command now what exactly do these mean
well<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.189> one<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.460> might<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:08.939> getting<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.299> new

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
well for one we might be getting a new

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.109 
well for one we might be getting a new
Club<00:01:09.930> Aleutian<00:01:10.320> event<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.799> final<00:01:11.400> stand<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
Club Aleutian event in final stand and

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.510 
Club Aleutian event in final stand and
how<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> look<00:01:13.110> at<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.920> there<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.220> actually

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
how I look at it is if there is actually

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.429 
how I look at it is if there is actually
some<00:01:14.670> kind<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.939> nuclear<00:01:15.299> events<00:01:16.080> then<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
some kind of nuclear events then it

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.350 
some kind of nuclear events then it
might<00:01:16.710> limit<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> boundaries<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> map<00:01:18.180> in

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
might limit the boundaries of the map in

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.630 
might limit the boundaries of the map in
the<00:01:18.450> areas<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:19.140> go<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> now<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.460> would

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the areas you can go to now this would

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.789 
the areas you can go to now this would
kind<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.119> make<00:01:21.299> sense<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:21.780> nuclear<00:01:22.409> event

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
kind of make sense because nuclear event

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.920 
kind of make sense because nuclear event
aftermaths<00:01:23.400> usually<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:24.090> hot<00:01:24.330> zones<00:01:24.659> where

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
aftermaths usually have hot zones where

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.870 
aftermaths usually have hot zones where
you<00:01:24.990> can't<00:01:25.229> travel<00:01:25.530> there<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.040> mean<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.729> look

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you can't travel there I mean just look

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.730 
you can't travel there I mean just look
at<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> Chernobyl<00:01:27.689> incident<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.290> example

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
at the Chernobyl incident for example

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.289 
at the Chernobyl incident for example
it's<00:01:28.860> been<00:01:28.920> about<00:01:29.130> 30<00:01:29.460> years<00:01:29.820> since<00:01:30.150> that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
it's been about 30 years since that

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.120 
it's been about 30 years since that
meltdown<00:01:30.840> happened<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.530> there<00:01:31.680> are<00:01:31.770> still

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
meltdown happened and there are still

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.640 
meltdown happened and there are still
areas<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:32.700> high<00:01:32.909> radiation<00:01:33.299> counts<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.619> I

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
areas with high radiation counts so I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.469 
areas with high radiation counts so I
think<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> how<00:01:35.369> dice<00:01:35.610> would<00:01:35.909> conduct<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
think that is how dice would conduct a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.539 
think that is how dice would conduct a
sort<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.840> nuclear<00:01:37.320> LEvolution<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.340> DLC

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
sort of nuclear LEvolution in this DLC

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.520 
sort of nuclear LEvolution in this DLC
because<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.540> take<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.780> look<00:01:39.960> at<00:01:40.110> link<00:01:40.320> hang

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
because if you take a look at link hang

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.980 
because if you take a look at link hang
dam<00:01:40.770> for<00:01:41.009> example<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:42.090> LEvolution<00:01:42.479> blocks

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
dam for example the LEvolution blocks

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.410 
dam for example the LEvolution blocks
off<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.380> roadways<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.280> dice<00:01:44.610> might<00:01:44.850> focus<00:01:45.240> on

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
off a roadways so dice might focus on

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.120 
off a roadways so dice might focus on
blocking<00:01:45.720> off<00:01:45.990> some<00:01:46.259> parts<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.890> maps

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
blocking off some parts of the maps

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.639 
blocking off some parts of the maps
because<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.030> radiation<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.990> mean<00:01:49.500> we've

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
because of this radiation I mean we've

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.620 
because of this radiation I mean we've
seen<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:50.009> type<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.340> LEvolution<00:01:50.909> plenty<00:01:51.540> of

siege<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.509> Shanghai<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.320> operation

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
siege of Shanghai and operation

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.469 
siege of Shanghai and operation
firestorm<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.549> crane<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.820> blocks<00:01:57.210> off<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
firestorm with a crane that blocks off a

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.139 
firestorm with a crane that blocks off a
road<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.920> DLC<00:01:59.460> does<00:01:59.700> include<00:02:00.119> some

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
road so if this DLC does include some

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.330 
road so if this DLC does include some
kind<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.659> nuclear<00:02:00.930> LEvolution<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.950> think<00:02:02.250> it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
kind of nuclear LEvolution I think it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.950 
kind of nuclear LEvolution I think it
would<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> great<00:02:02.909> way<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.119> end<00:02:03.390> battlefield

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
would be a great way to end battlefield

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.410 
would be a great way to end battlefield
fours<00:02:04.200> life<00:02:04.469> cycle<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.880> next<00:02:06.119> thing<00:02:06.329> I

I will throw up a picture of a b-52 on

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.870 
I will throw up a picture of a b-52 on
your<00:02:13.680> screen<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.130> can<00:02:14.280> kind<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.520> see<00:02:14.730> what

your screen so you can kind of see what
I'm<00:02:14.970> talking<00:02:15.450> about<00:02:15.530> now<00:02:16.530> if<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.800> do<00:02:16.920> remember

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
I'm talking about now if you do remember

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.640 
I'm talking about now if you do remember
the<00:02:17.400> h6<00:02:18.150> bomber<00:02:18.480> from<00:02:18.780> China<00:02:19.080> rising<00:02:19.319> that

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the h6 bomber from China rising that

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.110 
the h6 bomber from China rising that
bomber<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:20.040> absolutely<00:02:20.670> huge

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
bomber is absolutely huge

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.820 
bomber is absolutely huge
so<00:02:21.450> picture<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:22.020> but<00:02:22.230> about<00:02:22.410> two<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.800> three

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
so picture that but about two to three

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.370 
so picture that but about two to three
times<00:02:23.190> larger<00:02:23.520> that's<00:02:23.910> how<00:02:24.060> huge<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.630> b-52

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
times larger that's how huge a b-52

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.770 
times larger that's how huge a b-52
bomber<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.830> now<00:02:26.550> if<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:26.910> bomber<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.390> actually

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
bomber is now if this bomber is actually

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.420 
bomber is now if this bomber is actually
included<00:02:28.020> with<00:02:28.410> final<00:02:28.770> stand<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.250> all<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
included with final stand and all the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.940 
included with final stand and all the
info<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.850> legit<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.420> doubt<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.800> never

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
info is legit I doubt it but you never

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.420 
info is legit I doubt it but you never
know

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
know

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.280 
know
then<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.000> final<00:02:33.390> stand<00:02:33.600> maps<00:02:33.840> are<00:02:34.050> going<00:02:34.200> to

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
then the final stand maps are going to

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.260 
then the final stand maps are going to
be<00:02:34.380> pretty<00:02:34.620> vast<00:02:35.010> probably<00:02:35.730> about<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.060> same

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
be pretty vast probably about the same

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.660 
be pretty vast probably about the same
size<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.930> China<00:02:37.260> rising<00:02:37.530> maps<00:02:37.950> now

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
size that the China rising maps now

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.580 
size that the China rising maps now
could<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.060> new<00:02:39.239> bomber<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.810> overpowered

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
could this new bomber be overpowered

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.680 
could this new bomber be overpowered
well<00:02:40.950> I'm<00:02:41.220> sure<00:02:41.580> it'll<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:41.790> about<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.239> same

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
well I'm sure it'll be about the same

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.229 
well I'm sure it'll be about the same
damage<00:02:43.080> model<00:02:43.500> as<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.709> h6<00:02:44.459> bomber<00:02:44.700> from<00:02:44.940> China

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
damage model as the h6 bomber from China

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.960 
damage model as the h6 bomber from China
rising<00:02:45.450> maybe<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.989> bit<00:02:46.470> more<00:02:46.709> powerful<00:02:47.070> but<00:02:47.940> I

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
rising maybe a bit more powerful but I

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.210 
rising maybe a bit more powerful but I
don't<00:02:48.780> really<00:02:48.930> think<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.320> h6<00:02:49.800> bomber<00:02:49.980> was

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
don't really think that h6 bomber was

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.800 
don't really think that h6 bomber was
overpowered<00:02:50.760> or<00:02:50.970> underpowered<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.690> my

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
overpowered or underpowered in my

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.840 
overpowered or underpowered in my
opinion<00:02:52.200> now<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.920> next<00:02:53.310> thing<00:02:53.459> about<00:02:53.670> this

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
opinion now the next thing about this

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.520 
opinion now the next thing about this
assignment<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.540> last<00:02:54.989> requirement

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
assignment is the last requirement

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.070 
assignment is the last requirement
destroy<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.459> enemy<00:02:56.880> drone<00:02:57.180> command<00:02:57.660> what

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
destroy the enemy drone command what

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.680 
destroy the enemy drone command what
exactly<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.130> well<00:03:00.000> I'm<00:03:00.209> kind<00:03:00.540> of

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
exactly is this well I'm kind of

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.509 
exactly is this well I'm kind of
clueless<00:03:01.019> at<00:03:01.319> this<00:03:01.440> point<00:03:01.709> but<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.130> might<00:03:02.340> have

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
clueless at this point but it might have

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.160 
clueless at this point but it might have
something<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.880> do<00:03:03.060> with<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.300> drone<00:03:03.600> we<00:03:03.780> saw<00:03:03.989> in

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
something to do with the drone we saw in

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.840 
something to do with the drone we saw in
the<00:03:04.290> premium<00:03:04.650> trailer<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.130> few<00:03:05.459> months<00:03:05.730> ago

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
the premium trailer a few months ago

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.229 
the premium trailer a few months ago
called<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.420> MK<00:03:06.930> V<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.950> could<00:03:08.190> this<00:03:08.340> DLC<00:03:08.910> be<00:03:09.090> up

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
called the MK V so could this DLC be up

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.970 
called the MK V so could this DLC be up
to<00:03:09.420> its<00:03:09.569> teeth<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.080> new<00:03:10.380> features<00:03:10.560> and

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
to its teeth and new features and

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.820 
to its teeth and new features and
vehicles<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.700> mean<00:03:11.880> we<00:03:12.000> have<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.300> MK<00:03:12.660> V<00:03:12.930> b-52

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
vehicles I mean we have the MK V b-52

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.770 
vehicles I mean we have the MK V b-52
bomber<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.459> possibly<00:03:14.850> nuclear<00:03:15.360> LEvolution

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
bomber and possibly nuclear LEvolution

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.930 
bomber and possibly nuclear LEvolution
so<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.650> expansion<00:03:17.190> could<00:03:17.459> be<00:03:17.610> an<00:03:17.730> amazing

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
so this expansion could be an amazing

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.360 
so this expansion could be an amazing
way<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.329> end<00:03:18.600> battlefield<00:03:19.110> 4<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:20.010> final
