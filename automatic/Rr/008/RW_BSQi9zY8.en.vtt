2011<00:00:17.990> two<00:00:18.990> miles<00:00:19.490> what<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.610> a<00:00:20.640> cap

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
2011 two miles what is a cap

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.019 
2011 two miles what is a cap
construction<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.869> white<00:00:22.140> one<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> sidewall

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
construction in white one is a sidewall

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.929 
construction in white one is a sidewall
construction<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.900> black<00:00:25.490> just<00:00:26.490> basically

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
construction in black just basically

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.819 
construction in black just basically
talking<00:00:27.270> about<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> profile<00:00:28.200> of<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.439> ski<00:00:28.680> and

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
talking about the profile of the ski and

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.150 
talking about the profile of the ski and
how<00:00:28.950> it<00:00:29.099> behaves<00:00:29.630> this<00:00:30.630> side<00:00:31.410> Wolski<00:00:31.950> should

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
how it behaves this side Wolski should

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.889 
how it behaves this side Wolski should
be<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> little<00:00:32.430> bit<00:00:32.610> smoother<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.660> cap

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
be a little bit smoother the cap

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.270 
be a little bit smoother the cap
construction<00:00:34.170> should<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> little<00:00:35.100> bit

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
construction should be a little bit

00:00:35.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
construction should be a little bit
snappier<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.030> see<00:00:36.780> how<00:00:36.899> they<00:00:37.079> do

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.910 

a<00:01:21.270> sidewall<00:01:22.270> ski<00:01:22.630> was<00:01:22.900> very<00:01:23.200> smooth<00:01:23.590> and

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
a sidewall ski was very smooth and

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.460 
a sidewall ski was very smooth and
initiated<00:01:24.730> turns<00:01:24.940> very<00:01:25.210> well<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.780> great<00:01:26.170> ski

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
initiated turns very well a great ski

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.040 
initiated turns very well a great ski
for<00:01:26.500> an<00:01:26.830> intermediate<00:01:26.920> level<00:01:27.640> skier<00:01:27.940> but<00:01:28.840> also

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
for an intermediate level skier but also

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.660 
for an intermediate level skier but also
for<00:01:29.470> advanced<00:01:29.710> skiers<00:01:30.040> who<00:01:30.220> want<00:01:30.370> to<00:01:30.460> push<00:01:30.640> a

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
for advanced skiers who want to push a

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.220 
for advanced skiers who want to push a
little<00:01:30.790> harder<00:01:31.000> it<00:01:31.420> does<00:01:31.630> hold<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.960> snow

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
little harder it does hold the snow

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.350 
little harder it does hold the snow
quite<00:01:32.620> nicely<00:01:32.860> I'd<00:01:33.190> give<00:01:33.400> it<00:01:33.430> probably<00:01:33.850> an<00:01:33.940> 85

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
quite nicely I'd give it probably an 85

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.550 
quite nicely I'd give it probably an 85
out<00:01:34.570> of<00:01:34.600> 100<00:01:34.810> I<00:01:36.510> like<00:01:37.510> this<00:01:37.690> very<00:01:37.780> much<00:01:37.990> and

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
out of 100 I like this very much and

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.660 
out of 100 I like this very much and
considering<00:01:39.400> it<00:01:39.490> was<00:01:39.520> only<00:01:39.730> a<00:01:39.850> 165<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:41.320> I'm<00:01:41.980> 62

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
considering it was only a 165 and I'm 62

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.060 
considering it was only a 165 and I'm 62
and<00:01:42.910> 50<00:01:44.730> very<00:01:45.730> nicely<00:01:46.170> was<00:01:47.170> very<00:01:47.440> controllable

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
and 50 very nicely was very controllable

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.440 
and 50 very nicely was very controllable
very<00:01:48.910> predictable<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:50.440> give<00:01:51.430> this<00:01:51.580> ski<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.880> good

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
very predictable I give this ski a good

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.930 
very predictable I give this ski a good
85<00:01:53.050> to<00:01:53.320> 90<00:01:53.680> grading<00:01:54.330> for<00:01:55.330> most<00:01:55.540> anyone
