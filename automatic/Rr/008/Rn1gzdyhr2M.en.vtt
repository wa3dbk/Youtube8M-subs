try to make myself on the very edge of
the<00:01:51.990> map<00:01:52.140> I'd<00:01:52.350> never<00:01:52.649> try<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.860> go<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
the map I'd never try to go in the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.429 
the map I'd never try to go in the
middle<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> Middle's<00:01:55.049> will<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.320> it

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
middle but in the Middle's will have it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.690 
middle but in the Middle's will have it
to<00:01:55.530> stick<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.890> edges<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.250> look<00:01:56.549> how<00:01:56.640> I

another little tip if you know there's a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.520 
another little tip if you know there's a
guy<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.479> radar<00:02:03.689> right<00:02:03.960> here<00:02:04.140> technically

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
guy on the radar right here technically

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.749 
guy on the radar right here technically
past<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.040> see<00:02:05.159> if<00:02:05.250> he's<00:02:05.369> going<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.579> make<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
past and see if he's going to make a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.429 
past and see if he's going to make a
move<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.240> know<00:02:06.600> he's<00:02:06.810> not<00:02:06.960> start<00:02:07.229> doing

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
move I know he's not start doing

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.139 
move I know he's not start doing
flashbang<00:02:07.920> wait<00:02:08.429> for<00:02:08.580> him<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.700> get<00:02:08.819> stunned

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
flashbang wait for him to get stunned

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.820 
flashbang wait for him to get stunned

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
and I jump around the corner and pick

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.040 
and I jump around the corner and pick
them<00:02:10.979> off<00:02:11.099> for<00:02:11.310> an<00:02:11.400> easy<00:02:11.489> kill<00:02:11.790> so

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
them off for an easy kill so

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.690 
them off for an easy kill so
that's<00:02:13.590> just<00:02:13.740> my<00:02:13.830> little<00:02:13.980> tips<00:02:14.250> stay<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.610> this

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
that's just my little tips stay in this

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.580 
that's just my little tips stay in this
little<00:02:15.000> stay<00:02:15.570> on<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:15.870> side<00:02:16.050> right<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.410> front

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
little stay on this side right in front

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.140 
little stay on this side right in front
of<00:02:16.650> me<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.100> should<00:02:17.280> be<00:02:17.310> fairly<00:02:17.730> easy<00:02:17.940> to

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
of me and it should be fairly easy to

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.900 
of me and it should be fairly easy to
get<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.300> MOAB<00:02:18.770> also<00:02:19.770> with<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.070> unp<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.490> haven't

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
get a MOAB also with the unp I haven't

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.090 
get a MOAB also with the unp I haven't
noticed<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.240> big<00:02:21.720> increase<00:02:22.350> because<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.770> like

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
noticed a big increase because I like

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.800 
noticed a big increase because I like
this<00:02:23.250> gun<00:02:23.490> i<00:02:23.520> use<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.030> i<00:02:24.120> think<00:02:24.330> it's<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.540> good

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
this gun i use it i think it's a good

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.350 
this gun i use it i think it's a good
gun<00:02:24.990> thank<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.520> recoil<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> little

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
gun thank the the recoil is a little

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.270 
gun thank the the recoil is a little
less<00:02:27.510> I'm<00:02:27.750> not<00:02:27.990> too<00:02:28.170> sure<00:02:28.410> but<00:02:28.710> overall<00:02:29.040> it's

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
less I'm not too sure but overall it's

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.340 
less I'm not too sure but overall it's
still<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.490> good<00:02:29.670> gun<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.630> would<00:02:31.050> rank<00:02:31.230> it

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
still a good gun I would rank it

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.850 
still a good gun I would rank it
probably<00:02:32.100> third<00:02:32.720> for<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.750> SMGs<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.470> think<00:02:34.710> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
probably third for the SMGs I think the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.920 
probably third for the SMGs I think the
mp7<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.730> p90<00:02:36.150> are<00:02:36.270> still<00:02:36.480> better<00:02:36.840> than

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
mp7 and the p90 are still better than

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.750 
mp7 and the p90 are still better than
this<00:02:37.200> gun<00:02:37.410> but<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.070> one's<00:02:38.280> pretty<00:02:38.490> good

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
this gun but this one's pretty good

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.340 
this gun but this one's pretty good
Manimal<00:02:39.450> class<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.900> probably<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.320> hardest

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
Manimal class is probably the hardest

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.410 
Manimal class is probably the hardest
hitting<00:02:40.980> gun<00:02:41.250> if<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:41.940> guys<00:02:42.060> know<00:02:42.210> what<00:02:42.330> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
hitting gun if you guys know what the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.080 
hitting gun if you guys know what the
metal<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.900> extended<00:02:43.800> mags<00:02:43.920> rocket<00:02:44.340> fire<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:45.030> I

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
metal is extended mags rocket fire and I

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.400 
metal is extended mags rocket fire and I
think<00:02:45.300> overall<00:02:45.570> this<00:02:45.780> gun<00:02:45.960> is<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.080> really<00:02:46.320> good

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
think overall this gun is a really good
