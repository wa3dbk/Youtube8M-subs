00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.650
 and hello to all good tauriel too 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.019
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.269
 to make a pixel art ultra easily in 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.039
 minecraft it's super simple for 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.070
 buy lise minecraft full structure 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.869
 outdoors and mc says which i am going 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.779
 to be able to safely take the world 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.189
 so I 'm going too bad and when six of them 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.359
 links to download this work done 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.590
 on the video the video images here i 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.219
 take any picture not a 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.320
 place chic hop here is here it'll be 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.980
 the precision of our little one 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.899
 pixel art 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.219
 so I do not put a very big 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.930
 precision as will not be much 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.129
 of time but after if you want you 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.390
 can put 1000 so we do that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.670
 because the accuracy is going to be too 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.010
 the number of blocks will take to the top 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.170
 kraft if you put 100000 block by 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.760
 example will be hyper accurate but in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.280
 true minecraft that leg mud 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.219
 so what to try we'll put some 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.100
 meaning that's just history to test 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.590
 that's how we created a little thing like 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.979
 that then there are two techniques either you 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.840
 take 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.640
 here for example pulling towards you 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.409
 apply it like that is the one I 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.990
 think you'll use it's just 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.130
 to click here green autocon so a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.530
 small loading bar that appears 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.360
 and it's going automatically converted to 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.060
 our yoshi in pixel art so you go 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.939
 see when you will do a lot of 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.960
 precision will not take the time it's 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.130
 for that I do not like much for 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.219
 to be able to do a 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.450
 a video that respected all the same and 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.560
 so here we automatically saw that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.479
 transform them 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.350
 another little problem so we have it 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.850
 that's why we see that the eyes do not 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.130
 are not super accurate very sport me 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.130
 super accurate it's not very serious 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.840
 here we are almost 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.840
 see that converted one 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.710
 no it's good press map 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.100
 here is to oppose the other little pixel 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.260
 art 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:31.320
 here you will see the number of 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:34.560
 blacks that were used then I 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.270
 do not know if you see well there but he 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.130
 there was there were two there they added 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.380
 of the year at the contour since 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.640
 my basic image was white so 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.950
 to remove that it's very simple 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.100
 click on the little jump you 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.990
 select here the white texture 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.180
 click and that's it going down any 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.470
 snow by white now you 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:00.380
 do export cinematics game already on 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:06.240
 other things to do with art 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:10.800
 lyrical and hop we record now 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:16.080
 we're going to open mc lite we're going to pana 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:20.550
 level pixel-art yoshiki and here we go 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:26.819
 open it and it's just going 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:28.319
 put it here here 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.900
 now what you can do 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:38.969
 also to add it to your world 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:40.829
 excuses it's to select just one 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:42.389
 last little thing and I think you 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.250
 see there there are small blocks because 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.719
 that it was from writing what I 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.310
 bought I took the picture with a 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:54.469
 write on you can remove them 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:57.319
 here it is super simple up 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:04:03.139
 now I have more than to select 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.139
 montpetit yoshi up 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:24.090
 this little elite here now I 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:25.080
 can copy it save what comes back 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.300
 besides a little problem that puts 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.160
 now you may have to 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.650
 do it elsewhere so remark so if so 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.630
 save here you seem to save yourself 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:47.120
 return to the elite 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:47.120
 we click on klose 16e new world 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:55.139
 taking in the world 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:58.380
 I had a dish here and a little 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:01.740
 yoshi and then I can import it 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.060
 on my world is to learn a little 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.380
 little time here you see it is 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:15.690
 pretty big good there I wear it I can 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:20.150
 turn it how are we 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.150
 do I see myself movie feels that it's 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.340
 no it's not that I think 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.180
 yeah that's the wrong way 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:36.740
 I'm talking about me actually more than 7s 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.480
 was rolled up maybe so that role is 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:44.740
 so now you have your little one 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:52.250
 pixel art in the hexagon a little bit 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:59.180
 who is here now was doing enter 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:06:07.220
 to confirm his charge for this old 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:11.380
 disgusting texture cock good than that 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:17.800
 means here it's good it's started 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.800
 good so did this control to save 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:34.200
 here you can open minecraft your 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:40.200
 mac graft 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:42.570
 I hope I am very good this key 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:48.090
 me it's a little load why that's 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:49.620
 do that to me here I open multi minecraft 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:59.960
 this party to go far in a video 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:59.960
 where I'm six minutes ok his charge the 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.220
 sum minecraft opener 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:19.009
 solo I open the part is normally 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:21.080
 it's good you pixel art was thus created 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:22.090
 he's right there I can see him in 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:29.060
 full 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:32.810
 here you see it's big enough but 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:35.080
 it makes quite good so here I hope 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.460
 that this little one would have liked you 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.379
 so you actually see pixel art 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:45.439
 it's because it's so incredible 

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:48.169
 it's actually pretty simple, so 

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:49.909
 I hope you will not see wow anymore 

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:52.069
 amazing guy who did that he had to 

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:57.250
 spend hours balloon sent in ten 

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:59.389
 minutes not even it's settled here 

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.189
 I hope this little tutorial will have you 

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:03.199
 more if you liked the east and especially 

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:07.909
 not put an inch to a comment 

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:10.060
 this pleasure to subscribe and here you go 

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:10.060
 Hi
