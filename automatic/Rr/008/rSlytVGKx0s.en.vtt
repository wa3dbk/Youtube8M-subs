00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
I find a very strange that this is the

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.760 
I find a very strange that this is the
first<00:05:07.190> time<00:05:07.430> this<00:05:07.580> has<00:05:07.730> happened<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:09.260> I<00:05:09.470> don't

first time this has happened and I don't
think<00:05:10.040> I<00:05:10.340> think<00:05:10.910> it<00:05:11.000> should<00:05:11.120> be<00:05:11.150> more<00:05:11.360> of<00:05:11.720> a<00:05:11.810> big

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
think I think it should be more of a big

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.020 
think I think it should be more of a big
deal<00:05:12.290> like<00:05:13.100> they'd<00:05:13.310> not<00:05:13.520> really<00:05:13.730> making<00:05:13.910> a

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
deal like they'd not really making a
