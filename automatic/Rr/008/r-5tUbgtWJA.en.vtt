figure out how to play the game so I've

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.990 
figure out how to play the game so I've
had<00:06:58.750> it<00:06:58.900> since<00:06:59.080> then<00:06:59.410> and<00:06:59.620> I<00:07:00.370> don't<00:07:00.610> know<00:07:00.760> how

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
had it since then and I don't know how

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.030 
had it since then and I don't know how
to<00:07:01.090> play<00:07:01.300> the<00:07:01.450> game<00:07:01.600> okay<00:07:01.870> by<00:07:02.200> the<00:07:02.260> way<00:07:02.500> guys<00:07:02.680> I

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.040 
to play the game okay by the way guys I
