00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.580
 new from all bed bugs and welcome 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:08.970
 once again to the channel, I bring the top 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.120
 5 of the Pokémons of Giotto my Pokemon 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.730
 favorites of giotto is worth under the aspect 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.669
 does not go for pokemon quality or for its 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.769
 power or nothing just by its appearance the 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:22.470
 Pokémon that I like the most physically 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:27.029
 so to speak and well let's start 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.919
 and in the 15th take we have to sidor the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.040
 description of the Swiss is the following 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.230
 the successes are usually very lonely in 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.660
 wild this is because 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.269
 revolutionize they turn red and like 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.059
 insiders can not see that color the 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.340
 Swiss become unremitting and perceptible 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.320
 for these is why they should 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.629
 to separate from their colony and live isolated 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.579
 of skaters for this reason many of 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.280
 savage záiter refuse to evolve 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.010
 so as not to lose your family with this 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.920
 definition tell us that haters do not 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.570
 you can see the color red so no 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.159
 he wants to evolve so as not to lose his 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.530
 family because they would not see each other 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.280
 and I have chosen in the top 5 the 62 because 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.720
 the version 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.350
 the truth is that I quite like 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.240
 so metallic is a bit cool and good 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.640
 surely many people take it from everyone 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.610
 good but not for me it is the top 5 already 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.510
 let's see the top number 4 that is for 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.340
 use link the bear so stable so 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.290
 to say it good achuchable does not have very 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.350
 many cables but good we are going to 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.990
 start with the description of use link 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.580
 this pokemon is very territorial irate 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.630
 and selfish does not like people 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.180
 when people enter their 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.740
 territory becomes very aggressive but 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.600
 if you enter their territory during the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.200
 reproductive season become much more 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.750
 aggressive young man being able to kill 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.760
 everyone who is in his way 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.150
 is a protective pokémon and civilians and 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.500
 maternal mother of mine, I only achuchable, not 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.360
 they have nothing or this is not the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.790
 loving for nothing but good I love 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.710
 is a very powerful Pokémon more than many 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.770
 thank you reminds me the yogi bear but 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.590
 well now let's move to the top number 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.899
 3 we give it to tip lotion or it's 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.540
 implosion as you want to call it is a 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.329
 two initials of the second generation 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.280
 with the description unlike their 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.250
 productions have the holes 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.590
 where their flames come out in the back 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.120
 exactly between the shoulders is a lot 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.579
 faster and bigger than its shapes 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.799
 spent almost as tall as a man 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.500
 adult and can also stay about 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.849
 his two hind legs which he 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.280
 allows attacks with the 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.379
 upper limbs has the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.470
 ability to cause explosions in your 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.590
 fur and create explosive flares by 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.510
 expansive waves that embrace everything 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.030
 to the ashes 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.560
 wow a pretty powerful Pokémon and the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.730
 truth is that I love I have a 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.129
 weakness to answer that kind of 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.139
 fire or they drive me crazy you saw 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.659
 in the top 5 of singing my little more 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:00.540
 singing favorite was caritas because 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.790
 initial fire type but good in this 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.669
 case we will give the top 3 to the initial 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.760
 this generation and well now we are going to 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:10.420
 move to the top number 2 that we only give to 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.130
 a man on 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.290
 in the description of manbron is the 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.660
 next when the affective bond 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.940
 between an ibi and his coach be it 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.700
 high enough and get used to 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.760
 train the third to lose hours 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.220
 sorry sunset or at night to ibi 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.920
 will be prepared to evolve the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.190
 man or this pokemon has all its 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.660
 black coat except 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.760
 circumstances of a yellow color that 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.709
 can illuminate his will has 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.500
 look of a black fox red eyes 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.810
 they are striking sinister and adapted to 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.459
 the darkness this pokemon has a 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.890
 kind of link with the moon at night 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.230
 well you all know that ivy evolves 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.370
 at night because nothing has to be trained 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.950
 you have to walk with him to give him 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.069
 happiness and such and I have chosen this top 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.870
 2 because the truth is that I love it is 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.090
 very little favorite of the phases 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.670
 evolutionary of ivi vouchers but it's not my 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.459
 favorite of youtube when you see the top 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.620
 1 you are going to freak out in colors that is to say 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.930
 to be freaking out because it really is 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.890
 you are not going to wait for anything 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:21.220

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:23.710
 and the top 1 is the team yes gentlemen is the 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.720
 team or it does not make sense I know but 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.310
 is that I love the team and elected 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.080
 liked and I love I love the 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.720
 elective and I love the three phases 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.479
 evolutionary is it worth the team me 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.090
 Go crazy to do the description of 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.820
 This Pokémon is a Baby Pokémon as is 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.880
 a baby but it is very strong very 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.710
 resistant and nothing tender this pokemon 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.840
 live in jungle forests and more 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.360
 often in power plants 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.979
 he likes bitter fruits and his 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.800
 small hobby is to feed on 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.410
 electricity may have different 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.530
 temperaments according to how they are raised but 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.449
 It is usually something naughty, if it is 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.520
 a little bit naughty but it's very 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.050
