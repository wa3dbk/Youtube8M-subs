you the golden crow dragon so let's go
and<00:00:48.920> check<00:00:48.980> that<00:00:49.249> out<00:00:49.309> right<00:00:49.429> now<00:00:51.129> here<00:00:52.129> is<00:00:52.339> the

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
and check that out right now here is the

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.599 
and check that out right now here is the
egg<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:53.149> it<00:00:53.809> took<00:00:54.050> about<00:00:54.260> I<00:00:54.829> mean<00:00:55.129> I<00:00:55.190> have<00:00:55.339> VIP

egg and it took about I mean I have VIP

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.610 
egg and it took about I mean I have VIP
so<00:00:56.210> it's<00:00:56.510> probably<00:00:56.780> going<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:56.929> take<00:00:57.079> like<00:00:57.230> 22

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
so it's probably going to take like 22

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.439 
so it's probably going to take like 22
hours<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:58.069> get<00:00:58.159> it<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:58.550> it<00:00:58.850> has<00:00:58.969> a<00:00:58.999> little<00:00:59.269> beak

people<00:01:12.320> would<00:01:12.590> get<00:01:12.740> mixed<00:01:12.950> up<00:01:13.190> because<00:01:13.460> some

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
people would get mixed up because some

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.130
