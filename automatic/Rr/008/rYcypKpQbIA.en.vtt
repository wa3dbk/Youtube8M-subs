00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:07.660
 hello I am Carlos and cat too 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:10.090
 known as ricart 18 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.170
 I do not know how they are in page nor I 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.440
 agreement but today I come to talk about 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.710
 how did I make my spectacular pitcher 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.310
 spiderman is so it seemed like 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.630
 there since 2008 I am a fan of the and blame the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.630
 as you can see 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.650
 I like other series of spiderman but 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.630
 for me this was the best of you 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.060
 but regarding your decisions if 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.400
 respect mine 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.400
 let's start well hello how are 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.960
 dance 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.590
 I'm going to show you my launcher 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.590
 they see it 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.829
 well they see it then 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:06.100
 I made this launcher with paper 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:08.170
 tourette's adornment and lung ribbon 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.810
 you can ask an adult for help 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.360
 do this but it's so simple that as 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.470
 it is said that if they want to do it alone 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.540
 they will do but better or when they use 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.240
 scissors because their antigen 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.240
 ask for help from an adult is necessary 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.060
 are going to cut seriously I asked him 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.149
 help in saying but still you 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.070
 ask for help one day I cut myself just for 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.450
 use scissors 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.450
 so ask for help so 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.800
 good here is from the notebook 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.380
 they put their wrist here in the middle of the 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.259
 notebook where they think it 's better after 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.289
 cut the notebook until the end 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.140
 pitcher here here here 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.909
 it's kind of weird being my head but not 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.909
 I have the other half available 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.660
 they cut it where the launcher ends up 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.060
 or where you want but where 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.849
 want to cut it out 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.350
 and they make you turn on your wrist so more 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.980
 all right 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.980
 look 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:45.670
 so extended it looks better to see 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:50.370
 this is how you are going to cut back 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:54.739
 notebook and then Havana looks like this 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.739
 and from there the benches 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.990
 to be like that 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.990
 and they make the rectangle so they see well 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.140
 they make me the rectangle 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:22.130
 so here to do this thing goes up 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:26.150
 make a round here and low 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.610
 so that they are more or less like that with 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.060
 this thing 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.340
 right now it 's adorned but when 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.540
 you do it like I tell you 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.620
 it will stay like this 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.819
 with the tissues I repeat again 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.819
 ask an adult for help 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.980
 since it's like this the blade is going to grab a 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.700
 little of jour ets 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.700
 and they go 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.310
 as you say 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.430
 good to fill all you're with 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.680
 your ets the whole sheet to the tape 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.439
 is 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.079
 here after they have the lloret is already 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:13.709
 that has the jury and remains resistant without 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.709
 that breaks 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:23.889
 they put decoration ribbon is 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:28.110
 and a line of down 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:32.620
 then another tourette's and others and 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:36.360
 also here they put him and here they put him 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.360
 little chins to make it look like that 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.749
 since they have everything, they have everything 

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:49.259
 that is going to be able to put 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:50.740
 they will stay like this, do not put it here and 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:55.259
 stay like this 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.259
 put a piece of lurex here 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.100
 so they can do this so that they 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.540
 can place it 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.540
 and I'm also placing 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.190
 and so that they look good 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.759
 there is also another launcher that I did 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.759
 what is it like 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.900
 but this is already a bit more advanced and 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:24.150
 I'll explain in another video what 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.660
 but I will only explain to you, tantita, so that 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.660
 be excited 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:33.469
 this is just like this one that already 

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:35.050
 add with your exist the rope of 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:37.849
 clock 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.520
 and the cover of the clock 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:43.249
 and that's how it's said can be 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.699
 any watch but if it turns on better 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:48.999
 so that they are for the man already when 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.999
 want 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:57.470
 so you with your imagination do 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.639
 whatever they want east-west that has 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.249
 liked more 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.120
 this is my first advice the video on 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:05.849
 Youtube 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.289
 I want to know your opinions if I did 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:11.379
 well if I did it wrong as I want 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:14.889
 put a comment and this and the other 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:18.759
 eye if they do not like it, do not swear 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:21.820
 and if they are so kind express well 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:25.110
 as good human beings thank you 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.110
 see you and goodbye
