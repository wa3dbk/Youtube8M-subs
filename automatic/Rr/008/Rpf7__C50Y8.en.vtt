wanna give y'all an update on some of
the<00:00:37.489> supplements<00:00:37.699> I've<00:00:38.059> been<00:00:38.210> taking<00:00:38.570> I

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
the supplements I've been taking I

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.410 
the supplements I've been taking I
recently<00:00:39.079> started<00:00:39.410> using<00:00:40.180> BCAAs<00:00:41.180> and

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
recently started using BCAAs and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.810 
recently started using BCAAs and
glutamine<00:00:42.010> together<00:00:43.010> I<00:00:43.280> recently<00:00:43.550> came

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
glutamine together I recently came

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.460 
glutamine together I recently came
across<00:00:43.879> a<00:00:44.120> study<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:45.019> two<00:00:45.199> groups<00:00:45.379> of

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
across a study and two groups of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.490 
across a study and two groups of
athletes<00:00:45.589> they<00:00:46.399> gave<00:00:46.550> one<00:00:46.820> group<00:00:47.059> of<00:00:47.500> BCAAs

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
athletes they gave one group of BCAAs

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.290 
athletes they gave one group of BCAAs
and<00:00:48.680> glutamine<00:00:48.769> before<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:49.729> after<00:00:50.059> training

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
and glutamine before and after training

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.990 
and glutamine before and after training
and<00:00:50.570> they<00:00:51.079> gave<00:00:51.229> the<00:00:51.320> placebo<00:00:51.620> group<00:00:51.879> you<00:00:52.879> know

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
and they gave the placebo group you know

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.610 
and they gave the placebo group you know
some<00:00:53.210> bullshit<00:00:53.600> some<00:00:53.809> placebo<00:00:54.229> right

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
some bullshit some placebo right

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.780 
some bullshit some placebo right
instead<00:00:54.860> they<00:00:54.949> concluded<00:00:55.280> there<00:00:55.460> who<00:00:55.610> could

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
instead they concluded there who could

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.819 
instead they concluded there who could
took<00:00:55.909> the<00:00:56.059> BCAAs<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:56.719> glutamine<00:00:57.019> before<00:00:57.739> and

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
took the BCAAs and glutamine before and

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.290 
took the BCAAs and glutamine before and
after<00:00:57.980> training<00:00:58.250> their<00:00:58.489> recovery<00:00:58.879> time<00:00:59.149> was

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
after training their recovery time was

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.889 
after training their recovery time was
way<00:00:59.480> quicker

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
way quicker

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.450 
way quicker
there's<00:01:00.140> also<00:01:00.289> another<00:01:00.469> study<00:01:00.859> operated

your immune system and that's important
for<00:01:06.140> athletes<00:01:06.470> because<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:06.740> got<00:01:06.860> to

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
for athletes because you got to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.650 
for athletes because you got to
understand<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:07.429> when<00:01:07.910> uh<00:01:07.940> when<00:01:08.330> you<00:01:08.390> do<00:01:08.509> any

any kind of resistance training or any
kind<00:01:15.500> of<00:01:15.530> cardio<00:01:15.860> you're<00:01:16.100> putting<00:01:16.310> your<00:01:16.399> body

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
kind of cardio you're putting your body

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:18.310 
kind of cardio you're putting your body
on<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.759> certain<00:01:17.060> amount<00:01:17.479> of<00:01:17.570> stress<00:01:17.929> and<00:01:18.259> that

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
on a certain amount of stress and that

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.080 
on a certain amount of stress and that
stress<00:01:18.500> will<00:01:19.039> make<00:01:19.159> your<00:01:19.280> body<00:01:19.399> to<00:01:19.640> secrete<00:01:19.850> a

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
stress will make your body to secrete a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.029 
stress will make your body to secrete a
stress<00:01:20.509> hormone<00:01:20.539> actually<00:01:21.050> decrease<00:01:22.009> your

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
stress hormone actually decrease your

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.740 
stress hormone actually decrease your
immune<00:01:22.520> system<00:01:22.909> where<00:01:23.119> they<00:01:23.210> fell<00:01:23.420> was<00:01:23.630> it

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
immune system where they fell was it

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.840 
immune system where they fell was it
taking<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.020> BCAAs<00:01:24.679> and<00:01:24.710> glutamine<00:01:24.979> help

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
taking the BCAAs and glutamine help

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.550 
taking the BCAAs and glutamine help
prevent<00:01:26.479> a<00:01:26.630> lot<00:01:26.659> of<00:01:26.869> your<00:01:27.110> body's<00:01:27.319> production

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
prevent a lot of your body's production

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.200 
prevent a lot of your body's production
that<00:01:27.830> stress<00:01:28.220> hormone<00:01:28.640> not<00:01:28.909> only<00:01:29.030> did

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
that stress hormone not only did

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.940 
that stress hormone not only did
athletes<00:01:29.570> recover<00:01:29.750> faster<00:01:30.380> but<00:01:30.770> there<00:01:30.890> are

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
athletes recover faster but there are

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.499 
athletes recover faster but there are
new<00:01:31.100> systems<00:01:31.520> go<00:01:31.700> higher<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.119> this<00:01:32.240> is<00:01:32.360> good

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
new systems go higher so this is good

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.030 
new systems go higher so this is good
this<00:01:32.689> is<00:01:32.750> what<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.229> lot<00:01:33.409> of<00:01:33.470> people<00:01:33.710> only<00:01:33.770> start

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
this is what a lot of people only start

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.319 
this is what a lot of people only start
when<00:01:34.130> they<00:01:34.250> train<00:01:34.490> were<00:01:34.640> hard<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:34.939> get<00:01:35.060> sick

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
when they train were hard to get sick

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.270 
when they train were hard to get sick
because<00:01:35.540> it<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:36.530> stress<00:01:36.799> hormone<00:01:37.130> is<00:01:37.250> going

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
because it that stress hormone is going

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.100 
because it that stress hormone is going
to<00:01:37.490> weaken<00:01:38.240> your<00:01:38.360> immune<00:01:38.420> system<00:01:38.899> and<00:01:39.020> if

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
to weaken your immune system and if

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.840 
to weaken your immune system and if
you're<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:39.740> when<00:01:40.219> that<00:01:40.340> happens<00:01:40.700> when

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
you're a and when that happens when

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.310 
you're a and when that happens when
you're<00:01:40.939> exposed<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.360> any<00:01:41.450> kind<00:01:41.509> of<00:01:41.719> viruses<00:01:42.170> or

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
you're exposed to any kind of viruses or

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.200 
you're exposed to any kind of viruses or
bacteria<00:01:42.369> you're<00:01:43.369> more<00:01:43.549> likely<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:43.909> get<00:01:44.149> uh

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
bacteria you're more likely to get uh

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.580 
bacteria you're more likely to get uh
some<00:01:44.479> kind<00:01:44.630> elements<00:01:45.110> now<00:01:45.200> a<00:01:45.229> lot<00:01:45.439> of<00:01:45.469> you

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
some kind elements now a lot of you

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.319 
some kind elements now a lot of you
might<00:01:45.710> be<00:01:45.740> thinking<00:01:45.829> a<00:01:46.100> men<00:01:46.340> fuckin<00:01:46.969> protein

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
might be thinking a men fuckin protein

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.340 
might be thinking a men fuckin protein

true-true<00:01:51.409> I<00:01:51.590> can't<00:01:51.860> even<00:01:52.040> argue<00:01:52.159> with<00:01:52.399> that

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
true-true I can't even argue with that

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.120 
true-true I can't even argue with that
man<00:01:52.759> it's<00:01:53.119> also<00:01:53.240> some<00:01:53.539> evidence<00:01:53.689> that<00:01:54.130> when

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
man it's also some evidence that when

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.569 
man it's also some evidence that when
taking<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.460> BCAAs<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:56.240> glutamine<00:01:56.390> free<00:01:57.229> form

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
taking the BCAAs and glutamine free form

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.010 
taking the BCAAs and glutamine free form
your<00:01:58.579> body<00:01:58.759> absorbs<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.329> little<00:01:59.479> quicker<00:01:59.719> so

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
your body absorbs it a little quicker so

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.350 
your body absorbs it a little quicker so
if<00:02:00.320> you<00:02:00.500> could<00:02:00.649> afford<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.250> I'd<00:02:01.520> say<00:02:01.820> go<00:02:02.030> for<00:02:02.060> it

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
if you could afford it I'd say go for it

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.770
