00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.620
 demonstrate 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.569
 how easy it is to do it with the HP Touchpad 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:18.809
 the paper takes off a normal around 1900 Rogoff says that the c5 1 8 0 there 

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:23.249
 I already have time for about three years and already recognize the journal 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.239
 actually right off the bat and does not need to set anything up at all 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:28.310
 namely 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.480
 especially teenagers to the browser then percent group picture 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.950
 you can see their destination they have spend province of Herat Roger network are available 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.260
 that has made them more pressure Benitez is honesty in the LED national winner yet 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.710

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.210
 then we will all printers with such images as well out of the picture 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.300
 around 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.230
 With every drug support the two-sided pressure will come to life 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.230
 adjust if we count out the number of copies 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.200
 should print in color and then becomes easy 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.480
 Samples from that you can now prepare freshly prepared 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.370
 and evade taxes and also the place 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.960
 Printing process completed 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.880
 and already stuttering 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.740
 should be 1 4 3 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 Recession still to notify after young too

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.070
 the times are printed 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.090
 the whole thing works just like me from the orchestra photos AP 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.840
 I have this for example 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.090
 a small door opened 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.300
 we see how it works quite well 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.820
 I have Zieler the percent 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.020
 Another penalty we also give drugs the hustle and bustle takes place immediately 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.920

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.330

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.240
 displayed and the winner prices rape and say yes 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.979

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:19.909
 Auto Snake tested which Winnenden her computer in a difficult field 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.449

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.629
