00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.230
 tap and board presents 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:39.210
 and endodontics the tooth is not a 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.579
 homogeneous structure on the contrary 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.430
 It consists of several types of tissues 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.499
 the enamel in the crown of the tooth is 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.929
 white and very hard and forms its part 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:51.510
 visible is the first barrier 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:54.059
 the decay the color dentin 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.370
 yellowish is placed under the enamel and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.589
 continues along the root its hardness is 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.530
 minor so it's more sensitive to the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.839
 caries the pulp where the nerves are 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.180
 and blood vessels are in the 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.490
 crown and travel the root until 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.920
 surpassing is the one that brings life to 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.659
 tooth and is very vulnerable to attack 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.140
 the microorganisms 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.140
 i 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.240
 as the tooth is exposed to the medium 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.920
 outside is surrounded by 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.360
 germs 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.680
 some of these germs are the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.680
 responsible for dental caries 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.530
 i 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.500
 caries is a destructive process that 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.840
 usually starts in the enamel if the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.940
 Hygiene is incorrect and the tooth is not 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.370
 treated in time the decay will end 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.910
 going through the enamel layer and it will arrive 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.910
 to dentin 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.440
 as dentin is not very durable the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.690
 caries will increase its volume quickly 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.830
 under the enamel and will eventually infect the 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.830
 pulp which will cause intense pain 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.630
 If the situation continues along the 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.790
 time the infection will reach the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.300
 end of the root increasing the pain 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.220
 and causing serious alterations a 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.320
 infected pulp should be removed 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.740
 completely when the tooth is 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.260
 empty 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.480
 clean and free of germs will be filled 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.550
 with a special material that will guarantee 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.590
 the permanent seal to this 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.350
 removal and cleaning procedure 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.660
 sealed is called endodontics the 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.730
 endodontics will eliminate infection and 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.340
 pain and it's the last chance the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.340
 tooth before its definitive extraction 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.900
 Endodontics will also be necessary if 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.720
 the tooth would have suffered a traumatism 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.710
 or due to other non-infectious causes and 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.710
 that do not cause pain 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.620
 in general a tooth with endodontics 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.870
 You will also need other treatments 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.330
 later because it will be more fragile 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.310
 that before a crown can be a good 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.560
 option to avoid fractures and give 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.600
 greater resistance and if it were convenient 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.760
 a pin that holds it if you have been 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.740
 performed an endodontics but not 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.260
 feel pain, never ignore the 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.330
 planned treatment back is your 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.590
 tooth may fracture if it does not receive 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.590
 subsequent care 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.459
 We recommend you visit with 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.620
 regularity to your dentist so that in 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.170
 case of caries, this is treated in a 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.000
 early stage avoiding if the dreaded 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.269
 toothache and the consequent 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.989
 endodontics prevention is the best 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.989
 strategy
