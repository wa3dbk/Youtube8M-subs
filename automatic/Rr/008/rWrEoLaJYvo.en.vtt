00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.099
 while I have tokyo I'll be one of the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.190
 highest rates in the world has ever seen Brother 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.160

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.130
 war but what if the time machine where 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:25.410
 people can travel with dimensions therein 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.960
 Ai da silva mota is you too 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.650

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 dimensions where you deceive yourself brother 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.809

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.530
 world saw that no one's staff 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.260
 thought hotel europe the newest city

 to be true what is true 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.930
 are regarded as not being able to be 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.890
 true but end it is true is 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.180
 Larger imagination that was so carlão 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.180

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.560
 machine when I was talking without the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.410
 imagination has not how you produced 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.710
 harmonized only by running away with 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.560
