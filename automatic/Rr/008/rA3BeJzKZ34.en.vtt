00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:03.210
 roj 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.180
 ronald koeman is the last trainer to win the national championship with ajax 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.120
 after a successful year at psv and a foreign adventure in valencia 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.179
 Sunday is PSV Ajax 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.079
 ajax tv ronald koeman 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:21.079
 to watch 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.769
 all the time for it 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.849
 for other fun things outside of football and 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.669
 he must say that 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.349
 falls very well 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.349
 what is it like to follow football a bit from a distance for a year 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.950
 shame yummy i guess it 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.600
 yes it is icc it is of course a forced they got the call 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.030
 at least forced 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.670
 period that does not train 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.240
 and then I decided for myself 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.520
 just to keep making a season out of it 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.520
 everyone should do that once after so many years of living 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.570
 when it's time for other things you 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.020
 what fresher in your head than if you constantly in the football 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.880
 this band and in that respect 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.910
 then it will be another year with the flask tickling the meadows 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.980
 get back to work 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.980
 well it tickles one side 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.760
 yes i don't want to go everywhere but 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.010
 and go to work at every club this year partly due to a certain level 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.470
 used to 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.250
 and that is not that easy and so 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.250
 I make that and I realize that for myself and I make it for myself too 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.530
 not easy because 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.350
 I am not open to everything and it must not be too far away from the Netherlands 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.520
 so we wait quietly 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.170
 after sunday of course psv ajax 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.170
 with the competition actually of square meters 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.159
 how to say so nice memories at both clubs how looks 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.220
 the ronald koeman still to psv ajax 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.220
 but of course there are a lot of interesting competitions 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.260
 the man was the make 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.620
 that championship 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.430
 was at stake 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.840
 that is not now 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.840
 it's for Ajax for second place and it's for PSV 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.089
 long live cup football so yes that is 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:11.719
 not the daily 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.540
 moments pass for both clubs not of course certainly not for psv in the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.029
 last years 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:21.899
 but with one with such an interest of more curious what this is about 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.979
 become completely impartial 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.879
 yes oh well yes it doesn't matter so much to two at both clubs 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.919
 I have been and 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:35.079
 both clubs have championships and at ajax we even have two 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.069
 won 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.469
 in both clubs have p enjoyable moments for me 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.109
 so yes I have not really that I say well I hope 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.999
 that or ajax or psv wins 9 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:52.109
 Grab the best win that made the most claim to victory 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.099
 back to your period as a football player at ajax 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.549
 what the whole day of the match in eindhoven 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.639
 yes it was always difficult can remember that I thought on behalf of 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:04.919
 Ajax 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:08.339
 more often not and then have won and 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.839
 I think you never won with Ajax at PSV yes that could be 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:14.409
 I think I have 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:15.299
 have years 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.239
 yes I am not sure I thought once but it may be that it is not 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.150
 did not do a three-cylinder once 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.170
 but it does indicate that it is also for Ajax and normally always one 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.659
 difficult match 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.219
 and bass and and vice versa ajax psv will undoubtedly 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.269
 ajax have often won in history 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.469
 I think within 2 minutes with 2 0 before 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.429
 played richly I thought 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:59.710
 at ajax I think eventually 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.639
 4 2 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.289
 that helps me a bit more and 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:08.199
 I have of course played at PSV for three years and 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.829
 we have now been champions for three years so yes we were even stronger then 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.500
 can of course also in again 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.500
 two years ago we thought so 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.420
 adults got from ajax in our home game against making ajax 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.009
 time came close to the championship that we finally leave 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:25.879
 being a psv 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.199
 a 5 thought the red cross and 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.779
 that was a swollen competition 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:34.559
 well i then got into the far and wesley sneijder shot a coin from it 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:36.040
 passive balder 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.419
 that will now be alone 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.419
 a nice header 0 2 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.029
 the counter was opening three 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.069
 in Paris to a 5 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.270
 what about the current ajax 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.960
 quite changeable 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.939
 taken over an entire season 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:00.879
 especially the last two to three months, a bit more solid 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.830
 unfortunately for ajax because otherwise I think they had 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.460
 poets and possibly a championship because yes the distance 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.400
 between 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.680
 yes ajax and az it is of course way too big that is not allowed 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.710
 and 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.180
 maybe mark has coenen 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.669
 needed a little more time to finally have the formation true 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.259
 That 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.699
 what he wants to go with it goes further and may also have to do with injuries 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.490
 have and 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.470
 mamet plays the last weeks ajax in pure football made kools 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.620
 the second chamber fraction 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:42.430
 the much needed second place 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.259
 we are real 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.259
 and continue driving 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:49.830
 yes because what is that 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.719
 what is the goals for a club like ajax the plus i think i 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.379
 now falls until the last match day 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:00.619
 to the championship and 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:03.479
 but that did not happen that is disappointing 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.740
 From a European perspective I think they are 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.770
 that they did well but were boring 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.710
 ultimately unfortunate which they were eliminated 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.599
 but yes the the cup and in the competition 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.919
 not win but also have no chance 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.589
 I think that is 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:25.400
 slightly below par 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.639
 is a big difference from your team at ajax and 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.669
 the team is 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.360
 after about one 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.289
 my team back then there was also a helping hand and talented oman 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:40.729
 talented 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.210
 and then the group is now 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.110
 both players now watch 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.360
 in italy spain where but they all walk that too 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.639
 this ajax does not have that 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:52.889
 it's a good team 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.360
 but it is not 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.110
 of the caliber 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.110
 in my period I think there is a difference 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.960
 and they will have to wait or 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.790
 if there is another sneijdertje gentlemen of the vara termeer and heitinga and and and 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:11.929
 name them all in the sense that preceded them or or 

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:16.039
 that again from the youth comes from triada ajax will have to have it 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:19.159
 but I'm going to watch Sunday 

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:20.080
 and 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.939
 yes i know i wanted to be on an island in the beds are on vlieland 

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:29.099
 very coincidentally a weekend so but we will of course look somewhere 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.189
 the stand comes on vlieland I will watch Ajax PSV 

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:35.180
 So make a statement about the result 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.249
 and 

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.490
 just keep everyone happy
