and<00:00:17.760> I'm<00:00:17.850> going<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.270> label<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.690> strands

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
and I'm going to label the strands

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.380 
and I'm going to label the strands
closest<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.590> my<00:00:19.680> face<00:00:19.949> to-face<00:00:20.250> strand<00:00:20.789> the
