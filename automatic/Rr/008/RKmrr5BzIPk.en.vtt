it's<00:00:01.650> be<00:00:01.860> feeding<00:00:02.280> time<00:00:02.629> so<00:00:03.629> I'm<00:00:04.259> going<00:00:04.620> to

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
it's be feeding time so I'm going to

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.440 
it's be feeding time so I'm going to
feed<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.160> bees<00:00:05.540> three<00:00:06.540> kilograms<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.350> sugar

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
feed the bees three kilograms of sugar

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.480 
feed the bees three kilograms of sugar
what<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.540> actually<00:00:09.690> do<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.349> place<00:00:11.340> your

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
what you actually do is you place your

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.789 
what you actually do is you place your
sugar<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.000> suitable<00:00:12.389> container<00:00:12.809> mix<00:00:13.590> it

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
sugar in a suitable container mix it

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.269 
sugar in a suitable container mix it
with<00:00:13.950> water<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.670> make<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.450> really<00:00:15.870> strong

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
with water and make a really strong

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.460 
with water and make a really strong
sugary<00:00:17.279> glucose<00:00:17.880> mix<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.630> for<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.900> bees<00:00:19.109> now

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
sugary glucose mix you for the bees now

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.759 
sugary glucose mix you for the bees now
in<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.740> book<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.100> says<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.850> should<00:00:21.769> for

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
in the book it says that you should for

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.439 
in the book it says that you should for
every<00:00:23.010> one<00:00:23.340> kilogram<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.820> sugar<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.420> should

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
every one kilogram of sugar you should

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.950 
every one kilogram of sugar you should
have<00:00:24.779> one<00:00:25.019> pint<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.619> water<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.570> says<00:00:27.779> an

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
have one pint of water but it says an

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.839 
have one pint of water but it says an
easier<00:00:28.260> way<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.160> put<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.429> sugar

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
easier way to do it is to put the sugar

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.519 
easier way to do it is to put the sugar
into<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.449> container<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.140> you're<00:00:31.260> going<00:00:31.500> to

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
into the container that you're going to

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.910 
into the container that you're going to
use<00:00:31.880> shake<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.600> level<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.140> then

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
use shake it so that it's level and then

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.860 
use shake it so that it's level and then
fill<00:00:35.309> up<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.149> point

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
fill up to that point

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.139 
fill up to that point
wherever<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.559> finishes<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.760> hot<00:00:38.969> water

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
wherever that finishes up with hot water

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.639 
wherever that finishes up with hot water
to<00:00:39.420> make<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> syrup<00:00:39.930> which<00:00:40.230> sounds<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.559> lot

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
to make a syrup which sounds a lot

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.020 
to make a syrup which sounds a lot
easier<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.100> me<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.340> that's<00:00:41.550> about<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.910> I'm

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
easier to me so that's about that I'm

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.170 
easier to me so that's about that I'm
going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.300> use<00:00:42.390> now<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:44.670> first<00:00:44.879> thing<00:00:45.059> I'll

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
going to use now so the first thing I'll

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.430 
going to use now so the first thing I'll
do<00:00:45.270> when<00:00:45.390> they<00:00:45.510> spot<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> sugar<00:00:46.110> into<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
do when they spot the sugar into the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.939 
do when they spot the sugar into the
container<00:00:50.629> it's<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.960> normal<00:00:52.199> granulated

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
container it's just normal granulated

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:07.890 
container it's just normal granulated
sugar<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.370> don't<00:00:53.520> need<00:00:53.670> anything<00:00:53.879> special

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.100 

so<00:01:08.900> that's<00:01:09.110> three<00:01:09.320> kilograms<00:01:09.800> of<00:01:09.950> sugar<00:01:14.110> and

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
so that's three kilograms of sugar and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.650 
so that's three kilograms of sugar and
be<00:01:15.200> too<00:01:15.410> worried<00:01:15.710> about<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:16.160> that's<00:01:17.120> up<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.540> the

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
be too worried about it that's up to the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.250 
be too worried about it that's up to the
three<00:01:18.320> litre<00:01:18.820> mark<00:01:19.820> on<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.720> pan

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
three litre mark on the pan

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.180 
three litre mark on the pan
this<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:21.950> boiling<00:01:22.190> water<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:24.440> prepare<00:01:25.160> just

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
this is boiling water to prepare just

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.080 
this is boiling water to prepare just
before<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:25.730> started<00:01:26.090> them<00:01:26.240> in<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.390> video

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.450 

that's<00:01:32.090> about<00:01:32.360> Brian<00:01:32.660> its<00:01:32.930> narrative<00:01:33.650> three

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
that's about Brian its narrative three

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.480 
that's about Brian its narrative three
litres<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:36.380> that's<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.740> mix<00:01:36.950> I'm<00:01:37.160> just<00:01:37.340> going<00:01:37.460> to

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
litres so that's a mix I'm just going to

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.280 
litres so that's a mix I'm just going to
stir<00:01:37.729> that<00:01:37.880> now<00:01:38.090> it's<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.390> trying<00:01:38.750> dissolve<00:01:39.110> all

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
stir that now it's a trying dissolve all

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:57.400 
stir that now it's a trying dissolve all
the<00:01:39.410> sugar<00:01:43.479> heat<00:01:45.010> we'll<00:01:46.010> see<00:01:46.250> I<00:01:56.020> don't<00:01:57.020> see<00:01:57.200> get

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
the sugar heat we'll see I don't see get

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.710 
the sugar heat we'll see I don't see get
it<00:01:57.470> all<00:01:57.590> over<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.860> kitchen<00:01:58.070> I<00:02:01.479> want<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.570> put

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
it all over the kitchen I want to put

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.570 
it all over the kitchen I want to put
some<00:02:02.869> heat<00:02:03.080> on<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:03.350> just<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.070> give<00:02:04.220> it<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.369> pulp

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
some heat on it just to give it a pulp

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.919 
some heat on it just to give it a pulp
in<00:02:04.760> hand<00:02:07.090> that's<00:02:08.090> what<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.330> looks<00:02:08.540> like<00:02:08.720> before

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
in hand that's what it looks like before

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.740 
in hand that's what it looks like before
it's<00:02:09.290> dissolved<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.399> then<00:02:11.269> we're<00:02:11.630> gonna

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
it's dissolved and then we're gonna

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.509 
it's dissolved and then we're gonna
dissolve<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:12.650> it'll<00:02:12.769> be<00:02:12.920> clear<00:02:13.160> when<00:02:13.400> it's

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
dissolve it and it'll be clear when it's

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.580 
dissolve it and it'll be clear when it's
finished<00:02:13.850> dissolving<00:02:16.989> so<00:02:17.989> unique<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.290> he

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
finished dissolving so unique that he

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.199 
finished dissolving so unique that he
acid<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.280> speed<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.640> process<00:02:20.060> up

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
acid it to speed the process up

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.270 
acid it to speed the process up
otherwise<00:02:20.780> it'll<00:02:21.410> take<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.769> forever<00:02:21.950> to

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
otherwise it'll take you forever to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.830 
otherwise it'll take you forever to
dissolve<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.970> sugar<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.330> fact<00:02:23.540> I'm<00:02:23.690> not<00:02:23.780> even

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
dissolve the sugar in fact I'm not even

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.680 
dissolve the sugar in fact I'm not even
sure<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.380> would<00:02:24.530> dissolve<00:02:25.030> if<00:02:26.030> he<00:02:26.269> didn't<00:02:26.570> want

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
sure it would dissolve if he didn't want

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.380 
sure it would dissolve if he didn't want
me<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.830> I'll<00:02:28.130> just<00:02:28.280> keep<00:02:28.790> working<00:02:29.150> at<00:02:29.239> that

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
me to so I'll just keep working at that

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.000 
me to so I'll just keep working at that
it's<00:02:29.660> getting<00:02:29.810> clearer<00:02:30.170> all<00:02:30.410> that's<00:02:30.590> out<00:02:30.739> and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
it's getting clearer all that's out and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.860 
it's getting clearer all that's out and
see<00:02:31.130> any<00:02:31.370> clearer<00:02:31.700> but<00:02:32.269> it's<00:02:32.420> not<00:02:32.540> got<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.690> way

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
see any clearer but it's not got a way

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.000 
see any clearer but it's not got a way
to<00:02:32.930> go<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:36.110> other<00:02:36.320> thing<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.620> if<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:36.860> use<00:02:36.890> a

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
to go the other thing is if you use a

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.310 
to go the other thing is if you use a
big<00:02:37.310> pan<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:37.730> makes<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.090> we<00:02:38.420> were<00:02:38.690> easier<00:02:39.019> to

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
big pan it makes it we were easier to

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.229 
big pan it makes it we were easier to
stir<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.280> get<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.550> thing<00:02:40.730> mixed<00:02:40.910> up<00:02:41.090> if

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
stir it and get the thing mixed up if

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.790 
stir it and get the thing mixed up if
you<00:02:41.330> put<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.600> into<00:02:41.870> smaller<00:02:42.200> pan<00:02:42.500> you'll<00:02:42.680> end

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
you put it into smaller pan you'll end

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.380 
you put it into smaller pan you'll end
up<00:02:42.890> slopping<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.430> over<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.760> sides<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.239> making

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
up slopping it over the sides and making

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.750 
up slopping it over the sides and making
a<00:02:44.540> right<00:02:44.660> mess<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:46.280> hope<00:02:46.489> in<00:02:46.640> the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
a right mess of you you hope in the

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.880 
a right mess of you you hope in the
kitchen<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:47.930> find<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.290> biggest<00:02:48.470> contender

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
kitchen so find the biggest contender

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.490 
kitchen so find the biggest contender
you<00:02:49.160> can<00:02:49.400> or<00:02:49.660> maybe<00:02:50.660> do<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:50.959> in<00:02:51.050> batches<00:02:51.230> so

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
you can or maybe do it in batches so

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.620 
you can or maybe do it in batches so
that<00:02:51.800> you've<00:02:51.920> got<00:02:51.950> more

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
that you've got more

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.500 
that you've got more
for<00:02:53.080> weeks<00:02:53.230> in<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:56.760> right<00:02:57.760> there<00:02:58.000> we<00:02:58.090> go<00:02:58.240> that's

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
for weeks in it right there we go that's

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.180 
for weeks in it right there we go that's
just<00:02:58.750> about<00:02:58.960> done<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.650> can<00:02:59.800> see<00:02:59.980> now<00:03:00.160> that

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
just about done you can see now that

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.040 
just about done you can see now that
it's<00:03:00.550> clear<00:03:00.880> there<00:03:01.300> is<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.450> little<00:03:01.660> sugar<00:03:01.960> in

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
it's clear there is a little sugar in

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.270 
it's clear there is a little sugar in
the<00:03:02.140> bottom<00:03:02.320> though<00:03:02.620> I'm<00:03:02.800> not<00:03:02.920> going<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.130> worry

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
the bottom though I'm not going to worry

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.820 
the bottom though I'm not going to worry
about<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.870> that's<00:03:05.050> taken<00:03:05.410> about<00:03:05.560> 15

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
about that so that's taken about 15

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.450 
about that so that's taken about 15
minutes<00:03:06.460> from<00:03:06.820> start<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.330> finish<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:08.460> what

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
minutes from start to finish and what

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.160 
minutes from start to finish and what
I'm<00:03:09.580> going<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.730> do<00:03:09.820> now<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.330> take<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.930> off<00:03:10.990> the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
I'm going to do now is take it off the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.660 
I'm going to do now is take it off the
heat<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:12.030> I'll<00:03:13.030> let<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.210> cool<00:03:13.480> down<00:03:14.460> this<00:03:15.460> is<00:03:15.640> a

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
heat and I'll let it cool down this is a

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.370 
heat and I'll let it cool down this is a
frame<00:03:16.000> that<00:03:16.210> I<00:03:16.270> made<00:03:16.480> for<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.780> feeder<00:03:16.990> to<00:03:17.200> fit

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
frame that I made for the feeder to fit

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.560 
frame that I made for the feeder to fit
in<00:03:17.530> it's<00:03:17.680> called<00:03:17.920> an<00:03:18.040> Inc<00:03:18.240> it's<00:03:19.240> the<00:03:19.390> same

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
in it's called an Inc it's the same

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.590 
in it's called an Inc it's the same
dimension<00:03:20.290> as<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.890> hive<00:03:21.490> itself<00:03:21.970> as<00:03:22.150> an<00:03:22.270> us<00:03:22.390> or

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
dimension as the hive itself as an us or

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.480 
dimension as the hive itself as an us or
hive<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.560> just<00:03:23.770> made<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:24.070> out<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.250> some

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
hive so I just made that out of some

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.860 
hive so I just made that out of some
pine<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:27.400> beef<00:03:27.580> either<00:03:27.820> itself<00:03:28.330> fits<00:03:28.660> inside

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
pine the beef either itself fits inside

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.160 
pine the beef either itself fits inside
the<00:03:29.230> ink<00:03:29.490> this<00:03:30.490> move<00:03:30.730> of<00:03:30.940> two<00:03:31.150> parts<00:03:31.630> this<00:03:32.110> is

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
the ink this move of two parts this is

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.250 
the ink this move of two parts this is
the<00:03:32.320> main<00:03:32.620> tree<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:34.420> slot<00:03:34.720> there<00:03:34.930> is<00:03:35.080> where

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
the main tree that slot there is where

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.630 
the main tree that slot there is where
the<00:03:35.350> bees<00:03:35.500> actually<00:03:35.680> come<00:03:36.070> through<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.430> feed

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
the bees actually come through to feed

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.520 
the bees actually come through to feed
when<00:03:36.910> they're<00:03:37.180> when<00:03:37.900> they're<00:03:37.930> inside<00:03:38.320> the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
when they're when they're inside the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.150 
when they're when they're inside the
hive<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:39.790> actually<00:03:40.360> fits<00:03:40.600> over<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:40.900> top<00:03:41.200> and

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
hive this actually fits over the top and

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.220 
hive this actually fits over the top and
prevents<00:03:42.640> beach<00:03:42.880> from<00:03:43.180> moving<00:03:43.450> across<00:03:43.690> into

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
prevents beach from moving across into

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.870 
prevents beach from moving across into
the<00:03:44.260> actual<00:03:44.650> syrup<00:03:45.010> itself<00:03:45.430> otherwise<00:03:45.640> you'll

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
the actual syrup itself otherwise you'll

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.830 
the actual syrup itself otherwise you'll
end<00:03:46.030> up<00:03:46.120> drowning<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.600> lot<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.840> bees<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.840> it

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
end up drowning a lot of bees so it

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.690 
end up drowning a lot of bees so it
split<00:03:50.170> into<00:03:50.320> two<00:03:50.590> half<00:03:50.860> so<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:51.130> can<00:03:51.400> put<00:03:51.670> a

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
split into two half so you can put a

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.910 
split into two half so you can put a
small<00:03:51.850> feed<00:03:52.300> our<00:03:52.510> allowed<00:03:52.780> speed<00:03:53.110> arts<00:03:53.740> it'll

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
small feed our allowed speed arts it'll

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.560 
small feed our allowed speed arts it'll
be<00:03:53.980> using<00:03:54.280> both<00:03:54.460> sides<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.060> particular

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
be using both sides of this particular

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.480 
be using both sides of this particular
container<00:03:55.900> what<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.680> can't<00:03:56.920> see<00:03:57.130> very<00:03:57.160> well

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
container what you can't see very well

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.610 
container what you can't see very well
on<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:58.180> camera<00:03:58.690> is<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:58.840> it's<00:03:59.140> lock<00:03:59.440> and

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
on the camera is that it's lock and

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.240 
on the camera is that it's lock and
inwards<00:03:59.890> so<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:01.540> syrup<00:04:02.530> will<00:04:02.710> actually<00:04:03.040> look

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
inwards so the syrup will actually look

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.490 
inwards so the syrup will actually look
down<00:04:03.550> into<00:04:03.760> this<00:04:03.970> Ridge<00:04:04.900> there<00:04:05.200> where<00:04:05.410> the

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
down into this Ridge there where the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.740 
down into this Ridge there where the
bees<00:04:05.680> will<00:04:05.890> feed<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:07.090> bees<00:04:07.270> will<00:04:07.480> climb<00:04:07.720> up

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
bees will feed the bees will climb up

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.070 
bees will feed the bees will climb up
down<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.620> inside<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.280> feed<00:04:09.670> on<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.750> syrup

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
down the inside and feed on the syrup

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.930 
down the inside and feed on the syrup
ticket<00:04:11.740> back<00:04:11.830> down<00:04:12.040> into<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.430> hive<00:04:12.610> and<00:04:12.790> then

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
ticket back down into the hive and then

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.050 
ticket back down into the hive and then
store<00:04:13.240> it<00:04:13.270> in<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.600> honeycomb

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
store it in the honeycomb

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.630 
store it in the honeycomb
right<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:16.299> now<00:04:16.480> I'm<00:04:16.600> going<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:16.810> fit<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.080> feeder

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
right so now I'm going to fit the feeder

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.000 
right so now I'm going to fit the feeder
in<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:18.790> hive<00:04:19.470> just<00:04:20.470> lift<00:04:20.710> off<00:04:20.830> the<00:04:20.980> lid<00:04:23.010> I've

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
in the hive just lift off the lid I've

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.680 
in the hive just lift off the lid I've
got<00:04:24.220> to<00:04:24.370> remove<00:04:24.670> the<00:04:25.000> gloves<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.480> allow<00:04:25.630> the

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
got to remove the gloves to allow the
