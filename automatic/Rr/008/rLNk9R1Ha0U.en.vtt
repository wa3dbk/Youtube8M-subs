00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:55.370
 more time consuming and more relaxed and 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:01:06.979
 in this we will talk about if 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:06.979

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:17.130
 weakness and one that is of d 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:24.240
 So you had something to do with 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:27.840
 the chemist these things you use 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.130
 these positions at the end because it's an hour 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.439
 there everyone is better 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.600
 balanced and this is something that can 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.530
 seal different carlos and leave in 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.299
 front of them 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.960
 Thank you so let's start here 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.250
 staff and wood is first thing 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.510
 run run run 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.180
 leaps we have wood that goes more 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.540
 here that the staff does not steal beauty 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.450
 then we 'll make a sword of 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.100
 of stone we'll even try 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.720
 look for someone to try to use the 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.330
 kit the maximum and such I could present 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.220
 for you guys the coolest way 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.730
 I do not know if I'll wait until the office is 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.130
 Because I do not know if I'll get there more than 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:22.880
 good are going to make our halt 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:25.010
 ever in the hunger games pa staff not 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.980
 It's a review I 'm not doing, it's just 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.910
 a play with you with the same kit 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:39.020
 present to you 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:41.590
 such a hole in the ground then 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.590
 usual thing 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:52.610
 Let's see, I'll leave it a little close. 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:03:13.730
 from the mouth 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:26.260
 prevented a place to welcome us and a 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:26.260
 It took a while before the ravine took this one. 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.050
 preparing 15 seconds 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.700
 You have to be smart, Carlos Pollak. 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.650
 killing people think it's time to 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.630
 get that at least 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.290
 But let's be far behind here. 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.690
 In the galley there for us, we have more. 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.890
 angle of view not to be surprised 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:04:36.290
 Beauty looks like we 're here 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:04:40.930
 alone can not this already turned up 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.930
 here far 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.639
 - a sword and one will give what we 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.190
 makes the first 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.900
 I think I'll do the sword, I will not do it. 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.789
 a breastplate 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:00.780
 I'll start differently, we organized. 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:03.300
 the first is harbin and emad al 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:20.419
 qariri the position it stops creasing pv 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:25.740
 Leave me anything I played 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:55.550
 there we saw that this came the 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:58.849
 gave result and now roll up 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.409
 should have left 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:02.209
 I think he's going to have to go up here. 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.939
 get something or simon just have nothing 

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:07.969
 of iron thing here but have seen more 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:10.219
 or less the strategies you can have right? 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:13.009
 with the kit that's my intention is not 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:14.839
 to win the game is not to show you 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:19.069
 More or less, what can you do? 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:22.759
 You still have weaknesses and then the guy 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:07:14.839
 arrived here can now train on it and 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:07:17.180
 free flight radio even died for you 

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:22.479
 the possibilities of the team 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.479
 You can combine it with your friends. 

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:32.809
 but that's it you can use mask 

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:34.669
 and to reject he was surprised too 

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:37.579
 did not have much to do 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:44.649
 It was one thing happens happens but it is 

00:07:37.579 --> 00:07:44.649
 this was not winning the game can 

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:51.110
 including going well 

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:53.209
