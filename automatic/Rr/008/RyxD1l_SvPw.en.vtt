00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.549
 well all the boys of the gf clan are 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.690
 People female and welcome back here on 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.119
 our channel with a new video 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.730
 then first of all I wanted to start the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.320
 video apologizing for the mistake it is 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.490
 been loaded two hours ago more or less 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.140
 now the video has been removed there 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.839
 you are reviewing why 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.320
 I practically do the commentaries 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:33.150
 I did it on my cell phone 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.470
 listened again you felt good then I did it 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.720
 sent on whatsapp in milan then 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.430
 he should have made the video unfortunately 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.960
 probably inside its zap yes 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.449
 some data are lost for the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.960
 connection will be for bugs and at each 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.550
 the way it was loaded the same I didn't 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.870
 I knew nothing of this and is not giving the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.640
 blame milan because he too has not 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.160
 all the time to listen again 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.440
 request but close this 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.359
 paragraph in a few words we redo the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.519
 video I hope this time of problems 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.530
 there are none and then will restart with 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.090
 the topic that maybe could like you 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.530
 but before doing this I would keep it 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.080
 introduce gameplay that just any 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.900
 enter nng of our gtf kevin that 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.670
 today it offers us the number of ganz tricks 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.990
 highest in Italy in fact only 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.660
 even on the domain it comes to well 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.640
 99 gastric to one from 100 made in 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.890
 only on 6 against 6 domain with the poor 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.480
 cargo boys then I would now 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.920
 calmly resume the argument that already 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.540
 I had discussed in the last video 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.950
 unfortunately precisely as I said not 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.870
 but you could hear it now 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.220
 I hope you can appreciate me better 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.190
 sorry it won't happen again 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.870
 then let's start with today's topic 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.850
 today I wanted to talk with you a little 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.950
 those that are fashions and fashions and not 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.470
 the beautiful ones where maybe you go to follow 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.820
 an example of originality and progress 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.500
 in quotes today I'm here to talk 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.990
 of the fashions that are defined 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.810
 cancer of the social networks here in a few 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.000
 words as you can see on facebook there 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.710
 are many people who just see one 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.010
 something different though 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.650
 extremely stupid follow him like a 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.210
 mandrio like an eat a pack of 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.130
 lemmings 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.320
 but what is the real problem of this 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.720
 real problem consists in social media because 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.430
 because I have been told several times that 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.310
 the difference between the real world and 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.799
 facebook youtube twitter between the world 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.900
 real and internet is that internet was 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.550
 with time capable of giving voice to 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.050
 foolish what it means 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.080
 that there has always been what maybe 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.610
 in the bar he said bullshit or crazy 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.100
 that was bullshit in the middle of the street 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.260
 if you passed it you saw a madman 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.120
 no shit you pulled yourself forward to the bar c al 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.460
 asshole who says bullshit you leave him 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.130
 just stop talking there you don't see it anymore 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.930
 instead on the internet the problem is that 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.140
 when one of these people starts 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.080
 in quotation marks to show on the web the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.040
 people start deifying me I do 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.390
 an example 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.370
 now I don't want to mention names I don't know if 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.540
 you know rosario muniz I'm sorry to do 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.550
 names, however, seem to me an example 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.710
 quite concrete that person is one 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.390
 person who if there was no internet not 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.550
 would go anywhere 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.750
 with the internet a name has been made and this 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.430
 I think it's one of the most problems 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.260
 great internet people that don't 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.670
 they use to follow what really is 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.630
 should be followed because there are people 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.400
 on the Internet 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.470
 I know channels maybe even from 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.000
 thirty subscribers on youtube that make gods 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.190
 videos that would be very useful where 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.410
 maybe they tell you how to do stuff with i 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.830
 cell phones where maybe they tell you how 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.080
 related videos and crates I know the tasks 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.580
 some fun videos they have 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.739
 few people, however, people do 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.570
 he prefers to concentrate on things 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.580
 strange and I think this is one of the 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.290
 major internet problems and this 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.030
 is the first thing I wanted to deal with 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.520
 you the stupidity of people in the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.670
 follow a certain category precisely of 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.900
 the second problem is individuals 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.910
 precisely the fashions 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.489
 now the one in vogue and the woman already 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.890
 challenge that is the fashion where a 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.810
 any kid girl gets between 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.820
 quotes makes ugly by putting on 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.330
 black dots in the face of the monocle 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.890
 dirty lipstick makes you ugly then with 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.900
 the cream of taq taq taq becomes 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.180
 beautiful that is in some cases because 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.660
 many more of the same so 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.120
 unwatchable pro we leave out ok becomes 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.270
 beautiful okay it has lost its meaning 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.709
 of why this was really done 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.120
 was born not to judge people 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.890
 of appearance and maybe even could 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.600
 be a nice and serious thing done in 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.430
 a certain way no then he started the 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.950
 people to use it as exhibitionism 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.120
 wanting to be seen wanting to show a 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.560
 all that I am beautiful 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.890
 in practice these people don't want to 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.660
 be judged only if they are ugly 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.950
 then there is no good a judgment of the 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.500
 people, however, are not good only if 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.300
 negative because 16 do not judge me not 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.560
 judge me neither for good nor for evil not 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.720
 is 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.250
 one tells you you're ugly can't judge 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.870
 he must shut up instead if he tells you you are 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.970
 nice if you have a friend and no 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.940
 that is a problem and also for 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.430
 this according to me internet between 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.870
 quotes helps a lot to give precisely 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.300
 support to these people who do not have 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.700
 well understood what hypocrisy means 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.980
 just say no 3d themes you tell me you are 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.300
 bad is not freedom of speech mi 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.889
 you say you are beautiful if my best 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.720
 friend you see this is something that also 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.639
 that of george mitchell really is 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.450
 taking a lot of foot maybe he can give 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.070
 nuisance 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.169
 finally guys I thought of each other 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.120
 day let's pretend in ten years 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.710
 then for those who didn't know when 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.880
 is still looking for a job on 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.669
 employer 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.169
 many times not always before hiring 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.040
 maybe a person should take a look at 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.740
 the one that has its facebook profile 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.600
 because however with time facebook is 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.610
 become in quotes is the largest 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.139
 and the biggest business card that 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.520
 be there if I want to know how one 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.290
 first person I do and 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.630
 look for it on facebook and see if 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.950
 anyway I can get something out of it 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.830
 we pretend of his private life 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.870
 that in 10 years one of these will arrive 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.490
 does the don gigi challenge me from an employer 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.140
 serious work maybe for a job 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:44.900
 important I don't know any director 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.490
 what is what it does goes to see profile 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.320
 facebook and facebook profile is not that 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.210
 that changes with the years remains that me 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.310
 I see that even ten years ago he did 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.380
 I say something like that but who 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.110
 I'm assuming there is a need to realize 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.910
 that those things don't just see her 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.650
 your friends because maybe I could 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.820
 even make a video where living beautiful 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.710
 I even wear underwear in 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.539
 head to make him stupid to make people laugh 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.919
 my friends but I send it to them I don't 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.020
 put in a platform where anyway 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:12.080
 everyone can see it but above all 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.780
 everyone can reflect on it 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.760
 what did I do because maybe you maybe 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.560
 your lovers who follow you 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.630
 they say you are beautiful and you also do 5 thousand 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.910
 I like other 10 thousand people though 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.680
 they say but asked jerk and this 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.060
 I think it's another thing on which 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.889
 you have to think before using 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.720
 internet because what on the internet is 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.850
 very difficult to delete it and then 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.490
 must use it disputes prudence but 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.229
 especially with a lot of rationality 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.970
 obviously the ones I'm giving you 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:41.510
 they are personal opinions so I don't want to 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.220
 to flow into the objectivity of things 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.539
 they are subjective opinions then maybe there 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.470
 they are people to whom these things can 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.780
 like for example also the 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.090
 ice basket challenge had started as 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.340
 a good charity thing he did 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.810
 people have been lost on 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.420
 meaning if it is passed to do it for 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:00.330
 show off to do the performance 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.010
 to show the course in costume 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.100
 the tits in quotation marks to show 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:07.560
 abdominals or to have fun and you are 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.060
 lost the sense of why that moderates 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.230
 in vogue so this I think is a 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.030
 big internet problem 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.500
