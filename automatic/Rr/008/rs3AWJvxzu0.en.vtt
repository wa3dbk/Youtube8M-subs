meat wise oh that is a good question oh
well<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.810> microwave<00:02:32.080> came<00:02:32.260> with

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
well the microwave came with

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.290 
well the microwave came with
instructions<00:02:33.010> right<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:33.790> I'll<00:02:33.880> just<00:02:34.000> look<00:02:34.180> up

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
instructions right so I'll just look up

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.830 
instructions right so I'll just look up
chicken<00:02:35.280> no<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.550> think<00:02:36.790> pork<00:02:37.210> could<00:02:37.330> be<00:02:37.420> closest

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
chicken no I think pork could be closest

chicken no I think pork could be closest
all<00:02:38.080> right<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.440> realized<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.220> pork<00:02:39.490> is<00:02:39.670> most

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
all right I realized that pork is most

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.900 
all right I realized that pork is most
