oh<00:01:39.830> my<00:01:40.830> word<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.220> don't<00:01:41.399> know<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.580> we're<00:01:41.700> gonna

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
oh my word I don't know if we're gonna

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.779 
oh my word I don't know if we're gonna
get<00:01:42.149> make<00:01:42.330> a<00:01:42.479> splash<00:01:42.720> now<00:01:42.929> because<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.319> I

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
get make a splash now because of that I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.309 
get make a splash now because of that I
think<00:01:44.789> these<00:01:45.390> levels<00:01:45.750> are<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.929> bit<00:01:46.170> more

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
think these levels are a bit more

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.919 
think these levels are a bit more
forgiving<00:01:47.009> because<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.429> to<00:01:47.520> climb<00:01:47.929> but

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
forgiving because you have to climb but

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.639 
forgiving because you have to climb but
we<00:01:49.049> shall<00:01:49.229> see<00:01:50.720> it's<00:01:51.720> not<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:51.929> to<00:01:52.170> bad<00:01:52.350> hoop

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
we shall see it's not going to bad hoop

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.169 
we shall see it's not going to bad hoop
going<00:01:53.039> pretty<00:01:53.220> fast<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> ironing

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
going pretty fast on to the ironing

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.029 
going pretty fast on to the ironing
board<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:55.140> gotta<00:01:55.289> get<00:01:55.350> onto<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> bed<00:01:55.799> for

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.179 
okay think we could have done that quite
a<00:02:00.750> bit<00:02:00.899> faster<00:02:01.080> bit<00:02:01.470> would<00:02:01.590> be<00:02:01.619> our<00:02:01.830> best<00:02:02.009> time

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
a bit faster bit would be our best time

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:09.350 
a bit faster bit would be our best time
but<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> lot<00:02:04.640> yes<00:02:05.640> say<00:02:05.880> plus<00:02:06.060> plus<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:08.360> moving

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
but a lot yes say plus plus and moving

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.589 
but a lot yes say plus plus and moving
on<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> bathroom<00:02:10.430> I've<00:02:11.430> done<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:11.940> level<00:02:12.330> so

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
on to the bathroom I've done so level so

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.140 
on to the bathroom I've done so level so
many<00:02:12.810> times<00:02:13.080> I've<00:02:13.380> got<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:13.860> close<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:14.910> so

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
many times I've got so close but it's so

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.259 
many times I've got so close but it's so
fiddly<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:16.410> there's<00:02:17.070> loads<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.910> bits<00:02:18.120> to

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
fiddly just there's loads of bits to

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.520 
fiddly just there's loads of bits to
this<00:02:18.390> level<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:19.709> just<00:02:19.890> do<00:02:20.070> so<00:02:20.459> wrong

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
this level that you can just do so wrong

you'll see what I mean a bit but there's
this<00:03:10.440> ramp<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:11.580> all<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:12.750> have<00:03:12.900> to

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
this ramp so you do all this you have to

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.480 
this ramp so you do all this you have to
get<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.230> as<00:03:13.380> good<00:03:13.410> as<00:03:13.740> possible<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:14.340> if<00:03:14.400> you

oh come on come on okay
I<00:03:25.830> think<00:03:26.100> we<00:03:26.220> could<00:03:26.460> get<00:03:26.640> better<00:03:26.850> than<00:03:27.060> that

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
I think we could get better than that

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.920 
I think we could get better than that
but<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.450> think<00:03:27.570> we've<00:03:28.020> got<00:03:28.050> I<00:03:28.200> plus<00:03:28.530> plus<00:03:30.320> yes

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930
