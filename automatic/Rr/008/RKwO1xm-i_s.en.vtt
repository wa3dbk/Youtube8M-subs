00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860

and professional sport economics you
know<00:01:43.549> very<00:01:43.580> very<00:01:44.090> good<00:01:44.510> we<00:01:44.720> saw<00:01:44.900> his<00:01:45.080> ready<00:01:45.380> in

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
know very very good we saw his ready in

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.670 
know very very good we saw his ready in
India<00:01:46.190> nervous<00:01:46.490> he's<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:47.060> good<00:01:47.210> shape<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.810> think

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
India nervous he's in good shape I think

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.380 
India nervous he's in good shape I think
so<00:01:48.799> because<00:01:49.510> he<00:01:51.520> only<00:01:52.520> not<00:01:52.850> as<00:01:52.970> practically

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
so because he only not as practically

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.219 
so because he only not as practically
without<00:01:53.799> any<00:01:54.799> opening<00:01:55.610> sure<00:01:56.299> is<00:01:56.659> showing

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
without any opening sure is showing

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.680 
without any opening sure is showing
anything<00:01:57.530> she<00:01:57.830> was<00:01:57.979> just<00:01:58.390> playing<00:01:59.390> whatever

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
anything she was just playing whatever

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.760 
anything she was just playing whatever
openings<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.619> just<00:02:00.830> was<00:02:00.979> fighting<00:02:01.400> and

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
openings and just was fighting and

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.700 
openings and just was fighting and
of<00:02:03.340> course<00:02:03.609> it's<00:02:03.880> much<00:02:04.450> more<00:02:04.630> difficult<00:02:04.990> to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
of course it's much more difficult to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.369 
of course it's much more difficult to
play<00:02:06.429> like<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:06.789> because<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.840> know<00:02:07.990> we<00:02:08.200> have

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
play like this because you know we have

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.979 
play like this because you know we have
no<00:02:08.530> advantage<00:02:08.769> with<00:02:09.099> white<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.700> almost<00:02:10.300> with

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
no advantage with white and almost with

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.699 
no advantage with white and almost with
black<00:02:11.230> you're<00:02:11.670> worse<00:02:12.780> usually<00:02:13.780> without

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
black you're worse usually without

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.759 
black you're worse usually without
preparation<00:02:15.220> but<00:02:15.819> even<00:02:16.239> never<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.349> that<00:02:17.379> hue

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
preparation but even never like that hue

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.460 
preparation but even never like that hue
hue<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.879> think<00:02:19.330> he's<00:02:19.629> in<00:02:19.810> good<00:02:19.900> shape<00:02:19.959> it

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
hue in so I think he's in good shape it

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.309 
hue in so I think he's in good shape it
will<00:02:20.620> be<00:02:21.120> very<00:02:22.120> exciting<00:02:22.780> much<00:02:22.930> because<00:02:23.200> I

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
will be very exciting much because I

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.630 
will be very exciting much because I
think<00:02:23.379> we<00:02:23.650> should<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:24.010> prepared<00:02:24.370> very<00:02:24.549> well<00:02:29.640> no

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
think we should be prepared very well no

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.729 
think we should be prepared very well no
more<00:02:30.910> like<00:02:31.379> that<00:02:32.379> matches<00:02:32.920> before<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.870> did

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
more like that matches before and I did

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.809 
more like that matches before and I did
