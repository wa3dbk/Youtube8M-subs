knife<00:03:04.129> art<00:03:04.959> I've<00:03:05.959> had<00:03:06.140> this<00:03:06.319> for<00:03:06.379> about<00:03:06.620> a

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
knife art I've had this for about a

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.800 
knife art I've had this for about a
month<00:03:06.950> had<00:03:07.519> plenty<00:03:07.909> of<00:03:08.030> sub<00:03:08.269> ences<00:03:08.599> in<00:03:08.720> the

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
month had plenty of sub ences in the

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:25.960 
month had plenty of sub ences in the
past<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:12.010> here<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.099> is

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.530 

and<00:03:26.970> obviously<00:03:27.240> what<00:03:27.540> struck<00:03:27.840> me<00:03:27.870> first<00:03:29.540> when

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
and obviously what struck me first when

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.470 
and obviously what struck me first when
I<00:03:30.570> got<00:03:30.750> this<00:03:30.960> knife<00:03:31.610> was<00:03:32.610> how<00:03:32.880> wide<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.300> was

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
I got this knife was how wide it was

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.220 
I got this knife was how wide it was
yeah<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:35.100> think<00:03:35.250> it's<00:03:36.000> like<00:03:36.180> three<00:03:36.540> point<00:03:36.870> six

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
yeah I think it's like three point six

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.430 
yeah I think it's like three point six
or<00:03:37.530> seven<00:03:37.800> ounces<00:03:38.160> but<00:03:38.820> uh<00:03:39.080> when<00:03:40.080> you<00:03:40.170> carry<00:03:40.380> a

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
or seven ounces but uh when you carry a

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.070 
or seven ounces but uh when you carry a
full<00:03:40.620> tie<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.280> regular<00:03:42.270> sebenza<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:42.870> then<00:03:42.960> you

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
full tie a regular sebenza and then you

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.080 
full tie a regular sebenza and then you
get<00:03:43.200> this<00:03:43.440> one<00:03:43.650> it's<00:03:44.160> completely<00:03:44.670> different

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
get this one it's completely different

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.170 
get this one it's completely different
and<00:03:45.270> I<00:03:46.140> honestly<00:03:46.920> didn't<00:03:47.370> like<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.760> feel<00:03:48.000> at

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
and I honestly didn't like the feel at

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.340 
and I honestly didn't like the feel at
first<00:03:48.390> I<00:03:48.570> thought<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.720> was<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.930> little<00:03:49.050> too

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
first I thought it was a little too

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.150 
first I thought it was a little too
light<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:51.350> you<00:03:52.350> know<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.500> liked<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.040> way<00:03:53.130> it

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
light so you know I liked the way it

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.010 
light so you know I liked the way it
looked<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.180> just<00:03:54.480> didn't<00:03:54.630> like<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.870> way<00:03:54.900> it

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
looked so I just didn't like the way it

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.460 
looked so I just didn't like the way it
felt<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.500> went<00:03:55.980> ahead<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.160> carried<00:03:56.520> it<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:57.470> you

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
felt I went ahead and carried it and you

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.460 
felt I went ahead and carried it and you
know<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.620> didn't<00:03:59.010> think<00:03:59.190> twice<00:03:59.370> about<00:03:59.490> the<00:03:59.820> wait

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
know I didn't think twice about the wait

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.650 
know I didn't think twice about the wait
maybe<00:04:01.470> like<00:04:01.680> two<00:04:01.890> weeks<00:04:02.040> later<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.640> put<00:04:03.510> the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
maybe like two weeks later I put the

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.930 
maybe like two weeks later I put the
picked<00:04:04.230> up<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.440> regular<00:04:04.770> one<00:04:04.920> again<00:04:05.190> dan<00:04:05.820> I

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
picked up the regular one again dan I

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.380 
picked up the regular one again dan I
think<00:04:06.000> felt<00:04:06.480> like<00:04:06.630> a<00:04:06.660> tank<00:04:08.870> so<00:04:11.150> it's<00:04:12.150> real

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
think felt like a tank so it's real

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.470 
think felt like a tank so it's real
smooth<00:04:13.160> it's<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.459> lot<00:04:14.760> smoother<00:04:15.239> than<00:04:15.360> the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
smooth it's a lot smoother than the

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.090 
smooth it's a lot smoother than the
regular<00:04:15.660> version<00:04:15.870> sebenza<00:04:17.540> know<00:04:18.919> it's<00:04:19.919> weird

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
regular version sebenza know it's weird

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.039 
regular version sebenza know it's weird
because<00:04:20.280> there<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.549> only<00:04:20.640> one<00:04:21.450> other<00:04:21.690> video<00:04:21.989> I

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
because there is only one other video I

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.500 
because there is only one other video I
think<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.680> this<00:04:22.890> knife<00:04:23.130> on<00:04:23.340> YouTube<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:23.940> it's

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
think of this knife on YouTube and it's

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.260 
think of this knife on YouTube and it's
when<00:04:24.630> they're<00:04:24.720> outside<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:26.310> watched<00:04:27.150> it

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
when they're outside and I watched it

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.360 
when they're outside and I watched it
before<00:04:27.419> I<00:04:27.630> got<00:04:27.720> this<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.680> carbon<00:04:29.040> fiber

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
before I got this and the carbon fiber

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.150 
before I got this and the carbon fiber
looks<00:04:29.760> shiny<00:04:30.150> like<00:04:30.510> they<00:04:30.630> put<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:31.010> kind<00:04:32.010> of<00:04:32.070> like

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
looks shiny like they put a kind of like

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.850 
looks shiny like they put a kind of like
a<00:04:32.190> protective<00:04:32.790> coating<00:04:33.330> over<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:34.110> that's

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
a protective coating over it and that's

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.469 
a protective coating over it and that's
what<00:04:34.950> I<00:04:35.040> was<00:04:35.190> expecting<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.880> this<00:04:36.000> one's<00:04:36.210> more

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
what I was expecting and this one's more

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.620 
what I was expecting and this one's more
of<00:04:36.600> a<00:04:36.660> matte<00:04:36.900> carbon<00:04:37.200> fiber<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:39.150> can't

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
of a matte carbon fiber and I can't

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.750 
of a matte carbon fiber and I can't
really<00:04:39.780> think<00:04:40.140> of<00:04:40.380> another<00:04:40.800> carbon<00:04:41.160> fiber<00:04:41.490> on

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
really think of another carbon fiber on

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.780 
really think of another carbon fiber on
a<00:04:41.790> knife<00:04:42.030> that's<00:04:42.390> similar<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:42.840> this<00:04:43.400> maybe<00:04:44.400> the

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
a knife that's similar to this maybe the

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.320 
a knife that's similar to this maybe the
tilt<00:04:45.120> kind<00:04:45.600> of<00:04:45.780> comes<00:04:46.050> close<00:04:46.740> but<00:04:47.220> it's<00:04:47.910> a<00:04:48.060> lit

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
tilt kind of comes close but it's a lit

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.500 
tilt kind of comes close but it's a lit
a<00:04:49.169> little<00:04:49.260> sheen<00:04:50.130> to<00:04:50.160> it<00:04:50.370> this<00:04:50.940> one's<00:04:51.210> real

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
a little sheen to it this one's real

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.500 
a little sheen to it this one's real
flat<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:52.229> I<00:04:52.500> like<00:04:53.340> that<00:04:53.490> about<00:04:53.550> this<00:04:53.940> knife<00:04:54.180> its

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
flat so I like that about this knife its

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.650 
flat so I like that about this knife its
kind<00:04:54.720> of<00:04:54.870> kind<00:04:55.560> of<00:04:55.680> low-key<00:04:55.890> carbon<00:04:56.400> fiber<00:04:56.660> but

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
kind of kind of low-key carbon fiber but

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.680 
kind of kind of low-key carbon fiber but
it<00:04:57.990> is<00:04:58.400> obviously<00:04:59.400> carbon<00:04:59.820> fiber<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.360> it's

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
it is obviously carbon fiber and it's

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.530 
it is obviously carbon fiber and it's
really<00:05:01.080> nice<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:02.760> champ<00:05:03.060> reigns<00:05:03.300> got<00:05:03.479> the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
really nice the champ reigns got the

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:10.900 
really nice the champ reigns got the
champion<00:05:03.960> around<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.290> edges

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:18.800 

so<00:05:11.910> there's<00:05:12.720> at<00:05:15.440> the<00:05:16.440> blades<00:05:16.740> perfect<00:05:17.540> the<00:05:18.540> the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
so there's at the blades perfect the the

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.490 
so there's at the blades perfect the the
grinds<00:05:19.050> are<00:05:19.320> perfect<00:05:19.740> this<00:05:20.670> one's<00:05:20.880> got<00:05:21.060> the

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
grinds are perfect this one's got the

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.830 
grinds are perfect this one's got the
little<00:05:22.500> news<00:05:22.740> thumb<00:05:23.070> lug<00:05:23.340> design<00:05:23.760> that<00:05:24.090> crk

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
little news thumb lug design that crk

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.140 
little news thumb lug design that crk
changed<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:27.690> then<00:05:28.520> it's<00:05:29.520> pretty<00:05:29.670> cool<00:05:29.910> I

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
changed to and then it's pretty cool I

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.020 
changed to and then it's pretty cool I
don't<00:05:30.540> mind<00:05:30.690> it<00:05:30.890> you<00:05:31.890> know<00:05:32.010> I<00:05:32.220> but<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:32.520> didn't

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
don't mind it you know I but I didn't

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.000 
don't mind it you know I but I didn't
mind<00:05:33.180> when<00:05:33.390> that<00:05:33.540> Idaho<00:05:33.930> made<00:05:34.170> stamp<00:05:34.530> came<00:05:34.830> out

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
mind when that Idaho made stamp came out

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.790 
mind when that Idaho made stamp came out
to<00:05:35.190> be<00:05:35.220> honest<00:05:35.640> um<00:05:35.940> I<00:05:36.800> mean<00:05:38.390> it's<00:05:39.390> it's<00:05:40.200> not<00:05:40.770> a

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
to be honest um I mean it's it's not a

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.830 
to be honest um I mean it's it's not a
deal<00:05:41.010> breaker<00:05:41.070> for<00:05:41.400> me<00:05:41.610> I<00:05:41.940> know<00:05:42.360> some<00:05:42.630> people

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
deal breaker for me I know some people

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.070 
deal breaker for me I know some people
don't<00:05:42.870> like<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.230> classic<00:05:43.710> mm<00:05:44.420> I<00:05:45.420> didn't

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
don't like the classic mm I didn't

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.870 
don't like the classic mm I didn't
really<00:05:46.170> like<00:05:46.380> that<00:05:46.440> but<00:05:47.010> it<00:05:47.310> wouldn't<00:05:47.610> stop<00:05:47.850> me

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
really like that but it wouldn't stop me

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.350 
really like that but it wouldn't stop me
from<00:05:48.090> buying<00:05:48.300> a<00:05:48.510> sebenza<00:05:49.320> them<00:05:49.590> so<00:05:50.120> it's<00:05:51.120> cool

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
from buying a sebenza them so it's cool

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.400 
from buying a sebenza them so it's cool
knife<00:05:51.570> um<00:05:53.030> you<00:05:54.030> know<00:05:54.120> not<00:05:54.360> not<00:05:54.630> much<00:05:55.050> else<00:05:55.290> to

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
knife um you know not not much else to

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.920 
knife um you know not not much else to
say<00:05:55.530> about<00:05:55.800> it<00:05:55.950> the<00:05:56.520> clip<00:05:56.790> obviously<00:05:57.750> that

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
say about it the clip obviously that

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.160 
say about it the clip obviously that
design<00:05:58.260> is<00:05:58.520> amazing<00:05:59.520> it's<00:06:00.480> the<00:06:00.660> best<00:06:00.900> clip

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
design is amazing it's the best clip

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.460 
design is amazing it's the best clip
I've<00:06:01.410> ever<00:06:01.770> experienced<00:06:02.460> in<00:06:02.490> a<00:06:02.610> knife<00:06:03.470> it's

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
I've ever experienced in a knife it's

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.140 
I've ever experienced in a knife it's
real<00:06:04.650> easy<00:06:04.680> to<00:06:04.980> pull<00:06:05.280> from<00:06:05.400> your<00:06:05.490> pocket<00:06:05.760> but

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
real easy to pull from your pocket but

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.770 
real easy to pull from your pocket but
it<00:06:06.270> stays<00:06:06.480> in<00:06:06.510> place<00:06:06.900> which<00:06:07.200> is<00:06:07.350> nice<00:06:07.580> so<00:06:08.780> like

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
it stays in place which is nice so like

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.930 
it stays in place which is nice so like
the<00:06:09.930> clip<00:06:11.990> one<00:06:12.990> thing<00:06:13.170> I<00:06:13.260> noticed<00:06:13.680> and<00:06:13.950> my

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
the clip one thing I noticed and my

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.140 
the clip one thing I noticed and my
other<00:06:15.090> sub<00:06:15.480> n's<00:06:15.630> us<00:06:15.780> in<00:06:15.900> the<00:06:15.990> room<00:06:16.170> but<00:06:17.150> they

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
other sub n's us in the room but they

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.110 
other sub n's us in the room but they
actually<00:06:18.270> changed<00:06:18.780> sometimes<00:06:19.640> this<00:06:20.640> grind

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
actually changed sometimes this grind

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.650 
actually changed sometimes this grind
right<00:06:21.420> here<00:06:21.720> starts<00:06:22.680> a<00:06:22.920> little<00:06:23.430> lower<00:06:24.240> down

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
right here starts a little lower down
