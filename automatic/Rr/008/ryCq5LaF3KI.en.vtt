some of these rhythms so with the aspect

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.800

here<00:01:21.800> being<00:01:22.460> illegal<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.240> play<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.720> drum

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
here being illegal to play the drum

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.499 
here being illegal to play the drum
because<00:01:25.190> they<00:01:25.369> realized<00:01:25.940> that<00:01:26.210> there<00:01:26.360> was

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
because they realized that there was

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.600 
because they realized that there was
communication<00:01:27.200> being<00:01:27.800> translated<00:01:28.280> from

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
communication being translated from

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.630 
communication being translated from
slave<00:01:28.909> to<00:01:29.149> slave<00:01:29.420> via<00:01:29.780> rhythm<00:01:30.319> so<00:01:31.069> we<00:01:31.310> had<00:01:31.490> to

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
slave to slave via rhythm so we had to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.999 
slave to slave via rhythm so we had to
modify<00:01:31.970> that<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:33.170> we<00:01:33.290> couldn't<00:01:33.470> beat<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.740> drum

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
modify that so we couldn't beat the drum

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.830 
modify that so we couldn't beat the drum
so<00:01:34.310> we'd<00:01:34.759> stamp<00:01:35.060> out<00:01:35.180> a<00:01:35.270> little<00:01:35.420> rhythm<00:01:35.720> with

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
so we'd stamp out a little rhythm with

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.230 
so we'd stamp out a little rhythm with
our<00:01:35.990> feet<00:01:36.229> right<00:01:36.470> or<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.549> timing<00:01:37.970> that<00:01:38.090> we

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
our feet right or in the timing that we

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.319 
our feet right or in the timing that we
throw<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.600> sack<00:01:38.899> over<00:01:39.740> our<00:01:40.100> shoulder<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:41.180> we

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
throw the sack over our shoulder so we

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.289 
throw the sack over our shoulder so we
have<00:01:41.509> all<00:01:41.990> of<00:01:42.049> this<00:01:42.590> kind<00:01:43.189> of<00:01:43.280> under<00:01:43.909> pressure

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299

you<00:01:45.049> mean<00:01:45.290> but<00:01:46.100> what<00:01:46.219> happened<00:01:46.729> when<00:01:47.210> we<00:01:47.390> could

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
you mean but what happened when we could

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.850 
you mean but what happened when we could
actually<00:01:47.750> communicate<00:01:48.079> some<00:01:48.649> of<00:01:48.680> those

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860
