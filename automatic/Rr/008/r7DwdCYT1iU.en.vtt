00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:10.040
 and how experience has been and is also 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.929
 right now an experience anyway 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.700
 positive positive also because I have 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.039
 known precisely as said that a 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.310
 new football but above all because the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.119
 things went well then when the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:28.010
 things are good it is normal to draw too 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.779
 however, positive considerations 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.290
 then I repeat to you regarding the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.980
 I believe that the coach's president 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:41.129
 although for almost everyone it is almost done 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.780
 however we still need seven games 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.510
 and then think about next year 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.270
 maybe a little a while, even if 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.170
 I repeat I believe it is also right to do so 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.399
 however, as regards next year 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.399
 I believe that once the ends 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.410
 championship and may 31 you can 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.359
 start thinking and the idea was 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.949
 that of note that I am there or there 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.619
 general idea was to help out 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.290
 to the environment and society team 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.350
 to get back in series we are close 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.540
 and then saw that as mentioned a year of 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.950
 contract but in this case beyond 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.700
 I mean the contract year 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.450
 the idea is to continue to be 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.490
 here to do what I did from 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.820
 January onwards and that is trying to help 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.110
 both society and companions to that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.750
 which may be the goal of the year 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.850
 next I imagine will be the permanence 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.630
 in series with but the goal is itself 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:41.110
 possible to close the Saturday in Latin 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.880
 I believe that the sooner we close it the better 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.280
 also for a matter of both 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.870
 tranquility but also for per 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.420
 make the company tax 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.850
 can set a speech even for 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.960
 next year so once it is 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.000
 made once we have one 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.010
 math I think we can 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.560
 program everything I had in Varese 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.330
 I have hardly practiced a problem 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.840
 all week and then I played with 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.210
 the avellino this maybe meant that 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.209
 consequently it led to another 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.250
 slightly more important problem 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.980
 now and from the game with the Avellino 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.580
 that we are trying to solve this 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.810
 problem 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.280
 this morning I did another 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.250
 check that we are awaiting the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.930
 results therefore the desire is to 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.350
 don't even skip a game 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.910
 the reality is that anyway I believe that in 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.020
 field is right that it takes those 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.580
 which are one hundred percent and therefore 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.950
 consequently they are chosen precisely 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.630
 coach valerio I have to say that it is 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.590
 a guy who works a lot 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.290
 very good boy and sorry also not 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.049
 see it however participates and the case of 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.459
 valerio but not only also andrea 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.900
 belotti however a boy who when he is 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.430
 then he always did well 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:58.000
 unfortunately space knows is not reduced 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.830
 it's not just the two of them I have to say 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.320
 that this is a group that the strength of 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.540
 I think this group is above all 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.459
 players who do not play that one does not 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.650
 complain two do not bother between 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.420
 so the work is always a bit 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.420
 the strength of this team
