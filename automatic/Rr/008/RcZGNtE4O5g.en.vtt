obviously change first thing is that a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.830 
obviously change first thing is that a
lot<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.470> times<00:00:25.650> it'll<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> cover<00:00:26.279> which

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
lot of times it'll have a cover which

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.910 
lot of times it'll have a cover which
don't<00:00:27.840> worry<00:00:27.960> about<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.410> take<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.650> off<00:00:28.740> easy

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
don't worry about it to take it off easy

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.080 
don't worry about it to take it off easy
enough<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.310> probably<00:00:29.609> figured<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.910> much

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
enough you probably figured that much

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.179 
enough you probably figured that much
out<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.300> your<00:00:30.510> own<00:00:30.619> however<00:00:31.619> there<00:00:32.040> are<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> few

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
out on your own however there are a few

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.470 
out on your own however there are a few
things<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.579> might<00:00:32.730> seem<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:33.030> little<00:00:33.090> odd<00:00:33.300> to

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
things that might seem a little odd to

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.090 
things that might seem a little odd to
you<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.469> might<00:00:34.620> notice<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
you one you might notice that the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.180 
you one you might notice that the
bristles<00:00:35.489> are<00:00:35.700> really<00:00:36.000> stiff<00:00:36.300> okay<00:00:36.980> this<00:00:37.980> is

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
bristles are really stiff okay this is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.530 
bristles are really stiff okay this is
again<00:00:38.579> something<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.030> they<00:00:39.090> do<00:00:39.149> for

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
again something that they do for

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.150 
again something that they do for
packaging<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> protect<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> brush<00:00:40.800> they<00:00:41.040> add

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
packaging to protect the brush they add

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.830 
packaging to protect the brush they add
something<00:00:41.460> like<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> gum<00:00:42.120> arabic<00:00:42.329> which<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
something like a gum arabic which is a

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.440 
something like a gum arabic which is a
very<00:00:43.739> typical<00:00:43.890> additive<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:44.969> water<00:00:45.180> color

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
very typical additive and water color

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.569 
very typical additive and water color
and<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.260> stiffens<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.649> bristles<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
and it just stiffens the bristles like a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.520 
and it just stiffens the bristles like a
starch<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.600> give<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.989> little<00:00:49.140> bit<00:00:49.320> more

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
starch to give it a little bit more

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.350 
starch to give it a little bit more
strength<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.399> case<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.730> shipping<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.149> gets

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
strength so in case in shipping it gets

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.900 
strength so in case in shipping it gets
you<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.660> pushed<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.530> or<00:00:52.739> pulled<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.430> will

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you know pushed on or pulled on it will

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.750 
you know pushed on or pulled on it will
be<00:00:54.360> more<00:00:54.690> resilient<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:56.039> water<00:00:56.250> soluble

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
be more resilient so it's water soluble

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.610 
be more resilient so it's water soluble
all<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.840> get<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> brush<00:00:58.410> wet

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
all you have to do is get the brush wet

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.479 
all you have to do is get the brush wet
and<00:00:59.750> break<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.899> starch<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.859> will<00:01:02.039> get

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and break up the starch and it will get

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.840 
and break up the starch and it will get
extremely<00:01:03.120> soft<00:01:03.619> almost<00:01:04.619> immediately<00:01:04.979> now

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
extremely soft almost immediately now

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.539 
extremely soft almost immediately now
the<00:01:06.299> next<00:01:06.659> thing<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.220> be

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
I mean if it's in watercolor and you try

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.780 
I mean if it's in watercolor and you try
to<00:01:31.079> get<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.460> smudge

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
to get it out you can you know smudge

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.270 
to get it out you can you know smudge
your<00:01:32.970> lines<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.500> oil<00:01:34.799> or<00:01:35.130> acrylic

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
paints and you let it dry I mean you'll

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.140 
paints and you let it dry I mean you'll
be<00:01:37.829> pulling<00:01:38.250> out<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.460> tweezers<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.880> it
