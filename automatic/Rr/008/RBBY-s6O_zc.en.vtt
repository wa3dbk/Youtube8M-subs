in quarts just happened to be the

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.229 
in quarts just happened to be the
smallest<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.920> easiest<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.760> show<00:00:44.940> here

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
smallest and easiest to show here

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.479 
smallest and easiest to show here
obviously<00:00:45.590> but<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.949> specifically

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
obviously but this is specifically

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.150 
obviously but this is specifically
designed<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:48.120> those<00:00:48.390> applications<00:00:49.170> that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
designed for those applications that

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.000 
designed for those applications that
normally<00:00:50.760> call<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:52.010> conventional<00:00:53.010> 80<00:00:53.309> W<00:00:53.910> 90

normally call for a conventional 80 W 90

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.040 
normally call for a conventional 80 W 90
gear<00:00:56.010> lube<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.120> want<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> benefits

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
gear lube but that you want the benefits

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.799 
gear lube but that you want the benefits
of<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.559> full<00:00:58.829> synthetic<00:00:59.210> gear<00:01:00.210> lube<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.660> in

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
of a full synthetic gear lube going in

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.580 
of a full synthetic gear lube going in
there<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.340> still<00:01:02.609> rated<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.570> TW<00:01:04.140> 90

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 
there so this is still rated as a TW 90

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.300 
there so this is still rated as a TW 90
but<00:01:05.340> you've<00:01:05.519> got<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:05.940> of<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:07.009> benefits<00:01:08.009> of<00:01:08.220> a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
but you've got all of the benefits of a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.460 
but you've got all of the benefits of a
full<00:01:08.520> synthetic<00:01:08.790> Lube<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:10.049> know<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.320> you've

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
full synthetic Lube you know so you've

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.030 
full synthetic Lube you know so you've
got<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> better<00:01:11.070> cold<00:01:11.400> flow<00:01:11.759> you've<00:01:12.390> got<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
got the better cold flow you've got the

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.330 
got the better cold flow you've got the
high<00:01:14.040> load<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.240> bearing<00:01:16.229> protection<00:01:16.830> you've

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
high load and bearing protection you've

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.300 
high load and bearing protection you've
got<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.850> longer<00:01:18.210> oil<00:01:18.450> light<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.159> don't

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
got the longer oil light so you don't

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.730 
got the longer oil light so you don't
have<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.579> replace<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.210> often<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.560> you're

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
have to replace it as often so you're

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.440 
have to replace it as often so you're
gonna<00:01:22.829> have<00:01:23.070> lower<00:01:23.310> maintenance<00:01:23.670> cost<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
gonna have lower maintenance cost and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.490 
gonna have lower maintenance cost and
it's<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.720> protect<00:01:24.900> your<00:01:25.200> equipment

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
it's going to protect your equipment

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.859 
it's going to protect your equipment
better<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.150> compatible<00:01:27.600> with

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
better it is compatible with

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.780 
better it is compatible with
conventional<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.799> other<00:01:28.920> synthetic<00:01:29.220> oils

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
conventional and other synthetic oils

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.340 
conventional and other synthetic oils
although<00:01:30.119> am<00:01:30.299> Soule<00:01:30.570> does<00:01:30.750> not<00:01:30.930> recommend

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
although am Soule does not recommend

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.310 
although am Soule does not recommend
mixing<00:01:31.829> because<00:01:32.399> then<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.630> are<00:01:33.780> only<00:01:33.810> as

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
mixing because then you you are only as

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.609 
mixing because then you you are only as
good<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.950> point<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.670> weakest<00:01:36.149> or

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
good at that point as your weakest or

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.319 
good at that point as your weakest or
lowest<00:01:37.619> quality<00:01:38.220> oil<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.149> that

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
lowest quality oil that is in that

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
lowest quality oil that is in that
mixture<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.170> terms<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.680> how<00:01:40.799> often<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.340> have

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
mixture in terms of how often you have

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.469 
mixture in terms of how often you have
to<00:01:41.700> replace<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:44.130> very<00:01:44.250> versatile<00:01:45.210> so

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
to replace it and it's very versatile so

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.600 
to replace it and it's very versatile so
you<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.810> use<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.229> across<00:01:46.530> multiple<00:01:46.979> different

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
you can use it across multiple different

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.560 
you can use it across multiple different
applications<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:49.860> you've<00:01:50.040> got<00:01:50.570> equipment

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
applications so if you've got equipment

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.840 
applications so if you've got equipment

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
out there that is running at high speeds

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.709
