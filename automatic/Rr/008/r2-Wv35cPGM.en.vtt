00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.240
 that is not so cheap or and so 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.030

 something to report every day and so on 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.820
 in the future in multiplayer as wolf or 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.740
 to play as a dinosaur to be exact 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.390
 you can only put on the masks 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.520
 I have that on the battlefield side 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.830
 inside I discover that I put you with it 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.720
 simply to the heart and above 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.110
 In addition, electronic arts still has the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.340
 third godfather of the developer diary it out 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.900

 Report what they are doing and this time 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.819
 it's about the sound of the game 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.030
 Actually , unfortunately, there is not at all 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.200
 so much to mass effect say where 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.600
 but now confess christin 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.490
 has developed the tweets at bioware 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.569
 always diligent to maybe he will follow 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.100
 the colleague and there could also 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.780
 Always discover fun things and that 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.910
 he has calmed down the people again 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.280
 get excited about the multiplayer 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.709
 have and he has once again emphasized the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.880
 singleplayer from the upcoming mass effect 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.040
 Of course , violent offender says now 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.660
 not much out and the people 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.310
 have always wondered what now 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.050
 the new mass effect four titles because 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.250
 is finally and so because she has me 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.750
 actually already said that when I do that 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.970
 really remembered 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.989
 that is a title, but she still gives it 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.150
 not been published and now 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.340
 he said they work with high pressure 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.080
 I'm still curious about that 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.030
 I still hit a mass effect 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.950
 Sirius for the upcoming triology 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.670
 nadia thorn are the developer of 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.069
 or 18 66 what will appear on the 20th of february 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.380
 and where as I think am 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.930
 19 february the press in the dare of 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.150
 youtube embargo officially official 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.010
 fell again said that she 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.010
 with her game the best so far 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.970
 Cover feature of all shooters at all 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.340
 it's a done one 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.230
 Stock market game where you are so gears of 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.640
 was kind to the cover I bangs 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.470
 I did not play it, it's up 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.390
 the way to me, I will also 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.340
 play promised there is another 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.660
 a bit of trailer material to many 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.239
 people have been upset about that 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.799
 You can do that in five hours in only 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.840
 can play for five hours and that 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.340
 game does not have a multiplayer so 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.780
 that means that if you are one 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.549
 a little more time leaves something 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.739
 between seven and ten hours 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.450
 eventually scraped together gets the 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.030
 first evaluation of a French 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.620
 magazins now has 15 out of 20 points 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.299
 I am very much looking forward to it 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.650
 as soon as I play that part for 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.099
 then you can do it yourself too 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.650
 form another opinion 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.910
 pixel in the vision I never believe 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.400
 not, of course, there is the usual 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.620
 Discussions and rumors so you 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.750
 at the upcoming ubisoft toptitel 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.959
 possibly different resolutions 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.549
 between xbox and playstation 4 and pc 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.430
 Who has wondered that now and now 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.530
 has an industry insider on twitter 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.030
 said the xbox version would only open 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.940
 900 p come and the playstation 4 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.270
 million to 1080p yes who cares 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.889
 that because it is always so news where 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.960
 I always have a little bit in my head 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.669
 shake what is really set 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.979
 for the next version is on each 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.530
 case that the ubisoft massive team said 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.600
 had they only work with 30 fps 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.830
 At the console title because easy 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.560
 have set 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.000
 where do we want to compromise now 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.580
 and they said we do not want 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.960
 more textures effect or something 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.120
 compress but rather at 30 fps 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.419
 instead of 60 fps stay and then it works 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.460
 thing 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.560
 I really hope that in the summer 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.300
 know more about the title like a pointed 23 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.010
 and I'm sure about the gamescom 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.010
 the title is on everyone's lips 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.619
 then there are new pictures to tomb raider 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:16.449
 that really look fantastic 

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:17.860
 whole part is currently up to date with crystal 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.330
 dynamics in the development and the 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.159
 real game on me 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.499
 personally very happy 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:26.800
 just again because of the art 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:28.389

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.619
 has switched to crystal dynamics and 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.959
 it became official today too 

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:33.909

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:35.800
 works and the tomb raider team 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.929
 supported and then we can get in 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:43.599
 future on our siberia trip 

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:46.059
 especially looking forward to it now 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:48.039
 I know how many times I cut it out 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:49.330
 I had to clean my nose 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.889
 I've been drinking again 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.419
 I have prepared and so allow the 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:56.139
 way, somehow crosses the stage 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.490
 then the eyes that one stupid 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.779
 I hope you still have it 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.519

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.929

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:19.889
 The microphone pull away what an idiot 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:19.889
 writes out
