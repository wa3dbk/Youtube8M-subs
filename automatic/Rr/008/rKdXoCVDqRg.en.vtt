and<00:03:42.549> I<00:03:42.910> also<00:03:43.120> love<00:03:43.419> the<00:03:43.599> small<00:03:43.840> considerations

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
and I also love the small considerations

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.220 
and I also love the small considerations
to<00:03:45.400> include<00:03:45.819> cutouts<00:03:46.239> for<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.690> front<00:03:47.019> fan

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
cables that are also sleeve by the way

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.539 
cables that are also sleeve by the way
so<00:03:49.660> clean<00:03:50.319> routing<00:03:50.889> is<00:03:51.069> almost<00:03:51.370> an

so clean routing is almost an
