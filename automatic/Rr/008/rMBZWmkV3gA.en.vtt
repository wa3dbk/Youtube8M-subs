catch a little bit more bait fill up
that<00:00:16.710> live<00:00:16.890> wheel<00:00:17.189> back<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.179> a<00:00:18.210> big

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
that live wheel back here this is a big

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.659 
that live wheel back here this is a big
pond<00:00:18.839> out<00:00:19.140> here<00:00:19.259> what<00:00:19.529> exactly<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.580> you

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
pond out here what exactly are you

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.630 
pond out here what exactly are you
looking<00:00:20.699> for<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:22.169> find<00:00:22.439> where<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.130> can<00:00:23.310> fish

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
looking for to find where we can fish

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.550 
looking for to find where we can fish
for<00:00:24.029> all<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:24.539> bait<00:00:24.660> I'm<00:00:24.990> looking<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.470> that

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
for all for bait I'm looking for that

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.079 
for all for bait I'm looking for that
right<00:00:25.829> there<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.339> you<00:00:26.460> look<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.669> the<00:00:26.730> Sun<00:00:26.970> or

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:27.089 
right there if you look on the Sun or

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.999 
right there if you look on the Sun or
machine<00:00:27.359> where<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.689> thick<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.470> area<00:00:28.829> where

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
machine where it's thick this area where

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.729 
machine where it's thick this area where
it's<00:00:29.189> sand<00:00:29.789> patches<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.419> big<00:00:30.630> grass<00:00:30.929> bottom

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
it's sand patches and big grass bottom

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.650 
it's sand patches and big grass bottom
so<00:00:31.980> there's<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> pin<00:00:32.850> fishel<00:00:33.240> hang<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.570> that

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
so there's a pin fishel hang in that

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.810 
so there's a pin fishel hang in that
area<00:00:33.960> mainly<00:00:34.800> over<00:00:35.100> grass<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.610> they<00:00:35.700> can

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
area mainly over grass but they can

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.980 
area mainly over grass but they can
venture<00:00:36.060> onto<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> sand

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
venture onto the sand

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.360 
venture onto the sand

I'll kick the boats a dress
perpendicular<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.800> wind<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.520> we'll<00:00:50.910> get

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
perpendicular to the wind and we'll get

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.360 
perpendicular to the wind and we'll get
three<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.420> us<00:00:51.540> trying<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.020> get<00:00:52.170> get<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.040> couple

dozen<00:00:53.520> big<00:00:54.240> hands<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.780> spin<00:00:55.050> fish<00:00:55.850> catching

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
dozen big hands I spin fish catching

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.240 
dozen big hands I spin fish catching
bait<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.360> be<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.930> about<00:00:58.080> as<00:00:58.380> challenging<00:00:59.130> is

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
bait can be just about as challenging is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.100 
bait can be just about as challenging is
actually<00:00:59.670> catching<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:00.240> sport<00:01:00.540> fish<00:01:00.810> that

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
actually catching the sport fish that

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.330 
actually catching the sport fish that
we're<00:01:01.290> after<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.860> that's<00:01:02.010> why<00:01:02.160> it's

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
we're after and that's why it's

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.849 
we're after and that's why it's
important<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.790> have<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> good<00:01:03.600> sonar<00:01:04.499> machine

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:04.859 
important to have a good sonar machine

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:06.499 
important to have a good sonar machine
so<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.189> mean<00:01:05.429> we're<00:01:05.519> only<00:01:05.609> in<00:01:05.759> for<00:01:05.939> five<00:01:06.179> feet<00:01:06.390> of

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
so I mean we're only in for five feet of

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.090 
so I mean we're only in for five feet of
water<00:01:06.539> here<00:01:06.899> but<00:01:07.259> what<00:01:07.439> that's<00:01:07.619> telling<00:01:07.799> us<00:01:07.979> is

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
water here but what that's telling us is

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.910 
water here but what that's telling us is
where<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.399> weed<00:01:08.579> beds<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:09.119> at<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.770> if<00:01:10.770> we

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
where the weed beds are at and if we

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.370 
where the weed beds are at and if we
drift<00:01:11.219> off<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.789> them<00:01:11.999> there<00:01:12.179> we<00:01:12.299> go<00:01:12.450> okay<00:01:12.869> for

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
drift off of them there we go okay for

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.380 
drift off of them there we go okay for
drift<00:01:13.590> off<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.979> weed<00:01:14.159> beds<00:01:14.399> then<00:01:14.850> you're<00:01:15.179> you
