we<00:00:02.429> are<00:00:02.520> going<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.879> be<00:00:02.970> learning<00:00:03.449> how<00:00:03.810> to

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:04.910 
we are going to be learning how to

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.880 
we are going to be learning how to
install<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.029> game<00:00:06.240> Pokemon<00:00:06.960> generation

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
install the game Pokemon generation

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.850 
install the game Pokemon generation
which<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.570> probably<00:00:09.570> evident<00:00:09.990> from<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.380> title

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
which is probably evident from the title

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.820 
which is probably evident from the title
so<00:00:11.580> first<00:00:12.000> steps<00:00:12.240> first<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:13.019> got<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.590> go<00:00:13.769> to

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
so first steps first you got to go to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.560 
so first steps first you got to go to
the<00:00:14.130> place<00:00:14.429> where<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.790> downloaded<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
the place where you downloaded the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.130 
the place where you downloaded the
Pokemon<00:00:16.139> generation<00:00:16.710> RAR<00:00:17.420> file<00:00:18.420> it's

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
Pokemon generation RAR file it's

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.630 
Pokemon generation RAR file it's
probably<00:00:19.439> going<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.710> be<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:19.920> your<00:00:20.039> downloads

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
probably going to be in your downloads

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.870 
probably going to be in your downloads

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
but not for me I put it into a place

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.279 
but not for me I put it into a place
called<00:00:24.119> useless<00:00:24.510> because<00:00:24.750> that's<00:00:24.930> what<00:00:25.140> I

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
called useless because that's what I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that and I guess it's open it up and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.300 
that and I guess it's open it up and
it's<00:01:14.970> supposed<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.840> open<00:01:16.290> up<00:01:16.470> another<00:01:16.830> file<00:01:17.280> I

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310

but I guess if you click on it sorry it
actually<00:01:22.890> did<00:01:23.040> open<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> background

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
actually did open up in the background

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.050 
actually did open up in the background
here<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:26.100> open<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.939> up

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
here you go so you get this I open it up

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.690 
here you go so you get this I open it up
twice<00:01:27.299> damn<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.950> get<00:01:29.070> calculation

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
twice damn it and you get calculation

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
twice damn it and you get calculation
calculating<00:01:30.540> differences<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.200> goes<00:01:31.860> through

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
calculating differences and goes through

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.620 
calculating differences and goes through
the<00:01:32.100> entire<00:01:32.430> installation<00:01:32.729> process<00:01:33.329> which<00:01:33.479> is

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the entire installation process which is

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.160 
the entire installation process which is
quite<00:01:34.229> long<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.890> suggest<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.270> wait<00:01:36.869> for

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
quite long so I suggest you wait for

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.370 
quite long so I suggest you wait for
some<00:01:37.320> time<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.900> don't<00:01:39.900> know<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:40.350> something

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
some time and I don't know do something

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.770 
some time and I don't know do something
else<00:01:40.799> wait<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> finish<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.270> then<00:01:42.600> just

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
else wait for it to finish and then just

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.050 
else wait for it to finish and then just
click<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.229> nice<00:01:43.439> little<00:01:43.649> play<00:01:43.979> button<00:01:44.159> so

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
click on this nice little play button so

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.730 
click on this nice little play button so
I<00:01:45.119> will<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.450> skip<00:01:45.600> over<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.930> where<00:01:46.170> my<00:01:46.320> actual

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
I will just skip over to where my actual

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.010 
I will just skip over to where my actual
installation<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.000> will<00:01:48.210> see<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.509> then

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
installation is and I will see you then

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.749 
installation is and I will see you then
so<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.799> what<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.040> get<00:01:50.250> when<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.579> have

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.639 
so this is what you get when you have
the<00:01:51.000> final<00:01:51.540> thing<00:01:51.780> it'll<00:01:52.049> basically<00:01:52.259> say

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the final thing it'll basically say

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.920 
the final thing it'll basically say
Pokemon<00:01:53.159> gen<00:01:53.460> pokey<00:01:53.880> gen<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.509> date<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
Pokemon gen pokey gen is up to date and
