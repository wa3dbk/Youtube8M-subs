00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.579
 stenochku further here and here we do 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.480
 holes two blocks down further sideways 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.690
 of this block 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.810
 given god put theft torch 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.170
 under them we put on a piece of the diet further 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.390
 we break 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 one block and re-set the red torch about 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.810
 need to go out 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.090
 here we do the same, everything is ready 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.920
 gone out now find it on these torch and 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.549
 we put blocks on them pieces of roadstone from 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.630
 thinking 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.060
 so good and worthy of a piece and again but 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.700
 pieces all our cream is ready now 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.780
 left where we have a unit with two ryu with 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.970
 two torches 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.700
 we need to weave ready now we 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.759
 We are set to 2 sticky piston here 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.880
 in such a way on them the blocks that 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.780
 disguised as our wall as if all here 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.220
 such a compact design 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.259
 it turned out well let's check 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.630
 Well, just came to us already locked 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.329
 jump out here and it will be difficult that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.649
 there are such files but not denying 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.930
 so here it is better to put something 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.810
 like a half block or some lower 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.540
 Odessa Roma well, what's the top shelf especially 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.750
 so does not give time to jump from work we 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.570
 see that hard to harness 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.210
 in general, we see our guest's nickname and 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.100
