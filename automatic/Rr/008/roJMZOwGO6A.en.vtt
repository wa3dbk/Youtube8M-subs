00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
really fascinating that every school is

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.749 
really fascinating that every school is
unique<00:01:35.850> kind<00:01:36.179> of<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.390> its<00:01:36.569> own<00:01:36.780> way<00:01:37.050> that<00:01:38.009> you

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
unique kind of in its own way that you

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.240 
unique kind of in its own way that you
know<00:01:38.820> we're<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.990> Ohio<00:01:40.229> State<00:01:40.530> band

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
know we're not like the Ohio State band

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.770 
know we're not like the Ohio State band
and<00:01:41.490> they're<00:01:41.880> not<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.240> us<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.720> don't

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and they're not like us and I don't

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.300

think<00:01:42.869> either<00:01:43.110> band<00:01:43.409> would<00:01:43.590> ever<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.159> be

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
think either band would ever like to be

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.190 
think either band would ever like to be
like<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.700> other<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.509> great<00:01:45.689> thing<00:01:45.930> about<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200

moving forward and so that really
changes<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.320> way<00:02:04.469> we<00:02:04.500> approach<00:02:05.009> things<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
changes the way we approach things do a

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.399 
changes the way we approach things do a
lot<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.030> things<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.509> are<00:02:06.600> traditional<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
lot of things that are traditional and

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.109 
lot of things that are traditional and
do<00:02:07.619> things<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.009> are<00:02:08.310> gonna<00:02:08.549> be<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> little<00:02:09.000> bit

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
do things that are gonna be a little bit

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.960 
do things that are gonna be a little bit
different<00:02:09.329> and<00:02:09.690> change<00:02:10.649> things<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.760> was

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
different and change things up it was

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.120 
different and change things up it was
really<00:02:12.390> exciting<00:02:12.989> as<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:13.350> came<00:02:13.590> up<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.010> end

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
really exciting as we came up to the end

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.310 
really exciting as we came up to the end
of<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> season<00:02:14.730> last<00:02:14.910> fall<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.959> started

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
of the season last fall and it started

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.240 
of the season last fall and it started
looking<00:02:16.620> like<00:02:16.799> we<00:02:17.549> could<00:02:18.060> make<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.690> BCS

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
looking like we could make it to the BCS

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.590 
looking like we could make it to the BCS
Championship<00:02:20.250> game<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.880> think<00:02:20.970> with<00:02:21.359> the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
Championship game I think with the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.920 
Championship game I think with the
national<00:02:22.320> attention<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.950> we

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
national attention that we

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.740 
national attention that we
it's<00:02:24.470> put<00:02:24.739> some<00:02:24.920> pressure<00:02:25.099> on<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:26.150> students

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
it's put some pressure on the students

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.559 
it's put some pressure on the students
to<00:02:27.019> perform<00:02:27.500> at<00:02:27.829> a<00:02:27.860> high<00:02:28.549> caliber<00:02:28.849> in

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
to perform at a high caliber in

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.929 
to perform at a high caliber in
comparison<00:02:30.409> because<00:02:30.769> they<00:02:31.040> have<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:31.760> many

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
comparison because they have so many

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.479 
comparison because they have so many
more<00:02:32.299> fans<00:02:32.599> possibly<00:02:33.439> seeing<00:02:33.739> them<00:02:34.040> my
