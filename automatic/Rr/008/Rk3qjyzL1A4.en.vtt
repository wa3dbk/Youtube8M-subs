00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
power by max I got the tension control

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.629 
power by max I got the tension control
rods<00:00:07.799> which<00:00:08.069> look<00:00:08.280> like<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:08.870> and<00:00:10.610> some<00:00:11.610> of

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
rods which look like this and some of

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.230 
rods which look like this and some of
you<00:00:11.820> have<00:00:11.940> noticed<00:00:12.559> that<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.889> did<00:00:14.340> post<00:00:14.940> on

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.310 
Instagram a picture of ease and the user
I<00:00:20.189> believe<00:00:20.460> his<00:00:20.550> name<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.730> Justine<00:00:21.660> penguins

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
I believe his name is Justine penguins

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.210 
I believe his name is Justine penguins
on<00:00:22.820> Instagram<00:00:23.820> he<00:00:24.390> did<00:00:24.570> mention<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.529> SPL

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
on Instagram he did mention that the SPL

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.519 
on Instagram he did mention that the SPL
ones<00:00:26.490> look<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.880> lot<00:00:27.029> beefier<00:00:27.300> than<00:00:27.570> these<00:00:27.900> which

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
ones look a lot beefier than these which

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.229 
ones look a lot beefier than these which
is<00:00:28.560> true<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.810> I<00:00:30.810> would<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.199> address<00:00:31.590> that

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
is true and I would like to address that

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.270 
is true and I would like to address that
we<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.570> take<00:00:33.809> into<00:00:34.050> consideration<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
we have to take into consideration the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.750 
we have to take into consideration the
materials<00:00:36.030> used<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.660> make<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.800> parts<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.430> this

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
materials used to make the parts so this

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.049 
materials used to make the parts so this
here<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.180> made<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.480> steel<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.309> or<00:00:41.850> does

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
here is made of steel so it is or does

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.069 
here is made of steel so it is or does
look<00:00:42.379> thinner<00:00:43.550> but<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.910> SPL<00:00:45.420> ones<00:00:45.629> are<00:00:45.840> made

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
look thinner but the SPL ones are made

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.950 
look thinner but the SPL ones are made
of<00:00:46.320> aluminum<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.850> aluminum<00:00:48.239> wall<00:00:48.450> has<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.840> be

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
of aluminum the aluminum wall has to be

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.439 
of aluminum the aluminum wall has to be
a<00:00:48.989> lot<00:00:49.230> thicker<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.980> order<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.550> match<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
a lot thicker in order to match the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.049 
a lot thicker in order to match the
rigidity<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> steel<00:00:53.030> so<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.430> I<00:00:56.430> actually

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
rigidity of steel so I think I actually

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.470 
rigidity of steel so I think I actually
like<00:00:57.360> these<00:00:57.570> ones<00:00:57.719> better<00:00:57.989> than<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.440> fpl<00:00:58.949> ones

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
like these ones better than the fpl ones

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.840 
like these ones better than the fpl ones
the<00:01:00.480> thinner<00:01:00.920> tube<00:01:01.920> or<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> thinner<00:01:02.579> body

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the thinner tube or the thinner body

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.000 
the thinner tube or the thinner body
means<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.260> these<00:01:04.470> very

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
means that you can have these very

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.539 
means that you can have these very
clever<00:01:05.610> notches<00:01:06.470> which<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.280> stick<00:01:08.520> your

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
clever notches which you can stick your

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.240 
clever notches which you can stick your
wrench<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.540> hold<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:10.830> make<00:01:11.100> your

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
wrench in to hold or make your

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.969 
wrench in to hold or make your
adjustments<00:01:12.140> if<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> adjustments

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
adjustments if you have the adjustments

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.960 
adjustments if you have the adjustments
on<00:01:14.100> both<00:01:14.490> sides<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.450> end<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.409> end

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
on both sides so this end and this end

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.609 
on both sides so this end and this end
SPL<00:01:17.970> has<00:01:18.180> only<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.170> end<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:21.409> it<00:01:22.409> has<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
SPL has only on this end and it has a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.910 
SPL has only on this end and it has a
little<00:01:22.950> dust<00:01:23.400> boot<00:01:24.060> cover<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.619> believe

little dust boot cover here I believe

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.640 
little dust boot cover here I believe
SPL<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.700> open<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:28.400> s<00:01:29.400> fails<00:01:29.759> body<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:31.110> body<00:01:31.290> of

the TC rod it has two holes drilled into
the<00:01:35.340> body<00:01:35.549> which<00:01:36.119> I'm<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.390> too<00:01:36.570> fond<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.049> I

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
here's what it looks like young it

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.440 
here's what it looks like young it
extended<00:01:55.189> and<00:01:58.340> powermax<00:01:59.340> claims<00:01:59.700> that<00:02:00.000> this

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
extended and powermax claims that this

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.770 
extended and powermax claims that this
has

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
has

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.680 
has
the<00:02:01.869> largest<00:02:02.619> range<00:02:03.070> of<00:02:03.369> adjustment<00:02:03.790> which<00:02:04.570> I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
the largest range of adjustment which I

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.359 
the largest range of adjustment which I
believe<00:02:04.960> because<00:02:05.229> it<00:02:05.500> has<00:02:05.650> it<00:02:05.799> on<00:02:05.890> both<00:02:06.070> sides

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
believe because it has it on both sides

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:13.380 
believe because it has it on both sides
and<00:02:06.700> this<00:02:07.600> is<00:02:07.810> what<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.259> looks<00:02:08.530> like<00:02:08.709> spell<00:02:12.390> so

and this is what it looks like spell so

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.380 
and this is what it looks like spell so
yeah<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.340> why<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.490> picked<00:02:15.670> up<00:02:15.819> i<00:02:15.970> was<00:02:16.120> just
