but<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.840> reasonable<00:02:56.840> working<00:02:57.739> person's

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
but a reasonable working person's

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.430 
but a reasonable working person's
amplifier<00:02:58.760> instead<00:02:59.390> of<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.540> Class<00:02:59.780> A<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.049> lot<00:03:00.350> of

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
amplifier instead of a Class A a lot of

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.960 
amplifier instead of a Class A a lot of
people<00:03:00.650> can't<00:03:00.829> afford<00:03:00.890> those<00:03:01.340> but<00:03:01.579> this<00:03:01.700> court

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
people can't afford those but this court

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.120 
people can't afford those but this court
makes<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.329> difference<00:03:02.690> on<00:03:03.079> pretty<00:03:03.980> much

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
makes a difference on pretty much

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.120 
makes a difference on pretty much
everything<00:03:04.459> I've<00:03:04.760> tried<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:05.209> with

now<00:03:26.390> we're<00:03:26.480> going<00:03:26.569> to<00:03:26.629> switch<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.989> cord<00:03:27.200> out

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
now we're going to switch the cord out

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:40.149 
now we're going to switch the cord out
to<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.680> music<00:03:28.250> cord<00:03:28.700> from<00:03:28.909> ESP<00:03:38.650> okay<00:03:39.650> same
