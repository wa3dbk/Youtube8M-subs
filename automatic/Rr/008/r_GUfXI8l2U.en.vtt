00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.969
 mosconi an american bar in romatipo about 7 months ago so we're talking in 2012 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.470
 as of November 2012 it is a heart-shaped American bar and therefore a bottle from 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.230
 sun sized we are specialized spirit national index we have two 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.679
 target customers 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.960
 to a target audience of people a little bit big in the timetable 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.270
 of the aperitif pd the young as the place located in the city studies area 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.920
 di giovanni e vito friends through 4 years from 22 map to 2 20 the building was 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.079
 chosen it was. period building local classic local 15 fiordicuoca yes 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.220
 he married b 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.990
 local of this kind. building however trieste 90 years 90 nissan il 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.410
 basic problem that a building that is 90 years old of the big problems a 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.800
 level of the acqusti for we played. to solve using 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.100
 however of the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.579
 of technology 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:04.480
 acoustics 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.930
 before opening the bar and then before starting the renovations I have 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.550
 made several chats with other local managers issue number one I have 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.800
 to solve the product 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.770
 so I realized that the building anyway 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.560
 d age it was so beautiful to see each other practically with big problems of 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.480
 acoustics 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.760
 then through the company that deals with acoustic design 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.650
 and therefore to detect all the acoustic data that I followed to be able to then at the end 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.780
 comes to a final result that was to soundproof the local we have 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.460
 opted for the company knauf photo acoustics 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.280
 which allowed us anyway d 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.159
 % soundproof let's say the best way what local we did 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.070
 counter-wall all the false ceiling completely ciamo cappottato 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.530
 we were practically fine at the local end also in the kitchen compartment and also 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.470
 in the area I can leave 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.150
 the loft area which is soundproof this because why 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.110
 indeed despite being a deposit we have tried to shield the most 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.750
 possible local therefore create walls relatives anyway empty to be able to 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.960
 to make sure that sound could break anyway if it could have been in 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.529
 more. 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:14.669
 Acoustic soundproofing not only helps you to make the noises that 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:18.609
 they smile local are not transmitted out of me the first aidc first 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:19.969
 plan anyway 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.749
 then the neighbors who are found anyway 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:27.430
 laterally to the local but also the positive thing is that it soundproof 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:31.609
 local soundproofing well also allows you to make sure that customers nevertheless 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.109
 which are the local tables or at least the local people can communicate 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:39.059
 without having that problems of reverberations or problems with the beautiful thing is that 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:43.739
 in this place we really talk about soft music we talk we talk well 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.829
 if people communicated and not just article on a 50 people one speaks
