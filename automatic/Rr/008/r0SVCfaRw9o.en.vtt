00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.710
Swaying slowly back and forth, illuminating the darkness

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.960
These blue flames, this unerasable sadness..

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.360
The water of this river, flowing in irregular gaps

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.630
Is clear and serene again today.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.670
Softly, gently the wind trails over

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.180
Her long hair; it is the play of a prosperous world.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.840
When I knew the meaning of eternity

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.940
You were no longer here..

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.860
Waves of people,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.490
Even the liveliness of the street lamplights,\

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.500
NAll of it is drawn in the sky of death and rebirth..

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:16.320
Ah phantoms..

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.320
Spinning, twirling, the hem of your dress

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.430
Flutters as your dance; You are a dancer.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.960
Taking my hand in yours, you hummed

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.980
A song with no name and smiled.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.520
All lies and all sin, all dreams and all majesty,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.620
Everything rots in this ruined hell â€“ here

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.310
Surreptitiously, whimsically,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.280
A cat with braided hair lives.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.000
All ego and all deception, all freedom and all light,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.060
Is lost in this world, but you

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.980
Quietly, serenely

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.900
Live with pride in your heart.
