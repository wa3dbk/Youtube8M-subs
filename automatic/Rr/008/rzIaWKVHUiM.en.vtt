00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.710
 Look, I think the administration marcelo teixeira dos santos is a 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.209
 dementia are exquisite exquisite 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:13.409
 he got the club that did not even have 10% of what has today structure 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:17.259
 the club that had a financial situation that was not so strong 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.349
 so strong when it is nowadays 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.550
 had great achievements in the field 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.140
 and sometimes the supporter gets impatient he does not have the patience to realize 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.460
 here the victories in the field sometimes they do not come 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.450
 because it is paving the way for a future that will bring many more victories than 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.910
 gift can provide so I would give for the administration of marcelo 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.110
 I wish I had a desperate appeal today. 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.630
 so that he would continue ahead of the saints 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.660
 Why does Brazilian football need a manager with Marcelo Teixera? 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.150
 I hope he is reelected and helps to make Brazilian football 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.750
 Enjoy this opportunity, a world cup in Brazil 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.510
 to grow and grow again 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.590
 that strength we have had in the past 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.740
 I could finish but things are going to come from the 2010 classics that have come 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.310
 the feet of news 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.210
 2010 we are already working closely with the clubs 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.710
 and we make sure that we make the spectacle field 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.540
 be more attractive with the supporter in the stadium 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.780
 and more appealing to the supporter 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.950
 on television the viewer 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.440
 let's do with the saints in 2010 a pilot experience 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.660
 johnny marr 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.740
 the live games 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.579
 a joke with the supporter in the stadium using a screen that you already have 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.810
 the stadium is in an excellent state of repair and with this 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.369
 spectacle that has animation in the pre-game in the game in the 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.939
 interval so that the supporter has one more reason to be present in the 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:50.319
 state
