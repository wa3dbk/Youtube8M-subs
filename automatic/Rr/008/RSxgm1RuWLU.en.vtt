supposed to help global warming because

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.450 
supposed to help global warming because
it<00:00:32.969> has<00:00:33.600> poop<00:00:34.320> that's<00:00:34.620> not<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.010> bad<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
it has poop that's not so bad for the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.330 
it has poop that's not so bad for the
environment<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.350> remind<00:00:37.350> what<00:00:37.950> else<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.309> does

environment and remind what else it does

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
environment and remind what else it does
the<00:00:38.670> environment<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.899> they<00:00:39.989> cross

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
the environment so can they cross

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.959 
the environment so can they cross
animals<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.920> humans<00:00:41.309> well<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.640> turns<00:00:41.820> out

really<00:01:41.280> surprise<00:01:41.549> me<00:01:41.790> because<00:01:42.030> whenever<00:01:42.420> I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
really surprise me because whenever I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.330 
really surprise me because whenever I
read<00:01:42.899> about<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.320> kind<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.680> stuff<00:01:43.740> even<00:01:44.250> just

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
read about this kind of stuff even just

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.749 
read about this kind of stuff even just
regular<00:01:45.170> GMO<00:01:46.170> animal<00:01:46.649> technology<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> lot<00:01:47.670> of

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
regular GMO animal technology a lot of

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
regular GMO animal technology a lot of
times<00:01:47.939> they<00:01:48.149> don't<00:01:48.450> survive<00:01:48.960> very<00:01:49.200> well<00:01:49.350> so

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
times they don't survive very well so

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.550 
times they don't survive very well so
why<00:01:50.460> would<00:01:50.759> they<00:01:50.939> want<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.299> cross<00:01:51.659> humans<00:01:52.380> with

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
why would they want to cross humans with

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.859 
why would they want to cross humans with
rabbits<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.460> they<00:01:54.149> did<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.509> hope<00:01:54.750> of

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
rabbits and they did it in the hope of

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.240 
rabbits and they did it in the hope of
working<00:01:55.110> miracles<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.829> getting

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
working miracles like getting

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.120 
working miracles like getting
Christopher<00:01:56.759> Reeve<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.149> walk<00:01:57.360> again<00:01:58.100> okay<00:01:59.100> I

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
Christopher Reeve to walk again okay I

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.410 
Christopher Reeve to walk again okay I
guess<00:01:59.310> he<00:01:59.430> was<00:01:59.520> still<00:01:59.700> alive<00:01:59.850> back<00:02:00.119> then<00:02:00.299> cuz

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
guess he was still alive back then cuz

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.370 
guess he was still alive back then cuz
now<00:02:00.540> it'd<00:02:00.630> be<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> little<00:02:00.990> late<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.170> that

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
now it'd be a little late for that

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.069 
now it'd be a little late for that
curing<00:02:02.340> juvenile<00:02:02.790> diabetes<00:02:03.240> or<00:02:03.600> reversing

Parkinson's<00:02:04.710> disease<00:02:05.070> well<00:02:05.640> that's<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.880> bit

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
Parkinson's disease well that's a bit

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.219 
Parkinson's disease well that's a bit
strange<00:02:06.329> they<00:02:06.570> would<00:02:06.719> say<00:02:06.899> getting

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
strange they would say getting

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.919 
strange they would say getting
Christopher<00:02:07.649> Reeve<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.009> walk<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.550> know<00:02:08.610> why

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
Christopher Reeve to walk you know why

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.330 
Christopher Reeve to walk you know why
because<00:02:09.929> they<00:02:10.050> already<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.739> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
because they already have the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.880 
because they already have the
for<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.790> using<00:02:12.269> stem<00:02:12.989> cells<00:02:13.019> from<00:02:13.470> adult

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
for that using stem cells from adult

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.259 
for that using stem cells from adult
humans<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.400> get<00:02:17.519> those<00:02:17.640> stem<00:02:17.879> cells<00:02:18.120> from

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
humans you can get those stem cells from

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.759 
humans you can get those stem cells from
your<00:02:18.330> own<00:02:18.569> nose<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.140> they<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
your own nose so they have the

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.670 
your own nose so they have the
technology<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.690> interestingly<00:02:21.690> enough<00:02:22.349> they

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
technology and interestingly enough they

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.470 
technology and interestingly enough they
had<00:02:22.920> done<00:02:23.220> some<00:02:23.459> experiments<00:02:23.819> with<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.330> in

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
had done some experiments with this in

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.880 
had done some experiments with this in
the<00:02:24.629> US<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:26.420> actually<00:02:27.420> got<00:02:27.569> several<00:02:28.080> people

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
the US and actually got several people

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.410 
the US and actually got several people
with<00:02:29.040> spinal<00:02:29.220> cord<00:02:29.400> injuries<00:02:29.849> to<00:02:30.000> walk<00:02:30.209> again

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
with spinal cord injuries to walk again

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.720 
with spinal cord injuries to walk again
and<00:02:30.780> then<00:02:31.200> they<00:02:31.530> stopped<00:02:32.099> all<00:02:32.310> funding

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
and then they stopped all funding

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.160 
and then they stopped all funding
because<00:02:33.090> it's<00:02:33.269> one<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.569> those<00:02:33.660> things<00:02:33.720> and

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
because it's one of those things and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.660 
because it's one of those things and
they<00:02:34.260> don't<00:02:34.379> really<00:02:34.680> want<00:02:35.040> people<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.459> get

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
they don't really want people to get

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.660 
they don't really want people to get
well<00:02:36.319> it's<00:02:37.319> good<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.860> drag<00:02:38.129> it<00:02:38.310> out<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.549> make

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
well it's good to drag it out you make

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.690 
well it's good to drag it out you make

years<00:02:52.410> well<00:02:53.340> yes<00:02:53.700> they<00:02:53.910> had<00:02:54.209> actually<00:02:54.630> been

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
years well yes they had actually been

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.860 
years well yes they had actually been
crossing<00:02:55.140> human<00:02:56.299> genetic<00:02:57.299> material<00:02:57.720> with

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.030 
animal genetic material creating embryos
but<00:03:00.810> they<00:03:01.140> would<00:03:01.349> only<00:03:01.379> keep<00:03:01.680> them<00:03:01.860> alive<00:03:01.920> for

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
but they would only keep them alive for

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.190 
but they would only keep them alive for
14<00:03:02.519> days<00:03:02.549> but<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.090> doesn't<00:03:03.360> make<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.510> okay<00:03:03.690> in

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
14 days but that doesn't make it okay in

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.490 
14 days but that doesn't make it okay in
my<00:03:04.379> books<00:03:04.709> why<00:03:05.579> would<00:03:05.819> they<00:03:05.940> do<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.150> again<00:03:06.900> to

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
my books why would they do this again to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.860 
my books why would they do this again to
cure<00:03:07.860> incurable<00:03:08.549> diseases<00:03:09.170> like<00:03:10.170> what<00:03:10.410> cancer

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
cure incurable diseases like what cancer

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.000 
cure incurable diseases like what cancer
there's<00:03:12.870> already<00:03:13.079> a<00:03:13.230> cure<00:03:13.530> there<00:03:13.769> are<00:03:13.860> many

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
there's already a cure there are many

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.819 
there's already a cure there are many
cures<00:03:14.340> it's<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:15.030> big<00:03:15.209> lie<00:03:15.319> my<00:03:16.319> husband

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
cures it's just a big lie my husband

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.370 
cures it's just a big lie my husband
came<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.370> said<00:03:17.579> to<00:03:17.730> me<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.239> he<00:03:18.480> heard<00:03:19.109> that

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
came and said to me that he heard that

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.309 
came and said to me that he heard that
now<00:03:19.980> they're<00:03:20.340> taking<00:03:21.060> human<00:03:21.780> embryos

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
now they're taking human embryos

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.160 
now they're taking human embryos
genetically<00:03:23.069> modifying<00:03:23.609> them<00:03:23.850> so<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.690> cow

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
genetically modifying them so that a cow

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.979 
genetically modifying them so that a cow
will<00:03:25.829> not<00:03:26.040> reject<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.609> then<00:03:26.760> putting<00:03:27.690> the

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
will not reject it then putting the

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.050 
will not reject it then putting the
embryos<00:03:28.380> inside<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:29.069> cows<00:03:29.340> for<00:03:29.609> incubation

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
embryos inside the cows for incubation

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.890 
embryos inside the cows for incubation
so<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.170> humans<00:03:31.709> can<00:03:32.040> then<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.400> born<00:03:32.900> from

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
so that the humans can then be born from

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.229 
so that the humans can then be born from
a<00:03:34.079> cow<00:03:34.400> which<00:03:35.400> would<00:03:35.579> mean<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.760> they<00:03:35.940> have<00:03:36.090> no

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
a cow which would mean that they have no

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.159 
a cow which would mean that they have no
rights<00:03:37.099> but<00:03:38.099> is<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.370> true<00:03:39.169> scientists

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
rights but is this true scientists

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.379 
rights but is this true scientists
announced<00:03:40.620> birth<00:03:40.799> of<00:03:41.010> cows<00:03:41.280> cloned<00:03:41.849> in<00:03:42.090> new

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
announced birth of cows cloned in new

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.050 
announced birth of cows cloned in new
way<00:03:42.739> really<00:03:43.739> all<00:03:43.859> they're<00:03:44.040> doing<00:03:44.069> is<00:03:44.609> they<00:03:44.940> had

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
way really all they're doing is they had

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.120 
way really all they're doing is they had
found<00:03:45.269> an<00:03:45.630> improved<00:03:46.230> cloning<00:03:46.799> technology

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
found an improved cloning technology

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.680 
found an improved cloning technology
because<00:03:47.639> problem<00:03:47.940> with<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.120> old<00:03:48.269> one<00:03:48.359> was

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
because problem with the old one was

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.000 
because problem with the old one was
that<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.900> clone<00:03:49.169> would<00:03:49.380> die<00:03:49.620> very<00:03:49.889> quickly

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
that the clone would die very quickly

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.909 
that the clone would die very quickly
and<00:03:50.930> what<00:03:51.930> they're<00:03:52.139> saying<00:03:52.530> here<00:03:52.799> is<00:03:52.829> that

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
and what they're saying here is that

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.580 
and what they're saying here is that
they're<00:03:53.220> going<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.459> use<00:03:54.019> animals<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.410> have

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
they're going to use animals that have

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.390 
they're going to use animals that have
been<00:03:55.799> modified<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:57.319> create<00:03:58.319> like<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:59.370> know

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
been modified to create like a you know

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.430 
been modified to create like a you know
what<00:03:59.730> do<00:04:00.090> they<00:04:00.180> call<00:04:00.359> it<00:04:00.389> farming<00:04:01.319> ph8<00:04:02.060> RMA<00:04:03.440> ph

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
what do they call it farming ph8 RMA ph

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.789 
what do they call it farming ph8 RMA ph
a<00:04:05.569> RM<00:04:06.569> ing<00:04:07.200> farming<00:04:08.130> is<00:04:08.359> like<00:04:09.380> Pharma<00:04:10.380> farming

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
a RM ing farming is like Pharma farming

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.069 
a RM ing farming is like Pharma farming
and<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.880> they<00:04:12.000> can<00:04:12.150> use<00:04:12.329> these<00:04:12.450> animals<00:04:12.900> for

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
and so they can use these animals for

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.890 
and so they can use these animals for
medical<00:04:13.410> products<00:04:13.859> again<00:04:14.069> that's<00:04:14.519> silly<00:04:15.120> you

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
medical products again that's silly you

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.469 
medical products again that's silly you
know<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.260> dangerous<00:04:17.099> because<00:04:17.700> all<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.299> cure

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
know and dangerous because all the cure

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.240 
know and dangerous because all the cure
is<00:04:18.510> already<00:04:18.930> available<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.709> us<00:04:19.829> so<00:04:20.010> why<00:04:20.099> would

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
is already available to us so why would

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.250 
is already available to us so why would
we<00:04:20.340> have<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.579> do<00:04:20.729> this<00:04:20.930> scientists<00:04:21.930> create

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
we have to do this scientists create

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.140 
we have to do this scientists create
animals<00:04:22.680> that<00:04:22.800> are<00:04:22.919> part<00:04:23.159> human<00:04:23.219> and<00:04:23.760> it

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
animals that are part human and it

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.390 
animals that are part human and it
sheep<00:04:24.509> yeah<00:04:25.380> they<00:04:25.560> still<00:04:25.740> look<00:04:25.919> like<00:04:25.949> sheep<00:04:26.280> at

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
sheep yeah they still look like sheep at

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.460 
sheep yeah they still look like sheep at
the<00:04:26.460> part<00:04:26.699> human<00:04:26.820> what<00:04:27.600> they<00:04:27.780> did<00:04:28.020> was<00:04:28.410> they

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
the part human what they did was they

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.719 
the part human what they did was they
took<00:04:30.110> human<00:04:31.110> cells<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:31.740> injected<00:04:32.490> them<00:04:32.639> into

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
took human cells and injected them into

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.980 
took human cells and injected them into
the<00:04:33.030> brain<00:04:33.330> of<00:04:33.600> sheep<00:04:34.160> probably<00:04:35.160> stem<00:04:35.430> cells

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
the brain of sheep probably stem cells

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.719 
the brain of sheep probably stem cells
or<00:04:36.990> they<00:04:37.380> could<00:04:37.440> genetically<00:04:38.190> modify<00:04:38.669> an

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
or they could genetically modify an

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.540 
or they could genetically modify an
animal<00:04:39.240> so<00:04:39.509> that<00:04:39.810> one<00:04:40.139> of<00:04:40.259> its<00:04:40.380> organs<00:04:41.009> would

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
animal so that one of its organs would

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.390 
animal so that one of its organs would
be<00:04:41.729> more<00:04:42.150> like<00:04:42.509> a<00:04:42.870> human<00:04:43.410> organ<00:04:43.650> so<00:04:44.009> that<00:04:44.220> then

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
be more like a human organ so that then

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.420 
be more like a human organ so that then
they<00:04:44.910> could<00:04:45.150> use<00:04:45.449> the<00:04:45.750> animals<00:04:46.650> as<00:04:46.919> sort<00:04:47.370> of

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
they could use the animals as sort of

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.969 
they could use the animals as sort of
living<00:04:47.910> organ<00:04:48.449> banks<00:04:48.900> for<00:04:49.139> humans<00:04:49.620> in<00:04:49.770> need<00:04:49.949> of

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
living organ banks for humans in need of

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.219 
living organ banks for humans in need of
organs<00:04:50.490> for<00:04:51.300> example<00:04:51.780> if<00:04:51.930> you're<00:04:52.080> diabetic

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
organs for example if you're diabetic

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.920 
organs for example if you're diabetic
and<00:04:52.979> your<00:04:53.100> kidneys<00:04:53.460> fail<00:04:53.759> you<00:04:54.509> could<00:04:54.720> get<00:04:54.870> a

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
and your kidneys fail you could get a

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.210 
and your kidneys fail you could get a
kidney<00:04:55.259> that<00:04:55.440> came<00:04:55.800> from<00:04:55.919> a<00:04:56.070> sheep<00:04:58.070> that<00:04:59.070> I've

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
kidney that came from a sheep that I've

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.560 
kidney that came from a sheep that I've
been<00:04:59.370> modified<00:04:59.820> so<00:04:59.970> your<00:05:00.120> body<00:05:00.210> wouldn't

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
been modified so your body wouldn't

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.430 
been modified so your body wouldn't
reject<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:01.520> which<00:05:02.520> is<00:05:02.699> a<00:05:02.729> step<00:05:03.060> above<00:05:03.440> taking

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
reject it which is a step above taking

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.379 
reject it which is a step above taking
it<00:05:04.710> from<00:05:04.800> a<00:05:04.979> foul<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.370> gong<00:05:05.580> practitioner<00:05:06.300> in

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
it from a foul and gong practitioner in

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.290 
it from a foul and gong practitioner in
China<00:05:06.720> but<00:05:07.110> it's<00:05:07.800> still<00:05:08.070> you<00:05:08.550> know<00:05:08.669> crazy<00:05:08.970> and

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
China but it's still you know crazy and

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.210 
China but it's still you know crazy and
unnecessary<00:05:10.020> because<00:05:10.229> like<00:05:10.590> I<00:05:10.710> said<00:05:10.770> most<00:05:10.979> of

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
unnecessary because like I said most of

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.969 
unnecessary because like I said most of
these<00:05:11.310> diseases<00:05:11.550> can<00:05:12.030> be<00:05:12.060> cured<00:05:12.979> diabetes

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
these diseases can be cured diabetes

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.640 
these diseases can be cured diabetes
again<00:05:14.400> is<00:05:14.610> a<00:05:14.639> good<00:05:14.820> example<00:05:15.020> type<00:05:16.020> 2<00:05:16.229> diabetes

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
again is a good example type 2 diabetes

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.980 
again is a good example type 2 diabetes
anyway<00:05:17.099> can<00:05:17.430> be<00:05:17.520> cured<00:05:17.820> with<00:05:18.060> anabolic

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
anyway can be cured with anabolic

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.680 
anyway can be cured with anabolic
fasting<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:19.860> things<00:05:20.370> like<00:05:20.520> that<00:05:20.610> in<00:05:20.970> fact<00:05:21.479> I

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
fasting and things like that in fact I

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.870 
fasting and things like that in fact I
know<00:05:21.750> someone<00:05:22.110> who<00:05:22.229> cured<00:05:23.160> his<00:05:23.280> diabetes<00:05:23.580> so

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
know someone who cured his diabetes so

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.089 
know someone who cured his diabetes so
we<00:05:24.030> don't<00:05:24.180> really<00:05:24.419> need<00:05:24.750> sheep<00:05:25.110> organs<00:05:25.560> now

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
we don't really need sheep organs now

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.480 
we don't really need sheep organs now
about<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.610> cloning<00:05:27.300> aspect<00:05:28.020> of<00:05:28.199> this<00:05:28.410> when<00:05:29.400> it

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
about the cloning aspect of this when it

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.890 
about the cloning aspect of this when it
comes<00:05:29.639> to<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:29.820> animals<00:05:30.210> see<00:05:30.389> what<00:05:30.510> they<00:05:30.630> do<00:05:30.690> is

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
comes to the animals see what they do is

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.560 
comes to the animals see what they do is
they'll<00:05:31.050> modify<00:05:31.650> an<00:05:31.710> animal<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:33.150> once<00:05:33.389> they

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
they'll modify an animal and once they

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.689 
they'll modify an animal and once they
get<00:05:33.690> a<00:05:33.750> good<00:05:34.080> one<00:05:34.320> then<00:05:34.919> they'll<00:05:35.099> clone<00:05:35.490> it

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
get a good one then they'll clone it

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.089 
get a good one then they'll clone it
because<00:05:36.060> it's<00:05:36.270> not<00:05:36.389> easy<00:05:36.449> to<00:05:36.900> modify<00:05:37.139> it

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
because it's not easy to modify it

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.180 
because it's not easy to modify it
genetically<00:05:38.789> so<00:05:39.060> it's<00:05:39.240> just<00:05:39.659> right<00:05:39.960> and<00:05:40.320> then

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
genetically so it's just right and then

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.740 
genetically so it's just right and then
they'll<00:05:41.310> just<00:05:41.430> make<00:05:41.580> multiple<00:05:42.090> copies<00:05:42.120> of<00:05:42.479> the

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
they'll just make multiple copies of the

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.620 
they'll just make multiple copies of the
original<00:05:44.060> experimental<00:05:45.060> experimental

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
original experimental experimental

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.820 
original experimental experimental
animal<00:05:46.440> somehow<00:05:47.340> I<00:05:47.370> think<00:05:47.550> that<00:05:48.650> these<00:05:49.650> things

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
animal somehow I think that these things

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.350 
animal somehow I think that these things
are<00:05:50.010> all<00:05:50.159> getting<00:05:50.400> mixed<00:05:50.699> up<00:05:50.880> together<00:05:51.090> and

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
are all getting mixed up together and

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.850 
are all getting mixed up together and
it's<00:05:51.750> coming<00:05:52.169> out<00:05:52.320> that<00:05:52.590> they<00:05:52.800> are

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
it's coming out that they are

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.909 
it's coming out that they are
hybridizing<00:05:53.610> animals<00:05:54.300> with<00:05:55.080> humans<00:05:55.530> and<00:05:55.680> then

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
hybridizing animals with humans and then

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.360 
hybridizing animals with humans and then
cloning<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:56.699> humans<00:05:57.210> I<00:05:58.159> really<00:05:59.159> haven't

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
cloning the humans I really haven't

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.170 
cloning the humans I really haven't
found<00:05:59.699> any<00:06:00.030> evidence<00:06:00.120> of<00:06:00.659> that<00:06:00.720> I<00:06:00.870> find<00:06:01.530> them

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
found any evidence of that I find them

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.180 
found any evidence of that I find them
you<00:06:03.180> know<00:06:03.300> inserting<00:06:03.870> animals<00:06:04.380> with<00:06:04.620> certain

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
you know inserting animals with certain

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.450 
you know inserting animals with certain
human<00:06:05.669> genes<00:06:06.060> to<00:06:06.510> modify<00:06:06.900> their<00:06:07.139> organs<00:06:07.680> that

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
human genes to modify their organs that

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.950 
human genes to modify their organs that
they're<00:06:08.639> doing<00:06:08.970> experiments<00:06:09.690> where<00:06:09.840> they're

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
they're doing experiments where they're

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.969 
they're doing experiments where they're
taking<00:06:10.320> animals<00:06:10.800> like<00:06:11.070> I<00:06:11.099> showed<00:06:11.340> you<00:06:11.430> and

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
taking animals like I showed you and

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.830 
taking animals like I showed you and
inserting<00:06:13.979> some<00:06:14.520> human<00:06:14.940> genes<00:06:15.180> into<00:06:15.510> them<00:06:15.659> so

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
inserting some human genes into them so

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.060 
inserting some human genes into them so
that<00:06:15.870> they'll<00:06:16.169> have<00:06:16.380> more<00:06:16.979> human-like<00:06:17.280> organs

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
that they'll have more human-like organs

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.860 
that they'll have more human-like organs
but<00:06:20.070> does<00:06:20.280> that<00:06:20.430> make<00:06:20.639> them<00:06:20.820> human<00:06:21.030> I<00:06:21.389> don't

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
but does that make them human I don't

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.230 
but does that make them human I don't
think<00:06:22.199> that<00:06:22.289> it<00:06:22.500> makes<00:06:22.650> them<00:06:22.830> any<00:06:23.070> more<00:06:23.280> human

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
think that it makes them any more human

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.890 
think that it makes them any more human
then<00:06:25.229> it<00:06:25.260> makes<00:06:26.010> the<00:06:26.280> GMO<00:06:26.789> tomato<00:06:27.360> of<00:06:27.630> fish

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
then it makes the GMO tomato of fish

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.399 
then it makes the GMO tomato of fish
because<00:06:28.260> it<00:06:28.530> has<00:06:28.650> fish<00:06:28.889> genes<00:06:29.130> in<00:06:29.340> it<00:06:30.289> but<00:06:31.289> that

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:31.409 
because it has fish genes in it but that

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:34.129 
because it has fish genes in it but that
doesn't<00:06:31.740> make<00:06:31.830> it<00:06:31.889> right<00:06:32.010> either<00:06:32.520> and<00:06:33.139> of

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
doesn't make it right either and of

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:35.420 
doesn't make it right either and of
course<00:06:34.169> if<00:06:34.500> you<00:06:34.590> were<00:06:34.740> talking<00:06:34.950> about<00:06:35.099> putting

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:02.910 
very very bad history so I'd say you

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.310 
very very bad history so I'd say you
know<00:07:03.030> stop<00:07:03.360> while<00:07:03.600> you're<00:07:03.630> ahead<00:07:03.810> I<00:07:04.140> mean<00:07:04.260> I

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320 
know stop while you're ahead I mean I

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.740 
know stop while you're ahead I mean I
can<00:07:04.470> understand<00:07:05.090> they<00:07:06.090> always<00:07:06.240> want<00:07:06.420> to<00:07:06.540> you

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750 
can understand they always want to you

can understand they always want to you
know<00:07:06.870> push<00:07:07.200> the<00:07:07.410> bounds<00:07:07.800> of<00:07:07.800> science<00:07:08.400> but<00:07:08.670> I

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.970 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.280 

think<00:07:11.970> for<00:07:12.120> now<00:07:12.180> they're<00:07:12.810> not<00:07:12.960> going<00:07:13.080> to<00:07:13.140> be

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
think for now they're not going to be

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.550 
think for now they're not going to be
you<00:07:13.470> know<00:07:13.590> cloning<00:07:14.100> humans<00:07:14.550> and<00:07:15.000> you<00:07:15.930> know<00:07:16.050> for

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 
you know cloning humans and you know for

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.450 
you know cloning humans and you know for
organs<00:07:16.950> or<00:07:17.070> anything<00:07:17.370> like<00:07:17.400> that<00:07:17.580> I<00:07:18.180> think<00:07:19.460> but

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 
organs or anything like that I think but

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.340 
organs or anything like that I think but
I<00:07:20.490> you<00:07:21.180> know<00:07:21.210> hopefully<00:07:21.450> they'll<00:07:21.810> they'll

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350 
I you know hopefully they'll they'll

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.960 
I you know hopefully they'll they'll
stay<00:07:22.590> out<00:07:22.710> of<00:07:22.770> this<00:07:22.920> area<00:07:23.160> of<00:07:23.310> research<00:07:23.460> but<00:07:23.940> I

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:23.970 
stay out of this area of research but I

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.190 
stay out of this area of research but I
don't<00:07:24.240> know<00:07:24.360> if<00:07:24.540> this<00:07:24.690> is<00:07:24.720> the<00:07:24.840> kind<00:07:25.110> of<00:07:25.140> thing

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
don't know if this is the kind of thing

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.440 
don't know if this is the kind of thing
the<00:07:25.410> New<00:07:25.500> World<00:07:25.530> Order<00:07:25.890> likes<00:07:26.070> to<00:07:26.250> do<00:07:26.450> they

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:27.450 
the New World Order likes to do they

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.700 
the New World Order likes to do they
just<00:07:27.630> like<00:07:27.750> to<00:07:27.840> mess<00:07:28.080> everything<00:07:28.290> up

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:28.710 
just like to mess everything up

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.790 
just like to mess everything up
basically<00:07:29.640> that's<00:07:30.000> what<00:07:30.180> it<00:07:30.360> adds<00:07:30.480> up<00:07:30.690> to<00:07:30.800> but

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 
basically that's what it adds up to but

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.680 
basically that's what it adds up to but
for<00:07:31.980> now<00:07:32.130> I<00:07:32.160> don't<00:07:32.880> really<00:07:33.270> think<00:07:33.420> that

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690 
for now I don't really think that

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.980 
for now I don't really think that
they're<00:07:33.960> you<00:07:34.350> know<00:07:34.380> creating<00:07:35.660> humans<00:07:36.660> and

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:36.990 
they're you know creating humans and

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.190 
they're you know creating humans and
incubating<00:07:37.560> even<00:07:37.800> cows<00:07:39.200> genetically

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.200 
incubating even cows genetically

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.810 
incubating even cows genetically
modified<00:07:40.590> so<00:07:40.710> the<00:07:40.800> chem<00:07:40.950> won't<00:07:41.130> reject<00:07:41.370> it<00:07:41.610> so

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:41.820 
modified so the chem won't reject it so

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.100 
modified so the chem won't reject it so
they<00:07:41.910> can<00:07:42.030> then<00:07:42.150> be<00:07:42.240> born<00:07:42.480> and<00:07:42.630> have<00:07:42.720> no<00:07:42.870> rights

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.110 
they can then be born and have no rights

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.290 
they can then be born and have no rights
that<00:07:43.440> I<00:07:43.770> haven't<00:07:44.220> seen<00:07:44.580> if<00:07:44.790> you've<00:07:44.910> seen<00:07:45.120> it

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 
that I haven't seen if you've seen it

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.120 
that I haven't seen if you've seen it
let<00:07:45.450> me<00:07:45.480> know<00:07:46.040> so<00:07:47.040> that's<00:07:47.820> it<00:07:48.030> the<00:07:48.300> news<00:07:48.480> is<00:07:48.630> bad

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.130 
let me know so that's it the news is bad

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.630 
let me know so that's it the news is bad
but<00:07:50.130> I<00:07:50.340> guess<00:07:50.550> it<00:07:50.700> could<00:07:50.820> be<00:07:50.850> worse<00:07:51.800> and<00:07:52.800> well

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:53.640 
but I guess it could be worse and well

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.550 
but I guess it could be worse and well
thanks<00:07:53.940> for<00:07:54.060> listening<00:07:54.330> to<00:07:54.450> me<00:07:54.600> and<00:07:54.630> I'll<00:07:55.320> see

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 
thanks for listening to me and I'll see

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.060 
thanks for listening to me and I'll see
you<00:07:55.650> next<00:07:55.680> time
