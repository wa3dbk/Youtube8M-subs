00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 all and all here stringer 06 we get 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.060
 found for a new video on 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.690
 minecraft ps3 the game came out ago 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.700
 about a month so I 'm going to you 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.230
 show a little video that can be 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.480
 putting survival as creative then there 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.390
 I have a spider chasing me and the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.939
 pl we want but a little cactus like that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.260
 we do not stick to it and expect mud 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.250
 but must die in two small 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.270
 second then second subject 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.680
 because otherwise it will be a video 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.059
 too short how to make a vehicle 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.340
 like that so this is very simple already 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.010
 you need a wool of one color 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.489
 does any your color 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.059
 favorite 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.980
 I'm going I do not complain 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.600
 sports cars you take a 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.609
 staircase 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.399
 and like the color you want like 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:07.930
 you want to die including a plaque of 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:07.930
 detection a rail a minesweeper and 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:14.090
 you are going to take a window and kroos and 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.009
 wave here and you need a skull 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.200
 weezer skeleton or skull 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.250
 skeleton 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.930
 so we will weigh a blog like this and 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.330
 so it's not all the time like that 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.159
 either it's like this and after filming in 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.909
 the time in the other direction in 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.300
 doing it like that, that's it 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.909
 do not then then we want to put his 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.069
 we put the little stone staircase on 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.250
 small mine carts 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:46.580
 the little glass the little skulls to 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:53.929
