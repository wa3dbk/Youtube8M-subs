00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
thought that the bike could use a little

precise steering feeling and that kind

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.300 
precise steering feeling and that kind
of<00:02:27.489> sparked<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:28.330> idea<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:29.010> rider<00:02:30.010> first

than<00:02:39.040> in<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.250> past<00:02:39.480> think<00:02:40.480> about<00:02:40.630> if<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.840> go

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
than in the past think about if you go

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.240 
than in the past think about if you go
on<00:02:41.170> record<00:02:41.620> data<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.570> road<00:02:44.010> yeah<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.220> the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
on record data on a road yeah on the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.370 
on record data on a road yeah on the
streets<00:02:45.610> or<00:02:45.880> it's<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.989> date<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.350> really

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
streets or it's the date is really

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.780 
streets or it's the date is really
chaotic<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:48.790> we<00:02:49.450> we<00:02:50.140> tend<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.470> make<00:02:51.280> sure<00:02:51.550> that

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
chaotic so we we tend to make sure that

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.150 
chaotic so we we tend to make sure that
we<00:02:51.910> collect<00:02:52.209> very<00:02:52.390> real<00:02:52.780> very<00:02:53.019> relevant<00:02:53.830> date

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
we collect very real very relevant date

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.040 
we collect very real very relevant date
and<00:02:54.430> very<00:02:54.610> accurate<00:02:54.940> data<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.450> we<00:02:55.540> build

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
and very accurate data and we build

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.449 
and very accurate data and we build
experiments<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:57.010> do<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.580> but<00:02:57.970> we<00:02:58.120> also<00:02:58.239> have

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
experiments to do that but we also have

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.130 
experiments to do that but we also have
we<00:03:00.459> have<00:03:00.610> also<00:03:00.910> have<00:03:01.120> labs<00:03:01.360> here<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:01.840> can

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
we have also have labs here that can

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.100 
we have also have labs here that can
reconstruct<00:03:02.560> roads<00:03:03.150> on<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.209> bike<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.989> think

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
reconstruct roads on the bike so I think

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.930 
reconstruct roads on the bike so I think
we've<00:03:05.650> done<00:03:05.860> work<00:03:06.310> where<00:03:06.640> we've<00:03:06.790> actually

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
we've done work where we've actually

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.180 
we've done work where we've actually
replayed<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.140> vibrations<00:03:08.739> of<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.980> road

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
replayed the vibrations of a road

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.559 
replayed the vibrations of a road
through<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.580> bike<00:03:09.850> while<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.209> riders

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
through the bike while the riders

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.539 
through the bike while the riders
actually<00:03:11.170> on<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.290> bike<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.769> that<00:03:12.160> allows<00:03:12.370> us

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
actually on the bike and that allows us

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:13.830 
actually on the bike and that allows us
to<00:03:12.640> actually<00:03:12.760> engineer's<00:03:13.329> to<00:03:13.450> stand<00:03:13.690> around

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
to actually engineer's to stand around

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.539 
to actually engineer's to stand around
the<00:03:14.049> bike<00:03:14.290> for<00:03:14.530> us<00:03:14.590> today<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:15.250> collect<00:03:15.489> data

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
the bike for us today to collect data

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.550 
the bike for us today to collect data
that's<00:03:16.209> really<00:03:16.510> are<00:03:16.630> we<00:03:16.750> working<00:03:17.320> a<00:03:17.350> lot<00:03:17.440> of

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
that's really are we working a lot of

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.220 
that's really are we working a lot of
automotive<00:03:18.100> projects<00:03:18.850> well<00:03:19.840> we<00:03:19.930> learned<00:03:20.049> a

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
automotive projects well we learned a

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.630 
automotive projects well we learned a
writer<00:03:20.440> first<00:03:20.620> engineering<00:03:21.190> is<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.430> that

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
writer first engineering is that that

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.130 
writer first engineering is that that
scaling<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.269> difference<00:03:22.600> across<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.959> size

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
scaling and difference across the size

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.259 
scaling and difference across the size
range<00:03:23.380> needed<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.799> be<00:03:23.950> much<00:03:24.190> more<00:03:24.220> drastic<00:03:24.940> it

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
range needed to be much more drastic it

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.699 
range needed to be much more drastic it
needed<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.540> be<00:03:25.600> much<00:03:25.810> more<00:03:25.840> drastic<00:03:26.440> than<00:03:26.470> we

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
needed to be much more drastic than we

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.100 
needed to be much more drastic than we
had<00:03:26.920> originally<00:03:27.040> believed<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:28.840> if<00:03:29.079> you

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
had originally believed and so if you

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.960 
had originally believed and so if you
look<00:03:29.350> at<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.829> sizes<00:03:30.340> now<00:03:30.489> look<00:03:30.670> if<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.820> look

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
look at the sizes now look if you look

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.400 
look at the sizes now look if you look
at<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.090> forty<00:03:31.390> nine<00:03:31.510> centimeter<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.049> downtube

diameter we need up to a 61 centimeter
it's<00:03:36.640> about<00:03:36.970> 65<00:03:37.570> millimeters<00:03:38.019> in<00:03:38.140> diameter<00:03:38.290> so

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
it's about 65 millimeters in diameter so

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.590 
it's about 65 millimeters in diameter so
there's<00:03:38.829> a<00:03:38.920> big<00:03:39.700> difference<00:03:39.970> in<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:40.420> tube

shoes to be designed subjectively into a

shoes to be designed subjectively into a
world<00:04:32.260> which<00:04:32.410> is<00:04:32.530> more<00:04:32.710> familiar<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:33.220> formula

world which is more familiar to formula

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.670 
world which is more familiar to formula
one<00:04:33.730> which<00:04:34.060> is<00:04:34.090> virtual<00:04:34.720> design<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:35.590> that

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
one which is virtual design and that

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.830 
one which is virtual design and that
allows<00:04:36.100> us<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.400> iterate<00:04:36.910> much<00:04:37.419> much<00:04:37.630> faster

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
allows us to iterate much much faster

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.310 
allows us to iterate much much faster
and<00:04:38.200> have<00:04:38.320> a<00:04:38.350> greater<00:04:38.590> understanding<00:04:38.710> of<00:04:40.320> the

and have a greater understanding of the
product<00:04:41.620> that<00:04:41.710> we're<00:04:41.800> designing<00:04:41.919> and<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.340> think

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
product that we're designing and I think

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.570 
product that we're designing and I think
that's<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.850> biggest<00:04:43.240> success<00:04:43.720> is<00:04:43.870> really

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
that's the biggest success is really

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.100 
that's the biggest success is really
that<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.610> teams<00:04:46.030> are<00:04:46.210> actually<00:04:46.720> most<00:04:46.870> proud

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
that the teams are actually most proud

that the teams are actually most proud
of
