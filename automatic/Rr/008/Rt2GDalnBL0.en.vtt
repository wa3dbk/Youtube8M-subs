 a good angelic part they did diabolika the angelic part was 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.960
 blades defined as absolutly dry 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.010
 so simple color definition or they can be black and white they are 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.310
 institutional 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.720

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.200
 small tailoring size 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.080
 and then on a little more classic aladino pants 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.260
 the part that sends the jug is the part it represents 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.260
 hotel villa then the part of a pol ca 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.360
 moon folders. of the water heater 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.750
 essentially costs d 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.740
 the ginza waffle intellect 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.480
 that the part is fundamental in the exhibition with the expression 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.780
 flanked by e-mail that with hp has a little bit more rugged than life, f15 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.400
 a little more low-cut t-shirts 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.740
 and coats a little bit more we are all deconstructed compared to lavigne 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.050
 as for the colors, essentially the baby part by reading pm 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.240
 rock socially focused on black 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.749
 then flanked by the white, however, the thousand kunis orap - an important respect to the east 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.280
 as for the adige michele my angel devil jeans line 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.010
 composed essentially of denim 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.320
 so re because it is our workhorse or what for 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.740
 which we are and we have become famous in the course of time having been using 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.640
 then also hot elephant t-shirts in thick and tasteful outerwear 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.890
 a little bit more youthful therefore for a target it is prohibited to be lower than 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.769
 wood angel david 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.699
 the same philosophy was kit for racing even in the restructuring of the 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:32.790
 hai pehle albinia 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.979
 angel devil man 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:39.739
 meteo I obviously dj as regards the angel devil man is born with the 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.599
 same philosophy the angelic line the telephone line 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.349
 and obviously both philosophies are passed on to a fool online 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.729
 that we add ourselves marked over the years because angelita 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:57.409
 essentially releases a man on the line who in the last 2 years has 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.519
 developed in the women's line 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.239
 Lace course of all colors sexually are the same 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.120
 then white and black 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.339
 flanked by e blue 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:11.329
 from the use of red especially on the line sayii same color 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.029
 essentially a lot 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:15.259
 obviously then there is gray 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.619
 that if it is also a fundamental part of the connection 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:22.680
 and also in this collection as I said angelic anchovies 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.169
 evil line with 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:30.809
 in the study. d certain fields a little more sought after cult also ibiza 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:32.359
 by chance by a man 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.769
 I have heard people say never before, dad 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:36.810
 who knows how to wait 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.719
 and therefore also studied in modeling 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:44.469
 beautiful of the studio we say of our line essentially comes from 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.929
 needs to want to raise our target of 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:51.319
 because she is your photo as I said before nital dal 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.749
 little gianelline a little more fashion 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:59.329
 it is from the image of the famous hydrofoils gs15 and if not you surely 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.919
 red warhorse 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.969
 and of course. of the era of our history designers we have been looking for 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:11.109
 add more and therefore also use in man. of more materials 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.529
 sought after who they do both. to create and billÃ² 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:18.599
 hp that can be jackets v. of hair-cut pants 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.910
 tailoring betti why you chose michelle hunzicher in maps 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.999
 represent you in the advertising campaign 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:30.609
 alea iacta the character of the year to s40 transversal character who 

00:04:30.609 --> 00:04:32.639
 represents second year in a manner 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.790
 tourism is strong. from the angelic side on the harmonic side is a 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.860
 extremely feminine character 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.759
 go as it should therefore be nice 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.650
 friendly and approachable 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.059
 therefore they definitely have a disney character 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:49.559
 which represented second but in the best way at least among the various 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:51.349
 characters present 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.880
 pearl of Genoa, Naples presented 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.320
 off the best way made our our brenda and it seems that I have been drinking 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.090
