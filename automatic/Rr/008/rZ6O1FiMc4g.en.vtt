relighting in color correction this is a
shot<00:00:12.990> from<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.380> documentary<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.309> was<00:00:14.610> shot

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
shot from a documentary that was shot

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.480 
shot from a documentary that was shot
with<00:00:15.120> mixed<00:00:15.570> light<00:00:15.870> sources<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.310> see

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
with mixed light sources you can see

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.400 
with mixed light sources you can see
there's<00:00:17.760> some<00:00:17.850> warm<00:00:18.390> areas<00:00:18.869> on<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> right

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
there's some warm areas on the right

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.439 
there's some warm areas on the right
side<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.220> subjects<00:00:20.760> face<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.270> some

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
side of the subjects face and some

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.630 
side of the subjects face and some
cooler<00:00:21.720> areas<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.619> left<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.609> see

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
cooler areas on the left you can see

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.550 
cooler areas on the left you can see
it's<00:00:23.880> definitely<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> mixed<00:00:24.960> lighting

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
it's definitely a mixed lighting

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.710 
it's definitely a mixed lighting
scenario<00:00:26.130> we're<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.180> take<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.660> and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
scenario we're going to take this and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.570 
scenario we're going to take this and
balance<00:00:28.260> everything<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.949> neutral<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.550> color

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
balance everything to neutral in color

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.759 
balance everything to neutral in color
correction<00:00:30.330> as<00:00:30.510> if<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:30.990> shot<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.439> one

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
correction as if it was shot with one

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.920 
correction as if it was shot with one
single<00:00:32.219> light<00:00:32.610> source<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.540> let's<00:00:33.690> dive<00:00:33.870> right

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
single light source so let's dive right

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.500 
single light source so let's dive right
in<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.260> see<00:00:34.469> how<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.450> okay<00:00:36.450> so

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
in and see how we can do this okay so

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.000 
in and see how we can do this okay so
the<00:00:36.840> first<00:00:36.870> thing<00:00:37.260> I'm<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the first thing I'm going to do is a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.799 
the first thing I'm going to do is a
little<00:00:38.309> bit<00:00:38.399> unconventional<00:00:38.690> instead<00:00:39.690> of

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
little bit unconventional instead of

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.810 
little bit unconventional instead of
starting<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> primary<00:00:40.770> color<00:00:41.309> correction

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
starting with a primary color correction

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.810 
starting with a primary color correction
I'm<00:00:42.030> actually<00:00:42.329> going<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.899> isolate<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.370> skin

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
I'm actually going to isolate the skin

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.880 
I'm actually going to isolate the skin
tone<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:45.780> side<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> subjects

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
tone on the right side of the subjects

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.799 
tone on the right side of the subjects
face<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:47.430> see<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.730> very<00:00:47.820> warm<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
face you can see it's very warm and

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.760 
face you can see it's very warm and
orange<00:00:49.289> kind<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:50.690> neon<00:00:51.690> peachy<00:00:52.320> kind<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
orange kind of a neon peachy kind of

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.279 
orange kind of a neon peachy kind of
color<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.430> I'm<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> isolate<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.300> with

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
color so I'm going to isolate that with

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.830 
color so I'm going to isolate that with
a<00:00:55.320> little<00:00:55.500> qualification<00:00:56.460> here<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.030> there's

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
a little qualification here and there's

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.470 
a little qualification here and there's
the<00:00:58.050> skin<00:00:58.350> tone<00:00:58.590> isolated<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.520> I'm<00:01:00.149> actually

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the skin tone isolated and I'm actually

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.290 
the skin tone isolated and I'm actually
going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> desaturate<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.940> bring<00:01:03.270> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
going to desaturate that and bring that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.020 
going to desaturate that and bring that
down<00:01:03.809> into<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.589> correct<00:01:04.979> range<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> skin

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
down into the correct range of the skin

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.210 
down into the correct range of the skin
tone<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> left<00:01:06.780> hand<00:01:06.990> side<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.100> going

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
tone on the left hand side this is going

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.789 
tone on the left hand side this is going
to<00:01:08.280> involve<00:01:08.490> adding<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:09.000> little<00:01:09.150> bit<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.390> blue

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
to involve adding a little bit of blue

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.310 
to involve adding a little bit of blue
desaturating<00:01:10.799> slightly<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.020> upping<00:01:13.020> some<00:01:13.229> of

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
desaturating slightly and upping some of

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.499 
desaturating slightly and upping some of
the<00:01:13.380> contrast<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.189> now<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> balanced

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the contrast and now we have a balanced

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.600 
the contrast and now we have a balanced
flesh<00:01:15.869> tone<00:01:16.170> essentially<00:01:16.799> I've<00:01:16.950> taken<00:01:17.340> out

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
flesh tone essentially I've taken out

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.240 
flesh tone essentially I've taken out
that<00:01:18.390> second<00:01:18.960> light<00:01:19.200> source<00:01:19.530> coming<00:01:19.680> from<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
that second light source coming from the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.310 
that second light source coming from the
right<00:01:20.400> side<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.000> balanced<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> light

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
right side and balanced it with a light

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
right side and balanced it with a light
source<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> Left<00:01:23.159> creating<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.150> smooth

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
source on the Left creating a smooth

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.270 
source on the Left creating a smooth
flesh<00:01:24.930> tone<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.439> almost<00:01:25.680> looks<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.220> was

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
flesh tone that almost looks like it was

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.030 
flesh tone that almost looks like it was
lit<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.580> one<00:01:26.759> light<00:01:27.210> source<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.470> next

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
lit with one light source now the next

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.310 
lit with one light source now the next
two<00:01:29.430> steps<00:01:29.790> after<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.659> essentially<00:01:31.290> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
two steps after this is essentially to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.679 
two steps after this is essentially to
clean<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.130> some<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> work<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.540> I've<00:01:33.659> just

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
clean up some of the work that I've just

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.249 
clean up some of the work that I've just
done<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.159> see<00:01:35.369> his<00:01:35.490> hair<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.270> also

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
done so if you can see his hair is also

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.050 
done so if you can see his hair is also
a<00:01:37.290> little<00:01:37.560> bit<00:01:37.680> warm<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> top<00:01:38.520> right<00:01:38.759> side

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.929 
a little bit warm on the top right side
of<00:01:39.329> his<00:01:39.450> head<00:01:39.600> there<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:40.049> well<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.549> collar

hand<00:01:44.310> side<00:01:44.820> those<00:01:45.630> areas<00:01:46.140> also<00:01:46.439> need<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.950> be

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
hand side those areas also need to be

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
hand side those areas also need to be
color<00:01:47.490> corrected<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.210> brought<00:01:48.570> back<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
color corrected and brought back to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.960 
color corrected and brought back to
neutral<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.009> going<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.189> isolate<00:01:50.700> those

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
neutral so I'm going to isolate those

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.179 
neutral so I'm going to isolate those
with<00:01:51.360> secondary<00:01:51.840> Corrections<00:01:52.409> as<00:01:52.619> well<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
with secondary Corrections as well and

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.620 
with secondary Corrections as well and
here's<00:01:53.520> what<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.820> looks<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.149> after<00:01:54.450> I

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
here's what it looks like after I

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.200 
here's what it looks like after I
brought<00:01:54.990> those<00:01:55.229> back<00:01:55.649> now<00:01:56.579> everything<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
brought those back now everything is

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.370 
brought those back now everything is
looking<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:57.840> been<00:01:58.020> lit<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:58.350> one

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
looking like it's been lit with one

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.109 
looking like it's been lit with one
light<00:01:58.770> source<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.280> we're<00:01:59.490> pretty<00:01:59.700> evenly

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
light source and we're pretty evenly

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.200 
light source and we're pretty evenly
balanced<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.840> we've<00:02:01.020> come<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> long<00:02:01.409> way<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.579> now

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
balanced so we've come a long way so now

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.330 
balanced so we've come a long way so now
I'm<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.630> do<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> primary<00:02:04.469> correction<00:02:05.159> and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
I'm going to do a primary correction and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.039 
I'm going to do a primary correction and
actually<00:02:05.729> get<00:02:05.909> things<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:06.540> bit<00:02:06.719> cooler

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
actually get things a little bit cooler

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.080 
actually get things a little bit cooler
a<00:02:07.200> little<00:02:07.590> bit<00:02:07.710> more<00:02:07.829> desaturated<00:02:08.280> looking<00:02:09.030> a

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
a little bit more desaturated looking a

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.690 
a little bit more desaturated looking a
little<00:02:09.239> bit<00:02:09.390> more<00:02:09.569> neutral<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.890> once<00:02:11.250> i<00:02:11.370> dial

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
little bit more neutral so once i dial

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.790 
little bit more neutral so once i dial
in<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.030> primary<00:02:12.480> correction<00:02:13.230> which<00:02:13.410> involve

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
in that primary correction which involve

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.650 
in that primary correction which involve
a<00:02:13.830> little<00:02:14.130> bit<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.340> blue<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.150> mid-tones

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
a little bit of blue in the mid-tones

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.630 
a little bit of blue in the mid-tones
and<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.050> highlights<00:02:16.530> as<00:02:16.770> well<00:02:16.950> as<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.160> very

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and the highlights as well as a very

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.120 
and the highlights as well as a very
very<00:02:17.970> very<00:02:18.120> slight<00:02:18.840> desaturation<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:20.040> the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
very very slight desaturation of the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.920 
very very slight desaturation of the
image<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.580> get<00:02:21.150> something<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.630> looks<00:02:21.690> like

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
image I get something that looks like

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.860 
image I get something that looks like
this<00:02:22.080> now<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:23.490> isn't<00:02:23.790> our<00:02:23.880> ideal<00:02:24.210> image<00:02:24.510> yet

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
this now this isn't our ideal image yet

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.210 
this now this isn't our ideal image yet
i'm<00:02:25.080> going<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.290> do<00:02:25.500> some<00:02:25.980> additional

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
i'm going to do some additional

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.090 
i'm going to do some additional
secondary<00:02:26.970> corrections<00:02:27.510> on<00:02:27.690> top<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:28.260> but

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
secondary corrections on top of this but

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.360 
secondary corrections on top of this but
we're<00:02:29.580> getting<00:02:29.790> closer<00:02:30.590> after<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.770> primary

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
we're getting closer after this primary

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.890 
we're getting closer after this primary
correction<00:02:32.940> I'm<00:02:33.150> going<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.420> move<00:02:33.630> on<00:02:33.870> and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
correction I'm going to move on and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.810 
correction I'm going to move on and
actually<00:02:34.230> put<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.620> vignette<00:02:35.100> on<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.520> image

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
actually put a vignette on the image

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.640 
actually put a vignette on the image
this<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.180> part<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.600> digital<00:02:37.170> relighting

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
this is part of that digital relighting

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.930 
this is part of that digital relighting
that<00:02:37.980> i<00:02:38.040> was<00:02:38.160> talking<00:02:38.310> about<00:02:38.610> at<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
that i was talking about at the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.540 
that i was talking about at the
beginning<00:02:39.080> actually<00:02:40.080> going<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.350> isolate<00:02:41.310> his

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
beginning actually going to isolate his

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.850 
beginning actually going to isolate his
face<00:02:41.910> with<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.210> circular<00:02:42.780> vignette<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.500> then

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
face with a circular vignette and then

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.530 
face with a circular vignette and then
I'm<00:02:43.980> going<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.190> bring<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.550> background<00:02:45.120> down

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
I'm going to bring the background down

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.750 
I'm going to bring the background down
when<00:02:46.260> i<00:02:46.290> do<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.710> i<00:02:46.980> get<00:02:47.160> something<00:02:47.640> that

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
when i do that i get something that

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.450 
when i do that i get something that
looks<00:02:47.820> like<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:48.990> now<00:02:49.200> his<00:02:49.470> face<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.250> the

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
looks like this so now his face is the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.550 
looks like this so now his face is the
focal<00:02:50.910> point<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.510> frame<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
focal point of the frame and the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.990 
focal point of the frame and the
background<00:02:53.190> has<00:02:53.430> been<00:02:53.610> brought<00:02:53.940> down

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
background has been brought down

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.910 
background has been brought down
slightly<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.200> they're<00:02:55.350> your<00:02:55.470> eye<00:02:55.500> goes

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
slightly so they're your eye goes

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.770 
slightly so they're your eye goes
straight<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.640> subject<00:02:57.210> which<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.570> really

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
straight to the subject which is really

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.570 
straight to the subject which is really
important<00:02:58.350> especially<00:02:58.440> for<00:02:58.800> documentary

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
important especially for documentary

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.000 
important especially for documentary
interviews<00:03:00.150> now<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.410> have<00:03:01.590> this<00:03:01.710> frame

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
interviews now that I have this frame

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.280 
interviews now that I have this frame
looking<00:03:02.400> pretty<00:03:02.760> good<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.480> last<00:03:03.810> step<00:03:04.080> in

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
looking pretty good the last step in

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.900 
looking pretty good the last step in
this<00:03:04.380> process<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.280> put<00:03:05.460> a<00:03:05.490> little<00:03:05.700> bit<00:03:05.850> of

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
this process is to put a little bit of

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.690 
this process is to put a little bit of
color<00:03:06.270> back<00:03:06.630> into<00:03:06.660> his<00:03:07.050> skin<00:03:07.320> tone<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:08.370> I'm

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
color back into his skin tone so I'm

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.240 
color back into his skin tone so I'm
going<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.270> isolate<00:03:09.840> his<00:03:10.050> skin<00:03:10.410> tone<00:03:10.650> now<00:03:11.010> that

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
going to isolate his skin tone now that

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.940 
going to isolate his skin tone now that
everything's<00:03:11.640> even<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.360> very<00:03:12.690> easy

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
everything's even it's a very easy

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.500 
everything's even it's a very easy
qualification<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.100> make<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.580> I'm<00:03:15.300> going<00:03:15.480> to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
qualification to make and I'm going to

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.080 
qualification to make and I'm going to
put<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.900> little<00:03:15.960> bit<00:03:16.590> more<00:03:16.890> flesh<00:03:17.340> tone<00:03:17.670> back

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
put a little bit more flesh tone back

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.670 
put a little bit more flesh tone back
into<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.750> with<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:18.989> little<00:03:19.290> bit<00:03:19.470> more

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
into it with a little bit more

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.770 
into it with a little bit more
saturation<00:03:20.370> when<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.120> do<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.660> get

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
saturation when I do that I get

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.320 
saturation when I do that I get
something<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.410> looks<00:03:22.470> like<00:03:22.739> this<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.550> this

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
something that looks like this and this

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
a long way with the shot from beginning

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.930 
a long way with the shot from beginning
to<00:03:36.780> end<00:03:36.810> it's<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.290> completely<00:03:37.920> different<00:03:38.700> shot

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
to end it's a completely different shot

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.990 
to end it's a completely different shot
this<00:03:39.660> is<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.840> more<00:03:40.260> natural<00:03:40.980> kind<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.310> soft<00:03:41.640> lit

look<00:03:42.270> that<00:03:42.600> looks<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:42.989> it<00:03:43.140> uses<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.470> single

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770

light<00:03:44.070> source<00:03:44.100> one<00:03:44.580> actually<00:03:45.030> uses<00:03:45.540> two<00:03:45.840> but

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
light source one actually uses two but

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.160 
light source one actually uses two but
it<00:03:46.950> doesn't<00:03:47.520> distract<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.450> viewer<00:03:48.480> from<00:03:48.989> the

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170
