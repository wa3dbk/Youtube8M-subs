00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
 hello everyone and well 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.670
 today I'm going to introduce the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.810
 third and last farming spot 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.410
 skill points of the final game 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.080
 fantasy xiii so he has the peculiarity 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.849
 that it forms a little less the points of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.320
 skill say that you're going to do that 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.449
 6000 while the king of flats it's 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.240
 6008 so I think he's a little less 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.980
 performing well in terms of competence 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.070
 pure mission is a little longer 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.070
 learns so here is but you will do 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.570
 of gin and xp and more 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.430
 so that's the mission going on in the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.230
 tour of the hotel china so it's at 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.850
 fifth floor I showed you the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.309
 card but you have to go through the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.770
 fourth so you ride the elevator 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.570
 hop on the fourth floor you do the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.370
 little trick by the stake and you go 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.050
 take the other lift annexes which 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.789
 he leads you to the fifth then you 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.350
 paypal and to the fifth directly otherwise 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.629
 you will arrive on the other side there 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.860
 must go through the fourth and the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.239
 small lift annexes that takes us 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.610
 in the fifth part like that you are 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.050
 well on the good side of the room so you 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.719
 do not worry you will necessarily 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.370
 go in history it will be a big 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.480
 at home are going to have to do this 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.150
 mission in history or elsewhere 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.070
 you will have to believe I have finished all the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.970
 turn to then be able to resume the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.380
 mission as many times as you want 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.400
 as I show you the no stress 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.400
 so here we come to the fifth floor 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.829
 so here we are on the fifth floor 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.140
 to take the mission is simple 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.829
 you will take the mission to the big 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.829
 whole man who is there 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.570
 and there magically in your back we 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.340
 has the boss who is right behind 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.359
 so that's what's practical is that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.859
 the wood is really right next to 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.869
 the stele to take the mission so we 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.909
 will take for the loop and said 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.530
 m to do then when you get to this 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.990
 chapter we are still careful 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.000
 the bumps are not cardboard when we 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.709
 is where I'm too ashamed that it's are 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.959
 really in the story are there for 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.509
 you're blocking there absorption in 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.740
 every corner and are not necessarily 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.679
 simple even if it goes 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.209
 rather well suggests so I love you 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.010
 usually a small attacking defender 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.780
 by the way if the time of time in 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.170
 time you switch and it goes all 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.640
 alone when you are at the highest level 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.810
 it's definitely easier than most 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.560
 you are going to climb in skills and more 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.280
 to go the defenders hastily 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.140
 myself did not then I'm far from having 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.599
 tried filled I could not leave 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.849
 the blade under work and I let them 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.140
 two others and the bottom alone then 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.170
 than the other two all alone in 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.060
 attacker and in pest my future for 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.410
 kill them without any problem there I have not 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.690
 had to d me once my 9th step bar 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.400
 exchanged it's really quiet so 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.329
 it's really big the spot that you 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.370
 going to do later that which 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.569
 twelve thousand xp with growth afld 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.760
 but so civilian so it's a little less 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.130
 that the king of the volunteers but on the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.720
 mission here we are going to have the reward 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.310
 and that's where it's important 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.569
 a seed of unaf gold then we can get 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.040
 to say it's a shit but actually no 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.250
 it's something we sell 6000 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.900
 resale credit 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.190
 so it's not huge but that's when 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.680
 not bad knowing that the mission so 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.389
 takes 30 seconds to do it you need 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.880
 15 20 seconds to resume 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.500
 so if you train that makes you to the 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.239
 Once your xp club will resume 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.880
 mission up the bo will be the same here it is 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.040
 really 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.570
 tale and doing that makes you to the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.520
 times your xp a little less than the king 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.350
 flats it's a little longer by 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.010
 against you so make a seed of 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.620
 the unaf gold each time so it's very 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.350
 very lucrative because that every 30 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.200
 seconds where every minute 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.420
 from 6000 credit means saying 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.070
 easy and logical it's useless 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.090
 fast and it allows you to climb 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.740
 easily your accessories your weapons of 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.350
 mount the level you sell so the 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.090
 canes of the una fort and redeem you and 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.090
 so you do it's really the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.520
 better osmosis of all that makes the xp 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.470
 you make credits and the more you 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.790
 mountain and the faster it goes so it's 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.330
 really quiet it's really 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.220
 good spot 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.640
 so here I leave you I'll finish the 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.450
 fight my little guys, here we go 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.070
 so that's it if you have the offer of 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.480
 growth that's not easy to see and 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.870
 expect you can do it at the 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.850
 end of the game 12000 credit no 12000 xp 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.900
 you also have some doubts so 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.750
 it's rather interesting because it 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.040
 will allow you to ride a gratos you 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.920
 material a small seed of unaf gold 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.540
 There you go 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.220
 So here we are, I hope that this little 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.660
 doggie will have served you for those who 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.330
 did not know how to 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.590
 to have credits which I know a priori 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.050
 one of the most interesting spots in 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.940
 credit level and xp so that's it's 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.390
 so it's the mission 24 that rubs against it 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.250
 spades 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.370
 so I hope this little tutorial you 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.850
 will have served and the good xp is good credit 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.850
 is also
