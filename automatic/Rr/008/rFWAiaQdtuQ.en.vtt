00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello to all these two actors who you 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.830
 so today we will continue 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.290
 on the quadrille brothers actually the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.639
 December 3 so he says December 3 says 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.360
 we will open the small box 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.440
 number 3 which is here here so 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.210
 we will see what we have today 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.369
 so remember yesterday we had a 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.840
 pretty funny toboggan with a coin 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.060
 rather funny 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.910
 Here is the impression it makes me 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.170
 a little 15 kg compared to the size of 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.980
 the figurine which necessarily is enough 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.890
 skinny 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:41.960
 finally have together I wake up 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.960
 a bit of nothing you're awakening that's 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:50.700
 to open his bet and friends 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.070
 of course you know what I want to have I 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.739
 am where we will have a construction cost 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.050
 today children laugh in gold a 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.820
 kind of like maybe see it or 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.080
 maybe not we would have some kind of 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.010
 lanta baer of their through their 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.299
 works 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.770
 we can cut with the lamppost 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.229
 wisdom as everyone knows so 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.460
 there are plenty of small parts and so we 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.710
 will try to build a whole 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.240
 if I get to ok okay so we 'll 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.530
 start with this piece there as one 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.729
 can see it at this level 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.530
 then we take a small dome 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.880
 grays have what we avoid the rose must 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.110
 on the other hand it is a good idea limited 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.909
 their rise will street lights the city 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.979
 then we will take a lightsaber 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.350
 that we will put in our outfit as 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.420
 we can see it at this level 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:45.380
 click then we will take a small 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:51.030
 piece with clips like these agree 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.350
 then the little grass or branch form 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.970
 earlier 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.790
 as for decorating with two small flakes 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:03.600
 of snow in which sense but who like 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.979
 these ci see there and I even m sb I 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.140
 believe it's a light but in 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.030
 a brick all red so decoration 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.750
 once that's done I'll 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.150
 you still have to understand how that's 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.599
 walk all this on the other hand I did 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.099
 bullshit 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.310
 of course I'm bullshit 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.680
 with models in ten pieces because 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.620
 I'm like that so that's actually 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.019
 this before this dome so yes 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.609
 it's true I say it here I ride it gb 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.379
 it's the sound of his voice azera 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.060
 funds which then what is interesting 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.950
 is that I will take this piece here 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.239
 so which is a piece with a pack 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.549
 let's stick to that level in rates 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.639
 long that comes out if I go casey the 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.430
 small cone- shaped filler between 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:55.870
 but then that I put it to the 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:56.260
 above like those flat and so there 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:06.489
 normally 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:11.670
 I have two Arab pieces and that's it 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:15.459
 and so I'm going to make a little macro 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:24.609
 lyautey again if I click next to 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:26.340
 my cursor may not be visible 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:30.730
 woke up this morning 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:34.299
 so that's our little street lights she 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.590
 is my faith rather nice a charlot 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.720
 if you want to see a little the scale of 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.530
 comparison with a figurine 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.269
 normal here is used for that rest sum 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.620
 not every giant step but that's it 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.829
 how it's not at the same level as the 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.709
 figurine is so it must I do not know where 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:53.620
 I will put our side of the house 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.510
 seems a bit of a bit of ministers and 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.010
 who has too many passages sometimes in 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.620
 brief but presents all areas 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:05.019
 be a little busy with things so 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.329
 here is very east to thank you 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.290
 So here are street lights rather nice 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.019
 like that we did a little bit of 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.609
 construction today not take too much 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.590
 wrong when the white and gray color is going 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.810
 pretty good effect it's a little bit 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.419
 cold a little snowy it's good on this 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.950
 we search so based all I think 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.090
 we adapt to your video la bomba 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.020
 things appreciated this question is 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.610
 as for her not ask them japan 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.419
 great pleasure and then we get 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.169
 find I guess tomorrow to tomorrow 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.180
 good idea 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.860
 for the fourth day so the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.789
