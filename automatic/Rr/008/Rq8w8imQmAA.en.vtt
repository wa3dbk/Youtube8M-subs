00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello UTB Borisenko and Vinod and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.719
 only weekly motor we again 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.290
 let's talk about gold pig it back 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.690
 I have already told there the beginning of the new 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.699
 growth then well then still remained 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.480
 some room for development correction 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.619
 and last Friday the market has reached 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.619
 project levels 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.269
 end of the second wave pay attention 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.679
 that the 100 chart is completely 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.890
 wolfe wave formed lower part 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:41.510
 models 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:45.239
 its upper part note that 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.750
 the fifth wave of wulf graduated at level 78 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:54.140
 6 percent of amplitude first wave i 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.430
 ice and something was still a correction 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.210
 I decided to try this movement 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.210
 play it out it came out as you can see 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.900
 This video is the very beginning after the end 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.680
 b- wave zigzag and formation 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.260
 ambush impulse down I lived to put 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.210
 limit order to sell which she 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.330
 slight correction afterwards 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.780
 worked however a little later the bulls didn't 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.030
 poured the first pancake turned out lumpy when 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.740
 it became clear that the small second wave 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.799
 takes the form of a plane 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.229
 I decided to re-enter the market and already 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.750
 after a couple of hours the formation began 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.040
 third wave 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.229
 thereafter at the end of the fourth 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.060
 waves I opened an extra deal on 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.390
 sale and total work 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.310
 all turned out a total of three transactions in 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.490
 friday when we got to the target 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.509
 levels I closed all three deals 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.380
 fixing on him urgently good 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.630
 profit who knows maybe a thing 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.409
 finally colors are nothing but 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.049
 We 'll see the end of the gold correction 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.140
 On the purchase I have already opened the market allowed 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.000
 translate stop little teeth so it 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.090
 only the first step towards building 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.770
 trading pyramids for gold and further 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.370
 prospects will directly depend on 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.010
 samara 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.560
 to a it is worth bearing in mind that when gold 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.299
 enters the pulse phase then all 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.470
 local correction is extremely 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.549
 small amplitude 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.920
 well seen by the first wave structure and 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.860
 every horn i have a breather actually be 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.480
 signal to build long now 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.200
 let's turn to colleagues weakly 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.120
 forex let's start with the levels of paradise and hares 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.849
 still waiting for the price to continue 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.060
 down and still stays in sales within 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.379
 with your little trading pyramid 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.989
 support price provide lines super 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.930
 trends from which will be 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.120
 signal resumption of price reductions from 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.549
 goals and profit and choice are located on 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.930
 lines 0 8 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.060
 Eugene Vinsky prepare materials 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:03.750
 on the indicator ishimoku now we will open 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:05.940
 his last gold review while he 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.480
 also arranged by bear remains in 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.299
 sales rebound from the line of djuna and in 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.049
 the lower boundary of the cloud can push 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.669
 market resumption of price movement down 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:21.030
 Well, let's take a chance to reduce 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:23.669
 the prices are still slightly mine 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.160
 purchases already at breakeven this means 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:29.970
 that you can watch very calmly 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.870
 development of the situation even if 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.840
 tested 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.790
 lower bound of our target zone then 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.599
 thereafter, the word will always be possible 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.359
 enter the market 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.540
 but only after the formation of the ascendants 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.010
 pulses the main trade will be 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.230
 combine only later so we get 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.970
 output impulse up on younger new 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.169
 level and it will be adjusted 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.780
 second wave 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:54.989
 example since it was here ending 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.840
 triangle first wave 2 dacha 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.970
 elongation most likely in length to the third 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.739
 will be much bigger what to open 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.470
 good prospects for building 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:08.310
 position in the third wave on the youngest 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.980
 level of the head of the driver do the same 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.019
 same ridiculous mistake namely increases 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.229
 volumes of their transactions even before 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.690
 begins the movement of the machine in the right him 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.090
 direction in other words ahead 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.969
 the locomotive is given in this case 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.169
 an unforgivable mistake would be 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:27.599
 building up making a purchase at 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.900
 continuation of the correction that is why a 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:33.060
 set for transactions at breakeven 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.580
 because if the correction continues then 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.460
 local trend you downward some 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.320
 shopping speech can not be only after 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.050
 education small remote wife 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.700
 lower timeframes of impulses up 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.590
 subsequent transfer of transactions but 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.159
 break-even will be able to break with the 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.830
 limit potential losses along with 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:55.800
 by the mere construction of the pyramid I 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.479
 For sure I will not get off something 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.539
 means 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.310
 besides the pyramid itself can be opened 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.349
 it means they are big deals for one two 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.969
 days on small waves and which 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.810
 are formed on the hour or four 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:09.169
 hourly charts 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.760
 that is, no need to be limited to 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.740
 long 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:19.919
 trading it can be boring and just 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:22.250
 uninteresting however will return global 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.279
 markup of course until the end of the year 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.349
 Chinese price fluctuations are no longer worth 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:31.229
 the further course of development of the ascending 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.800
 momentum in the fifth wave of sleep may well 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.750
 to reach 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.400
 a historic mark of 2 thousand dollars 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:40.169
 per troy ounce present 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.060
 the attention of the markets is riveted on the battle 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.979
 Democrats and Republicans Washington 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.840
 trying in vain to find a compromise on 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.050
 tax and budget policy on 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.280
 next year the pack is not much progress 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.990
 visible and so -called 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.050
 fiscal abyss gradually 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:59.100
 become a reality meanwhile already in 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.139
 the first months of 2013 everything returns 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.480
 its normal active operation time of the furnace 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.580
 krukov leading central banks of the world again 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.139
 that will be actively discussed 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.960
 become a new driver short cancer 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.639
 metal so you can only 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.110
 reach the mark of 2000 but also in 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.110
 significantly surpass her
