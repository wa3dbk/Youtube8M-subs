00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:05.800

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:08.320
 bridle to wear a jacket and sleep 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.690
 based on the story of napoleon this 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.090
 small man was yes I am now all 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.360

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.270
 strong man right but he loved me 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.420
 read he loved to beat here so here so 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.330
 and a couple of times when he is so bill 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.180
 people have zero reaction was there so he 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:34.120
 hit and just the wind and he thought 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.739
 buttons on jackets 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.739
 metal buttons serrated on 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:47.180

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.280
 to the soldiers without using the sleeve 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.700
 like a handkerchief so as not to wipe 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.330
 you could have a nose all over 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.220
 the surface of the sleeve does not scare at all 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.780

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.100

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.530

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.680
 blow your nose to paint these and collars 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.299
 you can wear all the buttons as if they were 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.750

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:33.430
