the title of this video you can tell
that<00:00:15.900> it's<00:00:15.929> obviously<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.650> stone<00:00:17.190> blocks<00:00:17.490> which

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
that it's obviously a stone blocks which

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.000 
that it's obviously a stone blocks which
so<00:00:18.180> somewhere<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.930> room<00:00:19.230> one<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.890> these

so somewhere in this room one of these

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.950 
so somewhere in this room one of these
stone<00:00:20.310> blocks<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.820> going<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.119> activate<00:00:21.510> a

stone blocks is going to activate a
secret<00:00:22.769> entrance<00:00:22.859> but<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.580> guess<00:00:23.699> which

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
secret entrance but can you guess which

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.330 
secret entrance but can you guess which
one<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.570> actually<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:26.039> block<00:00:26.310> right

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
one it is is actually this block right

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.790 
one it is is actually this block right
here<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.000> there<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.210> no<00:00:27.390> visible<00:00:27.570> redstone<00:00:27.990> or

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
here and there is no visible redstone or

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.740 
here and there is no visible redstone or
Pistons<00:00:29.460> nearby<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.150> fact<00:00:30.330> we're<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.630> going

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
Pistons nearby in fact we're just going

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.440 
Pistons nearby in fact we're just going
to<00:00:30.779> dig<00:00:30.990> around<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.859> see<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.450> and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
to dig around it so you can see that and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.630 
to dig around it so you can see that and
behold<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.320> remove<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.800> block<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.340> going

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
behold if we remove this block is going

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.119 
behold if we remove this block is going
to<00:00:35.700> get<00:00:35.790> replaced<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:37.200> secret<00:00:37.590> entrance<00:00:37.710> is

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
to get replaced and a secret entrance is

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.119 
to get replaced and a secret entrance is
going<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> open<00:00:39.649> some<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.920> may<00:00:41.100> have

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
going to open some of you may have

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.190 
going to open some of you may have
already<00:00:41.370> guessed<00:00:41.820> how<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.420> works<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:42.989> for

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
already guessed how this works but for

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.229 
already guessed how this works but for
those<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.739> haven't<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.579> are<00:00:44.730> using<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
those of you that haven't we are using a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
those of you that haven't we are using a
smooth<00:00:45.570> stone<00:00:45.840> generator<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.860> are<00:00:46.980> using

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
smooth stone generator and we are using

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.010 
smooth stone generator and we are using
cube<00:00:47.460> hamsters<00:00:47.910> design<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.809> very

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
cube hamsters design because it is very

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.920 
cube hamsters design because it is very
fast<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.980> very<00:00:50.070> reliable<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.600> remove

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
fast and very reliable so if I remove

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.569 
fast and very reliable so if I remove
this<00:00:52.079> block<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.500> almost<00:00:52.710> instantly<00:00:53.309> gets

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
this block it almost instantly gets

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.729 
this block it almost instantly gets
replaced<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.300> what<00:00:55.050> we've<00:00:55.170> done<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.559> we've

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
replaced and what we've done is we've

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.500 
replaced and what we've done is we've
taken<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.160> smooth<00:00:56.430> stone<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:56.910> outputted

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
taken the smooth stone that is outputted

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
taken the smooth stone that is outputted
by<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.899> machine<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.559> extended<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
by this machine and extended it all the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.569 
by this machine and extended it all the
way<00:00:59.879> down<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.420> up<00:01:00.930> into<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> room<00:01:01.920> above<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
way down here up into the room above and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.700 
way down here up into the room above and
one<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.390> reasons<00:01:03.420> we've<00:01:03.870> extended<00:01:04.290> its<00:01:04.559> so

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
one of the reasons we've extended its so

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.469 
one of the reasons we've extended its so
far<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.129> because<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.610> thing<00:01:05.820> has<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> piston

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
far is because this thing has a piston

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.539 
far is because this thing has a piston
clock<00:01:06.720> which<00:01:06.990> makes<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.470> lot<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.650> noise<00:01:07.890> which

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
clock which makes a lot of noise which

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.969 
clock which makes a lot of noise which
could<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.180> bit<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.570> giveaway<00:01:09.799> so<00:01:10.799> we've

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
could be a bit of a giveaway so we've

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.039 
could be a bit of a giveaway so we've
extended<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.610> out<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.360> now<00:01:12.689> when<00:01:12.930> we

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
extended it out like that now when we

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.990 
extended it out like that now when we
remove<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> blocks<00:01:14.070> from<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.640> smooth

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
remove one of the blocks from the smooth

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.780 
remove one of the blocks from the smooth
stone<00:01:15.270> line<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:16.280> it's<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> be

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
stone line here it's going to be

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.700 
stone line here it's going to be
replaced<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.540> all<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> blocks<00:01:19.140> behind<00:01:19.409> it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
replaced and all of the blocks behind it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.410 
replaced and all of the blocks behind it
are<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.189> move<00:01:20.369> which<00:01:20.700> means<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.299> we

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
are going to move which means that we

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.600 
are going to move which means that we
can<00:01:21.630> create<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> bud<00:01:22.259> switch<00:01:22.439> all<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.280> way<00:01:23.400> back

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
can create a bud switch all the way back

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.940 
can create a bud switch all the way back
over<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> detect<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
over here so it's going to detect that

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.620 
over here so it's going to detect that
the<00:01:26.009> block<00:01:26.400> has<00:01:26.580> been<00:01:26.610> replaced<00:01:27.000> behind<00:01:27.509> it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the block has been replaced behind it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.690 
the block has been replaced behind it
because<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:28.020> moved<00:01:28.229> along<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.770> then<00:01:29.579> it's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
because it's moved along and then it's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.760 
because it's moved along and then it's
going<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> give<00:01:30.090> us<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.450> redstone<00:01:31.020> signal<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.680> an

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
going to give us a redstone signal as an

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.080 
going to give us a redstone signal as an
output<00:01:32.070> which<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.670> hooked<00:01:32.850> up<00:01:33.030> to

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
output which then can be hooked up to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.520 
output which then can be hooked up to
absolutely<00:01:33.780> anything<00:01:33.960> because<00:01:34.409> it's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
absolutely anything because it's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.830 
absolutely anything because it's
redstone<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.430> case<00:01:35.640> I've<00:01:35.909> used<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
redstone in this case I've used it to

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.929 
redstone in this case I've used it to
create<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.079> secret<00:01:37.439> entrance<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.729> like

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
create a secret entrance so if you like

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.399 
create a secret entrance so if you like
the<00:01:39.119> idea<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.659> want<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.990> build<00:01:40.170> one<00:01:40.380> of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the idea and you want to build one of

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.200 
the idea and you want to build one of
these<00:01:40.590> yourselves<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> can<00:01:41.460> use<00:01:41.640> cue<00:01:41.909> pumps

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
these yourselves you can use cue pumps

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.569 
these yourselves you can use cue pumps
this<00:01:42.390> tutorial<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.560> build<00:01:43.799> all<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.340> see

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
this tutorial to build all that you see

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.889 
this tutorial to build all that you see
right<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.360> he'll<00:01:45.450> show<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> how<00:01:45.840> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
right here and he'll show you how to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.719 
right here and he'll show you how to
build<00:01:46.110> everything<00:01:46.409> including<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.159> piston<00:01:47.579> on

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
build everything including the piston on

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.730 
build everything including the piston on
top<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:48.930> what<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.079> need<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.560> from

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
top and then what you need to do from

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740 
top and then what you need to do from
that<00:01:49.799> point<00:01:49.979> onwards<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:51.090> extend<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
that point onwards is just extend the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.300 
that point onwards is just extend the
signal<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.320> shows<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.680> how<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> build<00:01:53.130> in

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
signal that it shows you how to build in

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.889 
signal that it shows you how to build in
that<00:01:53.460> video<00:01:53.640> that's<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.270> part<00:01:54.570> right<00:01:54.689> here

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that video that's this part right here

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.560 
that video that's this part right here
and<00:01:55.439> extend<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.310> out<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.729> another<00:01:57.090> bunch<00:01:57.420> of

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and extend it out to another bunch of

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.240 
and extend it out to another bunch of
Pistons<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.110> are<00:01:58.290> going<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.500> continue

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
Pistons that are going to continue

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.459 
Pistons that are going to continue
moving<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.119> smooth<00:02:00.509> stone<00:02:00.780> along<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.350> we've

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
moving the smooth stone along so we've

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.959 
moving the smooth stone along so we've
got<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> piston<00:02:01.979> here<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.250> push<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.729> way

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
got a piston here to push it that way

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.789 
got a piston here to push it that way
that's<00:02:03.509> got<00:02:03.719> an<00:02:03.810> obsidian<00:02:04.110> block<00:02:04.560> there

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
that's got an obsidian block there

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.249 
that's got an obsidian block there
because<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.579> push<00:02:05.790> as<00:02:06.479> far<00:02:06.780> as<00:02:06.930> 12

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
because this can push as far as 12

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.169 
because this can push as far as 12
blocks<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.250> an<00:02:08.340> obsidian<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:09.030> an

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
blocks and but an obsidian is an

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.360 
blocks and but an obsidian is an
unmovable<00:02:09.599> block<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.259> then<00:02:10.709> we<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:11.039> another

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
unmovable block and then we have another

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.949 
unmovable block and then we have another
piston<00:02:11.879> here<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.180> well<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.510> send<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.810> all<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
piston here as well to send it all the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.850 
piston here as well to send it all the
way<00:02:13.110> down<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.319> this

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
way down to this

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.920 
way down to this
one<00:02:13.950> which<00:02:14.490> then<00:02:14.760> pushes<00:02:14.970> them<00:02:15.330> all<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.780> way

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
one which then pushes them all the way

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.320 
one which then pushes them all the way
up<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:17.190> as<00:02:17.370> well<00:02:17.520> as<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.940> other<00:02:18.090> thing

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
up so as well as that the other thing

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.880 
up so as well as that the other thing
that<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.480> need<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.990> bud<00:02:19.260> switch<00:02:19.440> there<00:02:19.770> are

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
that you need is a bud switch there are

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.410 
that you need is a bud switch there are
tons<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.220> tutorials<00:02:20.400> out<00:02:20.940> there<00:02:21.000> on<00:02:21.270> YouTube

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
tons of tutorials out there on YouTube

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.510 
tons of tutorials out there on YouTube
I'm<00:02:21.870> sure<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.230> have<00:02:22.380> no<00:02:22.560> problem<00:02:22.980> finding<00:02:23.160> one

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
I'm sure you have no problem finding one

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.850 
I'm sure you have no problem finding one
to<00:02:24.150> build<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.930> then<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.260> just<00:02:25.470> attach

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
to build this and then you just attach

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.220 
to build this and then you just attach
that<00:02:26.100> like<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.000> line<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.810> smooth

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
that like this to the line of smooth

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.660 
that like this to the line of smooth
stone<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.800> then<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.160> going<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.310> give<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.640> a

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
stone and then it's going to give you a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.180 
stone and then it's going to give you a
redstone<00:02:30.120> output<00:02:30.660> every<00:02:30.960> time<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.410> block<00:02:31.920> is

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
redstone output every time a block is

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.790 
redstone output every time a block is
broken<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.390> there<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.690> also<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.020> map<00:02:34.350> download

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
broken so there is also a map download

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.680 
broken so there is also a map download
