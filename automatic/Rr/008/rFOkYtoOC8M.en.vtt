00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hi guys Hassam abbas suggested I should

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.140 
hi guys Hassam abbas suggested I should
make<00:00:03.959> sort<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.859> hovercraft<00:00:05.250> that<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.000> could

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
make sort of a hovercraft that you could

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.600 
make sort of a hovercraft that you could
use<00:00:06.330> like<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.540> football<00:00:07.220> you<00:00:08.220> could<00:00:08.370> kick

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
use like a football you could kick

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.390 
use like a football you could kick
around<00:00:08.760> on<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.150> flat<00:00:09.719> surface<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.410> try<00:00:11.250> and

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
around on a flat surface and try and

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.860 
around on a flat surface and try and
score<00:00:11.700> goals<00:00:11.759> with<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.599> sort<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.900> thing<00:00:12.960> I

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
score goals with it that sort of thing I

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.910 
score goals with it that sort of thing I
spotted<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.369> inflatable<00:00:17.369> swim<00:00:18.150> ring<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:19.529> my

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
spotted this inflatable swim ring in my

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.880 
spotted this inflatable swim ring in my
bargain<00:00:20.460> store<00:00:21.080> so<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.109> thought<00:00:22.350> I'd<00:00:22.470> see<00:00:22.710> if<00:00:22.740> I

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
bargain store so I thought I'd see if I

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.859 
bargain store so I thought I'd see if I
could<00:00:22.920> blow<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.550> up<00:00:25.910> put<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.970> cover<00:00:27.300> over<00:00:27.390> it

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
could blow that up put a cover over it

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.439 
could blow that up put a cover over it
put<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> fan<00:00:29.070> motor<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.970> see<00:00:30.179> if<00:00:30.269> that

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
put a fan motor on it and see if that

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:48.490 
put a fan motor on it and see if that
would<00:00:30.599> work<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.949> that's<00:00:32.160> today's<00:00:32.369> project<00:00:33.149> I

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.779 

don't<00:00:49.500> expect<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.980> will<00:00:50.100> last<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.730> long

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
don't expect it will last all that long

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.720 
don't expect it will last all that long
once<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.420> start<00:00:51.719> kicking<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:53.010> at<00:00:53.579> least

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
once you start kicking it but at least

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.930 
once you start kicking it but at least
it'll<00:00:54.000> give<00:00:54.149> us<00:00:54.180> an<00:00:54.360> idea<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.110> see<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
it'll give us an idea and see if the

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.700 
it'll give us an idea and see if the
principle<00:00:56.940> will<00:00:57.120> work<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:58.170> I'll<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.440> blow

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
principle will work so I'll just blow

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.900 
principle will work so I'll just blow
this<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.690> then<00:01:00.690> see<00:01:01.140> how<00:01:01.800> big<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> circle<00:01:02.550> we

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
this up and then see how big a circle we

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.860 
this up and then see how big a circle we
need<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.270> go<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> middle

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
need to go in the middle

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.570 
need to go in the middle
well<00:01:04.500> that's<00:01:04.650> blowing<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:10.280> what<00:01:11.280> I'll<00:01:11.400> do

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
well that's blowing it up what I'll do

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.640 
well that's blowing it up what I'll do
is<00:01:11.909> I've<00:01:12.060> got<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.780> my<00:01:12.869> feets<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.350> trays

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
is I've got one of my feets of trays

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.760 
is I've got one of my feets of trays
here<00:01:15.200> I'll<00:01:16.200> cut<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.680> up<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:17.970> can

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
here I'll cut that up and see if we can

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.100 
here I'll cut that up and see if we can
stick<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> top<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:23.369> then<00:01:23.930> stick<00:01:24.930> one

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
stick it to the top and then stick one

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.149 
stick it to the top and then stick one
of<00:01:25.229> my<00:01:26.060> hair<00:01:27.060> dryer<00:01:27.420> fans<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> middle<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
of my hair dryer fans in the middle to

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.609 
of my hair dryer fans in the middle to
blow<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.729> air<00:01:29.880> right<00:01:30.170> this<00:01:31.170> should<00:01:31.350> save<00:01:31.590> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
blow the air right this should save a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.640 
blow the air right this should save a
bit<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.950> time<00:01:32.130> I've<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.700> dug<00:01:33.110> this<00:01:34.110> hair

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
bit of time I've just dug this hair

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.260 
bit of time I've just dug this hair
dryer<00:01:34.860> fan<00:01:35.400> out<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.030> my<00:01:36.150> other

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
dryer fan out of one of my other

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.890 
dryer fan out of one of my other
projects<00:01:37.430> got<00:01:38.430> two<00:01:38.729> 9-volt<00:01:39.060> batteries

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
projects got two 9-volt batteries

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.149 
projects got two 9-volt batteries
associated<00:01:40.650> with<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
associated with it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.120 
associated with it
and<00:01:42.119> also<00:01:42.600> got<00:01:42.780> them<00:01:42.869> on/off<00:01:43.140> switch<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:46.130> I

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and also got them on/off switch so I

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.530 
and also got them on/off switch so I
should<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.369> able<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.820> cut<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> hole<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
should be able to just cut a hole in the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.399 
should be able to just cut a hole in the
middle<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.840> there<00:01:49.549> mount<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> fan<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.180> it

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
middle of there mount the fan on it

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.490 
middle of there mount the fan on it
mount<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> batteries<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.250> underside<00:01:54.500> put

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
mount the batteries on the underside put

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.190 
mount the batteries on the underside put
the<00:01:55.619> switch<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.070> it

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
the switch on it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.840 
the switch on it
and<00:01:57.979> somehow<00:01:58.460> or<00:01:58.789> other<00:01:58.820> I<00:02:00.430> think<00:02:01.430> I'll

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
and somehow or other I think I'll

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.670 
and somehow or other I think I'll
probably<00:02:02.090> just<00:02:02.390> use<00:02:02.509> sticky<00:02:03.020> tape<00:02:03.049> to<00:02:03.619> stick

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
probably just use sticky tape to stick

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.229 
probably just use sticky tape to stick
this<00:02:04.039> round<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.460> top<00:02:05.890> well<00:02:06.890> there<00:02:07.070> we<00:02:07.159> go

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239 
this round the top well there we go

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:15.640 
this round the top well there we go

of 9-volt batteries on/off switch a

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.350

little bit of a polystyrene Cup there

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.199 
little bit of a polystyrene Cup there
just<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:24.099> give<00:02:25.099> us<00:02:25.220> an<00:02:25.340> edge<00:02:25.489> so<00:02:25.760> we<00:02:25.880> don't<00:02:26.060> have

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
just to give us an edge so we don't have

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.509 
just to give us an edge so we don't have
the<00:02:26.360> blades<00:02:26.650> blowing<00:02:27.650> in<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:27.920> wind<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:30.519> then

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
the blades blowing in the wind and then

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.020 
the blades blowing in the wind and then
I've<00:02:31.640> just<00:02:31.670> used<00:02:32.239> clear<00:02:32.810> parcel<00:02:33.470> tape<00:02:34.030> to

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
I've just used clear parcel tape to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.270 
I've just used clear parcel tape to
stick<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.360> pizza<00:02:35.930> tray<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.739> top<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.190> the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
stick the pizza tray to the top of the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:46.330 
stick the pizza tray to the top of the
rubber<00:02:37.459> ring<00:02:39.340> that's<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.549> inside<00:02:44.349> so<00:02:45.349> we

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
rubber ring that's the inside so we

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.229 
rubber ring that's the inside so we
better<00:02:46.519> go<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.819> test<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.410> give<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.440> quick<00:02:48.799> test

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
better go and test it give a quick test

00:02:49.239 --> 00:03:08.080
