00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.769
 Ha 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:10.889
 Rule that a person who has entered into earlier in professional sports bicycle race goal line say the winner is a simple yet 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:16.740
 Therefore, with the factor of Pooh pressure 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.270
 9 centimeters of each idea is intertwined All a Tall process and flow of race sometimes 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.090
 Be complicated 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.520
 This Japan sunny insects wakuho 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:29.780
 To ask you to Koichi Nakano goods-cho sports commentator Deciphering the flow of the race 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.780
 It is out of watching a bicycle race 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:41.160
 The third will focus on the skills and power of players 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.160
 First of all, technology to keep the flow of the race and Bach 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.210
 While it is orange of the 7th company of running a top in this race No white after this prior type 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.430
 First car 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:59.160
 Driving type continues to the pink 8th car yellow 5th person 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:04.440
 What kind of development do they make as their goal for the remaining half a week ? 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:10.080
 The best form as the second player of the second fastest player is the player who is running away to the fourth corner 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:12.360
 Run at the top and if you are second at that time , go ahead and finish just that player 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.700
 Because the form of one wear is the best 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.180
 It is natural that the technique of stopping while stopping the player who hits well so that it becomes like that 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.300
 Player who has 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.710
 Very good players will have a lot cyano 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:31.590
 When the leading players depending on the things to do it is go in the election up to four corner 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:37.649
 I was to ask you to further Nakano said the technique to keep the flow of the race 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:42.630
 In fact, it is the moment that the bicycle comes from here in that moment, the speed of the opponent at the corner 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:47.850
 If you match your own speed , it will be like the other party stopped for a moment 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:51.720
 This is to adjust the speed of the opponent by accelerating that oneself 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.960
 Then the other party is there and will stop at that same position 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.929
 It is a corner, but of course it will turn around along 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.650
 If the other party stops at that point, even if it returns to the place of the selection sake again, this is that 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.740
 It means that there is nothing to be done 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.740
 Hmm 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:15.310
 December 30 , 1986 Hitachi River Bicycle Racetrack 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:19.530
 The first Grand Prix champion Koichi Nakano is a top-rated player 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.530
 And the bicycle race Grand Prix makes the fall rough 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:27.200
 East of the players has plunged from behind in the four-corner to the in-course professional 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:36.920
 The player who got sparks in the bank beyond the finish line has a worn uniform 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.550
 Also is pulled in the facial expression was satisfied with his run while wearing 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.510
 This player is Shigenori Inoue 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:50.959
 And it's a great player who has been called a shrinemaster from the speed of straight line 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:56.600
 What that such a combination of Oriashi no 8 was easy to really run to 3 the bicycle race 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.940
 If I'm No army is also it finally dirty and say whether was easy to is I have had in the back of my 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.900
 Ne 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.920
 In you aim at the goal in that each other full force this also it is final that surplus power at that time that there is a force 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.220
 Say it extends come 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.310
 For example, one dollar problem before that 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.400
 Ummm 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:18.400
 I would like to stop the player who has been there just before 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:23.739
 I will open that course in the back or even if I come back again when I do that 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:28.630
 The it means they'll have to wait to put there was a kind of in that early stage 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.300
 It is said that it is easier for a rider to run, so it is quite easy for players without power 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.720
 If you can not 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:38.870
 If there is a power , that both things can be advanced in that good form 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.130
 And that's the same with me in front of that 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.700
 It's a transfer meeting in the back too, and this is a plus for each other, and such a race 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:50.760
 I mean 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.480
 Cooperation until the end of the race which can be said to be one of the features of the bicycle race is the probability of winning each other 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:58.780
 We do things to improve 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:00.549
 And in the last straight line to be most powerful for the driver, the demon is ashamed of its name 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.959
 I showed it every time I ran 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.660
 After all that rolled up and rolled up like that mole 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.830
 I 'm going to deflate the strawberry and the game uniform 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.160
 Nde there are more cases that are stepping on the outside 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:19.420
 according to a maiden to turn my new players give to say just 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:24.250
 When Zaru can not but construction outside nature and good filtration players to open the negotiations 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:27.320
 The now it has entered there Nde players that the checks and balances were from my kind come open Uchigau 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.560
 Is not so good as it is 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.030
 So this is 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:38.490
 The say the thrust players Toka or how we players became backward Nakano 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:44.120
 There are many cases that stretch is very hopefully digs where there was a well-course car 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:48.410
 If I run while watching such a place, that area is that 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:53.419
 You will need some techniques to open it a little further where it is open to some extent 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:57.970
 a As much as possible about that boarding technique How to run so as not to shine with the other party 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.970
 Also it is that it does not go unless you have that kind of technology 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:11.820
 And Mr. bicycle race with a dash and speed to wrest called the flow of the race to protect it 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:18.260
 Kyushu combination of Oniashi Cruncher force to assist was swept the bicycle race world of 1975 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:23.810
 However, in the 60 's, the most annoying type of athletes wanted by Mrs. 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:25.310
 Paul is not a player who uses a dash as a weapon but a top-class speed endurance. 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.790
 It appeared 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:33.460
 So I should separate you miss the player when the type Haiu to that back 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:46.449
 It is in sprinkled the base 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:51.990
 But not a player Patty went to open hee because it can not matter here as soon as possible 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:56.950
 I'm out there and I'll say it very well 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:06:00.910
 It monster Takizawa Masamitsu Speaking of the Fumikireru typical Sake 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.020
 But wearing their power in the overwhelming example Exit 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.129
 power 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:09.639
 The saying still other two mountain Mr. Toka elsewhere it is in up to do so 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:15.960
 The other true as the majors main 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:15.960
 A little Do not be difficult curtain and miss him, et al ultra 1 year 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:22.830
 I found a power that was difficult to catch if I missed it 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.240
 White is also the first car Takizawa Naha 3 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.889
 The line 98 whose power has become cheeky 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.430
 7 years of crash 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:32.430
 Other players are compelled to vigilance in order not to escape the falling mountain 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:41.469
 As a result, Takizawa leaked in third position 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:48.720
 And the remaining half a week 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:50.110
 Explosive leg power pulled rivals at a stretch 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.790
 Sometimes 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:57.160
 Also appear but become Keirin overwhelming power to transcend Yea seems door the 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.240
 In this way the force 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.990
 Cooperation until the end of the race 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.940
 Ton factors characterizing determine the flow of the race 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:09.900
 Next time is the last time 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:13.580
 In the second place of such a capacity, what kind of thought did the living owners run? 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.580
 Let's go to the star racer
