00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:20.450 

oh<00:00:06.920> yeah

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.580 

all<00:00:21.460> right<00:00:21.609> you<00:00:21.730> guys<00:00:21.880> now<00:00:22.359> the<00:00:23.170> reason<00:00:23.560> that

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
all right you guys now the reason that

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.830 
all right you guys now the reason that
the<00:00:24.189> West<00:00:24.430> is<00:00:24.669> moving<00:00:25.060> his<00:00:25.180> truck

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
the West is moving his truck

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.040 
the West is moving his truck
is<00:00:26.500> because<00:00:27.250> he<00:00:28.239> would<00:00:28.360> rather<00:00:28.539> not<00:00:28.840> have<00:00:29.020> a

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
is because he would rather not have a

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.080 
is because he would rather not have a
flying<00:00:29.439> trailer<00:00:29.739> go<00:00:30.009> through<00:00:30.310> it<00:00:30.460> and<00:00:30.849> the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
flying trailer go through it and the

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.990 
flying trailer go through it and the
reason<00:00:31.390> I<00:00:31.480> say<00:00:31.689> that<00:00:31.720> is<00:00:32.259> because<00:00:32.879> we<00:00:33.879> don't

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
reason I say that is because we don't

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.509 
reason I say that is because we don't
exactly<00:00:34.420> know<00:00:34.870> if<00:00:35.140> this<00:00:35.379> this<00:00:35.920> coupler<00:00:36.370> is

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
exactly know if this this coupler is

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.000 
exactly know if this this coupler is
lined<00:00:36.790> up<00:00:37.030> in<00:00:37.239> fact<00:00:38.170> it's<00:00:38.379> probably<00:00:38.530> not<00:00:39.300> but

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
lined up in fact it's probably not but

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.000 
lined up in fact it's probably not but
we<00:00:42.010> decided<00:00:42.370> that<00:00:43.650> crashing<00:00:44.650> it<00:00:44.739> through<00:00:44.980> a

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
we decided that crashing it through a

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.619 
we decided that crashing it through a
field<00:00:45.309> at<00:00:45.579> as<00:00:45.670> much<00:00:45.850> speed<00:00:46.239> as<00:00:46.269> we<00:00:46.480> could

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
field at as much speed as we could

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.200 
field at as much speed as we could
possibly<00:00:46.839> get<00:00:47.290> it<00:00:47.440> up<00:00:47.559> to<00:00:47.800> well<00:00:48.730> if<00:00:48.909> we<00:00:49.059> did

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
possibly get it up to well if we did

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.610 
possibly get it up to well if we did
that<00:00:49.360> we<00:00:49.510> might<00:00:49.690> be<00:00:49.809> able<00:00:49.960> to<00:00:50.019> tell<00:00:50.199> which<00:00:50.409> way

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
that we might be able to tell which way

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.849 
that we might be able to tell which way
it<00:00:50.739> pulled<00:00:50.949> if<00:00:51.190> any<00:00:51.430> way<00:00:51.699> and<00:00:52.620> first<00:00:53.620> things

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
it pulled if any way and first things

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.279 
it pulled if any way and first things
first<00:00:54.010> do<00:00:54.969> not<00:00:55.149> try<00:00:55.449> this<00:00:55.480> at<00:00:55.719> home

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
first do not try this at home

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.930 
first do not try this at home
second<00:00:57.280> thing<00:00:57.460> seconds<00:00:59.039> we<00:01:00.039> yes<00:01:00.579> we<00:01:00.789> do

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
second thing seconds we yes we do

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.599 
second thing seconds we yes we do
realize<00:01:01.420> that<00:01:01.870> this<00:01:02.410> will<00:01:02.649> probably<00:01:03.250> tell<00:01:03.430> us

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
realize that this will probably tell us

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.609 
realize that this will probably tell us
nothing<00:01:03.820> about<00:01:04.210> how<00:01:04.420> it<00:01:04.570> actually<00:01:05.080> pulls<00:01:05.350> when

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
nothing about how it actually pulls when

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.130 
nothing about how it actually pulls when
you're<00:01:05.740> not<00:01:05.920> crashing<00:01:06.460> it<00:01:06.550> through<00:01:06.789> a<00:01:06.820> field

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
you're not crashing it through a field

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.810 
you're not crashing it through a field
but<00:01:08.140> it's<00:01:08.350> gonna<00:01:08.500> be<00:01:08.590> fun<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.070> shit<00:01:09.340> either<00:01:09.610> way

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
but it's gonna be fun to shit either way

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.800 
but it's gonna be fun to shit either way
so<00:01:09.880> we're<00:01:10.210> gonna<00:01:10.390> do<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:11.429> alright<00:01:12.429> YouTube
