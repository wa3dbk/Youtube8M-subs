00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
really and all these guys don't really

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
really and all these guys don't really
shoot<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.410> ball<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.620> her<00:00:55.890> standstill

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
shoot the ball from her standstill

especially<00:00:57.930> from<00:00:57.990> the<00:00:58.140> corner<00:00:58.470> seemed<00:00:58.680> like

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
especially from the corner seemed like

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.010 
especially from the corner seemed like
they<00:00:58.920> practice<00:00:59.310> that<00:00:59.460> quite<00:00:59.700> often<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.390> that's

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
they practice that quite often so that's

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.390 
they practice that quite often so that's
probably<00:01:01.290> some<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> best<00:01:01.890> skills<00:01:02.220> they

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
probably some of the best skills they

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.530 
probably some of the best skills they
have<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> couple<00:01:03.360> of<00:01:03.420> Japanese

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
have we have a couple of Japanese

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.750 
have we have a couple of Japanese
players<00:01:04.050> that<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.250> jump<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.670> grab

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
players that can really jump and grab

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.460 
players that can really jump and grab
the<00:01:06.000> rim<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.390> all<00:01:06.510> those<00:01:06.660> things<00:01:06.870> but

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the rim and do all those things but

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.230 
the rim and do all those things but
they're<00:01:07.620> not<00:01:07.860> accustomed<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:09.119> know

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
they're not accustomed to you know

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.000 
they're not accustomed to you know
dunking<00:01:09.660> on<00:01:09.750> people<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:10.740> I'm<00:01:10.830> not

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
dunking on people you know I'm not

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.080 
dunking on people you know I'm not
trying<00:01:11.190> to<00:01:11.400> tell<00:01:11.550> them<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
trying to tell them that you know you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.000 
trying to tell them that you know you
don't<00:01:12.479> go<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.690> shore<00:01:13.140> that's<00:01:13.290> only<00:01:13.440> two<00:01:13.650> points

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
don't go on shore that's only two points

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.950 
don't go on shore that's only two points
but<00:01:14.160> it<00:01:14.250> makes<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.460> statement<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.360> I'm<00:01:15.720> trying

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
but it makes a statement and I'm trying

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.090 
but it makes a statement and I'm trying
to<00:01:16.050> get<00:01:16.200> them<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.320> play<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.920> little

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
to get them to play with that little

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:28.430 
to get them to play with that little
enthusiasm<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:23.960> think<00:01:24.960> Japanese<00:01:25.770> players<00:01:27.440> need

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
enthusiasm I think Japanese players need

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.680 
enthusiasm I think Japanese players need
to<00:01:28.470> learn<00:01:28.800> how<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.160> play<00:01:29.490> physically<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
to learn how to play physically and

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.590 
to learn how to play physically and
mentally<00:01:31.290> they<00:01:32.009> got<00:01:32.160> to<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.280> tough<00:01:32.610> that's

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
mentally they got to be tough that's

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.280 
mentally they got to be tough that's
what<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.750> learned

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
what I learned

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.030 
what I learned
learn<00:01:35.160> in<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> States<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.770> foreign<00:01:37.770> players

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
learn in the States for foreign players

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.550 
learn in the States for foreign players
in<00:01:38.490> Japan<00:01:41.060> probably<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> language<00:01:42.690> you<00:01:43.410> know

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
in Japan probably the language you know

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.359 
in Japan probably the language you know
they<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.310> they<00:01:44.940> probably<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.300> a<00:01:45.330> hard<00:01:45.630> time

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
they have they probably have a hard time

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.249 
they have they probably have a hard time
communicate<00:01:47.369> with<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> refs<00:01:47.930> most<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.080> them

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
communicate with the refs most of them

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.219 
communicate with the refs most of them
are<00:01:49.350> Japanese<00:01:49.830> breath<00:01:50.039> so<00:01:51.020> they<00:01:52.020> probably

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
are Japanese breath so they probably

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.960 
are Japanese breath so they probably
don't<00:01:52.590> know<00:01:52.800> what<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.369> Americans<00:01:53.820> are

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
don't know what the Americans are

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.180 
don't know what the Americans are
talking<00:01:54.360> about<00:01:54.479> during<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> game<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.619> maybe

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
talking about during the game so maybe

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.969 
talking about during the game so maybe
they<00:01:56.429> probably<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.119> complain<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:58.410> sounds

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
they probably like complain it sounds

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.490 
they probably like complain it sounds
like<00:01:59.130> they're<00:01:59.340> complaining<00:02:00.209> about<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:01.259> calls

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
like they're complaining about the calls

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.070 
like they're complaining about the calls
and<00:02:01.770> stuff<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.250> they<00:02:02.640> maybe<00:02:03.179> get<00:02:03.420> tagged<00:02:03.750> for

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
and stuff so they maybe get tagged for

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.990 
and stuff so they maybe get tagged for
no<00:02:04.259> reason<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.280> kind<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.610> stuff<00:02:05.819> we're<00:02:05.970> just

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
no reason that kind of stuff we're just

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.070 
no reason that kind of stuff we're just
looking<00:02:06.300> for<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.479> fans<00:02:06.660> get<00:02:06.899> more

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.540 
looking for the fans get more
enthusiastic<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.830> understand<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> game

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.430 
enthusiastic and understand the game
more<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.090> understand<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.840> cheers<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.380> how

to<00:02:10.500> boo<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:11.160> visiting<00:02:11.520> team<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.300> think<00:02:12.599> as

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
to boo the visiting team so I think as

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.360 
to boo the visiting team so I think as
time<00:02:13.140> goes<00:02:13.410> on<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.860> as<00:02:13.950> they<00:02:14.069> learn<00:02:14.220> the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
time goes on and as they learn the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.280 
time goes on and as they learn the
personalities<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.959> roller-coaster

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
personalities and the the roller-coaster

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.990 
personalities and the the roller-coaster
ride<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.010> basketball<00:02:17.430> game<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.700> think

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
ride of a basketball game I think

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.949 
ride of a basketball game I think
they've<00:02:18.120> become<00:02:18.209> more<00:02:18.540> enthusiastic

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.240
