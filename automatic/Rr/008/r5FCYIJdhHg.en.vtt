this thing is run on for 18 650

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.420 
this thing is run on for 18 650
lithium-ion<00:00:36.690> batteries<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:38.010> puts<00:00:38.250> out

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
lithium-ion batteries and it puts out

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.780 
lithium-ion batteries and it puts out
over<00:00:38.870> 6000<00:00:39.870> lumens<00:00:40.230> what<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.950> means<00:00:41.220> is<00:00:41.580> you
