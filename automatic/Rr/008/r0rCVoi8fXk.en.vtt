00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
this h2o bowl slide here so this ride is

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.010 
this h2o bowl slide here so this ride is
fairly<00:00:40.020> simple<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.360> dark<00:00:42.600> there<00:00:42.840> is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
fairly simple and in the dark there is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.360 
fairly simple and in the dark there is
that<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> peeps<00:00:44.160> will<00:00:44.670> line<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:45.710> they'll<00:00:46.710> get

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that the peeps will line up they'll get

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.100 
that the peeps will line up they'll get
on<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.640> little<00:00:47.910> raft<00:00:48.980> they<00:00:49.980> will<00:00:50.899> go<00:00:51.899> down

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
on this little raft they will go down

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.069 
on this little raft they will go down
this<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.620> slide<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:53.969> spin<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.780> spin

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
this little slide and then spin and spin

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.270 
this little slide and then spin and spin
spin<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.149> ultimately<00:00:57.149> drop<00:00:57.660> into<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.710> body<00:00:59.129> of

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
spin and ultimately drop into a body of

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.750 
spin and ultimately drop into a body of
water<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.500> key<00:01:01.680> elements<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.520> are

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
water so the key elements here are

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.759 
water so the key elements here are
really<00:01:03.149> building<00:01:03.539> something<00:01:04.199> very<00:01:04.470> much<00:01:04.710> like

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
really building something very much like

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.929 
really building something very much like
a<00:01:05.369> body<00:01:06.119> slide<00:01:06.619> that<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.920> leads<00:01:08.189> into<00:01:08.549> this

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
a body slide that just leads into this

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.200 
a body slide that just leads into this
whirlpool<00:01:09.720> thing<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.530> then<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.909> drop

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
whirlpool thing and then just drop

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.630 
whirlpool thing and then just drop
straight<00:01:12.600> down<00:01:12.720> into<00:01:13.110> water<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:16.130> how<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> built

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
straight down into water so how I built

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.170 
straight down into water so how I built
this<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.659> went<00:01:19.140> into<00:01:19.350> rides<00:01:20.180> full

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
this is I just went into rides full

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.350 
this is I just went into rides full
slides<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.780> rides<00:01:21.990> h2<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> bowl<00:01:23.189> slide<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.880> I

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
slides and rides h2 a bowl slide and I

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.670 
slides and rides h2 a bowl slide and I
used<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.810> ready-made<00:01:26.119> slide<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.689> there

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
used a ready-made slide here so there

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.109 
used a ready-made slide here so there
are<00:01:28.740> different<00:01:29.040> ones<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.520> look<00:01:29.670> at<00:01:29.880> I

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
are different ones you can look at I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.090 
are different ones you can look at I
just<00:01:30.360> did<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> most<00:01:30.930> basic<00:01:31.470> which<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.680> vortex

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
just did the most basic which is vortex

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.600 
just did the most basic which is vortex
you<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:33.360> change<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:34.229> type<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.650> rack<00:01:35.340> is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
you can change what type of rack is

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.969 
you can change what type of rack is
being<00:01:35.880> used<00:01:36.119> your<00:01:36.420> ring<00:01:36.600> or<00:01:36.810> mat<00:01:37.110> I'll<00:01:37.829> go

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
being used your ring or mat I'll go

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.870 
being used your ring or mat I'll go
ahead<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.220> do<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> ring<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:40.640> here<00:01:41.640> is

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
ahead and do a ring for this and here is

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.590 
ahead and do a ring for this and here is
the<00:01:42.329> already<00:01:43.100> constructed<00:01:44.100> ride<00:01:44.549> now<00:01:45.299> if<00:01:45.479> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the already constructed ride now if I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.530 
the already constructed ride now if I
tap<00:01:45.869> Z<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.770> rotate<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.880> now<00:01:48.270> it's

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
tap Z I can rotate this and now it's

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.160 
tap Z I can rotate this and now it's
pretty<00:01:48.990> much<00:01:49.170> identical<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:51.780> other<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.140> I

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
pretty much identical to the other one I

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.749 
pretty much identical to the other one I
had<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.680> there<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.700> see<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:55.759> pretty

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
had and there you can see it pretty

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.039 
had and there you can see it pretty
close<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:58.189> what<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.219> had<00:01:59.399> built<00:01:59.810> something<00:02:00.810> I

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
close to what I had built something I

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.740 
close to what I had built something I
want<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.259> mention<00:02:01.469> with<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.509> do

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
want to mention with this and you can do

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.109 
want to mention with this and you can do
with<00:02:03.899> other<00:02:04.079> rides<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:05.189> case<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.820> didn't

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
with other rides in case you didn't

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.089 
with other rides in case you didn't
already<00:02:06.210> know<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.380> hold<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> shift<00:02:07.740> key

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
already know if you hold the shift key

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.180 
already know if you hold the shift key
in<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.670> move<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.509> mouse<00:02:09.539> forward<00:02:10.319> or<00:02:10.619> back

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
in and move the mouse forward or back

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.350 
in and move the mouse forward or back
you<00:02:11.489> can<00:02:11.640> raise<00:02:11.910> or<00:02:12.270> lower<00:02:12.300> this

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
you can raise or lower this

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.220 
you can raise or lower this
now<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:14.410> going<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.680> be<00:02:15.870> instrumental<00:02:16.870> in

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
now this is going to be instrumental in

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.100 
now this is going to be instrumental in
a<00:02:17.740> couple<00:02:18.190> different<00:02:18.490> reasons<00:02:18.520> one<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.450> then

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
a couple different reasons one and then

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.630 
a couple different reasons one and then
there<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.470> go<00:02:20.560> if<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.010> release<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.460> mouse

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
there you go if I just release the mouse

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.950 
there you go if I just release the mouse
you<00:02:21.670> can<00:02:21.970> then<00:02:22.120> move<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.420> around<00:02:22.510> in<00:02:22.750> place

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
you can then move it around in place

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.460 
you can then move it around in place
that<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.230> want<00:02:23.640> one<00:02:24.640> would<00:02:24.790> be<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.440> layout<00:02:26.440> of

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
that you want one would be the layout of

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.180 
that you want one would be the layout of
your<00:02:26.800> part

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
your part

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.450 
your part
maybe<00:02:27.430> it's<00:02:27.700> very<00:02:28.800> mountainy<00:02:29.800> different

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
maybe it's very mountainy different

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.520 
maybe it's very mountainy different
elevations<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:31.660> for<00:02:32.080> whatever<00:02:32.230> reason

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
elevations and so for whatever reason

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.660 
elevations and so for whatever reason
you<00:02:32.950> need<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.340> really<00:02:33.700> high<00:02:36.150> ride<00:02:37.150> or<00:02:37.480> lower<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
you need a really high ride or lower the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.720 
you need a really high ride or lower the
reason<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.120> I'm<00:02:40.270> bringing<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.720> up<00:02:40.870> is<00:02:41.730> that

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
reason that I'm bringing it up is that

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.160 
reason that I'm bringing it up is that
the<00:02:43.030> default<00:02:43.780> height<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:44.950> thing<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:46.170> I

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
the default height of this thing is I

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.100 
the default height of this thing is I
think<00:02:47.530> about<00:02:47.800> right<00:02:48.070> there<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.690> if<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.810> build

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
think about right there and if I build

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.280 
think about right there and if I build
that<00:02:50.320> at<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.950> height<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.870> we<00:02:52.870> come<00:02:53.110> down

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
that at that height and we come down

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.770 
that at that height and we come down
here<00:02:53.459> there's<00:02:54.459> very<00:02:55.060> little<00:02:55.390> difference

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
here there's very little difference

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.890 
here there's very little difference
between<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:57.630> actual<00:02:58.630> floor<00:02:59.020> of<00:02:59.350> this<00:02:59.590> and

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
between the actual floor of this and

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.699 
between the actual floor of this and
where<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.500> peeps<00:03:03.120> drop<00:03:04.120> into<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.600> water<00:03:04.709> here

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
where the peeps drop into the water here

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.650 
where the peeps drop into the water here
I<00:03:05.740> have<00:03:06.100> given<00:03:06.370> just<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.730> little<00:03:07.030> bit<00:03:07.150> more<00:03:07.390> room

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
I have given just a little bit more room

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.230 
I have given just a little bit more room
by<00:03:07.959> actually<00:03:08.410> lowering<00:03:08.830> this<00:03:09.160> complex<00:03:09.700> this

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
by actually lowering this complex this

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.210 
by actually lowering this complex this
pool<00:03:10.540> complex<00:03:11.050> down<00:03:12.360> lower<00:03:13.360> than<00:03:13.690> normal<00:03:14.220> you

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
pool complex down lower than normal you

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.479 
pool complex down lower than normal you
see<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.580> normal<00:03:15.790> pool<00:03:16.150> complex<00:03:16.450> height<00:03:17.110> is

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
see the normal pool complex height is

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.340 
see the normal pool complex height is
supposed<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.610> be<00:03:18.730> at<00:03:18.820> this<00:03:19.030> level<00:03:19.330> so<00:03:20.320> I

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
supposed to be at this level so I

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.520 
supposed to be at this level so I
dropped<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.190> down<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.760> bit<00:03:22.360> lower<00:03:22.530> actually

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
dropped it down a bit lower actually

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.150 
dropped it down a bit lower actually
into<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.800> ground<00:03:25.560> just<00:03:26.560> so<00:03:26.860> that<00:03:26.950> there<00:03:27.070> would

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
into the ground just so that there would

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.220 
into the ground just so that there would
be<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.340> little<00:03:27.640> more<00:03:27.790> room<00:03:28.060> for<00:03:28.450> them<00:03:28.600> drop<00:03:29.019> out

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
be a little more room for them drop out

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.759 
be a little more room for them drop out
and<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:30.910> did<00:03:31.780> that<00:03:31.959> just<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.500> would<00:03:32.620> look

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
and so did that just so it would look

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.949 
and so did that just so it would look
better<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.340> also<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.180> as<00:03:34.330> these<00:03:34.540> people

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
better and also so that as these people

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.590 
better and also so that as these people
are<00:03:35.080> walking<00:03:35.320> underneath<00:03:35.830> their<00:03:36.820> heads<00:03:37.239> don't

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
are walking underneath their heads don't

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.180 
are walking underneath their heads don't
poke<00:03:37.930> through<00:03:38.350> because<00:03:38.680> actually<00:03:39.070> if<00:03:39.130> you

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
poke through because actually if you

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.729 
poke through because actually if you
come<00:03:39.430> through<00:03:39.790> this<00:03:39.970> way<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.510> look<00:03:40.630> down<00:03:40.930> it

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
come through this way and look down it

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.440 
come through this way and look down it
looks<00:03:41.950> like<00:03:42.190> they're<00:03:42.430> walking<00:03:42.880> through<00:03:42.910> this

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
looks like they're walking through this

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.750 
looks like they're walking through this
thing<00:03:44.190> which<00:03:45.190> is<00:03:45.340> probably<00:03:45.700> more<00:03:46.000> of<00:03:46.239> just<00:03:46.450> a

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
thing which is probably more of just a

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.400 
thing which is probably more of just a
bug<00:03:48.760> or<00:03:49.120> maybe<00:03:49.540> not<00:03:49.750> there<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.080> go

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
bug or maybe not there you go

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.590 
bug or maybe not there you go
that's<00:03:50.560> where<00:03:50.830> they<00:03:50.950> had<00:03:51.130> pokes<00:03:51.459> through<00:03:51.610> so

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
that's where they had pokes through so

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.900 
that's where they had pokes through so
that<00:03:53.080> problem<00:03:53.739> was<00:03:53.950> just<00:03:53.980> because<00:03:54.519> I<00:03:54.550> built

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
that problem was just because I built

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.380 
that problem was just because I built
the<00:03:55.090> ramp<00:03:55.330> there<00:03:56.190> but<00:03:57.190> if<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:57.790> kept<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.269> at

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
the ramp there but if you kept it at

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.240 
the ramp there but if you kept it at
this<00:03:58.540> default<00:03:59.050> height<00:03:59.350> as<00:03:59.620> it<00:03:59.650> getting<00:04:00.040> up<00:04:00.130> and

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
this default height as it getting up and

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.560 
this default height as it getting up and
walk<00:04:00.459> around<00:04:00.610> they<00:04:00.940> could<00:04:01.000> still<00:04:01.360> probably

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
walk around they could still probably

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.660 
walk around they could still probably
walk<00:04:01.900> through<00:04:02.230> that<00:04:02.470> so<00:04:03.160> you<00:04:03.190> want<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.550> keep

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
walk through that so you want to keep

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.479 
walk through that so you want to keep
that<00:04:03.880> in<00:04:04.030> mind<00:04:04.269> just<00:04:04.720> for<00:04:05.019> parents<00:04:05.470> sake<00:04:05.920> I

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
that in mind just for parents sake I

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.850 
that in mind just for parents sake I
don't<00:04:07.120> know<00:04:07.450> if<00:04:07.630> there's<00:04:07.900> a<00:04:07.989> maximum<00:04:08.590> height

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
don't know if there's a maximum height

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.970 
don't know if there's a maximum height
that<00:04:09.610> you<00:04:09.790> can<00:04:09.940> build<00:04:10.180> this<00:04:10.390> from<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.590> water<00:04:11.799> I

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
that you can build this from the water I

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.929 
that you can build this from the water I
think<00:04:12.250> there<00:04:12.430> is<00:04:12.610> if<00:04:13.299> it's<00:04:13.450> too<00:04:13.690> high<00:04:13.920> then

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
think there is if it's too high then

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.330 
think there is if it's too high then
it'll<00:04:16.660> get<00:04:16.780> shut<00:04:17.109> down<00:04:17.139> saying<00:04:17.889> that<00:04:18.100> it's<00:04:18.250> not

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
it'll get shut down saying that it's not

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.490 
it'll get shut down saying that it's not
safe<00:04:19.350> but<00:04:20.400> raising<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:21.549> might<00:04:21.759> increase<00:04:22.180> the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
safe but raising it might increase the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.439 
safe but raising it might increase the
thrill<00:04:23.500> factor<00:04:23.710> so<00:04:24.250> they'll<00:04:24.970> just<00:04:25.090> have<00:04:25.300> to

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
thrill factor so they'll just have to

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.779 
thrill factor so they'll just have to
work<00:04:25.600> that<00:04:25.810> out<00:04:25.919> but<00:04:26.919> you<00:04:27.190> can<00:04:27.340> either<00:04:27.520> build

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
work that out but you can either build

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.820 
work that out but you can either build
one<00:04:28.060> of<00:04:28.150> these<00:04:28.240> directly<00:04:29.050> over<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.530> pool

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
one of these directly over a pool

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.680 
one of these directly over a pool
complex<00:04:31.289> or<00:04:32.289> a<00:04:32.710> pool<00:04:33.070> I<00:04:33.310> should<00:04:33.490> say<00:04:33.729> or<00:04:34.210> you

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
complex or a pool I should say or you

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.270 
complex or a pool I should say or you
can<00:04:34.870> build<00:04:35.050> one<00:04:35.289> over<00:04:35.590> an<00:04:35.650> area<00:04:35.860> and<00:04:36.039> then

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
can build one over an area and then

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.700 
can build one over an area and then
build<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.699> pool<00:04:36.880> under<00:04:37.360> it<00:04:37.509> with<00:04:38.199> rides

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
build the pool under it with rides

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.730 
build the pool under it with rides
swimming<00:04:39.490> pools<00:04:39.729> and<00:04:40.120> then<00:04:40.960> here<00:04:41.410> I'm<00:04:41.530> just

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
swimming pools and then here I'm just

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.040 
swimming pools and then here I'm just
gonna<00:04:41.860> hold<00:04:42.130> in<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.490> shift<00:04:42.789> key<00:04:43.030> you<00:04:43.270> can<00:04:43.780> see

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
gonna hold in the shift key you can see

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.420 
gonna hold in the shift key you can see
the<00:04:44.259> basic<00:04:44.860> area<00:04:45.280> that<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.699> needs<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.060> be<00:04:47.430> for

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
the basic area that it needs to be for

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.339 
the basic area that it needs to be for
them<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.639> fall<00:04:49.000> into<00:04:49.210> it<00:04:49.509> so<00:04:50.080> I'm<00:04:50.139> just<00:04:50.199> gonna

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
them to fall into it so I'm just gonna

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.760 
them to fall into it so I'm just gonna
hold<00:04:50.590> in<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.889> left<00:04:51.099> button<00:04:52.110> mouse<00:04:53.110> over<00:04:53.530> to<00:04:53.680> an

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
hold in the left button mouse over to an

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.850 
hold in the left button mouse over to an
area<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:54.310> now<00:04:55.210> I've<00:04:55.389> got<00:04:55.570> a<00:04:55.599> pool<00:04:55.870> of<00:04:55.900> water<00:04:56.110> so

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
area and now I've got a pool of water so

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.689 
area and now I've got a pool of water so
this<00:04:57.270> would<00:04:58.270> be<00:04:58.690> all<00:04:59.229> that<00:04:59.259> I<00:04:59.919> needed<00:05:00.160> for<00:05:00.550> this

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
this would be all that I needed for this

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.589 
this would be all that I needed for this
to<00:05:01.050> work<00:05:02.050> all<00:05:02.440> I<00:05:02.470> would<00:05:02.800> need<00:05:03.009> then<00:05:03.310> is<00:05:03.599> to

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
to work all I would need then is to

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.230 
to work all I would need then is to
connect<00:05:05.080> this<00:05:05.410> section<00:05:05.919> here<00:05:06.340> to<00:05:06.820> a<00:05:06.849> pool

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
connect this section here to a pool

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.529 
connect this section here to a pool
complex<00:05:08.280> as<00:05:09.280> well<00:05:09.550> as<00:05:09.610> this<00:05:09.910> section<00:05:10.180> down

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
complex as well as this section down

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.740 
complex as well as this section down
here<00:05:10.949> and<00:05:11.949> you<00:05:12.250> can<00:05:12.400> see<00:05:12.580> how<00:05:12.759> I<00:05:12.789> did<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:13.270> here

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
here and you can see how I did that here

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.469 
here and you can see how I did that here
by<00:05:14.590> I've<00:05:15.280> just<00:05:15.520> got<00:05:15.729> some<00:05:15.940> of<00:05:15.970> these<00:05:16.120> flat

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
by I've just got some of these flat

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.330 
by I've just got some of these flat
sections<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:17.259> can<00:05:17.410> see<00:05:17.650> how<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:17.889> build<00:05:17.979> these

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
sections you can see how to build these

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.749 
sections you can see how to build these
in<00:05:18.610> another<00:05:18.729> tutorial<00:05:19.180> I<00:05:19.660> have<00:05:20.220> and<00:05:21.220> then

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
in another tutorial I have and then

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.300 
in another tutorial I have and then
there<00:05:22.240> is<00:05:22.570> just<00:05:22.599> a<00:05:23.110> little<00:05:23.199> bridge<00:05:23.560> that<00:05:24.099> goes

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
there is just a little bridge that goes

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.810 
there is just a little bridge that goes
across<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:25.090> connects<00:05:25.389> to<00:05:25.780> this<00:05:26.080> pool<00:05:26.440> complex

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
across and connects to this pool complex

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.570 
across and connects to this pool complex
so<00:05:27.820> pool<00:05:28.060> complex<00:05:28.599> 2<00:05:28.900> is<00:05:29.110> here<00:05:29.349> pool<00:05:29.650> complex<00:05:30.070> 2

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
so pool complex 2 is here pool complex 2

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.600 
so pool complex 2 is here pool complex 2
is<00:05:30.729> here<00:05:30.940> it's<00:05:31.060> all<00:05:31.240> considered<00:05:31.750> one

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
is here it's all considered one

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.490 
is here it's all considered one
continual<00:05:33.610> pool<00:05:33.820> complex<00:05:34.060> and<00:05:34.750> then<00:05:35.110> there's

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
continual pool complex and then there's

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.909 
continual pool complex and then there's
just<00:05:35.919> this<00:05:36.539> circular<00:05:37.539> stairway<00:05:37.960> all<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:38.830> way

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
just this circular stairway all the way

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.430 
just this circular stairway all the way
up<00:05:39.750> to<00:05:40.750> some<00:05:41.820> little<00:05:42.820> ramp<00:05:43.030> pieces<00:05:43.539> here<00:05:43.870> for

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
up to some little ramp pieces here for

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.629 
up to some little ramp pieces here for
them<00:05:44.650> to<00:05:44.770> get<00:05:44.949> on<00:05:44.979> and<00:05:45.340> then<00:05:45.430> these<00:05:45.580> are

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
them to get on and then these are

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.210 
them to get on and then these are
stations<00:05:46.360> so<00:05:47.199> if<00:05:47.530> you're<00:05:47.650> building<00:05:48.039> your<00:05:48.190> own

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
stations so if you're building your own

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.790 
stations so if you're building your own
the<00:05:49.060> main<00:05:49.240> things<00:05:49.509> you'll<00:05:49.720> need<00:05:49.960> then<00:05:50.289> are

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
the main things you'll need then are

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.550 
the main things you'll need then are
these<00:05:51.099> station<00:05:51.880> pieces<00:05:52.330> and<00:05:52.509> if<00:05:52.630> I<00:05:52.780> close<00:05:53.259> this

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
these station pieces and if I close this

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.499 
these station pieces and if I close this
ride<00:05:53.889> and<00:05:56.009> force<00:05:57.009> everyone<00:05:57.550> to<00:05:57.610> go<00:05:57.880> all<00:05:58.389> the

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
ride and force everyone to go all the

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.480 
ride and force everyone to go all the
way<00:05:58.539> down<00:05:58.870> they're<00:05:59.680> going<00:05:59.770> to<00:05:59.860> go<00:05:59.979> down<00:06:00.009> anyway

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
way down they're going to go down anyway

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.020 
way down they're going to go down anyway
but<00:06:01.210> anyway<00:06:02.250> here<00:06:03.250> you've<00:06:03.370> got<00:06:03.520> station

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
but anyway here you've got station

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.360 
but anyway here you've got station
pieces<00:06:05.550> so<00:06:06.550> you'll<00:06:06.699> need<00:06:06.880> a<00:06:07.150> few<00:06:07.509> of<00:06:07.659> those<00:06:07.840> and

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
pieces so you'll need a few of those and

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.450 
pieces so you'll need a few of those and
then<00:06:09.370> here<00:06:09.759> you've<00:06:09.909> just<00:06:10.090> got<00:06:10.300> normal<00:06:10.509> slopes

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
then here you've just got normal slopes

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.300 
then here you've just got normal slopes
normal<00:06:12.460> curves<00:06:12.789> nothing<00:06:13.389> fancy<00:06:14.190> until<00:06:15.190> you

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
normal curves nothing fancy until you

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.950 
normal curves nothing fancy until you
get<00:06:15.490> to<00:06:15.639> this<00:06:15.789> piece<00:06:16.090> here<00:06:16.449> and<00:06:16.630> then<00:06:16.840> you've

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
get to this piece here and then you've

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.350 
get to this piece here and then you've
got<00:06:17.139> a<00:06:17.169> bowl<00:06:17.500> right<00:06:17.830> so<00:06:18.580> if<00:06:18.759> you<00:06:18.849> wanted<00:06:19.090> to<00:06:19.210> get

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
got a bowl right so if you wanted to get

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.659 
got a bowl right so if you wanted to get
more<00:06:19.690> fancy<00:06:20.289> with<00:06:20.530> this<00:06:20.830> you've<00:06:21.159> got<00:06:21.400> other

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
more fancy with this you've got other

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:25.580 
more fancy with this you've got other
options<00:06:22.000> here<00:06:22.659> that<00:06:22.690> you<00:06:22.870> could<00:06:23.139> build<00:06:23.490> I

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
options here that you could build I

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.980 
options here that you could build I
don't<00:06:26.590> know<00:06:26.650> if<00:06:26.710> they're<00:06:26.860> all<00:06:27.010> available<00:06:27.990> but

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
don't know if they're all available but

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.260 
don't know if they're all available but
if<00:06:29.199> you<00:06:29.320> built<00:06:29.590> some<00:06:29.860> of<00:06:29.889> the<00:06:30.099> other<00:06:30.310> if<00:06:31.000> you

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
if you built some of the other if you

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.969 
if you built some of the other if you
were<00:06:32.110> to<00:06:32.380> place<00:06:32.680> some<00:06:32.949> of<00:06:33.039> the<00:06:33.130> other<00:06:33.279> pre-made

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
were to place some of the other pre-made

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.459 
were to place some of the other pre-made
h2o<00:06:35.979> Bowl<00:06:36.370> slides<00:06:36.909> then<00:06:37.840> you'd<00:06:38.020> be<00:06:38.199> able<00:06:38.289> to

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:38.469 
h2o Bowl slides then you'd be able to

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:41.010 
h2o Bowl slides then you'd be able to
see<00:06:38.650> some<00:06:38.860> other<00:06:39.099> pieces<00:06:39.580> and<00:06:39.760> use<00:06:39.969> one<00:06:40.779> thing

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
see some other pieces and use one thing

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.570 
and then I build that piece and now it's

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.019 
and then I build that piece and now it's
covered<00:06:58.810> if<00:06:59.589> I<00:06:59.650> didn't<00:07:00.039> want<00:07:00.190> the<00:07:00.339> next<00:07:00.580> few<00:07:00.909> to

covered if I didn't want the next few to

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:04.219 
covered if I didn't want the next few to
be<00:07:01.060> covered<00:07:01.539> I<00:07:01.659> just<00:07:01.990> deselect<00:07:02.789> build<00:07:03.789> it

are<00:07:08.380> now<00:07:08.500> not<00:07:08.800> covered<00:07:09.219> the<00:07:09.820> only<00:07:09.940> problem<00:07:10.360> is

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:10.449 
are now not covered the only problem is

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:12.450 
are now not covered the only problem is
the<00:07:11.020> peeps<00:07:11.260> will<00:07:11.409> probably<00:07:11.770> get<00:07:11.860> going<00:07:12.159> fast

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
the peeps will probably get going fast

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.230 
the peeps will probably get going fast
enough<00:07:12.699> they'll<00:07:13.060> probably<00:07:13.240> go<00:07:13.570> up<00:07:13.779> here<00:07:14.199> and

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 
enough they'll probably go up here and

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.420 
enough they'll probably go up here and
be<00:07:16.240> inclined<00:07:16.690> to<00:07:16.839> want<00:07:16.900> to<00:07:17.260> slide<00:07:17.740> off<00:07:17.979> of<00:07:18.010> this

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.430 
be inclined to want to slide off of this

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.480 
be inclined to want to slide off of this
or<00:07:18.849> have<00:07:19.690> the<00:07:19.839> right<00:07:20.050> shutdown<00:07:20.949> because<00:07:21.339> it's

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.490 
or have the right shutdown because it's

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.060 
or have the right shutdown because it's
not<00:07:21.699> safe<00:07:22.060> so<00:07:22.360> I'll<00:07:23.139> just<00:07:23.320> set<00:07:23.469> it<00:07:23.589> back<00:07:23.770> to<00:07:23.830> how

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:24.070 
not safe so I'll just set it back to how

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.200 
not safe so I'll just set it back to how
it<00:07:24.219> was<00:07:24.659> nothing<00:07:25.659> there's<00:07:26.260> one<00:07:26.880> there's<00:07:27.880> that

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210 
it was nothing there's one there's that

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.450 
it was nothing there's one there's that
now<00:07:28.479> it's<00:07:28.659> back<00:07:29.520> so<00:07:30.520> that's<00:07:30.729> the<00:07:31.000> basics<00:07:31.449> is

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 
now it's back so that's the basics is

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.909 
now it's back so that's the basics is
this<00:07:33.460> needs<00:07:33.760> to<00:07:33.940> just<00:07:34.180> be<00:07:34.419> over<00:07:34.960> a<00:07:35.380> body<00:07:35.740> of

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 
this needs to just be over a body of

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:38.490 
this needs to just be over a body of
water<00:07:36.159> it<00:07:36.820> could<00:07:37.089> be<00:07:37.240> over<00:07:37.570> this<00:07:37.750> pool<00:07:38.050> that's

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:38.500 
water it could be over this pool that's

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.430 
water it could be over this pool that's
fine<00:07:40.800> need<00:07:41.800> to<00:07:41.949> have<00:07:41.979> some<00:07:42.310> stations<00:07:42.849> and<00:07:43.440> it

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.440 
fine need to have some stations and it

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:50.390 
fine need to have some stations and it
needs<00:07:44.650> to<00:07:44.979> have<00:07:45.279> both<00:07:45.610> ends<00:07:46.150> connected<00:07:46.389> to<00:07:46.990> a

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.320 

pool<00:07:51.400> complex<00:07:52.260> so<00:07:53.260> hope<00:07:53.800> that<00:07:54.070> helps<00:07:54.789> clear<00:07:55.150> up

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.330 
pool complex so hope that helps clear up

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.669 
pool complex so hope that helps clear up
some<00:07:55.539> questions<00:07:55.690> folks<00:07:56.229> add<00:07:56.469> on<00:07:56.650> that<00:07:56.919> enjoy
