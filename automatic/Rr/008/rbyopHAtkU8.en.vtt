00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.540 
has the macro lens part well it has two
parts<00:00:25.500> basically<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.160> separate<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
parts basically you have to separate the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.550 
parts basically you have to separate the
macro<00:00:26.939> lens<00:00:27.090> if<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.779> want<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.019> use<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> macro

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
macro lens if you want to use the macro

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.870 
macro lens if you want to use the macro

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
lens and if you want to use the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.160 
lens and if you want to use the
wide-angle<00:00:30.090> then<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.630> would<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.080> have

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
wide-angle then you would have to have

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.200 
wide-angle then you would have to have
both<00:00:31.439> parts<00:00:32.009> attached<00:00:32.430> at<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> same<00:00:32.940> time

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
both parts attached at the same time

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.110 
both parts attached at the same time
just<00:00:33.860> for<00:00:34.860> comparison<00:00:35.100> purposes<00:00:35.700> guys<00:00:35.880> I'm

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
just for comparison purposes guys I'm

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.479 
just for comparison purposes guys I'm
going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.300> show<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.719> difference<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
going to show you the difference to a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.760 
going to show you the difference to a
nickel<00:00:38.879> as<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.750> see<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.110> very<00:00:40.410> small

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
nickel as you can see it's very small

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.950 
nickel as you can see it's very small
it's<00:00:41.670> actually<00:00:41.940> smaller<00:00:42.120> than<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.420> expected<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
it's actually smaller than I expected it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.860 
it's actually smaller than I expected it
to<00:00:42.989> be<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.399> very<00:00:44.520> easy<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.180> misplace<00:00:45.660> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
to be so it's very easy to misplace you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.260 
to be so it's very easy to misplace you
just<00:00:46.050> gotta<00:00:46.170> be<00:00:46.320> careful<00:00:46.440> where<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.039> put<00:00:47.219> it

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
just gotta be careful where you put it

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.670 
just gotta be careful where you put it

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
unfortunately but this is the only bad

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.749 
unfortunately but this is the only bad
part<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> little<00:01:47.399> metal<00:01:47.549> part

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
part of it that the little metal part

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.700 
part of it that the little metal part
has<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.090> stay<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:48.360> permanently<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:49.439> doesn't

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
has to stay there permanently it doesn't

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.469 
has to stay there permanently it doesn't
really<00:01:49.799> get<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.130> way<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:51.000> still

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
there so now this is how the lens looks

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.030 
there so now this is how the lens looks
when<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.149> attached<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:54.630> phone

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
can see more of the field monitor you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.000 
can see more of the field monitor you
can<00:02:20.390> even<00:02:20.600> see<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.900> lens<00:02:21.230> on<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.620> right<00:02:21.800> hand

side that you don't see so it definitely

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.650 
side that you don't see so it definitely
does<00:02:24.830> give<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.100> much<00:02:25.430> more<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:26.630> an<00:02:26.780> angle<00:02:27.170> and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
does give it much more of an angle and

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.699 
does give it much more of an angle and
it's<00:02:29.660> definitely<00:02:29.990> cool<00:02:30.110> definitely<00:02:30.380> four

and I want to show you some more samples

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.220 
and I want to show you some more samples
this<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.830> camera<00:02:34.450> now<00:02:35.450> if<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.690> removed<00:02:36.110> the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
this is the camera now if I removed the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.750 
this is the camera now if I removed the
lens<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.590> can<00:02:36.740> automatically<00:02:37.370> and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
lens you can automatically and

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.150 
lens you can automatically and
immediately<00:02:38.660> see<00:02:39.020> that<00:02:39.050> it<00:02:39.560> does<00:02:39.739> definitely

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
immediately see that it does definitely

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.050 
immediately see that it does definitely
Deskin<00:02:40.640> closer<00:02:40.880> so<00:02:41.660> with<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.900> right<00:02:42.050> angle

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
Deskin closer so with the right angle

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.250 
Deskin closer so with the right angle
definitely<00:02:44.060> gives<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.270> more<00:02:44.420> now<00:02:45.020> you<00:02:45.080> also

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
definitely gives it more now you also

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.570 
definitely gives it more now you also
have<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.470> take<00:02:45.560> into<00:02:45.620> consideration<00:02:45.860> that

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
have to take into consideration that

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.100 
have to take into consideration that
when<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:46.850> have<00:02:47.030> video<00:02:47.480> recording<00:02:47.930> it

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
when you have video recording it

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.260 
when you have video recording it
definitely<00:02:48.470> shrinks<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.790> have<00:02:49.940> more

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
definitely shrinks it you have more

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.050 
definitely shrinks it you have more
space<00:02:50.959> like<00:02:51.470> more<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.890> an<00:02:52.010> angle<00:02:52.190> when<00:02:52.940> you're

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
space like more of an angle when you're

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.630 
space like more of an angle when you're
taking<00:02:53.330> pictures<00:02:53.510> now<00:02:54.410> this<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.709> macro<00:02:55.070> as<00:02:55.459> you

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
taking pictures now this is macro as you

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.170 
taking pictures now this is macro as you
can<00:02:55.790> see<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.120> very<00:02:56.450> close<00:02:56.830> that's<00:02:57.850> hence<00:02:58.850> the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
can see it's very close that's hence the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.870 
can see it's very close that's hence the
macro<00:02:59.830> this<00:03:00.830> is<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.010> nickel<00:03:01.250> now<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:01.519> see<00:03:01.760> the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
macro this is a nickel now you see the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.190 
macro this is a nickel now you see the
very<00:03:02.090> detail<00:03:02.570> you<00:03:02.660> can<00:03:02.750> even<00:03:02.930> see<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.170> little

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
very detail you can even see a little

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.080 
very detail you can even see a little
red<00:03:03.530> fiber<00:03:03.830> that<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.280> naked<00:03:04.580> eye<00:03:04.670> might<00:03:04.940> not

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
red fiber that the naked eye might not

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.240 
red fiber that the naked eye might not
be<00:03:05.209> able<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.420> see<00:03:05.690> so<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.709> definitely<00:03:06.830> gives<00:03:07.100> it

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
be able to see so it definitely gives it

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.850 
be able to see so it definitely gives it
a<00:03:07.340> lot<00:03:07.459> of<00:03:07.489> detail<00:03:08.260> cool<00:03:09.260> effects<00:03:09.620> I

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860

have never thought you could pretty much
you<00:03:18.140> would<00:03:18.290> never<00:03:18.410> think<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.769> it's<00:03:19.040> from<00:03:19.190> an

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
you would never think that it's from an

you would never think that it's from an
iPhone<00:03:19.670> 4

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230

this<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.350> some<00:03:21.470> more<00:03:21.549> sample<00:03:22.549> footage<00:03:23.260> just<00:03:24.260> to

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
this is some more sample footage just to

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.170 
this is some more sample footage just to
show<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.650> how<00:03:24.980> close<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.640> actually<00:03:25.760> have<00:03:26.060> to

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
show you how close you actually have to

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.150 
show you how close you actually have to
get<00:03:26.329> to<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.540> picture<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:27.079> was<00:03:27.620> amazed<00:03:27.920> when<00:03:28.070> I

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
get to the picture I was amazed when I

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.620 
get to the picture I was amazed when I
saw<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.579> and<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:28.910> realized<00:03:29.269> that<00:03:29.360> you<00:03:29.480> could

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
saw this and I realized that you could

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.229 
saw this and I realized that you could
literally<00:03:30.140> see<00:03:30.530> all<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.340> little<00:03:31.489> pixels<00:03:32.000> on

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
literally see all the little pixels on

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.270 
literally see all the little pixels on
these<00:03:32.510> two<00:03:32.720> pictures<00:03:32.930> which<00:03:33.739> I<00:03:33.890> thought<00:03:34.130> was

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
these two pictures which I thought was

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.030 
these two pictures which I thought was
crazy<00:03:34.489> I<00:03:35.110> also<00:03:36.110> decided<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.590> put<00:03:36.739> this<00:03:36.799> on<00:03:36.950> my

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
crazy I also decided to put this on my

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.090 
crazy I also decided to put this on my
macbook<00:03:37.690> since<00:03:38.690> I<00:03:38.750> had<00:03:38.900> an<00:03:38.989> extra<00:03:39.350> ring<00:03:39.590> now<00:03:40.070> I

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
macbook since I had an extra ring now I

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.440 
macbook since I had an extra ring now I
chose<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.519> ring<00:03:40.670> without<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.120> indent

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
chose the ring without the indent

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.090 
chose the ring without the indent
obviously<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.350> as<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:42.560> can<00:03:42.650> see<00:03:42.799> it<00:03:42.920> doesn't

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
obviously and as you can see it doesn't

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.710 
obviously and as you can see it doesn't
block<00:03:43.340> any<00:03:43.400> of<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.760> sensors<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.450> doesn't

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
block any of the sensors and it doesn't

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.120 
block any of the sensors and it doesn't
block<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.989> camera<00:03:45.320> so<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.590> definitely<00:03:45.709> worked

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
block the camera so it definitely worked

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.949 
block the camera so it definitely worked
out<00:03:46.250> perfectly<00:03:46.700> you<00:03:47.329> just<00:03:47.510> removed<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.870> little

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
out perfectly you just removed a little

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.830 
out perfectly you just removed a little
film<00:03:48.380> protector<00:03:49.070> and<00:03:49.250> then<00:03:50.239> he<00:03:50.360> just<00:03:50.540> attached

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
film protector and then he just attached

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.569 
film protector and then he just attached
the<00:03:51.019> lens<00:03:51.260> so<00:03:51.590> I'm<00:03:52.040> gonna<00:03:52.190> show<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.400> some

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
the lens so I'm gonna show you some

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.810 
the lens so I'm gonna show you some
footage<00:03:52.760> on<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.450> MacBook<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:54.170> how<00:03:54.590> much<00:03:54.820> more

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
footage on the MacBook and how much more

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.880 
footage on the MacBook and how much more
space<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.209> actually<00:03:56.360> get<00:03:56.720> using<00:03:57.049> this<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:57.829> you

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
space to actually get using this so you

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.009 
space to actually get using this so you
see<00:03:58.100> you<00:03:58.220> immediately<00:03:58.610> see<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.880> difference

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
see you immediately see the difference

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.800 
see you immediately see the difference
on<00:04:00.019> and<00:04:00.560> then<00:04:01.160> back<00:04:01.549> off<00:04:01.760> now<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.510> know<00:04:02.630> I'm

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
on and then back off now I know I'm

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.360 
on and then back off now I know I'm
being<00:04:03.049> I'm<00:04:03.350> probably<00:04:03.650> being<00:04:03.950> a<00:04:04.130> little

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
being I'm probably being a little

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.830 
being I'm probably being a little
redundant<00:04:04.790> I'm<00:04:04.910> showing<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.299> footage<00:04:05.510> on<00:04:05.750> how

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
redundant I'm showing you footage on how

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.000 
redundant I'm showing you footage on how
to<00:04:05.900> do<00:04:06.049> this<00:04:06.140> but<00:04:06.320> I<00:04:06.350> want<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.560> emphasize<00:04:06.680> on

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
to do this but I want to emphasize on

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.640 
to do this but I want to emphasize on
how<00:04:07.400> much<00:04:07.640> more<00:04:07.940> space<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:08.480> actually<00:04:09.260> get<00:04:09.470> out

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
how much more space you actually get out

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.819 
how much more space you actually get out
of<00:04:10.070> this<00:04:10.190> little<00:04:10.459> lens<00:04:11.079> if<00:04:12.079> I<00:04:12.230> put<00:04:12.410> my<00:04:12.560> hand

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
of this little lens if I put my hand

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.440 
of this little lens if I put my hand
well<00:04:13.280> this<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:13.549> what<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.820> wide-angle<00:04:14.000> but<00:04:14.359> if

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
well this is what the wide-angle but if

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.440 
well this is what the wide-angle but if
I<00:04:14.540> put<00:04:14.720> my<00:04:14.840> hand<00:04:15.079> with<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.920> regular<00:04:16.880> lens<00:04:17.090> and

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
I put my hand with the regular lens and

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.539 
I put my hand with the regular lens and
I<00:04:17.810> attach<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.440> lens<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:18.769> see<00:04:18.950> how<00:04:19.100> much<00:04:19.310> more

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
I attach the lens you see how much more

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.969 
I attach the lens you see how much more
space<00:04:19.850> you<00:04:19.880> get<00:04:20.209> on<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:20.959> right<00:04:21.169> side<00:04:21.200> and<00:04:21.620> the

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
space you get on the right side and the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.860 
space you get on the right side and the
same<00:04:22.160> thing<00:04:22.340> goes<00:04:22.370> for<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.760> left<00:04:22.940> side<00:04:23.150> if<00:04:23.720> I

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
same thing goes for the left side if I

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.420 
same thing goes for the left side if I
remove<00:04:24.080> my<00:04:24.200> hand<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.680> this<00:04:24.800> is<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.070> regular

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
remove my hand and this is the regular

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.810 
remove my hand and this is the regular
this<00:04:25.520> is<00:04:25.580> where<00:04:25.789> the<00:04:25.880> regular<00:04:26.210> lens<00:04:26.390> and

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
this is where the regular lens and

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.330 
this is where the regular lens and
you<00:04:27.330> can<00:04:27.480> definitely<00:04:27.630> see<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:27.990> huge<00:04:28.410> gap<00:04:28.800> on

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
you can definitely see the huge gap on

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.100 
you can definitely see the huge gap on
both<00:04:29.730> sides<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.300> it's<00:04:30.450> pretty<00:04:30.630> much<00:04:30.720> it's

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
both sides and it's pretty much it's

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.220 
both sides and it's pretty much it's
probably<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:31.830> want<00:04:31.980> to<00:04:32.100> estimate<00:04:32.730> maybe<00:04:33.060> 25%<00:04:33.630> I

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
probably I want to estimate maybe 25% I

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.560 
probably I want to estimate maybe 25% I
don't<00:04:34.860> know<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.040> exact<00:04:35.370> number<00:04:35.640> though<00:04:35.760> guys

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
don't know the exact number though guys

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.640 
don't know the exact number though guys
that's<00:04:36.810> pretty<00:04:36.870> much<00:04:37.140> it<00:04:37.380> if<00:04:37.500> you're

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
that's pretty much it if you're

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.080 
that's pretty much it if you're
interested<00:04:38.040> in<00:04:38.130> buying<00:04:38.280> this<00:04:38.430> lens<00:04:38.670> the<00:04:38.880> link
