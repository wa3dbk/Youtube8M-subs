believe in myself and never to

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.910 
believe in myself and never to
underestimate<00:05:14.010> the<00:05:14.580> power<00:05:14.730> of<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:15.120> good<00:05:15.240> story

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
underestimate the power of a good story

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.110 
underestimate the power of a good story
sometimes<00:05:16.920> when<00:05:17.250> I<00:05:17.280> should<00:05:17.580> have<00:05:17.610> just<00:05:17.730> told

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
sometimes when I should have just told

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.940

and<00:05:27.210> things<00:05:27.240> in<00:05:27.600> her<00:05:27.720> class<00:05:28.020> and<00:05:28.410> we<00:05:28.920> were

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
and things in her class and we were

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.740 
and things in her class and we were
always<00:05:29.190> doing<00:05:29.520> something<00:05:29.850> fascinating<00:05:30.240> that

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
always doing something fascinating that

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.170 
always doing something fascinating that
that<00:05:31.080> was<00:05:31.290> the<00:05:31.440> contrast<00:05:31.950> because<00:05:32.220> I<00:05:32.669> had<00:05:33.000> come

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
that was the contrast because I had come

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.790 
that was the contrast because I had come
out<00:05:33.300> of<00:05:33.450> a<00:05:33.540> school<00:05:33.810> where<00:05:34.169> I<00:05:34.230> didn't<00:05:34.680> like

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
out of a school where I didn't like

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.380 
out of a school where I didn't like
school<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.160> I<00:05:35.460> was<00:05:35.610> afraid<00:05:35.700> of<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.180> teacher

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
school and I was afraid of the teacher

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.020 
school and I was afraid of the teacher
and<00:05:36.810> it<00:05:37.680> was<00:05:37.860> a<00:05:37.890> horrible<00:05:38.280> thing<00:05:38.580> for<00:05:38.820> me<00:05:38.910> the

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
and it was a horrible thing for me the

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.110 
and it was a horrible thing for me the
day<00:05:39.150> I<00:05:39.180> figured<00:05:39.660> out<00:05:39.810> that<00:05:40.080> when<00:05:40.200> you<00:05:40.350> do<00:05:40.470> this

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
day I figured out that when you do this

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.950 
day I figured out that when you do this
the<00:05:42.120> teacher<00:05:42.360> can<00:05:42.720> still<00:05:43.020> actually<00:05:43.230> see<00:05:43.860> you

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
the teacher can still actually see you
