possibilities but in the end none of the

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.710 
possibilities but in the end none of the
ideas<00:05:40.340> felt<00:05:40.610> fleshed<00:05:40.940> out<00:05:41.120> enough<00:05:41.420> for<00:05:41.570> it<00:05:41.690> to

be that much fun and it pains us to say
that<00:05:44.000> because<00:05:44.180> America<00:05:44.870> is<00:05:44.960> the<00:05:45.080> type<00:05:45.230> of<00:05:45.260> game

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
different development idea we want to

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.730 
different development idea we want to
encourage<00:05:49.730> the<00:05:50.540> visuals<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.170> audio<00:05:51.500> the

setting and the concepts are all solid
but<00:05:54.560> the<00:05:54.680> execution<00:05:54.950> falls<00:05:55.520> short<00:05:55.790> as<00:05:56.030> it

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
but the execution falls short as it
