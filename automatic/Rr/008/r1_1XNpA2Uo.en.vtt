thing<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.660> means<00:02:54.780> we<00:02:54.990> can<00:02:55.140> get<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.290> large

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
thing it means we can get a large

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.080 
thing it means we can get a large
keyboard<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.430> also<00:02:56.610> means<00:02:56.940> we

keyboard on that and it also means we

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
can get a nice big trackpad as well so

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.760 
can get a nice big trackpad as well so
potentially<00:03:00.540> it's<00:03:00.810> all<00:03:01.020> worth<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.350> little<00:03:01.620> bit

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770
