00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.730
 hair was thrown all beautiful in the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.820
 neck up has to leave such 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.010
 braces on lap 30 because another and 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.170
 Sergio will depend on how much I go 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.500
 get your head around 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.810
 if she can lower her head 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.769
 way that along the death line 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.050
 neonatal stay perfect glory was or 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.160
 parallel to the ground however a good piece 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.500
 solo 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.360
 if I can do it 35 for the world 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.300
 some reason they can not lower the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.600
 head is more a natural position 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.219
 back and 37 but the tendency is that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.360
 People have to make the head 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.980
 part to force with 30 and 37 is a 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.710
 variant of the skin 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.649
 this variant that will forget a little 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.410
 the real image then uses the ideal is that 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.570
 Whoever heads down here. 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:04.260
 but if I did not get it with my 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.180
 patient and 37 low - head 30 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.100
 the head gets a little more imposing 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.299
 that it is no longer the long 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.159
 In particular, Lyon can be 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.960
 So how can we find my 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.020
 Head I'm going to use 30 degrees down a thunderbolt 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.479
 central and thus directs 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.960
 approximately 16 centimeters above the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.259
 table now warlike eyebrow 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.200
 about four fingers 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.420
 depending on the hand 3 god some neighbor 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.710
 in the beginning of the hair but if 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.710
 Bald ride is dead 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.220
 legal information lets you know if 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.610
 all is well positioned to head 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.710
 the central ray at right slope and 6 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.219
 above the glabella is that the extension 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.350
 from the ray he passes the next moment well 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.920
 if it has 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.189
 being means everything has worked 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.860
 there the centralism here with the possibility 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.959
 extension of the beam line and 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.209
 with animation obeying the contours in the 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:17.720
 skull 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:22.400
 around the big is what it calls if 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.190
 the person to the digital method 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.310
 only it is more common simply 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.100
 believe in beauty he can ask 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.170
 alone this method or as three 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.550
 skull positions that we do 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.190
 stepped off 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.900
 but the most lethal profile here is 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:46.730
 is good for the volume of skull and 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.850
 especially here on the motorcycle lightweight skull 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:56.090
 and lightweight and lightweight one 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:58.600
 traumatic brain injury and believe in 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.600
 rigid stretcher 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.600
 ah
