may have noticed that this chassis is

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.420 
may have noticed that this chassis is
called<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.269> EVGA<00:04:00.569> had<00:04:01.019> drawn<00:04:01.349> air<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:02.310> that

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
called the EVGA had drawn air and that

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.610 
called the EVGA had drawn air and that
is<00:04:02.519> because<00:04:02.819> EVGA<00:04:03.209> will<00:04:03.360> have<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.750> water-cooled

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
is because EVGA will have a water-cooled
