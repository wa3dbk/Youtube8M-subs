 Edward Gal Andersen Burger Gallant Dressage 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.960
 we are halfway through the event the drentse championships dressage course with 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.499
 name 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:11.209
 what so impressed to be few things 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:12.819
 not technically 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:14.449
 nevertheless went well 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.060
 and we are in a beautiful location with good ones 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.919
 events for transportation 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.900
 what are your findings so far 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.140
 years so far have to say it pleases well and of course it is on every one 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.259
 contest things that I think I can maybe better that could be better 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.400
 but of course there is so much that needs to be arranged here and with all 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.270
 participants that you have and the ones who are cats what things that maybe what 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.290
 could be better 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.810
 but i have to say the area is that the loots are the beautiful ones 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.270
 yes for us it all looks great 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.560
 how do you see the future of the mountain championship you see that on old photos 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.350
 well as far as I'm concerned because I think it is always very beautiful and environment here 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.460
 super and with such silent in the background 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.890
 and okay maybe some small things have to be adjusted here and there 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.820
 to make it even more interesting also for the riders that so got it 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.350
 have the feeling that it is a championship emma and that his things are there 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.930
 of course always something to do and there is a lot of harm for the organization 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.900
 actually want to cooperate with all possibilities so 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.150
 for me his power concerns staying here 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.150
 So that means we actually have some sort of procession it doesn't matter 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.060
 do if you have to make up for the things 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.530
 to be improved and that of next year application 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.000
 yes I am there it seems and it is this ideal gadgets that was there 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.760
 also one this can still hurt you a little that you have this with every one 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.299
 contest 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.060
 as a nk it is of course very important that it is all super 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.259
 for each other there tent I think your possessions I think three years or so and yes 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.149
 Do you know that it also needs some time before you really get all that 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.890
 have each other but so far it all looks very good 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.610
 and what would you actually do for next year then 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.060
 want to see it differently it is an example after maybe they are for example 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.390
 all finals in the main ring could do that is 80 years 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.940
 still nice for the people and also for the riders that is the idea they have 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.400
 do both in the preliminaries and then in the main ring all the finals it is already one 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.860
 very difficult natural impasse so that must see if that is possible in the bath 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.980
 but something that I think will be very nice for the list 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.840
 between what you were right about the surplus 2012 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.329
 the alley as far as I am concerned that they are the dea 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.059
 I think it is very important that we have Russians
