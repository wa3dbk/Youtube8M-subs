the<00:00:26.160> weather<00:00:26.279> Swiss<00:00:26.640> researchers<00:00:27.269> have

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the weather Swiss researchers have

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.359 
the weather Swiss researchers have
succeeded<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.050> using<00:00:28.320> technology<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.859> promote

succeeded in using technology to promote
cloud<00:00:29.699> formation<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.539> theory<00:00:30.840> believe

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
cloud formation and in theory believe

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.630 
cloud formation and in theory believe
that<00:00:31.470> they<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.740> use<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.980> technology<00:00:32.309> to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
that they can use that technology to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.760 
that they can use that technology to
trigger<00:00:32.850> rainfall<00:00:33.300> or<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.809> at<00:00:34.110> sea<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.440> know

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
trigger rainfall or out at sea you know

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.040 
trigger rainfall or out at sea you know
like<00:00:35.010> not<00:00:35.280> over<00:00:35.700> inhabited<00:00:36.420> land<00:00:36.450> but

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
like not over inhabited land but

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.299 
like not over inhabited land but
underneath<00:00:37.320> then<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.829> know<00:00:37.920> what<00:00:37.980> I'm<00:00:38.100> saying

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
underneath then you know what I'm saying

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.950 
underneath then you know what I'm saying
where<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> water<00:00:38.910> already<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> people

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
where the water already is and people

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.510 
where the water already is and people
are<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.290> if<00:00:40.379> they<00:00:40.469> succeed<00:00:40.890> scientists<00:00:41.370> think

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
are and if they succeed scientists think

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.040 
are and if they succeed scientists think
they'll<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.730> able<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.000> keep<00:00:42.120> rain<00:00:42.450> away<00:00:42.480> from

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
they'll be able to keep rain away from

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.750 
they'll be able to keep rain away from
big<00:00:43.200> events<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.559> know<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.829> weddings<00:00:44.280> parade

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
big events you know like weddings parade

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.810 
big events you know like weddings parade
or<00:00:45.620> other<00:00:46.620> big<00:00:46.860> events<00:00:46.890> did<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.489> imagine<00:00:47.610> if

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
or other big events did you imagine if

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.979 
or other big events did you imagine if
you<00:00:47.879> had<00:00:47.910> enough<00:00:48.180> money<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.510> keep<00:00:48.629> rain<00:00:48.960> away

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
you had enough money to keep rain away

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.290 
you had enough money to keep rain away
from<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.500> wedding<00:00:49.739> day<00:00:49.890> that's<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.760> new<00:00:50.969> level

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
from your wedding day that's a new level

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.330 
from your wedding day that's a new level
of<00:00:51.360> luxury<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.710> technique<00:00:53.100> has<00:00:53.129> been

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
of luxury and this technique has been

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.369 
of luxury and this technique has been
used<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.969> control<00:00:54.270> lightning<00:00:54.750> as<00:00:54.870> well<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
used to control lightning as well and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.689 
used to control lightning as well and
rolling<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> weather<00:00:55.829> was<00:00:56.010> attempted<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
rolling the weather was attempted at the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.610 
rolling the weather was attempted at the
2008<00:00:57.210> Beijing<00:00:57.570> Olympics<00:00:57.960> when<00:00:58.170> scientists

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
2008 Beijing Olympics when scientists

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.290 
2008 Beijing Olympics when scientists
apparently<00:00:58.949> fired<00:00:59.160> chemical<00:00:59.699> into<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> sky

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
apparently fired chemical into the sky

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.819 
apparently fired chemical into the sky
to<00:01:00.329> disperse<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.020> clouds<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> opening

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
to disperse the clouds for the opening

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.709 
to disperse the clouds for the opening
ceremony<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.489> called<00:01:02.699> cloud<00:01:03.059> seeding<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
ceremony it's called cloud seeding and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.359 
ceremony it's called cloud seeding and
it<00:01:03.809> should<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.140> called<00:01:04.320> something<00:01:04.860> way<00:01:05.070> cooler

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
it should be called something way cooler

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.670 
it should be called something way cooler
really<00:01:06.180> should<00:01:06.510> see<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.840> involves<00:01:07.260> firing

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
really should see it involves firing

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.190 
really should see it involves firing
silver<00:01:08.070> iodide<00:01:08.310> or<00:01:08.970> dry<00:01:09.299> ice<00:01:09.510> into<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.840> cloud<00:01:10.049> in

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
silver iodide or dry ice into a cloud in

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.649 
silver iodide or dry ice into a cloud in
order<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.560> make<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> rain<00:01:11.070> rain<00:01:11.850> yeah<00:01:12.360> it's

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
order to make it rain rain yeah it's

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.600 
order to make it rain rain yeah it's
produced<00:01:13.140> some<00:01:13.350> mixed<00:01:13.590> results<00:01:13.740> now<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> team

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
produced some mixed results now a team

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.160 
produced some mixed results now a team
from<00:01:14.729> Geneva<00:01:15.090> will<00:01:15.299> use<00:01:15.450> lasers<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> try<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
from Geneva will use lasers to try to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.320 
from Geneva will use lasers to try to
get<00:01:16.350> water<00:01:16.650> condensation<00:01:17.159> or<00:01:17.580> ice<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.090> form

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
get water condensation or ice to form

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.179 
get water condensation or ice to form
again<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.900> end<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.259> really<00:01:19.530> lame<00:01:19.740> storm

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
again the end of a really lame storm

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.460 
again the end of a really lame storm
they<00:01:20.670> should<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:20.850> call<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> Halle<00:01:22.140> Berry

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
they should just call it the Halle Berry

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.499 
they should just call it the Halle Berry
method<00:01:23.280> yeah<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> past<00:01:24.240> they<00:01:24.479> have

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
method yeah but in the past they have

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.600 
method yeah but in the past they have
made<00:01:24.810> progress<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.409> these<00:01:25.680> experiments<00:01:26.130> get

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
made progress in these experiments get

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.940 
made progress in these experiments get
this<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.119> laser<00:01:27.390> action<00:01:27.960> led<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> strong

form<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:38.310> still<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> big<00:01:39.090> step<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.750> guys

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
form but that's still a big step so guys
