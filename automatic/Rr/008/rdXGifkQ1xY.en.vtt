Europa<00:00:02.490> is<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.850> most<00:00:03.060> likely<00:00:03.510> place<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.290> find

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
Europa is the most likely place to find

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.670 
Europa is the most likely place to find
life<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.609> our<00:00:05.819> solar<00:00:06.000> system<00:00:06.540> today<00:00:06.779> because

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
life in our solar system today because

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.520 
life in our solar system today because
we<00:00:07.859> think<00:00:08.040> there's<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.370> liquid<00:00:08.639> water<00:00:09.030> ocean

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
we think there's a liquid water ocean

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.919 
we think there's a liquid water ocean
beneath<00:00:10.530> its<00:00:10.710> surface<00:00:10.940> and<00:00:11.940> we<00:00:12.090> know<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.750> on

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
beneath its surface and we know that on

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.680 
beneath its surface and we know that on
earth<00:00:13.190> everywhere<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.610> there's<00:00:14.820> water<00:00:15.150> we

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
earth everywhere that there's water we

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.680 
earth everywhere that there's water we
find<00:00:15.900> life<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:17.070> could<00:00:17.369> Europa<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
find life so could Europa have the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.900 
find life so could Europa have the
ingredients<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.619> support<00:00:20.460> life

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
ingredients to support life

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.480 
ingredients to support life
we<00:00:21.539> might<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:22.020> actually<00:00:22.830> looking<00:00:23.130> at<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> body

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
we might be actually looking at a body

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.210 
we might be actually looking at a body

there<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.550> too<00:00:29.760> much<00:00:29.910> evidence<00:00:30.570> right<00:00:30.990> now

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
there is too much evidence right now

were for a spacecraft that would orbit

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.960 
were for a spacecraft that would orbit
Europa<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:04.260> Europa<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.010> bathed<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.939> a

instead<00:01:12.720> we're<00:01:12.960> looking<00:01:13.290> at<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> mission<00:01:13.799> that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
instead we're looking at a mission that

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.609 
instead we're looking at a mission that
will<00:01:14.040> orbit<00:01:14.430> Jupiter<00:01:14.670> make<00:01:15.420> close<00:01:15.960> flybys<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
will orbit Jupiter make close flybys of

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.070 
will orbit Jupiter make close flybys of
Europa<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.340> then<00:01:17.939> zip<00:01:18.390> out<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> high

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
Europa and then zip out of the high

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.560 
Europa and then zip out of the high
radiation<00:01:19.530> region<00:01:20.159> kind<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.880> when<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> was

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
radiation region kind of like when I was

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.330 
radiation region kind of like when I was
a<00:01:21.630> kid<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.080> had<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.409> sprinklers<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.189> we

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
a kid we had the sprinklers and we

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.859 
a kid we had the sprinklers and we
didn't<00:01:23.520> want<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.909> too<00:01:24.240> close<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
didn't want to be too close to the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.630 
didn't want to be too close to the
sprinkler<00:01:25.290> head<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.830> would<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.340> would<00:01:26.460> run

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
sprinkler head so we would we would run

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.340 
sprinkler head so we would we would run
in<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.119> get<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> little<00:01:27.420> water<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.960> then<00:01:28.110> run

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
in and get a little water and then run

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.710 
in and get a little water and then run
back<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:28.710> again<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.700> allows<00:01:30.060> us<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
back out again this allows us to have a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.109 
back out again this allows us to have a
mission<00:01:31.049> that's<00:01:31.200> many<00:01:31.590> years<00:01:31.920> long<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.549> to

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
mission that's many years long and to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.600 
mission that's many years long and to
collect<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.810> transmit<00:01:34.110> lots<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.280> lots<00:01:35.460> of

collect and transmit lots and lots of

collect and transmit lots and lots of
data<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:36.780> Europa<00:01:37.140> orbits<00:01:37.590> Jupiter<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.220> flexes

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
data as Europa orbits Jupiter it flexes

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.420 
data as Europa orbits Jupiter it flexes
and<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.479> could<00:01:39.689> measure<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.500> gravitational

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and we could measure the gravitational

and we could measure the gravitational
change<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.720> Europa<00:01:43.229> by<00:01:43.560> encountering<00:01:44.369> Europa

remote sensing instruments we would
image<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.350> surface<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.009> would<00:01:53.159> interrogate

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
image the surface we would interrogate

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.700

the<00:01:53.880> surface<00:01:54.240> with<00:01:54.450> spectroscopy<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.439> we

the surface with spectroscopy and we

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.080 
the surface with spectroscopy and we
would<00:01:55.829> do<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> same<00:01:56.100> thing<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> way<00:01:56.880> out

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
would do the same thing on the way out

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.910 
would do the same thing on the way out
and<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.659> would<00:01:57.810> essentially<00:01:58.290> rinse<00:01:58.710> and

and we would essentially rinse and

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.639 
and we would essentially rinse and
repeat<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.460> do<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.030> many<00:02:00.360> many<00:02:00.630> times<00:02:00.719> until

Telescope<00:02:07.750> tells<00:02:08.750> us<00:02:08.990> that<00:02:09.200> Europa<00:02:09.590> might<00:02:10.310> be

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
Telescope tells us that Europa might be

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.510 
Telescope tells us that Europa might be
erupting<00:02:10.880> plumes<00:02:11.690> of<00:02:12.080> water<00:02:12.319> high<00:02:12.890> into<00:02:13.250> space

if<00:02:13.940> that's<00:02:14.870> true<00:02:15.290> then<00:02:15.740> we<00:02:16.010> could<00:02:16.280> fly<00:02:16.670> through

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
if that's true then we could fly through

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.850 
if that's true then we could fly through
those<00:02:17.300> plumes<00:02:17.660> with<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.050> spacecraft<00:02:18.620> and

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
those plumes with a spacecraft and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.949 
those plumes with a spacecraft and
literally<00:02:19.250> taste<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:20.150> understand<00:02:20.810> the

does that work exactly we'll have enough

exactly<00:02:31.010> how<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.790> mechanisms<00:02:32.540> would<00:02:32.900> work

exactly how the mechanisms would work

subsurface ocean ropa is so important

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.310 
subsurface ocean ropa is so important
