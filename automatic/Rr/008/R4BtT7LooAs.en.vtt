annual<00:00:51.420> deal<00:00:51.810> you<00:00:52.020> do<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.260> once<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.560> year<00:00:52.850> most

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
annual deal you do it once a year most

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.400 
annual deal you do it once a year most
of<00:00:53.970> us<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.300> started<00:00:54.690> working<00:00:54.960> cattle<00:00:55.140> we

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
always this is probably what set the

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.220 
always this is probably what set the
hook<00:00:57.450> for<00:00:57.720> most<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.020> us<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> brandies<00:01:00.230> Parker
