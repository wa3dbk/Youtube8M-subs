00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:50.120
 but in general the missions that we have to 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:55.039

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.409

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.810
 the bright side I'm still playing for 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.689
 the bright side let's look at 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.130
 missions so roll codes to enter which 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:41.090
 we are sometimes offered to enter continue 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.929

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.749

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.510
 but what about and I don't even know how to play and 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.770
 Leo com starcraft, that is, someone needs 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.990
 internet connection 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.760
 but we will not do it all we 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.620
 let's just go to the tattoo planet 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.450
 click on the second mission which i am not 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.710
 passed here are tasks 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.970
 here on the endi defense vata save the pilot and 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:27.300
 find cotton in 50 seconds 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:31.320
 let's start the mission video insert 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.750
 missions here are our times this robot 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.530
 connected waters some pupils here 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.570
 Jedi 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:43.530
 without swords swords from them pam took this 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:46.520
 scoundrel and robot Jedi shorter well who 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.450
 are present in the film and all the animated series 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.459
 so here is the beginning of the mission 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.830
 find march push so we are 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.980
 below how you see the bonus of us 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.269
 is on top that is us now 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.760
 in a lightning way you need to get to 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.880
 center to get lightning fast 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.239
 Well, in principle, you can wear I do not 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.930
 I know even a soldier or something let's put on 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.160
 him soldier 5 pieces just soldiers 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.580
 move faster 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.620
 a little bit in my opinion and these robots and 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.799
 the fact is that the soldiers and automatic 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.500
 fire we move up well judging by 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.320
 the map needs to move exactly up to 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.519
 bonus targets and bonus target this is exactly 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.100
 this cotton 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.930
 so here I do not know now we are about this 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.650
 and find out so moving up enemies i 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.019
 don't see yet 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.650
 together a variety that is, we need 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.950
 control the robots sometimes we control in 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.000
 so here is the infantrymen all this is possible 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.150
 crossings tower 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.560
 change yes there is a motorcycle and these 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.709
 here that were in this cartoon 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.440
 in the film there is also even 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.410
 star ships that we can too 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.560
 build and the same on the map 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.840
 move around destroying all enemies so 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.450
 seems to be moving we do n't know correctly 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:17.239
 am I a passage here or not therefore a wall yes 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.600
 here guys wall i don't know how her 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.120
 overcome altogether how do we get to 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.250
 this bonus goal ok let's go 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.410
 move down and get to 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:33.110
 The main objectives on the map are all indicated 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.570
 on the bottom left we see our currency for 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.720
 currency we hire warriors we change warriors there 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.169
 as you like there on the right above the map and 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.700
 there fell for it all minimalist and all 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.870
 understandable to ordinary 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.900
 players this point that these are broken 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.540
 who lived here such heaps but if for 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.690
 little girls we get coins 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:01.310
 useful in the construction of warriors so 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:07.190
 to honor her find hell yes oh well 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:09.440
 I unfortunately have not yet found that 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.410
 I like of course what if the warriors 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.750
 Somebody sees such balls 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.460
 they automatically shoot at them and not 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.890
 need to send them there to shoot 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.190
 unlike robots robot need 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.669
 show exactly where to shoot and what 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.169
 enemies eliminate first very tags 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.580
 page 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:33.310
 so I almost went there 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:36.590
 let's move a little to the left 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:40.210
 let's guys something not stuck in this 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.210
 need to get stuck need to move 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:47.860
 this body of a warrior can be different with you 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:54.029
 there is even an iodine teacher with whom 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:57.129
 fight against these invaders 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:06:02.770
 craftsmen who strive for you 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:07.360
 close up between the eyes is better well between 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:11.879
 blaster so we move we even you 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:19.270
 go closer to your goal 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:22.680
 went love this embroidery with a 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.659
 satellite dish we can naturally 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.589
 eat life so you need to protect 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:31.389
 you from 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:35.009
 on the dashboard it's not a problem then ours here 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:35.009
 troops settle 

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:50.680
 here they are these gold coins , those who 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:52.659
 Do upload loves most is not well, and I 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.800
 I will continue to come wonderful 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:57.069
 star wars game 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:01.439
 why not trying to save ask 

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:01.439
 practical tasks and a bunch of common tasks 

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:07.419
 let's say now there is this you under 

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:11.740
 protect the cub 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:17.189
 this is a door open on my cap from 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.189
 pregnancy only there probably 

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:22.199
 having an hour of motorcycle cinema and hire 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:35.180
 ferry and what does not like this dough on 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:56.120
 cycle and they very quickly move well 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:58.820
 and homemade pilaf around here is a goal well 

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.290
