00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.109 
these games when they're half off or
less<00:01:27.520> because<00:01:27.759> I<00:01:29.189> use<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.340> box<00:01:30.490> as<00:01:30.729> i<00:01:30.850> turn<00:01:31.000> the

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
less because I use the box as i turn the

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.670 
less because I use the box as i turn the

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.150 
39 38 Andrea and her bunny and 239 32
andreea<00:02:09.820> stage<00:02:10.179> they<00:02:11.140> stay<00:02:11.350> interesting<00:02:11.980> the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
andreea stage they stay interesting the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.690 
andreea stage they stay interesting the
bunny<00:02:13.090> set<00:02:13.450> has<00:02:13.690> less<00:02:14.110> pieces<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.890> actually

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
bunny set has less pieces I actually

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.190 
bunny set has less pieces I actually
think<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> more<00:02:16.750> valuable

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
think this is a more valuable

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.680 
think this is a more valuable
it<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:19.099> know<00:02:19.340> it's<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.580> same<00:02:19.819> price<00:02:20.000> range<00:02:20.239> as

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
it you know it's the same price range as

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.790 
it you know it's the same price range as
the<00:02:21.020> stage<00:02:21.530> it's<00:02:21.890> got<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.910> rabbit<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:24.230> few

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
the stage it's got the rabbit and few

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.619 
the stage it's got the rabbit and few
more<00:02:25.510> harder<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.599> find<00:02:26.780> colors<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.830> pieces<00:02:28.340> and

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
more harder to find colors of pieces and

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.610 
more harder to find colors of pieces and
then<00:02:30.489> this<00:02:31.569> Mandalorian<00:02:32.569> battle<00:02:33.110> pack<00:02:33.319> that's

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
then this Mandalorian battle pack that's
