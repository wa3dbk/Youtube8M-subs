00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.129 
connective tissue so alcohol is useful
there<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.150> there<00:03:15.269> are<00:03:15.299> a<00:03:15.449> lot<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.780> elite

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
there and there are a lot of elite

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.439 
there and there are a lot of elite
strength<00:03:16.650> athletes<00:03:17.099> who<00:03:17.250> do<00:03:17.459> use<00:03:17.699> alcohol<00:03:18.209> as

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
strength athletes who do use alcohol as

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.379 
strength athletes who do use alcohol as
a<00:03:18.599> pre-workout<00:03:19.729> so<00:03:20.729> you've<00:03:20.879> got<00:03:21.060> all<00:03:21.090> those

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
a pre-workout so you've got all those

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.210 
a pre-workout so you've got all those
psychological<00:03:22.199> components<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.680> consider<00:03:23.040> and

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
psychological components to consider and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.949 
psychological components to consider and
then<00:03:23.370> there's<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.790> energy<00:03:24.150> perspective<00:03:24.569> and

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
then there's the energy perspective and

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.509 
then there's the energy perspective and
this<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.169> one<00:03:25.319> of<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.500> reason<00:03:25.799> alcohol<00:03:26.310> has

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
this is one of the reason alcohol has

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.789 
this is one of the reason alcohol has
been<00:03:26.699> used<00:03:26.970> historically<00:03:27.090> for<00:03:27.810> centuries<00:03:28.530> by

not<00:04:28.330> millennia<00:04:29.789> but<00:04:30.789> you<00:04:30.879> don't<00:04:31.029> see<00:04:31.210> anyone

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
not millennia but you don't see anyone

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:32.550 
not millennia but you don't see anyone
talk<00:04:31.629> about<00:04:31.659> it<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.139> thought<00:04:32.289> I'd<00:04:32.469> be

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
talk about it so I thought I'd be

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.469 
talk about it so I thought I'd be
interesting<00:04:33.009> to<00:04:33.099> bring<00:04:33.219> it<00:04:33.400> up<00:04:33.550> just<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.300> see

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
interesting to bring it up just to see

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.659 
interesting to bring it up just to see
what<00:04:34.689> people<00:04:34.840> think<00:04:35.199> and<00:04:35.439> to<00:04:35.740> create<00:04:36.430> some

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
what people think and to create some

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.820 
what people think and to create some
interesting<00:04:36.909> conversation<00:04:37.810> all<00:04:38.529> right<00:04:38.650> guys

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
interesting conversation all right guys

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.230 
interesting conversation all right guys
but<00:04:39.009> that's<00:04:39.099> really<00:04:39.370> all<00:04:39.490> I<00:04:39.610> have<00:04:39.879> to<00:04:39.999> say<00:04:40.029> on

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
but that's really all I have to say on

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.189 
but that's really all I have to say on
that<00:04:40.360> today<00:04:40.659> I<00:04:40.689> hope<00:04:40.930> it<00:04:41.080> has<00:04:41.169> been

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
that today I hope it has been

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.800 
that today I hope it has been
informative<00:04:41.349> and<00:04:42.249> I<00:04:42.969> will<00:04:43.180> talk<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:43.629> guys

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
informative and I will talk to you guys

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.230 
informative and I will talk to you guys
next<00:04:44.139> time<00:04:44.370> but<00:04:45.370> let<00:04:45.520> me<00:04:45.639> give<00:04:45.789> you<00:04:45.879> guys<00:04:46.060> the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
next time but let me give you guys the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.800 
next time but let me give you guys the
bicep<00:04:46.599> shot<00:04:46.840> before<00:04:47.169> I<00:04:47.289> go<00:04:47.499> oh<00:04:51.509> not<00:04:52.509> by

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
bicep shot before I go oh not by
