 willing to contribute to the cost of 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.309
 defense some governments however 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.340
 already trying to get off the hook 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.510

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.730
 countries this statement apply to us 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.010
 NATO countries should fulfill mutual 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.870
 commitments all countries of the alliance should 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.879
 contribute to the creation of new forces fast 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.570

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.170
 forces that can quickly respond to 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.090
 call problem . 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.250
 we must create as soon as possible

 command centers and control centers in 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.210

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.130
 front 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.470
 what is this strange which the State Department 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.810
 assigns the role of forward clear by active 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.790
 build groups of NATO not only 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.939
 around ukraine poland bulgaria and romania 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.799

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.350
 the main part is sent from bases to 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.810
 western europe else 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.710
 Directly from the United States are mainly tanks

 Estonia doubled compared with 2013 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.549
 year Russian tracking systems 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.479
 register flights of combat aviation NATO 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.149

 naval group 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.770
 it is necessary in parallel increases 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.780
 number of land contingent in 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.730
 Mostly these are American instructors 2 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.370
 armored ceiling which 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.830
 based in german physics but here 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.570
 now from us from base court carson to them 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.110
 guide specially prepared 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.290
 officers 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.720
 4 infantry divisions to perform some 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.060
 strategic tasks apparently it just 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.230
 talking about new command centers over and 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.590
 eastern europe 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.630
 about which the gant president was talking 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.090
 us next week intends to convince 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.490
 congress increase by 35 billion 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.640
 dollars military budget sixteenth 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.800
 year it should be 534 billion and 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.120
 only 51 billion of them 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.520
 allocated to the fight against the militants 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.530
 Islamists and Taliban wherever they go 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.270
 the remaining money becomes clear if 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.190
 look at the rapidly growing 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.780
 NATO troop activity near 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.700
 Russian borders in Poland and 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.440
 baltic scale building 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.350
 American military presence in 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.500
 Baltics already transferred even 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.709
 sabotage units of us intelligence 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.660
 report of dmitry petrova atlantic 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.100
 determination so called mission which 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.130
 set in motion the NATO troops 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.360
 ships and airplanes in europe in poland and 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.400
 Baltic countries right now 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.860
 ends rotation takes over on 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.620
 duty battalion 2 armored 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.110
 the regiment from the base in German physics seems to be 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.959
 little things but soon they will join more 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.030
 100 military experts from the 4th Infantry 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.980
 divisions they will take on a common 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.810
 command of the american land 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.890
 units in central and 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.620
 eastern europe 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.780
 and this is a strategic task started 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.180
 US military equipment transfer 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.400
 tanks and armored personnel carriers total about 50 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.780
 units officially for training but on 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.730
 in fact, this is the initial stage 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.730
 so for an external observer, he is 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.480
 doesn't look too big but important 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.000
 understand those intermediate phases that 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.090
 eventually lead to the fact that 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.690
 territories of former Soviet republics 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.210
 the Baltic states and in Poland will be created 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.430
 hit 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.960
 and groups of troops and it’s all as if 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.010
 in accordance with current 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.010
 arrangements 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.530
 in terms of letter agreement 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.820
 Russia-nato not deploy on 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.880
 permanent basis 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:30.160
 forces in the eastern regions they supposedly 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.980
 comply because rotation occurs 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.860
 but from the point of view of Russia it turns out 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.860
 constant presence of naval 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.570
 aviation and land groups 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.760
 near the borders of Russia and who asks 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.160
 It’s not us who is moving to Europe 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.530
 NATO members are increasing and air force 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.380
 forces in lithuania and estonia and poland also 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.330
 formally on rotational terms are on duty 16 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.370
 Allied fighters are engaged 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.110
 monitoring and maintenance of our 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.430
 military aircraft along the air borders 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.310
 alliance countries 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.620
 This is according to the documents if we talk it in 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.710
 Estonia this time literally 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.960
 a few minutes is for 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.990
 crossing the border with Russia and to 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.600
 St. Petersburg for about 10-15 minutes 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.430
 in this case Polish and Italian 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.100
 airplanes are capable of carrying 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.830
 free fall atomic bombs which 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.080
 These 200 are located in Europe 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.010
 American from the moment it creates 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.610
 threat to Russia direct from the king and 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:36.070
 back daughter of Smolensk or Moscow 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.870
 15-20 minutes ice every three months, the Poles 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.520
 together with the Americans conduct exercises 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.920
 on the transfer of personnel to 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.960

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.630
 sky over central and eastern europe 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.560
 standing ovation in the Baltic and 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.140
 the mediterranean seas 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.710
 there are three tactical combat groups 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.660

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.670
 one exercises after another spend 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.650
 land units are the most 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.250
 large-scale maneuvers took place in October 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.630
 in Poland 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.129

 under the cover of which will act 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:18.189
 other more serious units
