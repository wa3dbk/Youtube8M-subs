00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
got a nerf and now he's done to 257

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.609 
got a nerf and now he's done to 257
speed<00:01:31.850> which<00:01:32.509> most<00:01:32.810> cats<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.409> you're<00:01:33.500> going

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
speed which most cats that you're going

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.749

but because cats have such strong beast

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.149 
but because cats have such strong beast
offense<00:01:43.369> they<00:01:43.729> tend<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.350> make<00:01:45.350> short<00:01:45.710> work<00:01:45.920> of
