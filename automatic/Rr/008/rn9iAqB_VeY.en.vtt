00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello and welcome on 20minutes of art 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.350
 mark your aromatherapy minutes 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.880
 today we are going to talk about 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.990
 angelic and that's why we 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.309
 let's go up see the angels 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.820
 I took what I needed for 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.820
 to interview 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.560
 teacher 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.300
 a few minutes of waiting to talk 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.160
 already from the botany of this plant 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.840
 angelica is a plant of the family 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.670
 umbellifers that is to say the same 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.950
 family as cumin or fowl 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.660
 for example in this family this is a 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.670
 great it's a reigning effect 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.309
 m happy over its leaves are 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.270
 80 cm willingly and I made you 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.160
 leaflets and then she has ten who does the 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.010
 wrist size hollow shaft 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.660
 Strangely beautiful season of flowers make 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.550
 gladly the size of a little hat 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.320
 it's a plant that grows in 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:14.729
 wetlands plon 10 wetlands 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.260
 in this end we were saying so she 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.030
 grows in wetlands where they 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.250
 easily descend his big 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.630
 roots its roots are harvested for 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.490
 him the essential they must be 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.290
 harvested before the ripening of the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.479
 seed which makes it a bit more expensive 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.070
 since the ripening of the seed 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.450
 a peak that could be made of oil 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.700
 essential with greece 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.049
 of angelica both are made and of 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.399
 can not be done from one and the same 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.560
 plan 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.270
 its roots it has to invoice 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.310
 for three years on the plant and 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.289
 then it takes three tons of water 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.840
 level well yes 3 tons to make a 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.009
 only kilo of essential oils 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.420
 express themselves explains the price sometimes a 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.170
 bit high of essential oils 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.170
 in geniki 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.299
 some delays due to snow then 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.100
 posing to talk again about this 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.500
 plant 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.330
 in 15 110 by at 16 there used to 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.319
 to fight the plague of Milan 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.780
 pressed on its properties 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.640
 immunostimulants these are properties 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.440
 also used by doctors of the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.050
 middle ages indeed they had in 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.120
 general says the little necklaces like that 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.560
 of angelica around your neck you have some 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.020
 pieces of root that was chewing 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.880
 among patients this flora is 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.920
 also used in baking it 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.050
 uses the petiole this is the task of the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.000
 leaf on the stem this petioles should 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.950
 to be boiled twice to remove the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.450
 toxicity is recognized elsewhere in 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.100
 these pastries the taste of oil 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.810
 essential in genic 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.670
 but be careful do not do it yourself 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.530
 not only must we say two 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.120
 times to avoid toxicity but she 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.769
 looks like a lot of other plants from 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.690
 the same family including plants 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.390
 toxic salma like hemlock 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.810
 others waiting for us to 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.810
 take off 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.260
 silence 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.900
 as we approach the antibois of his 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.190
 own ideas will feed from that of 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.030
 its essential oil 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.319
 a basically g 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.790
 basically turned to our hearts 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.550
 she is first cardiotonic in 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.680
 that is to say, she wanted to 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.150
 then the corners in italy is at 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.890
 to say that they like dilate the arteries 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.350
 in the East 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.970
 and then adaptogenic girls level of 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.470
 blood pressure 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.959
 that is, she is here and here 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.310
 the attention that we were too much to see 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.810
 the voltage in this one is too low 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.610
 we will explain all that we 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.040
 indicates the faces and ariane 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.300
 but she is also sedative 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.250
 immunostimulant guy told me so and 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.480
 digestive for the poor and 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.300
 that it will be used for studies 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.220
 I made this very good choice indeed 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.580
 the ecological effort granted by plant 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.980
 preserve his job emergencies yesterday at 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.140
 his first cardio of europe on a 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.140
 recessed fruit 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.020
 no 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.170
 at the level of chemistry it's a 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.540
 essential is also very 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.700
 interesting and that she understands it's 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.080
 yet a little near monterrey 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.570
 makes so much sense of quite 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.950
 lenglen about 20% of the pine forest 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.180
 a dozen or more of 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.950
 landrel packages she's full of 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.710
 molecules are much more peaceful 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.360
 even frankly g so we see 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.160
 especially stones to our marine tastes 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.660
 like the ferrone embellishment and then 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.180
 furans with navy necks like angelism 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.500
 also called he observed you wool but 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.390
 also molecules a little bit more 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.460
 rare like lactones in this case 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.960
 the so- called style or stalin like the 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.780
 little does come valid that is contained 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.800
 in his breech at this one risk because he 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.050
 there is no particular toxicity 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.280
 known to him the main danger in 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.800
 effect though some may have it 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.720
 counting up to 5% of flu gives a 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.130
 it is the terpene mill no 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.330
 to worry about and even at a 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.280
 pregnant woman and a toddler 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.629
 photosensitizers ie 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.759
 it must not be applied before 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.349
 to go to the sun or so the region 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.689
 driving essential oil should not 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.770
 be exposed to UV rays in the sun 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.040
 for twelve to twenty-four hours 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.040
 twitter is who 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.900
 a spike to structures like the 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.900
 Stakeholders will be updated 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.220
 this is for the episode of the day of my 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.840
 remark dot com I hope you 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.160
 will have liked this shoot in a few 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.870
 small square meters we will have 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.920
 nevertheless owed some wise men and talk about 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.420
 the angelic I hope she will have 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.250
 worked for your body for me 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.360
 this is the case I found an angel who 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.650
 already waiting for me at the airport 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.650
 See you soon in the next episode
