00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.899
 Hello, in this lesson we 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.630
 consider the issue of creating your 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:12.599
 bone character based on character 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.450
 template and so very comfortable we go le 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.160
 tricot of livelibry templates and already there 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.859
 ready characters 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.930
 but we don't want to use them we want 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.460
 based on these characters and make 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.550
 your characters and so we will find a vibe or 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.890
 This entry is Tongom Kim Plate and 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.239
 actually find a pattern here and here they are 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.989
 robe skeleton let's open I suppose 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:45.539
 I will take animals here a certain walking 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.860
 the animal is female and so run 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.649
 let's see that is this 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.140
 small animation there i want to do 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.230
 no one of your little man who will be in 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.210
 principle walk just as well therefore not 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.520
 i need to create it from scratch i can 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.460
 take advantage of burger trousers already 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.189
 proposed for me om template and so 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.860
 secret and for that we do well for a start 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:13.860
 I will not click on this connect button 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.630
 character set up fashion and abroad like mine 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.280
 a bone character was formed 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.439
 I will have him a warmer he was such 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.920
 the envelope for which was 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.780
 I created the animation itself now I'm in 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.240
 these envelopes, as it were, to draw 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.130
 your character and your business 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.290
 him instead for doggy 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.720
 let us do this with knowledge 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.650
 I will have a new level 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.159
 any 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.159
 but 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.890
 well, let's get down to drawing 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:49.400
 our ducks 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:52.010
 Well, we go into the shotgun mode and so here 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.090
 my dog I draw exactly skin on 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:58.040
 envelope duck well, given an approximate 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.690
 the proportions of this character are 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.610
 then I could naturally character myself 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.860
 increase decrease 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.280
 how it works with the layer but actually 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.530
 let's draw something and so but i 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.260
 presses so roughly that not particularly 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:19.940
 go so here i will have some 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:22.970
 Ways So I Draw, Paint, Draw 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.370
 her own character tail 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.140
 will be like this 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.060
 so paw well on paws go especially 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.540
 I will not bother doing these 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.540
 here is lanka 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.630
 so we create based on the template after 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.160
 substitutions are now done in essence but 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.360
 I will paint I will paint 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:56.020
 spike will be someone like that 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:58.560
 Flesh color assume and so here 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.970
 I was such a character 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.130
 we come back with you in planning 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:09.520
 scenes and so here she is on the show. 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.900
 our task is to drag our car 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.370
 now here in this block 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.060
 skin group to put next to the dock site 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.060
 what we will do now 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:26.890
 so here she is a duck dock site I actually 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.490
 disconnected saw my fishing rod now 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:35.050
 click on this mana button 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:40.780
 manipulator and actually how much 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:45.060
 frames going on animation we will increase by 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.060
 This is the number of frames life for jokes 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.350
 actually here is such an animation 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.500
 happened now let's see what 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.820
 do we actually got try 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:02.560
 disable not this setup 0 and see my 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:06.010
 look at the wheelbarrow as she weighed walks 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.980
 all the same way we can create our 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.950
 on the basis of already created that is already 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.419
 there are objects created look which 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.520
 already have certain effects 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:20.650
 run jump that is a release on the spot 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.490
 these objects draw your use 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.100
 in the animation in the time of people who are well 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.140
 so this lesson is over 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.580
 Thank you very much for your attention with you 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.580
