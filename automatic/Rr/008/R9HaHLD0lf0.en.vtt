 two samsung only recently became 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.279
 what to prove right and camera 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.089
 and this year they made the second 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.899

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.499
 previous and then smashed based 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:29.749
 camera 5 to the appropriate 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.850
 indexes to 20 differs from it 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.750
 very little just the shape of the buttons 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.770
 some changes in position breaking through 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.250
 key rate this 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.460
 the camera is a resolution of 406 megapixels a 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.049

 himaev with a resolution of 230 thousand points of life news network 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.470
 it is incompatible with the ruler like this 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.700
 as well as a good opportunity 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.280
 set up the camera for yourself what it means and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.750
 samsung camera based on pentax camera 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.190
 the fact is that about a year and a half ago 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.630
 samsung company 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.850
 agreement according to which company 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.910
 samsung share their experience in the field 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.979
 electronics 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.200
 Pentax company is one giant experience 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.429
 camera build camera samsung live in two 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:19.079
 color hardening ask sea showed 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.890
 advanced class and she's very comfortable 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.770
 deals 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.960
 including such work brother which 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.790
 laid around 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.020
 the shutter button is very convenient and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.490
 allows you to turn on cameras very 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.480
 operatively 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.830
 managing crystal camera 2 in front and 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.600
 behind 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.240
 what's the same speed increase 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.530
 of management 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.070
 the village is not in blocks 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.119
 there is no adventure mode on it 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.170
 scenarios they are hidden change 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.880
 but providing 9 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.770
 position 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.450
 here and I would call it of course guys not 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.190
 really wants to understand 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.450
 Of course the full set live Paz 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.259
 program takes precedence over and 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.020
 diaphragm is completely human 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.150
 here also prefer to lead in 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.380
 this case 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.619
 falling in such a way that some of them 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:01.910
 main less 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.920
 shutter speed and aperture priority 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.510
 at the same time in this case, recognition 7 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.580
 nobody's blizzard 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.490
 that is, the staff is still very and exposure 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.630
 diaphragm sensitivity 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.029
 is chosen so that 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.889
 come true to exhibit 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:14.809
 if usually excerpts he also 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:16.259
 located colleagues 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:17.419
 her regime 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:18.999
 cut sync for 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.459
 work with matches 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.889
 also on the cruiser live together 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.109
 the user will survive later 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.840
 Essence is the constructor mode 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.769
 you can 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:27.670
 to make 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.920
 building in advance and because it loves 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.879
 any moment 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.620
 what does the camera mean well you can say 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.419
 customize the matter is that 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:36.879
 value official but appointment 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.090
 what is happening you can build so you 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.039
 conveniently 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:41.779
 also the camera will be able to release well 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:43.499
 this image processing 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.569
 if committed which is called master 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.609
 pictures you can 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.059
 it builds on the following parameters 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:50.779
 Color tone 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.209
 pensioners make 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.010
 contract saturation and sharpness 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.239
 Putin's can this prevent 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.019
 preset 10 4 standard usually 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.420
 a bright portrait of the landscape, too, then you can 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.169
 build 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:02.449
 and there are two users 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.349
 Installations that you can structure 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.509
 of their own accord 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:07.580
 Of course the item is not amazing 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.300
 a simple listing would probably take 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.309
 the place of the role 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:11.719
 believe it 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.239
 probably the most gas camera 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.349
 film mirror 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.950
 to manage various all that u 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.999
 camera parameters 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.339
 a lot of buttons levers near the neck 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:22.419
 For example, 2003, metering is possible with 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.529
 using 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:24.979

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.359
 located around the mess 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.529
 there are also three positions 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:42.329

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.089
 MVD accurate focus yourself 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:46.959
 Navigation buttons are also used for 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.699
 setting various parameters 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.529

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.999
 she is also in a similar 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:21.479

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.039
 the collective cover however 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.949
 wide focal range 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.749
 from 18 to two hundred millimeters 

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:35.160
 versatile enough 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.770
 photo storage camera 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.590

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.710
 Kara spring 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.229
 hold the format and the judges of large volume 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.309

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:43.729
 from remarkable Astana 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.580
 4 board this camera is worth noting 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.060
 This is a reserve button which is set to 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.090
 the basis of the performance which allows 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.360
 in any mode use 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.470
 automatically determined 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.580
 exposure 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.379
 and an arab button which allows 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.400
 switch to shooting mode 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.199
 for consent mode 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.229
 I think the reason for disconnecting 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.860
 in this case we will see what is now 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.659
 see camera lens 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:10.759
 wishing to work in this chamber as follows 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.039
 way for this is taken 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.599
 exclusively fermentation which 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:14.470
 forms the composition 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.710
 matrix 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.880
 and then 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.120
 in order to make like a mirror 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.259
 starts up 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:20.979
 autofocus triggered 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.370
 all this is understood 5 kg case still not 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.370
 very quickly promptly 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:28.919
 he is not the main mirror 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.039
 camera rather tanzania 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.059
 and me in the camera what 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:36.079
 very customizable to do 

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:37.370
 good media 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.800
 The quality of the pictures this camera is satisfied 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.169
 which will reduce the risks of a lot of permission 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.050
 needs a lot of noise 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.740
 but in general, all at the level 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.740
 for shooting you can safely benefit 500 and 600 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.080
 6 400 is also a bit extreme 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.529
 can not use 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:57.559
 in a situation when necessary 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:58.909
 eighteenth lens 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:00.289
 enough 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.419
 he has a good movie 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.169
 sufficiently large distances that 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.189
 allows you to do macro photography though 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:08.439
 and not a macro lens 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:11.050
 there is some barrel for wide rubles 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.509
 but in general the general with our meters 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:15.159
 sent quite naturally 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:18.300
 Power colors in lenses 3 5 3 5 and 6 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.150
 photos from the patch of view this is of course 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.360
 very good indicative 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.240
 whale mock well supporters in 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.590
 a set of beaten 53 m place his aperture 4 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.439
 36 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:30.430
 for a two hundred meter whale 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.729
 these six are usually a bad indicator 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.749
 perhaps the only inconvenience is that 

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:35.289
 minimum distance 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.289
 focusing about one meter but 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:39.990
 optical quality is pretty good 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.560
 if you choose to mirror 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.469
 camera 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:43.529
 worth paying attention to 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:45.559
 samsung cameras are alive 20 

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:48.459
 this is a good photo opportunity pros 

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:50.299
 tremendous camera setting options 

00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:53.279
 under itself besides when buying it costs 40 something 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.099
 will be able to choose from the product of the body of two 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:56.449
 samsung shades
