00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.900
 hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.480
 welcome to a new video like many 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.450
 of you already know xbox 360 increased the 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.630
 capacity of your internal storage 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.619
 that is to say, one can already occupy a disk 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.659
 500GB hard either brand Microsoft 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.089
 or an external hard drive of a 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:24.849
 computer in my case what I did 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:27.699
 it was that he had a hard disk of a 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.979
 laptop that no longer occupied and only what 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.649
 What I did was buy a case for disk 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:35.860
 hard or a hard drive enclosure already 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.560
 you know these cost about 60 pesos this 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.120
 they sell them in mercadolibre and the only thing 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.710
 what you have to do is put the disk 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.930
 hard inside the casing and as 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.400
 using a usb cable you can connect your 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.920
 hard drive to your computer to a 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.880
 Xbox 360 console will realize 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:56.050
 here in the system I have a hard drive 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.910
 320GB right now is not me is not me 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.270
 detecting only the disk detects me 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.960
 hard of microsoft is the normal and the 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.040
 memories that obviously you still have to 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.800
 Customized set up for you the 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.360
 Detect the console with the new ones 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.820
 console and store updates 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.700
 360 you do not have to modify anything in 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.680
 case of an an external hard drive is 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.430
 say configure it and right now I'm going 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.650
 to show on my 320gb hard drive and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.870
 I'll connect it right now like I said 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.210
 I have a case in a case for 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.130
 external hard drive and I'm going to connect it 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.610
 using the USB data cable to 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.610
 console 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.370
 automatically right now it's going to 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.940
 detect 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.300
 and let's wait for it to detect it 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.430
 Let's see if right now I get it 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.700
 hardly reading and then right now it's not going to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.770
 take a long time to update the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.240
 storage devices of my 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.960
 console 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.500
 you just have to wait a bit for 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.310
 Detect me 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.020
 to see there is no longer updating 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.429
 as you realize I have a device 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.910
 usb of 298 still free is 320 but 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.240
 it will not detect everything 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.450
 the external hard drive 320GB you 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.170
 accepts 298 gigas 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.700
 and then you just have to not have 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.099
 you format it because many times you 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.310
 is going to ask that you need to format what 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.950
 you have to format and it's going to be ready 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.300
 to take care of the device and sevilla 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.340
 they realize that games come out and 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.250
 applications profiles leave me everything 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.110
 I can move anything to my disk 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.890
 this is my normal hard drive of the 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:48.730
 internal console in this case if I have 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.010
 some gears of war 2 and I want it 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.239
 send this 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.019
 to the hard drive this external is going to 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.760
 to accept 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.459
 I do not have to configure absolutely 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.110
 nothing from the external hard drive because 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.680
 with this updates you are going to 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.469
 easily detect 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.659
 and then if those who asked how 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.810
 it was because that is how it is easier to be 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.489
 on the computer configuring what 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.219
 tell the program it is easier 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.599
 buy a case and put the disk 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.969
 hard and connect the car with your reader 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.519
 360 using the usb cable and so it's more 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:26.280
 easy and it will detect you because your disk 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.689
 hard and you will be able to download games and 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.920
 It will be cheaper for you if you already 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.019
 you have the hard drive of some 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.389
 computer that does not only serve you 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.519
 you buy the case and it's going to work for you 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.930
 you are going to save a lot of money in 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.939
 place of being buying a hard drive 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.470
 Well, this is just advice 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:42.000
 that I give to all of you, I hope it serves you 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.400
