00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.730
 Hyundai brings a big one with the i40 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.010
 combo on the german market the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 competition is hard opel insignia ford 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.090
 mondeo and vw passat are good cars we 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.090
 want to see what the korean deaf 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.250
 visually I do not have to hide the 40 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.110
 you look fast and dynamic 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.120
 the front headlights the long line 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.280
 At the side that gives the carriage contour 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.290
 is not a comparison to the sonata 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.860
 the predecessor with his exhausted 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.860
 Soap design 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.060
 Law 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.720
 which hole does the boy tear into the 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.100
 Household cash for a little driver is 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.990
 maybe also the entry-level gasoline in 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.360
 the basic equipment interesting if 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.400
 a little extra lands you at 25,000 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.830
 a normal driver needs the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.930
 bigger this second equipment line 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.510
 in addition to a equipment package he 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.010
 lands at 30 32,000 euros 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.810
 But there is a lot of equipment for that 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:53.550
 on board and that makes the boy 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:54.510
 only in this price class 136 ps in 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.800
 the eco version 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.350
 we ask ourselves what we really want 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.880
 have 4.7 liters hyundai indicates 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.830
 you can call him around five 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.210
 actually move downtown and 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.210
 Of course, freeways are more 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.610
 With 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.450
 1 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.239
 Under the hood governs the voice of the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.340
 136 hp diesel that sounds 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.930
 sounder but an eco version is the 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.150
 engine expelled every splash 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.010
 been a passbook with you may well 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.930
 live the consumption values ​​are right 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.530
 but if you want more, you have to 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.530
 go competition 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.280
 theme feel good when you look at the scarce 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.020
 four years looks that's pretty is 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.820
 a few years ago, this is only possible at 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.600
 audi get in this now 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.580
 price range 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.470
 Of course you can say button switch 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.270
 also what the important where these are the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.650
 points the car actually hate 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.650
 and that's fun with the ireland 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.700
 what is there to the game 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.900
 this waives what the 32,000 euros and 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.970
 He brings a whole lot of equipment 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.519
 with among other things has a big one 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.579
 Navigation system with touchscreen with 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.459
 sound system with bluetooth connection with 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.950
 ipod connection and and and that gets 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.269
 one for this money so not elsewhere 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.829
 you have to be with a classy manufacturer 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.230
 anyway with quite different buzz for 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.700
 this equipment calculate who else 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.560
 can have more with jona that 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:05.910
 buy technology package then there is 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:05.910
 even a parking machine goes 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.840
 In june like this you have to be on the 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.090
 Do not lift the car park 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.709
 Ensures that good design and also 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.750
 The brand is reasonably solid 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.820
 meanwhile through the success of the suvs 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.710
 certainly synonymous with a 5 bmw or 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.020
 Of course, audi a6 can not keep up 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.020
 but they also cost much more 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.229
 Individuality exists only as 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.370
 package solution the boy will send the 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.990
 designs and with good ones 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.030
 equipment packages offered 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.979
 that would be more than enough ten years ago 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.210
 have been offer other manufacturers today 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.700
 but more 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.650
 who dare his car from an infinite 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.880
 to put together a number of possibilities 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.880
 wants to go before another 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.550
 What's up on interesting prices 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.440
 today, the customer alone is not enough 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.419
 expects more and hyundai gives a 5 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.919
 year warranty and on top of that all 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.530
 maintenance costs during this period 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.510
 compared to a normal offer so 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.590
 that makes a price advantage of 2000 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.590
 I think that's good 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.490
 what did you dive 40? 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.310
 a good price a worthy one 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.760
 Processing very good 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.890
 Equipment packages make him 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.540
 interesting only for rally pilots 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.390
 The motors do not provide enough fabric 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.520
 but for normal families and drivers the 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.240
 in the consumption of the heart is yes 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.240
 a very good offer
