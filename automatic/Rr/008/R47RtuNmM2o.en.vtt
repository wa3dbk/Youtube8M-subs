00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.615
Hello !!!

00:00:02.615 --> 00:00:05.300
My name is Dimitris and we are going to start a series of origami

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.693
For start I'm going to do some easy designs

00:00:07.693 --> 00:00:10.734
In order to be comprehensive even from younger ages

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:13.854
so at the end we will be able to decorate a wall in our home

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.200
good luck to everyone

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.250
we start with our first origami, a liitle dog, which is favourable by most kids

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.020
to make our origami easier and more beautiful,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.500
we're going to need pencil, rubber, ruler

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.554
and some other that we're going to meet in the process

00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:33.394
good luck to everyone

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:35.634
this the dog we are about to make

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.540
either in small or bigger size

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:42.449
21x21cm is the the big and 8,5x8,5cm the small one

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.089
they're made in different coloured papers and painted

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:58.174
we will use a A4 size paper

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.000
allready cutted in 21x21cm dimensions

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:04.754
which is approximately 85 gr

00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:12.295
and so we start, good luck kids

00:01:13.054 --> 00:01:14.734
we turn it like a diamond shape

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:17.095
we bunch it right in the middle

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.240
so as to create a triangle

00:01:24.954 --> 00:01:26.874
we bunch it and from this side

00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:29.335
to make an even smaller triangle

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.740
we open it and turn it exactly this way kids

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.120
now is the time to take our ruler and pencil

00:01:43.054 --> 00:01:44.974
we mark 11,5 cm from this side

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.000
and 11,5 cm that side

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.860
6 cm this side

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.040
and 6 cm this side

00:02:06.762 --> 00:02:10.442
we connect these marks by drawing a line with our pencil

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.600
same with this side

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.140
we turn it upwards

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.380
and dogear exactly over the line

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:43.574
and here we have our dog's ears

00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:46.085
we turn the origami backwards

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.520
and mark 2,5 cm

00:02:50.380 --> 00:03:02.620
let me here say that all markings are approximately and according to someone's favour

00:03:04.173 --> 00:03:06.033
we dogear from the point we marked

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.240
carefull notice so that the edge will face the center of the opposite side

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.794
we turn it backwards and we see our origami is done

00:03:13.794 --> 00:03:15.114
that was it, so simple!!!

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.600
from now on we have to paint and decorate it as we like

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.154
im about to show you a way

00:03:20.154 --> 00:03:21.854
you can do it this way if you like

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.180
otherwise you can use your imagination 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.460
we draw a straight line exactly at the center of our origami

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.940
we place our mark at 5,5cm

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.020
at this point i use a ruler with shapes

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.590
which has various circles of different size

00:03:47.255 --> 00:03:48.855
here i will draw the eyes

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.260
i allign the marks on the ruler, with the line i previously drawn

00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:57.275
I draw the first eye

00:03:57.275 --> 00:04:01.815
on the opposite side I draw the other one

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:04.958
this is the mark of 5,5 cm i drew before kids

00:04:08.334 --> 00:04:10.494
now i will put the pupil of the eye

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.260
and now i will draw the brows

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.120
not even half a circle

00:04:58.151 --> 00:04:59.591
now the dog of our nose

00:05:00.554 --> 00:05:02.074
we mark 2,5 cm this side

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.500
and 1,5 cm this side

00:05:12.124 --> 00:05:15.404
6 to 7 mm from one side and the same on the other half

00:05:16.754 --> 00:05:18.114
we draw our triangle

00:05:22.395 --> 00:05:23.195
and paint it

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.160
and so the nose is done

00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:31.911
now we're make the smile

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.720
this ruler is very helpfull

00:05:42.134 --> 00:05:44.614
now will draw the moustache of our dog

00:05:49.075 --> 00:05:52.595
and from now on we can freely ad anything we have in mind

00:05:55.075 --> 00:05:57.315
for example a spot on our dog's ear

00:06:03.274 --> 00:06:04.394
another one here

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.540
same on the other ear

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:46.209
our dog is ready kids, from this point you can ad anything you like

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:49.074
this is our first origami, I hope you liked it

00:06:49.074 --> 00:06:51.374
good luck to everyone

00:06:51.374 --> 00:06:54.949
see you again in a couple of weeks with our second origami

00:06:55.254 --> 00:06:57.294
goodbye!!!!!
