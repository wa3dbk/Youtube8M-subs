00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Dear subscribers, I recommend you 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.560
 the first and largest group on such 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.790
 famous marvel series 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.809
 as agents of the shield 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.089
 agent carter and daredevil enter us 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.310
 really enjoyed it without fools 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:24.029
 link in the description hello to all broadcasts 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:29.779
 segava where you watch the best channel about 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:33.000
 superheroes in the cis for 2014 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.980
 In the beginning I would like to say a few words about 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.059
 biographies of a great actor 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.309
 which is not yet 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.739
 Oscar in general I liked it 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.960
 more than for example the biography of bruce 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.090
 banner or barry allen but need 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.489
 understand that the adventure of these comrades 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.219
 I was not impressed at all 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.739
 chameleon look great potential 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.309
 but it is not implemented by the creators in full 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.910
 least 10 facts about dmitry's death 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.649
 Covey 1 Smerdykov is a stepbrother 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.799
 blood on the hunter 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.439
 he lived in his house 2 attempts to prove 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.950
 brother that he is stronger than his chameleon 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.450
 tried to beat the iron man 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.909
 disguised as captain america he 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.640
 I wanted to convince stark that he is 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.200
 real cop and that cap in the mansion 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.930
 avengers chameleon 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.689
 iron fell and entered into battle with 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.210
 rogers based base brawl lasted until 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.560
 as long as the giant man is not 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.390
 opened the chameleon 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.090
 incredible events 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.220
 especially considering the notorious ingenious 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.930
 intellect tony stark how is he not 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.570
 guessed during the battle 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.700
 that fights with a real cop because 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.580
 Smerdyakov is not as experienced 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.570
 fighter third chameleon tried to take 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.450
 the appearance of the Obama barracks but spiedy stopped 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.210
 scoundrels if I was a PR man 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.300
 Obama I would say that spida well done 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.909
 although no I would say that in fact 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.399
 Obama actually manually neutralized 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.310
 chameleon which in turn on 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.590
 him a heap and if i was a PR man 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.390
 Putin would have said that throughout 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.360
 visibility spiderman failed 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.519
 neutralize smerdyakova well hinting at 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.860
 that way you can somehow 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.380
 explain obama's behavior lately 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.900
 although there is no time better to wrap it up 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.840
 that the chameleon entered into a criminal conspiracy 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.760
 with a barrack actually with boracay who 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.390
 probably revealed this collusion yourself 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.880
 guess 4 character name is invented 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.420
 by combining the first and last name of two 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.920
 heroes of the last novel of Dostoevsky 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.560
 probably that is why the Russian surname 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.930
 in american comics finally look like 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.880
 on Russian 5 green goblin 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.870
 persuaded the chameleon to make two robots 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.030
 similar to Peter Parker's parents 6 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.730
 the time of one of the fights with the spider 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.610
 Dmitry fuck 0 and memories from 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.720
 childhood smerdyakov on them and began 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.299
 repeat the same phrase i'm not that 7 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.940
 chameleon put parker in jail and 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.299
 convinced that he was the writer herbert 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.940
 smith 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.730
 and the life of a spiderman is just 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.490
 sick imagination hacks and himself Dmitri 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.640
 at this time took the place of peter from 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.070
 how together with mary jane 8 chameleon 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.650
 confessed to Peter that after death 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.200
 brother he became his closest to him 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.680
 man peter parker he's the man 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.040
 In response, Dmitry laughed at the spider . 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.770
 impulse decided to throw off the bridge 9 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.310
 for a while the chameleon thought he was 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.770
 craven hunter 10 smerdykov iso step 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.160
 rabbis tried to resurrect sergey 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.260
 blood for this was necessary 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.990
 sacrifice spiderman on 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.630
