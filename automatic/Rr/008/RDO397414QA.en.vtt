 Templar who will win me and this 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.370
 is that there are people who are not very 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.850
 smart in this world I do not know 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.850

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.220
 of weird stuff 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.670
 God please tell me that you are not 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.670

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.540
 son of your mother 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.730
 ok what does it matter if the battle starts? 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.730
 and die to the fart all 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.970
 begins and begins 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.150
 the battle begins in favor of the 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.370
 Templars the battle is in the field 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.250
 of the aerosols 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.490
 wow was like that of the other chapter 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.910
 so this please think that of the other 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.240
 chapter or that is the color is that not 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.729
 I remember if I source the zombies and good 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.100
 important was like the other chapters 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.310
 without counting the first and see this by 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.310
 favor 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.120
 and that's how the Templars win the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.430
 battle 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.430
 by God I do not understand how they do that 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.030
 let's see he's not fighting anymore I've already said 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.650
 several times they are fighting because over 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.490
 all the archers is that the archers 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.490
 They do this 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.470
 they want to hit him 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.450
 tosomeone 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.149

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.130
 I want to hit that horse, I do not know 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.570

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.500

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.110

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.640
 I forgot but this always happens to me 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.190
 I always say it tomorrow and neither does the other 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.840
 Wednesday I will go up bad world I already 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.240
 I know I have not climbed bad world 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.240
 many days already I know that as a media 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.480
 to you 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.410
 I grabbed everything I could grab and good 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:05.130
 while I'm doing this, I'm saying 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:08.220
 so I was going to say that the video 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.850
 that follows from the bad world this has me 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.850
 a little problem 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.530
 so sometimes he's already in the 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.319
 program product that I use when the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.129
 video is very long I start to upload 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:27.540
 well it's going up when the field 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:31.170
 when I have a video that lasts more than 40 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.319
 minutes and I upload it by means of qantas already 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.409
 you sing and him when he is short 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.049
 good for what happens to the 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:43.379
 50 average penis when a video in the 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:47.010
 average 50 the temple you sing and 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:49.470
 when I'm uploading the video has already advanced 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.629
 the person the second part because there 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.760
 two parts in which he sings if he has 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.500
 succumbed then when I'm already 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.189
 people like half of the second 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.200
 part stops me and tells me the video does not 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.880
 it could go up blah blah blah not 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.880
 I understand why soon 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.240
 but good 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.620
 something very very strange and now yes and good 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.490
