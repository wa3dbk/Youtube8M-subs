why<00:00:53.050> cats<00:00:53.469> develop<00:00:54.219> this<00:00:54.339> particular<00:00:54.550> form<00:00:55.269> of

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
why cats develop this particular form of

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.450 
why cats develop this particular form of

thoughts include the fact that when you

thoughts include the fact that when you
look<00:01:00.039> at<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.249> behavior<00:01:00.399> of<00:01:00.850> cats<00:01:01.089> with<00:01:01.719> how

look at the behavior of cats with how

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.719 
look at the behavior of cats with how

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
fast it is they are with licking

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.459

the time that their oral cavity becomes

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.550 
drooling weight loss loss of appetite
and<00:01:54.399> sometimes<00:01:55.299> even<00:01:55.539> a<00:01:55.780> little<00:01:56.049> bit<00:01:56.200> of<00:01:56.289> blood

saliva and the reason that this occurs

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.349 
saliva and the reason that this occurs
is<00:02:02.049> because<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:03.369> cats<00:02:03.609> start<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.179> develop

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
is because the cats start to develop

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.599 
is because the cats start to develop
difficulty<00:02:05.079> in<00:02:05.200> eating<00:02:05.560> their<00:02:06.130> tongues<00:02:06.399> don't

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
work as well as they should so instead

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
of being able to swallow their saliva it

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.030

is then a surgeon will likely go in and

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
increase the sensitivity of cancer cells

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.649 
increase the sensitivity of cancer cells

to the effects of radiation making the

chemotherapy and cats as well as

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.610 
chemotherapy and cats as well as
radiation<00:04:22.729> has<00:04:23.120> very<00:04:23.360> few<00:04:23.599> side<00:04:23.810> effects

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620

radiation has very few side effects
and<00:04:24.710> in<00:04:24.830> fact<00:04:24.979> 95%<00:04:25.699> of<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.330> cats<00:04:26.570> that<00:04:26.810> we

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
and in fact 95% of the cats that we

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.020 
and in fact 95% of the cats that we
treat<00:04:27.229> with<00:04:27.410> chemotherapy<00:04:27.590> actually<00:04:28.370> have<00:04:28.790> no

side effects whatsoever the major reason

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.219 
side effects whatsoever the major reason
for<00:04:31.729> that<00:04:31.940> is<00:04:32.150> that<00:04:32.300> cats<00:04:32.540> don't<00:04:32.840> know<00:04:33.020> they

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
for that is that cats don't know they

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.020 
for that is that cats don't know they
have<00:04:33.380> cancer<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.010> so<00:04:34.400> they<00:04:34.850> don't

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
have cancer and so they don't

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.080 
have cancer and so they don't
psychologically<00:04:36.020> have<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.680> same<00:04:37.090> baggage

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
psychologically have the same baggage

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.750 
psychologically have the same baggage
that<00:04:38.570> a<00:04:38.930> person<00:04:39.380> would<00:04:39.560> have<00:04:39.590> if<00:04:40.160> they<00:04:40.729> were

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
that a person would have if they were

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.700 
that a person would have if they were
undergoing<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.630> same<00:04:41.840> sort<00:04:42.110> of<00:04:42.229> treatment

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710
