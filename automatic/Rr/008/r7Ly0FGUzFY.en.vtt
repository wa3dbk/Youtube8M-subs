80 dribbling and he's got some good

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.619 
80 dribbling and he's got some good
defense<00:02:31.370> that's<00:02:31.610> actually<00:02:31.970> free<00:02:32.180> air<00:02:32.360> left

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629

but<00:02:32.780> with<00:02:32.870> 75<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.950> he<00:02:34.129> costed<00:02:34.489> 3600<00:02:35.360> coins<00:02:35.569> in
