00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.580
 2 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.150
 and good morning to all and nec of cases and 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.830
 we are today with the map 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.200
 mind map rainbow rhodes 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.000
 then the rainbow road the road to 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.500
 the rainbow some will know everything 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.620
 what it is because in 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.300
 done it's a resumption of one of the races 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.160
 of mario kart those who do not know 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.420
 so the rainbow road you go 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.640
 to see it's absolutely beautiful we're going 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.840
 go see that right after but already you 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.030
 start here so here it'll be your 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.100
 your spawn point so sometimes you 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.600
 go to show I show you you 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.460
 can appear on the platform on 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.839
 the sides so do not hesitate to you 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.159
 put in creative to start because 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.559
 that me each time I appeared a side 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.390
 and coming in creative by flying everything 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.799
 simply 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.299
 madam in dance is in this area of 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.430
 spawn so she's a little bit small 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:04.850
 and suddenly in sometimes we are we are at 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.470
 side of this area forgiveness and so so 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.479
 it's going to be the map mannequinat mind map 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.530
 rainbow rhodes and it's going to be some races 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.210
 from mein because simply 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.680
 so like in a mario kart you 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.090
 will be able to recover objects in 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.350
 course of road then it's not easy 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.240
 however, because you have to succeed 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.409
 press the button on the road no 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.990
 we'll see it right after we're already going 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.220
 start by reading the rules so like 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.360
 once again one is the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.190
 holidays so the maps are not 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.890
 translated but I tell you the rules to 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.780
 the oral like that you can see them and 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.780
 know them before you start 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.870
 in the race 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.420
 just then this map is better than 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.820
 the races with pigs his 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.110
 doctors in jailers 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.400
 a year this map is much better when 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.900
 we run with pigs on the other hand 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.000
 with pigs it's not easy because 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.270
 that because to control them it's 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.220
 not easy then the goals you 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.230
 have to do three races in finis and 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.810
 finish first 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.180
 a first the cards are given to the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.710
 start line click on the button 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.510
 to choose your starting point 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.500
 then you clicked on the button and 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.270
 it'll give you a wool of a 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.100
 different color and you'll see in 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.600
 down when we go down this color 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.369
 aisne will give us the place where 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.200
 we will have to position ourselves only with our man 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.700
 map so here I am wool 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.680
 violet so we'll keep it we'll see 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.820
 we'll see after that then I do not know 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.560
 too much what is this xbox version 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.760
 so do not have two carrots playing each other 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.590
 and I admit that I have a little bit stuck 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.700
 does not have karaoui does not have a map 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.860
 believe that with pigs with the 40 we 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.810
 can make them go in the direction that we 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.150
 wants I think it's on pc but 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.050
 when there will be it zaps will date 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.050
 share in the map 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.890
 when that's when you're on the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.450
 route you can use the ten 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.070
 sponsors you'll see lady dee 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.740
 Spencer have a little bit of everything 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.380
 and who will give you give you 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.950
 item objects when you press 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.420
 on the button and who you 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.120
 will therefore slow down or 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.860
 hit a lot of opponents of the road 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.410
 each player each player each 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.730
 player must have a stack of arrows and 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.680
 steak on him so we'll take that 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.600
 it's just in the kop right next door and 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.150
 you will have arches in the ten 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.400
 sponsors so here is so we have to have 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.560
 a stack of arrows and a stack of 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.480
 meat well listen we'll go 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.680
 directly to the scene of hostilities 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.720
 so it's just below there you 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.610
 go down by falling so there I want 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.140
 it's much simpler since you 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.560
 get off by flying and so that's it 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.120
 the brand 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.950
 the amap pardon rainbow like you 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.560
 can see it from mario kart so that 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.350
 can be played up to 6 and you go 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.890
 to have your see eat the wool 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.760
 violet so I start here all in front 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.200
 so it's not because we're first 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.000
 that we will necessarily finish first and 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.050
 precisely because with the attacks of 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.959
 our opponents it will be rather 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.520
 complicated but now so you 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.400
 have the same cards here 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.080
 here you go where you 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.430
 should you place precisely in relation 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.170
 to the color that you would have had in the 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.000
 you will have had in the dispensary just 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.760
 on top you place your mac carthy 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.280
 this and the other of the party must support 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.620
 so whoever will be on the orange part 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.090
 or else the other simply that he 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.280
 will not play but who will leave us 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.360
 a little bit late must activate the 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.660
 little trick and you'll see we have a 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.510
 small yellow green red light system 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.400
 red yellow and green which is rather nice 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.010
 see who is going to really do that 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.080
 like mario kart what to send up and that's it 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.150
 here and there it's gone 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.530
 and in this case I go up in the same 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.180
 neighborhood after it's a race all to 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.840
 do it finally it's classic what but 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.940
 it's pretty good 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.890
 we really have this mario kart universe that 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.050
 is there with this rainbow rainbow road 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.030
 road which is really amazing of 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.650
 colors and here you are the little ones 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.880
 dispensaries here so we have to succeed in 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.490
 press the button there I did not succeed 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.000
 to be able to pick up items all the way 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.650
 along the road 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.970
 so there will be several like that 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.580
 and it's frankly it's not easy 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.390
 a trip never succeeded to tell you 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.860
 push the button 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.370
 so you have to be careful 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.780
 prepare her I still missed game 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.520
 for now I have about 0 forget 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.470
 so if you run against me one day 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.430
 I think you will be able to leave 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.500
 quietly because I you 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.960
 would not put a lot but here after 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.850
 massar of this rest of the race and we have 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.900
 all it is little pixel art of which we 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.540
 remind the mario universe that are 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.420
 really splendid I still missed 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.740
 it's okay so here you are 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.570
 have to do three rounds and that's the one 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.830
 who will arrive the first step that will win 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.300
 who will win the race 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.490
 go we try to have a small object 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.930
 before I leave you I do not have them 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.860
 had a good time again 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.600
 it does not matter anyway 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.040
 it was the rainbow road map I'm going 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.420
 continue my little tour 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.280
 so we're going to leave that way okay 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.780
 to be pretty good and in any case 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.180
 I hope you enjoy the map 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.169
 I 'm going to be there yes I managed to 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.700
 see there I had a canvas 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.190
 spider that I could throw at my 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.680
 competitors maybe if I get there a 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.690
 place and on their way 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.919
 to annoy them to slow them down so 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.620
 here are several things like that at 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.940
 do it rather well 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.500
 here I am putting myself of creative singing 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.030
 it does not do much to me so we 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.039
 I hope you will have liked the same 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.840
 I'll see you soon for 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:54.310
 next videos on discovery 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.310
 minecraft hi everyone
