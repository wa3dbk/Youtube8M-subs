this I hope that the buyer of this
bracelet<00:01:17.610> eventually<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.180> wear<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
bracelet eventually will wear is if the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.310

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
when when it is worn and I think if I
