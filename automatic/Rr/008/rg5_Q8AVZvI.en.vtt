00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:06.054
 I would like to know all of you closer 

00:00:06.054 --> 00:00:08.093
 but at one time it’s hard to meet so many people 

00:00:08.093 --> 00:00:09.074
 I'm alone, and you - a whole bunch 

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:11.072
 Therefore, I developed a special method 

00:00:11.072 --> 00:00:12.088
 "Moral Dilemmas". These are questions to which 

00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:14.082
 there is no one right answer 

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:16.066
 What you say will help me understand 

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.076
 what are you separately 

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:19.087
 and what are you as a group 

00:00:19.087 --> 00:00:20.074
 If everyone participates, the method will work. 

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:21.078
 All together we say: “Yes” 

00:00:21.078 --> 00:00:22.028
 YES! 

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:23.087
 All together: “No” 

00:00:23.087 --> 00:00:24.037
 NOT! 

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:26.029
 All together: “I have my own opinion” 

00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:28.027
 I have my own opinion! 

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.095
 Good 

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:34.018
 To start a little warm-up 

00:00:34.018 --> 00:00:35.056
 It will not affect the final result. 

00:00:35.063 --> 00:00:37.015
 Just make you feel how it works. 

00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:39.006
 If everyone will respond without thinking 

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.046
 it will be excellent 

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.096
 Can I kill a whale 

00:00:42.096 --> 00:00:45.017
 to save two pandas? 

00:00:45.017 --> 00:00:45.067
 YES! 

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:46.018
 Not! 

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:49.069
 Well, 90 percent say "yes" 

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.084
 Today you decided: "Yes, in the ass of this whale!" 

00:00:52.064 --> 00:00:53.084
 Someone said "Nooo!" 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.023
 Not? Good. Do not worry, this will not happen. 

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.012
 Our show will not end there. 

00:00:59.098 --> 00:01:01.058
 Although it would be fucking 

00:01:01.058 --> 00:01:03.021
 It is a pity that I did not think of it before. 

00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:04.072
 From recent answers to this question 

00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:05.067
 the best was such 

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:07.023
 I asked: "Is it possible to kill a whale to save two pandas" 

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:10.057
 And someone said: "They will fight the way and find out for themselves" 

00:01:13.068 --> 00:01:15.032
 All right, and now the question that 

00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:16.079
 I use to understand what my audience is, 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.055
 and who are my viewers individually. 

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:20.020
 It would be great if everyone answers 

00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:23.085
 Would you fuck your father to save mom? 

00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:27.031
 Not! 

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:30.075
 I do not understand why you are unhappy? 

00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:32.023
 It's easier for girls. 

00:01:33.073 --> 00:01:35.050
 She has a terrible dad! 

00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:36.044
 Scary dad? 

00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:40.086
 Just imagine if that was the real reason. 

00:01:41.014 --> 00:01:43.048
 And she thinks: “I could have fucked my father 

00:01:43.054 --> 00:01:44.062
 but, he is still not handsome 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.020
 “I stopped following myself. 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.016
 But five years ago ... " 

00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:52.012
 Would you fuck your father? 

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:52.094
 And he is here 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.078
 He is here? 

00:01:54.057 --> 00:01:55.056
 Hello! 

00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:03.078
 Is mom here too? 

00:02:03.078 --> 00:02:04.092
 Yes, she is here. 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:05.085
 Fine! Well, 

00:02:05.085 --> 00:02:08.017
 Finally, we will conduct a full-fledged experiment. 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.098
 My snipers are all over the corners. 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.072
 And they all aim at mom 

00:02:14.072 --> 00:02:17.052
 We want to kill her. She is hostage. 

00:02:17.052 --> 00:02:18.071
 We are going to finish it. 

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.080
 And we want you to fuck your dad. 

00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:24.044
 Um, it's hard. 

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:25.086
 Of course, this is not easy. 

00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:27.072
 I did not say that I expect a good erection, 

00:02:27.072 --> 00:02:29.057
 You can help shove your fingers. 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.021
 Okay, let her die! 

00:02:32.076 --> 00:02:34.050
 Do you agree that she died? 

00:02:39.057 --> 00:02:42.006
 Hey Hey! Wait a minute! We are not in Norfolk! 

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:43.040
 What do not you like? 

00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:45.087
 You resent that guy 

00:02:45.087 --> 00:02:47.019
 refuses to fuck father. 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.025
 Think about it 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.024
 Well, young man, you said your word 

00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:55.019
 Shh! Mom, listen Jimmy! 

00:02:57.027 --> 00:03:01.004
 All right, mom. Everything is good. 

00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:02.030
 Is this your daughter? 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.093
 Yes. 

00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:05.074
 Answer the same question. 

00:03:09.012 --> 00:03:11.075
 I love my job! 

00:03:11.076 --> 00:03:14.061
 I wonder what your family decided 

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:16.067
 “This is a wonderful show, let's all go together!” 

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:18.066
 "Who needs bullshit, like the" Lion King " 

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:21.036
 "Let's take the kids to a normal show ... 

00:03:21.057 --> 00:03:24.000
 where we can talk openly about incest 

00:03:26.034 --> 00:03:27.053
 And the best answer to this question was: 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.057
 "How?! Again?!"
