00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
you see on the bottom left of wolves is

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.039 
you see on the bottom left of wolves is
prowling<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.700> pack<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.180> wolves<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.479> prolly<00:01:06.689> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
prowling a pack of wolves is prolly and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.160 
prowling a pack of wolves is prolly and
then<00:01:07.200> once<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.369> shows<00:01:08.850> up

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
then once you do it just shows up

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.399 
then once you do it just shows up
failure<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.710> near<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> end<00:01:12.409> whereas

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
failure is like near the end whereas

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.050 
failure is like near the end whereas
avex<00:01:13.920> shows<00:01:14.220> up<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.200> yeah<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.799> think<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.000> is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
avex shows up so yeah I think this is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.310 
avex shows up so yeah I think this is
the<00:01:18.150> last<00:01:18.330> wave<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.720> didn't<00:01:18.930> realize<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> was

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
end that's two spots so we're it was

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.860 
end that's two spots so we're it was
like<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.519> lot<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.790> us<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.269> we<00:02:15.360> still<00:02:15.630> kind<00:02:15.780> of

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
like a lot of us and we still kind of

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.949 
like a lot of us and we still kind of
find<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.549> because<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:18.060> chest<00:02:18.360> doesn't<00:02:18.599> spawn

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
find it because the chest doesn't spawn

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.770 
find it because the chest doesn't spawn
in<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.440> same<00:02:19.650> place<00:02:19.940> they<00:02:20.940> spawn<00:02:21.299> all<00:02:21.540> around

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
in the same place they spawn all around

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.559 
in the same place they spawn all around
the<00:02:21.959> map<00:02:22.470> are<00:02:23.220> like<00:02:23.459> wherever<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:24.000> relevant<00:02:24.510> to

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
the map are like wherever is relevant to

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.690 
the map are like wherever is relevant to
the<00:02:24.720> map<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:26.700> i<00:02:27.890> think<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.130> where<00:02:29.430> he's<00:02:29.549> like<00:02:29.670> oh

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700
