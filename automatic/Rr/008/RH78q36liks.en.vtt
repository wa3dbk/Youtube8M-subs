00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
that spins connected to an impeller that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.160 
that spins connected to an impeller that
throws<00:00:50.579> water<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.360> how<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:51.690> water<00:00:51.870> gets

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
throws water that's how your water gets

throws water that's how your water gets
moving<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.100> your<00:00:53.219> pump<00:00:53.930> what's<00:00:54.930> happening<00:00:55.710> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
moving in your pump what's happening is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.240 
moving in your pump what's happening is
in<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:57.660> winter<00:00:58.109> you'll<00:00:58.500> get<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> lot<00:00:59.039> of

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
in the winter you'll get a lot of

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.369 
in the winter you'll get a lot of
corrosion<00:00:59.520> from<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> pump<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.989> sitting

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
corrosion from the pump just sitting

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.229 
corrosion from the pump just sitting
there<00:01:01.410> it'll<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.070> corroded<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.940> it'll

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
there it'll get corroded and it'll

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.230 
there it'll get corroded and it'll
almost<00:01:03.390> lock<00:01:03.960> itself<00:01:04.559> into<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.460> place<00:01:05.850> and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
almost lock itself into that place and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.870 
almost lock itself into that place and
the<00:01:06.960> reason<00:01:07.500> you're<00:01:07.619> hearing<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.310> humming

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the reason you're hearing that humming

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.149 
the reason you're hearing that humming
is<00:01:09.030> you're<00:01:09.630> hearing<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> electricity<00:01:11.010> go

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
is you're hearing the electricity go

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.390 
is you're hearing the electricity go
into<00:01:11.580> your<00:01:11.820> pump<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.990> your<00:01:13.140> pumps<00:01:13.619> froze<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
into your pump but your pumps froze to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.910 
into your pump but your pumps froze to
the<00:01:14.520> shell<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> motor<00:01:15.450> or<00:01:15.630> your<00:01:16.020> your<00:01:16.350> that

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the shell of the motor or your your that

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
the shell of the motor or your your that
copper<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.580> froze<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> shell<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
copper is froze to the shell of the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.020 
copper is froze to the shell of the
motor<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.439> won't<00:01:19.680> spin<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.820> you're

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
motor and it won't spin so you're

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
motor and it won't spin so you're
hearing<00:01:21.270> electricity<00:01:22.049> going<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.530> there<00:01:22.710> but

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
hearing electricity going in there but

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.010 
hearing electricity going in there but
the<00:01:23.040> pumps<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.759> motor<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.150> trying<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.720> spin

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the pumps the motor is trying to spin

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.320 
the pumps the motor is trying to spin
but<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.290> can't<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.700> got<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> bunch<00:01:27.210> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
but it can't you just got a bunch of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.899 
but it can't you just got a bunch of
corrosion<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:28.110> there<00:01:28.290> okay<00:01:28.890> again<00:01:29.640> this

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
corrosion in there okay again this

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.399 
corrosion in there okay again this
doesn't<00:01:30.299> mean<00:01:30.720> your<00:01:31.229> pump<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.770> dead<00:01:32.900> now<00:01:33.900> what

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
doesn't mean your pump is dead now what

doesn't mean your pump is dead now what
will<00:01:34.530> happen<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.549> tries<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> minute

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810

pump<00:03:31.690> you're<00:03:32.140> just<00:03:32.350> going<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.590> pop<00:03:32.830> that<00:03:33.510> round

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
pump you're just going to pop that round

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.110 
pump you're just going to pop that round
plug<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:35.950> speak<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.430> will<00:03:36.520> either<00:03:36.610> be<00:03:36.730> metal

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
plug so to speak it will either be metal

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.090 
plug so to speak it will either be metal
or<00:03:37.240> plastic<00:03:37.360> or<00:03:37.900> rubber<00:03:38.080> you'll<00:03:38.680> just<00:03:38.860> pop

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
or plastic or rubber you'll just pop

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.940 
or plastic or rubber you'll just pop
that<00:03:39.130> off<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.820> that<00:03:39.880> will<00:03:40.690> reveal<00:03:41.140> this<00:03:41.560> screw

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
that off and that will reveal this screw

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.710 
that off and that will reveal this screw
what<00:03:42.340> I'm<00:03:42.460> showing<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.880> is<00:03:43.000> how<00:03:43.240> to<00:03:43.270> reveal

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
what I'm showing you is how to reveal

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.840 
what I'm showing you is how to reveal
this<00:03:43.930> group<00:03:44.460> now<00:03:45.720> what<00:03:46.720> this<00:03:46.900> bolt<00:03:47.800> is<00:03:48.010> is<00:03:48.550> it's

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
this group now what this bolt is is it's

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.850 
this group now what this bolt is is it's
the<00:03:48.910> long<00:03:49.300> shaft<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.170> goes<00:03:50.380> all<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.710> way

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
the long shaft that goes all the way

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.010 
the long shaft that goes all the way
through<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.370> motor<00:03:51.610> that's<00:03:52.270> connected<00:03:52.990> to

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
through the motor that's connected to

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.290 
through the motor that's connected to
the<00:03:55.020> impeller<00:03:56.020> and<00:03:56.320> as<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.250> impeller<00:03:57.760> spins

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
the impeller and as that impeller spins

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.840 
the impeller and as that impeller spins
it<00:03:58.720> throws<00:03:59.230> water<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.980> that's<00:04:00.400> how<00:04:00.610> this

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
it throws water and that's how this

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.000 
it throws water and that's how this
works<00:04:01.150> so<00:04:01.450> this<00:04:01.960> is<00:04:02.140> a<00:04:02.170> shaft<00:04:02.440> that<00:04:02.620> goes<00:04:02.800> all

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
works so this is a shaft that goes all

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.890 
works so this is a shaft that goes all
the<00:04:03.040> way<00:04:03.160> through<00:04:03.580> on<00:04:03.760> this<00:04:04.150> shaft<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:04.780> has<00:04:04.870> a

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
the way through on this shaft it has a

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.870 
the way through on this shaft it has a
bunch<00:04:05.200> of<00:04:05.320> copper<00:04:05.740> wire<00:04:05.920> wrapped<00:04:06.310> around<00:04:06.490> it

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
bunch of copper wire wrapped around it

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.270 
bunch of copper wire wrapped around it
this<00:04:07.120> is<00:04:07.180> where<00:04:07.540> your<00:04:07.720> corrosion<00:04:08.320> is<00:04:08.530> so

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
this is where your corrosion is so

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.550 
this is where your corrosion is so
here's<00:04:09.580> what<00:04:09.850> you're<00:04:10.000> wanting<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.450> do<00:04:10.660> if<00:04:11.020> you

here's what you're wanting to do if you
get<00:04:11.710> a<00:04:11.770> flathead<00:04:12.400> screwdriver<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:13.420> you<00:04:14.080> try

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
get a flathead screwdriver and you try

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.789 
get a flathead screwdriver and you try
to<00:04:14.410> turn<00:04:15.010> this<00:04:15.630> you're<00:04:16.630> going<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:17.020> feel<00:04:17.470> the

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
to turn this you're going to feel the

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.120 
to turn this you're going to feel the
corrosion<00:04:18.400> inside<00:04:19.299> of<00:04:19.660> it<00:04:19.840> crunching<00:04:20.770> and

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
corrosion inside of it crunching and

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.940 
corrosion inside of it crunching and
trying<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.730> break<00:04:22.000> free<00:04:22.380> sometimes<00:04:23.380> it's

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
trying to break free sometimes it's

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.980 
trying to break free sometimes it's
going<00:04:24.130> to<00:04:24.190> be<00:04:24.280> really<00:04:24.580> really<00:04:24.970> hard<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.330> turn

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
going to be really really hard to turn

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.980 
going to be really really hard to turn
here's<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.770> more<00:04:26.979> of<00:04:27.069> the<00:04:27.160> story<00:04:27.539> if<00:04:28.539> you<00:04:28.780> can

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
here's the more of the story if you can

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.499 
here's the more of the story if you can
turn<00:04:29.229> this<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:29.860> break<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.430> corrosion<00:04:31.090> free

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
turn this and break that corrosion free

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.409 
turn this and break that corrosion free
you<00:04:32.349> can<00:04:32.590> get<00:04:32.800> your<00:04:33.099> pump<00:04:33.370> started<00:04:33.849> again<00:04:34.180> if

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
you can get your pump started again if

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.350 
you can get your pump started again if
you<00:04:35.289> try<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.620> turn<00:04:35.979> this<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.550> you<00:04:36.759> can't<00:04:37.060> break

you try to turn this and you can't break

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.240 
you try to turn this and you can't break
the<00:04:37.539> corrosion<00:04:37.870> free<00:04:38.319> or<00:04:38.530> you<00:04:38.740> can't<00:04:39.039> even

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
the corrosion free or you can't even

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.120 
the corrosion free or you can't even
turn<00:04:39.580> this<00:04:40.060> then<00:04:40.660> that<00:04:40.690> means<00:04:41.259> you've<00:04:41.650> got<00:04:41.680> so

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
turn this then that means you've got so

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.490 
turn this then that means you've got so
much<00:04:42.310> corrosion<00:04:42.610> you<00:04:43.539> can't<00:04:43.810> turn<00:04:44.050> your<00:04:44.110> shaft

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
much corrosion you can't turn your shaft

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.960 
much corrosion you can't turn your shaft
and<00:04:44.740> your<00:04:44.860> pumps<00:04:45.130> not<00:04:45.310> going<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.580> work<00:04:45.729> you're

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
and your pumps not going to work you're

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.159 
and your pumps not going to work you're
going<00:04:46.120> to<00:04:46.180> have<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.449> end<00:04:46.569> up<00:04:46.690> getting<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:47.020> new

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
going to have to end up getting a new

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.860 
going to have to end up getting a new
pump<00:04:47.440> okay<00:04:48.099> or<00:04:48.310> at<00:04:48.490> least<00:04:48.669> a<00:04:48.819> new<00:04:48.970> motor<00:04:49.240> okay

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
pump okay or at least a new motor okay

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.490 
pump okay or at least a new motor okay

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
this kick start in the pump if you can

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.589 
this kick start in the pump if you can
break<00:05:04.810> this<00:05:05.080> free<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.009> you<00:05:06.280> can<00:05:06.310> spin<00:05:07.030> this<00:05:07.270> to

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599 
break this free and you can spin this to

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.510 
break this free and you can spin this to
some<00:05:07.840> extent<00:05:07.870> what<00:05:08.590> you're<00:05:08.800> going<00:05:08.979> to<00:05:09.039> do<00:05:09.280> is

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
some extent what you're going to do is

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.960 
some extent what you're going to do is
try<00:05:10.210> to<00:05:10.270> plug<00:05:10.780> this<00:05:11.080> pump<00:05:11.830> into<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.370> outlet

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
try to plug this pump into the outlet

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.420 
try to plug this pump into the outlet
and<00:05:13.210> right<00:05:13.900> when<00:05:14.139> you<00:05:14.259> plug<00:05:14.560> it<00:05:14.710> in<00:05:14.889> you're

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
and right when you plug it in you're

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.600 
and right when you plug it in you're
going<00:05:15.639> to<00:05:15.729> spin<00:05:16.240> this<00:05:16.509> clockwise<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:17.770> that's

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
going to spin this clockwise and that's

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.969 
going to spin this clockwise and that's
going<00:05:18.909> to<00:05:19.000> help<00:05:19.210> kick-start<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:20.349> and<00:05:20.530> get<00:05:20.770> this

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
going to help kick-start it and get this

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.450 
going to help kick-start it and get this
thing<00:05:21.280> going<00:05:21.389> okay<00:05:22.389> so<00:05:22.630> if<00:05:23.349> you<00:05:23.500> can<00:05:23.710> spin<00:05:24.190> this

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
thing going okay so if you can spin this

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.219 
thing going okay so if you can spin this
thing<00:05:24.520> right<00:05:25.090> when<00:05:25.270> you<00:05:25.389> plug<00:05:25.690> it<00:05:25.840> in<00:05:26.020> and
