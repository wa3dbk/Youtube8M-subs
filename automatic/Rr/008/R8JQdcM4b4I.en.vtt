00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.660
 for my people here I bring you a new 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.690
 trick this time is call of duty 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.510
 advanced warfighter this this trick is 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.730
 to leave the map in mode 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.939
 survival and so long a lot 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.769
 mount a round button that here they 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.869
 I recommend that they catch or not 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.570
 I recommend you have to take the gun 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.720
 light the light gun the first one 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.420
 out is to catch the this nadal here 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.020
 we have to come and look for this area 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.940
 for here 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.890
 over here because around here and more or less 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.270
 is known on the map is here and here is 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.670
 Where it comes is here with the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.220
 pictures we stand in this little corner and 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.460
 fast we jump back until it 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.560
 lace here I'm playing and once 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.120
 lace we look for the right and 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.720
 we jump twice and we're going to 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.760
 prepare here is super easy if not yes no 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.260
 it comes out because they are shooting 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.660
 little things so I recommend you 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.180
 practice alone or play alone and 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.010
 that they practice so that they leave him but 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.330
 once they find you the trick is how 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.640
 I look how easy I am 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.369
 actually working is super easy 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.899
 here on the whole roof can pass 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.440
 rounds someone who are peeling the 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:21.000
 others are but it's super easy to kill the 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.560
 people from up here or not so easy 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.680
 because a little bit complicated and all of 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.080
 the aim and all those things but but 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.520
 they can do it from above nothing what 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.140
 we have to make them come to be 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.670
 here where is the helicopter and what 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.830
 we have to do is to throw ourselves towards 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.630
 helicopter so we have to have 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.360
 nothing helicopter we are going to die but what 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.149
 happens when we kill ourselves in that way 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.920
 let's do it 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.350
 invincible we will never learn 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.460
 because whenever they kill you 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.369
 they are not going to die 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.490
 look here I'm going to let myself 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.440
 kill and the other and I do not know if it holds 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.090
 more shot doing that looking I'm at 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.300
 principle was supposed to be in the 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.979
 floor and they do not kill me but look if I 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.470
 I was yes, if we were 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.140
 playing regular the regular way there 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.450
 when the floor arrives I get like that 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.310
 It loads a bar is like they give you 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.440
 an opportunity the first time 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.690
 there is because he is playing alone but the 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.010
 the second time it falls automatically it 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.480
 finish the game only give you two 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.150
 opportunities and for the second 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.030
 opportunity they kill you or in this case 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.550
 If they kill me , the game is over 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.560
 understand but look here do not finish the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.810
 game if it continues it never ends 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.370
 here in when I was playing the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.050
 game that was to teach him the round 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.870
 I'm going to go up a friend came in but look 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.030
 the friend that is on the floor and I wanted them 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.880
 show that even if your friend falls 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.440
 floor and you kill him not like you 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.390
 I explain that the game is not over 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.430
 suppose that when your friend dies 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.190
 truth and as I no longer save it 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.800
 he dies crowd and you die then 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.239
 already the game is over but look here the 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.310
 person died and I both died and 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.319
 we are still playing like he is 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.970
 in the game and minimum one of the 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.370
 question is that this will never die or 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.870
 it is dying but you will return to respond 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.940
 and the game is not over and so they will be 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.650
 all the rounds that you want and not 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.030
 matter what is the four friends shots 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.230
 they fall they go until the round that you 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.220
 want to see anything this is all the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.019
 trick I hope you liked it 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.730
 as always if you like it, like it 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.150
 comment subscribe and see you until the 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.150
 next
