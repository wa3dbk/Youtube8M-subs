00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.430
Hello friends, today we are going to show you how to install the Gitma Easy Grow Garden.
The Gitma Easy Grow Garden

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.429
It`s a great plant pot, that's easy to use and easy to reach at waist height with inbuilt water tank

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.340
and reservoir that collects rain water for irrigation. A decorative hand pump provides lots of water.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.630
it also comes with a sink and toolbox protected with a key to keep

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.630
your tools safe and clean.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.940
We are going to show you, step by step, the installation process of this Easy Grow Garden . You will see how easy it is!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.420
The Gitma Easy Grow Garden can be installed on any surface, gardens , terraces, roofs, balconies. Today we are going to install it on this terrace.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.629
It has a small area of turf, we have prepared these tables as a base.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.629
Now let's bring the pieces. The Gitma Easy Grow Garden will arrive, packed  for transport

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.860
on a pallet which is easy to unload. Once on the ground, the first thing to do is unpack it

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.860
and take the pieces one by one. You will need help for this, although as you can see, the pieces are

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.970
light weight and small enough to fit through all doors.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.500
Once all the parts are positioned on the surface

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.910
we will link all the modules to form the Gitma Easy Grow Garden. First we need to

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.470
prepare the seals, this is done by bonding the cylindrical foam profile

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.520
in the footprint of the connecting side. Now we piece the modules together

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.829
with screws, ensuring a tight fit. It is important to match the edges correctly

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.759
for this we can use a spirit level.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.509
Now let's connect the taps

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.799
To make assembly easier, we are going to turn the Gitma Easy Grow Garden over, and screw the fittings and the tap that we need

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.160
for the junction of the containers and the emptying of the tank. We need to choose

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.069
the  depth of water that can be stored according to the strength of your terrace or garden surface.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:24.069
Full or half full.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.000
All right, now let's do the pump. This beautiful hand pump lets us use the water stored in the tank

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:34.099
To install this first thread the pipe through the hole

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.500
which is in the base of the pump and fasten with screws. Next install

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.599
the sink filter that will let you recover the excess water,  and then the drain cap for

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:53.599
draining the sink. In the toolbox we are going to install the security key and the cover.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
With the Gitma Easy Grow Garden finished, it's time

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.569
to fill the garden with soil . First, fill the cones with gravel or other

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.040
inert filter material. Then extend the filter on the bottom

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.659
If your terrace or soil can only carry a limited weight, you can

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:28.659
fill part of the volume with lighter inert materials such as polystyrene.

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:42.269
Well, here it is, a Gitma Easy Grow Garden. Comfortable to use, natural, neat and clean. It is

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.190
available in a range of different sizes, to install in gardens, in schools as a school garden, residential, rooftop. Well,

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.189
anywhere you can imagine. Now I am going to start planting and create my own Gitma Easy Grow Garden
Bye everyone.
