00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
exaggerating about millions of punches

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.429 
exaggerating about millions of punches
from<00:01:44.939> guards<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.450> basically<00:01:45.869> well<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.409> is

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
from guards so basically well this is

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.170 
from guards so basically well this is
telling<00:01:46.740> us<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:46.950> they<00:01:47.040> go<00:01:47.189> way<00:01:47.490> back<00:01:47.850> they've

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
telling us as they go way back they've

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.630 
telling us as they go way back they've
probably<00:01:48.450> been<00:01:48.799> rivals<00:01:49.799> maybe<00:01:50.250> they've<00:01:50.490> been

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
probably been rivals maybe they've been

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.030 
probably been rivals maybe they've been
fighting<00:01:50.909> each<00:01:51.180> other<00:01:51.329> for<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.780> long<00:01:52.140> time<00:01:52.649> just

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
fighting each other for a long time just

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.830 
fighting each other for a long time just
constant<00:01:53.909> fighting<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.420> looks<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.659> they

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
constant fighting and it looks like they

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.330 
constant fighting and it looks like they
were<00:01:54.899> always<00:01:55.320> pretty<00:01:55.500> much<00:01:55.740> evenly<00:01:56.130> matched

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
were always pretty much evenly matched

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.179 
were always pretty much evenly matched
and<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.450> one<00:01:57.509> particular<00:01:58.380> time<00:01:58.979> he

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
and then this one particular time he

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.730 
and then this one particular time he
fought<00:01:59.460> garb<00:01:59.790> garb<00:02:00.000> managed<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.049> flatten<00:02:01.439> his

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
fought garb garb managed to flatten his

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.560 
fought garb garb managed to flatten his
head<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.549> ruined<00:02:02.909> everything<00:02:03.119> because

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
head and that ruined everything because

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.899 
head and that ruined everything because
it's<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.899> fucking<00:02:04.259> ice<00:02:04.680> Island<00:02:05.219> where<00:02:05.670> he<00:02:05.759> would

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
it's a fucking ice Island where he would

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.760 
it's a fucking ice Island where he would
break<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.600> ice<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> only<00:02:07.229> thing<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.469> break

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
break the ice and the only thing a break

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.529 
break the ice and the only thing a break
it<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.039> his<00:02:08.429> head<00:02:08.640> as<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> treasure<00:02:09.209> underneath

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
it is his head as a treasure underneath

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.510 
it is his head as a treasure underneath
so<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.080> pretty<00:02:10.470> much<00:02:10.530> ruined<00:02:11.009> everything<00:02:11.220> when

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
so it pretty much ruined everything when

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.870 
so it pretty much ruined everything when
don't<00:02:11.700> you

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880
