00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
definitely last all day so if you are

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.880 
definitely last all day so if you are
sensitive<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.940> sense<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:44.600> might<00:01:44.840> be<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:45.380> bit

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
sensitive to sense this might be a bit

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.740 
sensitive to sense this might be a bit
much<00:01:45.920> for<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.399> she<00:01:46.790> does<00:01:46.970> have<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.450> lighter

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
much for you she does have a lighter

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.230 
much for you she does have a lighter
since<00:01:48.200> like<00:01:48.409> lavender<00:01:49.009> vanilla<00:01:49.310> that's<00:01:50.180> a

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
since like lavender vanilla that's a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.029 
since like lavender vanilla that's a
little<00:01:50.479> bit<00:01:50.570> lighter<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.080> I<00:01:51.440> also<00:01:51.619> believe

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
little bit lighter and I also believe

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.270 
little bit lighter and I also believe
her<00:01:52.250> part<00:01:52.550> of<00:01:52.700> common<00:01:53.240> sense<00:01:53.479> as<00:01:53.869> well<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:54.860> this

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
her part of common sense as well so this

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.399 
her part of common sense as well so this
is<00:01:55.460> a<00:01:55.490> leave-in<00:01:56.060> conditioner<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:57.020> can<00:01:57.170> use<00:01:57.380> it

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
is a leave-in conditioner you can use it

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.359 
is a leave-in conditioner you can use it
as<00:01:58.130> their<00:01:58.640> or<00:01:58.970> act<00:01:59.119> like<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.300> daily<00:01:59.600> moisturizer

to<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.610> auto<00:03:47.210> oil<00:03:47.690> because<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:49.130> know<00:03:49.250> I've

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
to the auto oil because you know I've

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.600 
to the auto oil because you know I've
heard<00:03:49.670> that<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.150> argan<00:03:50.630> oil<00:03:50.900> is<00:03:51.200> not<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.620> greasy

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
heard that the argan oil is not a greasy

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.200

greasy<00:03:52.970> oil<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.810> very<00:03:54.110> light<00:03:54.530> oil<00:03:54.790> so<00:03:55.790> i

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
greasy oil is a very light oil so i

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.630 
greasy oil is a very light oil so i
think<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:56.840> where<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.650> can<00:03:57.890> still<00:03:58.160> get<00:03:58.490> the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
think that where you can still get the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.840 
think that where you can still get the
moisture<00:03:58.880> and<00:03:59.330> shine<00:03:59.720> without<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.850> greasy

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
moisture and shine without the greasy

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.160 
moisture and shine without the greasy
feeling<00:04:02.120> of<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:02.540> heavier<00:04:03.020> oil<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:05.720> of<00:04:05.960> course

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
feeling of a heavier oil and of course

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.870 
feeling of a heavier oil and of course
the<00:04:06.350> shea<00:04:06.530> butter<00:04:06.560> also<00:04:07.070> will<00:04:07.430> help<00:04:07.610> with

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
the shea butter also will help with

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.910 
the shea butter also will help with
definition<00:04:10.880> as<00:04:11.030> well<00:04:11.350> some<00:04:12.350> people<00:04:12.620> just<00:04:12.800> use

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
really did start to define my curls

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.920 
really did start to define my curls
especially<00:04:42.099> the<00:04:42.280> super<00:04:43.090> duper<00:04:43.389> hydrating

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
especially the super duper hydrating

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.129 
especially the super duper hydrating
hair<00:04:44.139> cream<00:04:44.500> my<00:04:45.190> curls<00:04:45.669> were<00:04:45.849> just<00:04:46.150> popping<00:04:46.419> I

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
hair cream my curls were just popping I

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.850 
hair cream my curls were just popping I
probably<00:04:48.069> can't<00:04:48.460> use<00:04:48.729> this<00:04:48.970> combination<00:04:49.900> if<00:04:50.620> I

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
probably can't use this combination if I

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.070 
probably can't use this combination if I
wanted<00:04:51.129> to<00:04:51.250> do<00:04:51.430> like<00:04:51.610> shingling<00:04:52.300> which<00:04:52.870> is

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
wanted to do like shingling which is

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.070 
wanted to do like shingling which is
basically<00:04:53.530> taking<00:04:54.490> small<00:04:54.819> sections<00:04:55.210> of<00:04:55.840> the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
basically taking small sections of the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.320 
basically taking small sections of the
hair<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.740> breaking<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.610> product<00:04:58.000> do<00:04:58.150> with

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
hair and breaking the product do with

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.839 
hair and breaking the product do with
your<00:04:58.509> fingers<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.139> define<00:04:59.470> your<00:04:59.680> curls<00:05:00.099> that's

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
your fingers to define your curls that's

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.420 
your fingers to define your curls that's
basically<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.449> process<00:05:01.750> of<00:05:02.229> shaping<00:05:02.500> so<00:05:03.099> I

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
basically the process of shaping so I

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.300 
basically the process of shaping so I
could<00:05:04.210> do<00:05:04.569> that<00:05:04.599> and<00:05:05.050> just<00:05:05.199> leave<00:05:05.560> it<00:05:05.800> in<00:05:06.039> like

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
could do that and just leave it in like

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.180 
could do that and just leave it in like
that<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.849> then<00:05:07.419> just<00:05:07.659> pineapple<00:05:08.530> it<00:05:08.680> at<00:05:08.860> night

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
that and then just pineapple it at night

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.460 
that and then just pineapple it at night
to<00:05:09.580> give<00:05:09.849> it<00:05:09.970> some<00:05:10.180> stretch<00:05:12.870> but<00:05:13.870> I<00:05:13.930> find<00:05:14.319> that

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
to give it some stretch but I find that

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.959 
to give it some stretch but I find that
if<00:05:14.710> I<00:05:14.889> do<00:05:15.180> twist<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.509> I<00:05:16.780> get<00:05:17.259> it<00:05:17.919> last<00:05:18.520> longer

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:18.969 
if I do twist it I get it last longer

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:22.980
