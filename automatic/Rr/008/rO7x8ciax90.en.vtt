millimeter<00:01:18.680> socket<00:01:21.190> if<00:01:22.190> you<00:01:22.460> turn<00:01:22.670> the

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
millimeter socket if you turn the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.389 
millimeter socket if you turn the
steering<00:01:23.210> arm<00:01:23.690> out<00:01:23.990> you'll<00:01:24.710> be<00:01:24.890> able<00:01:25.009> to<00:01:25.190> fit

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
steering arm out you'll be able to fit

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.160 
steering arm out you'll be able to fit
in<00:01:25.520> there<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.700> lot<00:01:25.970> better<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.540> not<00:01:26.899> struggle

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
in there a lot better and not struggle

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.400 
in there a lot better and not struggle
like<00:01:27.500> I<00:01:27.710> was<00:01:27.890> doing<00:01:28.190> here<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.960> just<00:01:30.170> crank

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
like I was doing here and just crank

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.770 
like I was doing here and just crank
them<00:01:30.590> off<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.130> those<00:01:32.119> are<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.360> only<00:01:32.509> two

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
them off and those are the only two

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.719 
them off and those are the only two
bolts<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:33.500> are<00:01:33.560> holding<00:01:33.680> on<00:01:34.280> your<00:01:34.490> brake

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
bolts that are holding on your brake

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:43.580 
bolts that are holding on your brake
caliper

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.190 

you

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.630 

so<00:01:51.200> once<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.500> get<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.770> two<00:01:51.950> bolts<00:01:52.430> on<00:01:52.549> the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
so once you get the two bolts on the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.760 
so once you get the two bolts on the
inside<00:01:52.670> of<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.180> brake<00:01:53.420> caliper<00:01:53.960> removed<00:01:54.409> the

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
inside of the brake caliper removed the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.609 
inside of the brake caliper removed the
next<00:01:55.040> step<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.490> going<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.030> be<00:01:56.500> alleviating<00:01:57.500> the

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
next step is going to be alleviating the

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.320 
next step is going to be alleviating the
pressure<00:01:57.920> from<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.369> brake<00:01:58.520> pads<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:59.119> the

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
pressure from the brake pads to the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.530 
pressure from the brake pads to the
brake<00:01:59.770> discs<00:02:01.149> you're<00:02:02.149> going<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.360> need<00:02:02.509> a

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
brake discs you're going to need a

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.230 
brake discs you're going to need a
screwdriver<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:03.409> place<00:02:03.740> on<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.070> outside<00:02:04.880> of

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
screwdriver to place on the outside of

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.820 
screwdriver to place on the outside of
the<00:02:05.479> brake<00:02:05.720> pads<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:06.350> you're<00:02:06.530> just<00:02:06.649> going<00:02:06.799> to

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
the brake pads and you're just going to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.880 
the brake pads and you're just going to
pry<00:02:07.190> them<00:02:07.369> inwards<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:09.229> then<00:02:09.350> once<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.739> put

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
pry them inwards and then once you put

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.650 
pry them inwards and then once you put
it<00:02:09.979> on<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.130> inside<00:02:10.429> pry<00:02:10.759> outwards<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.510> this

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
it on the inside pry outwards and this

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.270 
it on the inside pry outwards and this
is<00:02:11.780> going<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.020> leave<00:02:12.260> e8<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.650> pressure<00:02:12.950> so

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
is going to leave e8 the pressure so

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:28.190 
is going to leave e8 the pressure so
that<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.580> can<00:02:13.700> pull<00:02:13.880> your<00:02:14.000> brake<00:02:14.330> caliper<00:02:14.600> off

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.290 

once<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.950> remove<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.430> be<00:02:29.580> very<00:02:29.790> careful<00:02:30.270> that

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
once you remove it be very careful that

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.390 
once you remove it be very careful that
you<00:02:30.630> don't<00:02:30.810> bend<00:02:31.380> or<00:02:32.370> break<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:34.130> brake<00:02:35.130> line

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
you don't bend or break the brake line

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.670 
you don't bend or break the brake line
that<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.300> metal<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.170> don't<00:02:37.319> want<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.530> twist

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
that it's metal you don't want to twist

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.120 
that it's metal you don't want to twist
it<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.130> move<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.459> too<00:02:38.640> much<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.830> don't

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
it and move it too much and you don't

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.870 
it and move it too much and you don't
want<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.400> let<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.610> let<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.290> hang<00:02:43.290> on<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.880> brake

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
want to let it let it hang on the brake

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.640 
want to let it let it hang on the brake
line<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.450> that's<00:02:45.630> I'm<00:02:45.930> just<00:02:45.959> putting<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.440> rope

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
line so that's I'm just putting a rope

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.699 
line so that's I'm just putting a rope
to<00:02:47.010> tie<00:02:47.819> that<00:02:48.030> off<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.510> one<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.989> arms<00:02:49.380> on

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
to tie that off to one of the arms on

once<00:06:21.690> you've<00:06:21.840> removed<00:06:22.050> those<00:06:22.560> bolts<00:06:23.100> you<00:06:23.400> can

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
once you've removed those bolts you can

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.300 
once you've removed those bolts you can
see<00:06:23.790> a<00:06:23.820> little<00:06:24.180> bit<00:06:24.390> clearer<00:06:24.750> now<00:06:25.050> the<00:06:25.740> holes<00:06:26.100> I

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
see a little bit clearer now the holes I

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.560 
see a little bit clearer now the holes I
was<00:06:26.460> talking<00:06:26.880> about<00:06:28.700> your<00:06:29.700> steering<00:06:30.240> knuckle

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
was talking about your steering knuckle

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.120 
was talking about your steering knuckle
should<00:06:30.780> come<00:06:30.990> right<00:06:31.260> off<00:06:31.290> and<00:06:31.710> then<00:06:31.890> you<00:06:31.980> can

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
should come right off and then you can

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.890 
should come right off and then you can
just<00:06:32.250> push<00:06:32.460> your<00:06:32.640> drive<00:06:33.000> axle<00:06:33.480> right<00:06:33.630> through

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
just push your drive axle right through

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:51.450 
just push your drive axle right through
the<00:06:33.990> hole

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.830 

now<00:06:52.460> you're<00:06:52.670> going<00:06:52.760> to<00:06:52.820> go<00:06:52.970> underneath<00:06:53.450> and

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
now you're going to go underneath and

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.210 
now you're going to go underneath and
you're<00:06:53.990> going<00:06:54.140> to<00:06:54.200> go<00:06:54.290> to<00:06:54.320> the<00:06:54.590> inner<00:06:54.800> shaft

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
you're going to go to the inner shaft

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.850 
you're going to go to the inner shaft
where<00:06:55.550> the<00:06:55.640> driveaxle<00:06:56.410> enters<00:06:57.410> the

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
where the driveaxle enters the

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.860 
where the driveaxle enters the
differential<00:06:58.760> and<00:06:58.970> you're<00:06:59.540> just<00:06:59.660> going<00:06:59.780> to

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
differential and you're just going to

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.750 
differential and you're just going to
use<00:07:00.020> a<00:07:00.050> bar<00:07:00.410> and<00:07:00.710> you're<00:07:01.040> going<00:07:01.190> to<00:07:01.220> pound<00:07:01.550> it

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760 
use a bar and you're going to pound it

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.880

out<00:07:01.850> with<00:07:02.090> a<00:07:02.150> large<00:07:02.420> mallet<00:07:02.750> you're<00:07:03.710> going<00:07:03.830> to

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:03.890 
out with a large mallet you're going to

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.860 
out with a large mallet you're going to
have<00:07:03.980> some<00:07:04.190> differential<00:07:05.060> fluid<00:07:05.300> come<00:07:05.690> out

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
have some differential fluid come out

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.570 
have some differential fluid come out
make<00:07:06.140> sure<00:07:06.170> you<00:07:06.410> have<00:07:06.500> a<00:07:06.560> pan<00:07:06.860> underneath<00:07:07.280> your
