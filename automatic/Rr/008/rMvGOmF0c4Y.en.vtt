00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
Cantonese isn't all that great which

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.120 
Cantonese isn't all that great which
obviously<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:09.220> isn't<00:03:09.580> or<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:11.650> really<00:03:11.799> has<00:03:12.100> some

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
obviously it isn't or it really has some

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.569 
obviously it isn't or it really has some
improving<00:03:12.850> that<00:03:13.209> it<00:03:13.359> really<00:03:14.140> needs<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.470> do<00:03:14.739> so

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
improving that it really needs to do so

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.599 
improving that it really needs to do so
but<00:03:16.329> that's<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.590> demo<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:18.220> wanted<00:03:18.549> to
