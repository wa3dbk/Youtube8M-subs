00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.530 
9 comes out if you get what I'm saying
like<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:16.980> was<00:03:17.190> ten<00:03:17.490> or<00:03:17.520> in<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.850> future<00:03:18.090> they

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
like I was ten or in the future they

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.320 
like I was ten or in the future they
will<00:03:18.750> like<00:03:18.960> implement<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.280> know<00:03:20.430> cool

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
will like implement that you know cool

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.410 
will like implement that you know cool
feature<00:03:21.600> in<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.110> street<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.550> by<00:03:24.060> then<00:03:24.270> I'll

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
feature in the street so I by then I'll

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.510 
feature in the street so I by then I'll
probably<00:03:24.630> do<00:03:24.900> update<00:03:25.320> version<00:03:25.740> of<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.220> if<00:03:26.340> they

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
probably do update version of it if they

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.910 
probably do update version of it if they
make<00:03:26.700> our<00:03:26.880> spring<00:03:27.210> shot<00:03:27.420> too<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:28.470> that's<00:03:28.770> it

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920
