00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello you ask yourself lots of 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.259
 questions about the exciting world of 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.520
 Horse races 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.500
 you wonder how he is 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.940
 possible to win at races where you 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.860
 already know that it's possible to win 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.900
 but you will not be what are the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.759
 secrets of professional tarfis or 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.080
 again you are already playing at the races and 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.250
 you want to know more 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.320
 methods 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.820
 in this video I tell you why the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.240
 chance has no place in the races 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.310
 horse 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.170
 I reveal to you the secrets of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.539
 turfists and especially how they do 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.880
 to win at the races I take in 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.500
 example my own results I you 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.230
 details the methods to achieve this 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.820
 let's start right now my races 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.680
 horses have nothing to do with a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.550
 lottery horse racing exists 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.320
 for 200 years 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.820
 and it is above all a competition in 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.680
 which professionals engage 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.070
 their proteges to win and take from 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.289
 the value 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.850
 like any self- respecting professional 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.800
 its primary mission is to have a 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.789
 maximum chance of success chance 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.399
 does not belong here 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.590
 logic requires for example that on 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.660
 a pmu race with fifteen starters we have 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.660
 a chance on 15 to win and not a 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.670
 chance on 19 million 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.290
 remains to be found in every race and 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.970
 for each game the candidates who we 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.920
 will win and for that many 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.140
 solutions are available to us the first 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.880
 solution is to do like those who 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.650
 do not know anything about playing dates 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.659
 marriage and birth in ten years they 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.189
 will always play the same numbers and 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.049
 will not have prevented the slightest euro 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.909
 the second solution is to do 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.380
 trust the forecasters but the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.000
 counselors are they the payers 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.619
 some are knotted elsewhere and I 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.729
 will tell you what I like and that I 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.619
 consults regularly 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.090
 the third solution is to play 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.009
 intelligently what does it want 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.560
 to say is to be able to maximize 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.420
 its potential for success and that's 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.950
 very very easy to make from the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.960
 when we are interested in a small 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.729
 little about so I asked myself the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.780
 question of how to take 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.549
 the right decisions 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.799
 and there I thought to myself if you want to win 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.689
 find the people who win look 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.210
 how they do and imitates the east and yes 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.680
 it seems obvious but ultimately how much 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.649
 of us actually go to garlic 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.360
 in fact very very little for many he 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.399
 it seems easier to do nothing 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.680
 so obviously it's not going big 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.680
 thing for them so how do the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.810
 tarfis who wins we know that basically 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.259
 on a run to 15 starters we have a 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.119
 15.2 chance of winning 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.950
 now if we play the fifteen horses 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.110
 winners we are sure to have the right 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.849
 ticket not to make a profit because for 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.709
 it is necessary that the winner is a rating 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.879
 greater than 16 euros but between these 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.650
 two extremes there are solutions 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.450
 profitable and lucrative to win at 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.920
 races and his solutions I have them 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.019
 discoveries alongside the turfists 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.430
 who wins why they win because 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.620
 they know methods that 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.480
 you do not even have an idea 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.359
 they know for example that the miss is going 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.400
 nothing to do with the goods you can 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.989
 bet for example 2 euros to the quintÃ© plus 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.030
 and pocket several million euros 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.950
 but they also know that if he bet on 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.049
 four horses among fifteen starters they 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.489
 have four chances out of 15 to win the 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.260
 it's all about choosing your horses 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.120
 in our example so the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.170
 ratio is greater than the setting for 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.150
 make a profit 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.340
 so that's how those who win 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.750
 proceeds the first secret is that it does not 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.280
 not looking for exceptional gains is 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.760
 rare but rather regular gains and 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.889
 frequent 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.599
 the second secret is that he plays 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.519
 serenely at the horse races decides 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.769
 for example he does not seem to ride 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.329
 they will refrain from playing the 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.370
 third secret is to select 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.849
 its candidates and for that there are 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.870
 methods what is a method 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.370
 it's a series of filters for 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.290
 select horse races in 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.040
 particular some horses among these 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.870
 Horse races 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.209
 what game to choose and how to fill his 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.160
 ticket for example in January 2015 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.049
 a method that I use since 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.480
 a long time now allowed me to 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.930
 still make a profit of 1749 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.849
 euros every month I spend several 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.599
 dozens of euros in gaming techniques 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.730
 methods 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.650
 I have them is playing virtually 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.000
 for several weeks once 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.900
 I have assimilated very little goal and 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.849
 methods 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.379
 I'm starting to really barrier too 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.030
 through press prognosis I you 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.829
 delivers all my conclusions on what 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.810
 works for me in the hope that it 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.579
 also works for you and it's for 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.019
 that I created for your press because 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.359
 that I will show you the secrets 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.980
 jealously guarded by the sailors wins 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.540
 at the time then if you wish in 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.489
 know more you can already discover 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.079
 20 rule of thumb that I use every 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.549
 days because it's the basis for starting 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.970
 understand and decode the races 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.829
 horse 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.479
 these are 20 golden rule that I sorted on 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.310
 the shutter and which are the result of 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.790
 twenty years of experience I do not want more 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.129
 keep them for me I wanted 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.689
 for free but beware i'll 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.720
 voluntarily limit the number 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:20.000
 of enrolled in 200 why of meaning because 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.680
 that every player at the pmu is playing against 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.389
 others and so I want to share my 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.550
 methods but not with everyone and 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.139
 I know that 200 it will not influence the 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.620
 result of the methods and they will remain 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.900
 reliable 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.880
 as well for you as for me then 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.490
 if you want to be part of the registered 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.020
 you will immediately receive them by email 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.680
 but 20 golden rule that I consult in 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.449
 permanence 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.039
 now it's up to you to play and 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.960
 remember that people who have 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.560
 successes invest in them and in their 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.360
 education 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.039
 I still have to wish you good guy on 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.990
 find myself on the other side where I 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:50.620
 dissect the first method in simple 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.620
 placed winner
