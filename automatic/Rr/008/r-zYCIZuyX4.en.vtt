00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
wasn't really much difference I mean he

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.270

did<00:03:58.799> go<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.400> lot<00:04:00.269> of<00:04:00.510> trap<00:04:01.500> heavy<00:04:01.739> which<00:04:02.099> I

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
did go a lot of trap heavy which I

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.770 
did go a lot of trap heavy which I
believe<00:04:02.579> being<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.180> environment<00:04:03.690> has

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
believe being that the environment has

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.439 
believe being that the environment has
slowed<00:04:04.049> down<00:04:04.549> that<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.579> lot<00:04:05.849> of<00:04:05.970> these<00:04:06.090> decks

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
slowed down that a lot of these decks

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:11.390 
slowed down that a lot of these decks
nowadays<00:04:07.109> are<00:04:07.290> going<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.500> be<00:04:07.730> trap<00:04:08.730> heavy<00:04:10.400> and

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
nowadays are going to be trap heavy and

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.650 
nowadays are going to be trap heavy and
being<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.329> a<00:04:13.310> lot<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.459> trap<00:04:14.669> heavy<00:04:14.940> he<00:04:15.359> went

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
being that a lot of trap heavy he went

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.229 
being that a lot of trap heavy he went
his<00:04:15.930> way<00:04:16.139> with<00:04:16.349> the<00:04:16.380> traps<00:04:16.739> there<00:04:17.039> too<00:04:17.280> matter
