00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
started implementing this technology

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.920 
started implementing this technology

works on bands one two and four which

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.889 
works on bands one two and four which
cover<00:01:30.829> 99%<00:01:31.759> of<00:01:31.790> carriers<00:01:32.210> around<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.659> world

cover 99% of carriers around the world

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.950 
cover 99% of carriers around the world
it<00:01:33.710> also<00:01:33.860> happens<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.490> increase<00:01:34.909> LTE<00:01:35.360> signals

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
it also happens to increase LTE signals

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.249 
it also happens to increase LTE signals
on<00:01:36.110> t-mobile<00:01:36.590> in<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.369> u.s.<00:01:37.840> we<00:01:38.840> wanted<00:01:39.229> to

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
on t-mobile in the u.s. we wanted to

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.590 
on t-mobile in the u.s. we wanted to
take<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:39.979> next<00:01:40.220> level<00:01:40.430> allowing<00:01:41.240> users

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
take it to the next level allowing users

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.990 
take it to the next level allowing users
from<00:01:41.930> other<00:01:42.229> LTE<00:01:42.740> networks<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:43.549> benefit<00:01:43.970> from

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
from other LTE networks to benefit from

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.410 
from other LTE networks to benefit from
our<00:01:44.210> technology<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.469> so<00:01:45.649> here<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.040> an<00:01:46.430> LTE

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
our technology and so here it is an LTE

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.690
