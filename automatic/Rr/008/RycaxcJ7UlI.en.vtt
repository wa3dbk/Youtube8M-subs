00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
demise and it kind of grips them in

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.050 
demise and it kind of grips them in
terror<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.160> fear<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.580> that's<00:03:29.730> like<00:03:29.880> we're

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
terror and fear and that's like we're

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.699 
terror and fear and that's like we're
the<00:03:30.180> best<00:03:30.450> way<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.900> can<00:03:30.930> try<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.320> describe

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
the best way that I can try to describe

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.729 
the best way that I can try to describe
what<00:03:32.549> I<00:03:32.580> understand<00:03:33.269> this<00:03:33.420> as<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:34.260> far<00:03:34.530> almost

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
what I understand this as so far almost

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.410 
what I understand this as so far almost
like<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.130> nightmare<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.970> can't<00:03:36.209> wake<00:03:36.390> up

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
like a nightmare that you can't wake up

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.979 
like a nightmare that you can't wake up
from<00:03:36.630> there<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:36.989> absolutely<00:03:37.680> am<00:03:38.640> amazed<00:03:39.330> by<00:03:39.690> the

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
from there I absolutely am amazed by the

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.960 
from there I absolutely am amazed by the
way<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.500> this<00:03:40.860> that<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:41.310> character<00:03:41.790> goes

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
way that this that this character goes

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.370 
way that this that this character goes
and<00:03:42.150> does<00:03:42.269> this<00:03:42.480> because<00:03:42.840> if<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.049> think<00:03:43.080> about

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
and does this because if you think about

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.620 
and does this because if you think about
it<00:03:43.560> being<00:03:44.190> able<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.610> mess<00:03:44.850> with<00:03:45.060> somebody<00:03:45.480> and

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
it being able to mess with somebody and

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.750 
it being able to mess with somebody and
paralyze<00:03:46.500> them<00:03:46.769> with<00:03:46.950> fear<00:03:47.250> while<00:03:47.519> they're

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760
