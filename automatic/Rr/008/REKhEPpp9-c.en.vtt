00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
wood if I had an actual book here that's

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.340 
wood if I had an actual book here that's
how<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.850> pages<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.930> book<00:00:37.140> would

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
how the pages of the the book would

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.290 
how the pages of the the book would
sound<00:00:37.680> when<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.309> wouldn't<00:00:38.790> when<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> flipped

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
sound when you wouldn't when I flipped

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.030 
sound when you wouldn't when I flipped
them<00:00:40.100> that<00:00:41.100> sounds<00:00:41.460> pretty<00:00:41.700> nice<00:00:42.020> so<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.350> if

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
them that sounds pretty nice so if if

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.500 
them that sounds pretty nice so if if
you<00:00:44.190> could<00:00:44.340> imagine<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.239> bound

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
you could imagine that this is bound

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.290 
you could imagine that this is bound
together<00:00:46.309> that's<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.700> what<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> book

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
together that's this is what a book

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.470 
together that's this is what a book
would<00:00:48.480> be<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.520> instead<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> pages<00:00:50.969> being

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
would be and instead of the pages being

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.500 
would be and instead of the pages being
blank<00:00:52.199> there<00:00:52.649> would<00:00:52.770> be<00:00:53.030> words<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.300> them

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
blank there would be words on them

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.540 
blank there would be words on them
that's<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> book<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:58.559> I'll<00:00:58.980> go<00:00:59.250> ahead
