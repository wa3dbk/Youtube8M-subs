conventional design mono bridge they

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.670 
conventional design mono bridge they
really<00:01:08.799> really<00:01:09.100> light<00:01:09.310> so<00:01:10.560> handling<00:01:11.560> is

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
really really light so handling is

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.490 
really really light so handling is
really<00:01:11.860> easy<00:01:14.369> they<00:01:15.369> have<00:01:15.520> a<00:01:15.549> Schmidt<00:01:16.000> patient

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
really easy they have a Schmidt patient

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.859 
really easy they have a Schmidt patient
prisons<00:01:17.500> fully<00:01:18.460> multi-coated<00:01:18.850> lenses<00:01:19.240> and

prisons fully multi-coated lenses and
also<00:01:20.500> prisons<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.299> they<00:01:22.450> offer<00:01:22.830> really

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
also prisons so they offer really

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.539 
also prisons so they offer really
exceptional<00:01:24.960> resolution<00:01:25.960> in<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.920> center<00:01:27.310> or

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
exceptional resolution in the center or

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.859 
exceptional resolution in the center or
and<00:01:27.939> also<00:01:28.180> edge<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:29.320> edge<00:01:30.540> what<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.570> also

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
and also edge to edge what is also

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.690 
and also edge to edge what is also
really<00:01:32.140> important<00:01:32.650> is<00:01:32.860> that<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:36.460> have<00:01:36.670> a

surfaces from scratches or and repels
water<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.990> also<00:01:50.170> means<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:51.000> beam

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
water it also means that the beam

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.420 
water it also means that the beam
authors<00:01:52.360> do<00:01:52.600> not<00:01:52.780> fall<00:01:53.110> if<00:01:53.409> you<00:01:53.710> breed<00:01:54.009> on<00:01:54.220> them

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
authors do not fall if you breed on them

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.770 
authors do not fall if you breed on them
on<00:01:55.350> when<00:01:56.350> on<00:01:56.710> while<00:01:57.640> their<00:01:58.030> temperatures<00:01:58.600> are

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
on when on while their temperatures are

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.179 
on when on while their temperatures are
very<00:01:58.810> low<00:02:00.780> they're<00:02:01.780> also<00:02:01.990> waterproof<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:02.860> for

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
very low they're also waterproof and for

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.130 
very low they're also waterproof and for
proof<00:02:03.460> they're<00:02:04.420> filled<00:02:04.719> with<00:02:04.810> dry<00:02:05.110> nitrogen

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
proof they're filled with dry nitrogen

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.620 
proof they're filled with dry nitrogen
so<00:02:06.100> at<00:02:06.280> low<00:02:06.670> temperatures<00:02:07.240> there<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:07.479> no

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
so at low temperatures there is no

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.749 
so at low temperatures there is no
problem<00:02:07.990> there<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.200> no<00:02:08.229> internal<00:02:09.040> fogging<00:02:09.369> and

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
problem there is no internal fogging and

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.960 
problem there is no internal fogging and
they<00:02:10.690> offer<00:02:10.840> great<00:02:11.140> vivid<00:02:11.650> colors<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:12.670> called

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
they offer great vivid colors so called

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.260 
they offer great vivid colors so called
Leica<00:02:13.569> colors<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.459> great<00:02:15.459> control<00:02:15.879> of<00:02:16.030> in

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
Leica colors and great control of in

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.180 
Leica colors and great control of in
turn<00:02:16.420> or<00:02:16.710> flares<00:02:17.710> or<00:02:18.130> internal<00:02:18.820> reflections

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
turn or flares or internal reflections

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.150 
turn or flares or internal reflections
they<00:02:21.190> have<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> central<00:02:21.970> focusing<00:02:22.870> knob<00:02:23.160> which

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
they have a central focusing knob which

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.080 
they have a central focusing knob which
is<00:02:24.310> really<00:02:24.670> big<00:02:24.940> compared<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:25.990> their<00:02:26.770> size

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
is really big compared to their size

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.880 
is really big compared to their size
that<00:02:28.090> means<00:02:28.300> it's<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.660> focusing<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.620> really

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
that means it's the focusing is really

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.550 
that means it's the focusing is really
easy<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:31.510> can<00:02:31.690> feel<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.140> really

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
easy and you can feel it's really

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.820 
easy and you can feel it's really
precise<00:02:33.900> really<00:02:34.900> really<00:02:35.170> nice<00:02:35.380> all<00:02:35.770> the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
precise really really nice all the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.710 
precise really really nice all the
internal<00:02:36.550> parts<00:02:36.580> are<00:02:36.970> made<00:02:37.120> out<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.300> titanium

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
internal parts are made out of titanium

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.590 
internal parts are made out of titanium
and<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.900> means<00:02:41.140> that<00:02:41.290> this<00:02:41.680> focusing<00:02:42.600> system

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
and that means that this focusing system

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.410 
and that means that this focusing system
works<00:02:43.840> at<00:02:44.170> any<00:02:44.410> temperature<00:02:44.740> in<00:02:45.460> any<00:02:46.090> kind<00:02:46.360> of
