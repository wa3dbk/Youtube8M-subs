bracket<00:00:44.109> what<00:00:44.289> I<00:00:44.319> did<00:00:44.499> is<00:00:44.620> I<00:00:44.710> created<00:00:45.300> these

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
bracket what I did is I created these

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.520 
bracket what I did is I created these
two<00:00:46.600> strips<00:00:47.309> aluminum<00:00:48.569> its<00:00:49.569> measured<00:00:50.079> drilled

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
two strips aluminum its measured drilled

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.329 
two strips aluminum its measured drilled
and<00:00:50.800> then<00:00:51.489> this<00:00:51.729> center<00:00:52.329> strip<00:00:52.679> goes<00:00:53.679> straight

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
and then this center strip goes straight

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.129 
and then this center strip goes straight
up<00:00:54.639> and<00:00:55.739> then<00:00:56.739> curls<00:00:57.249> around<00:00:57.839> and<00:00:58.839> then<00:00:58.959> that

00:00:59.129 --> 00:00:59.139 
up and then curls around and then that

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:02.189 
up and then curls around and then that
becomes<00:00:59.409> the<00:00:59.559> bottom<00:00:59.920> of<00:01:00.039> the<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.780> camera

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
becomes the bottom of the the camera

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.510 
becomes the bottom of the the camera
bracket<00:01:04.170> I've<00:01:05.170> had<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.500> put<00:01:05.710> little<00:01:05.950> spacers<00:01:06.490> a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
bracket I've had to put little spacers a

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.429 
bracket I've had to put little spacers a
little<00:01:06.700> half-inch<00:01:07.060> spaces<00:01:07.570> under<00:01:07.810> here<00:01:07.990> to

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
little half-inch spaces under here to

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.170 
little half-inch spaces under here to
clear<00:01:08.710> this<00:01:08.890> safe<00:01:09.189> from<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.460> plastic<00:01:09.939> but

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
clear this safe from the plastic but

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.090 
clear this safe from the plastic but
they<00:01:10.780> said<00:01:10.990> this<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.350> now<00:01:11.530> ball<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:11.920> damn

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
they said this is now ball to damn

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.819 
they said this is now ball to damn
solidly<00:01:12.670> this<00:01:13.240> is<00:01:13.360> bolted<00:01:13.750> down<00:01:13.840> solidly<00:01:14.320> this

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
solidly this is bolted down solidly this

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.580 
solidly this is bolted down solidly this
vertical<00:01:15.280> bar<00:01:15.310> is<00:01:15.609> piece<00:01:15.850> of<00:01:16.000> I<00:01:16.630> think<00:01:17.439> it's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
vertical bar is piece of I think it's

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.609 
vertical bar is piece of I think it's
3/16<00:01:18.280> steal<00:01:18.700> kids<00:01:19.210> aluminum<00:01:19.810> bounced<00:01:20.500> around

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
3/16 steal kids aluminum bounced around

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.139 
3/16 steal kids aluminum bounced around
too<00:01:20.950> much<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.390> then<00:01:22.539> what<00:01:22.719> happens<00:01:23.109> is<00:01:23.320> it

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
too much and then what happens is it

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.669 
too much and then what happens is it
just<00:01:25.149> comes<00:01:25.390> right<00:01:25.659> up<00:01:25.869> and<00:01:26.829> provides<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.490> flat

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
just comes right up and provides a flat

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:30.779 
just comes right up and provides a flat
mounting<00:01:29.679> surface<00:01:30.070> for<00:01:30.250> whatever<00:01:30.369> so<00:01:30.729> I've

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
mounting surface for whatever so I've

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.190 
mounting surface for whatever so I've
got<00:01:30.909> a<00:01:30.939> piece<00:01:31.179> of<00:01:31.299> rubber<00:01:31.509> in<00:01:31.659> between<00:01:31.960> there

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
got a piece of rubber in between there

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.050 
got a piece of rubber in between there
then<00:01:32.799> zip<00:01:33.009> tie<00:01:33.159> this<00:01:33.340> camera<00:01:33.609> down<00:01:33.729> in<00:01:33.850> place

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
then zip tie this camera down in place

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.029 
then zip tie this camera down in place
this<00:01:34.270> thing<00:01:34.509> is<00:01:34.750> solid<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.530> is<00:01:35.649> not<00:01:35.829> going

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
this thing is solid it is not going

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.880 
this thing is solid it is not going
anywhere<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.780> if<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.320> have<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.500> matched<00:01:38.679> up

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
anywhere so if you have the matched up

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.249 
anywhere so if you have the matched up
bracket<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:39.520> want<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.850> do<00:01:40.270> this<00:01:40.450> if<00:01:41.140> you

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.910 
about three dollars worth of bolt and
that's<00:01:59.289> a<00:02:00.359> clean-looking<00:02:01.799> doesn't<00:02:02.799> look

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
that's a clean-looking doesn't look

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.090 
that's a clean-looking doesn't look
remotely<00:02:03.280> out<00:02:03.819> of<00:02:03.969> play

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
remotely out of play

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.130 
remotely out of play
it<00:02:06.100> in<00:02:06.340> fact<00:02:06.369> almost<00:02:06.819> kind<00:02:07.119> of<00:02:07.179> looks<00:02:07.329> dark<00:02:07.689> so

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
it in fact almost kind of looks dark so

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.280 
it in fact almost kind of looks dark so
I<00:02:08.380> think<00:02:08.979> so<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:10.060> there<00:02:10.240> you<00:02:10.300> go<00:02:10.479> Mountain

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
I think so so there you go Mountain

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.149 
I think so so there you go Mountain
camera<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.310> bike

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
camera to the bike

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.800 
camera to the bike
nice<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.969> solid<00:02:14.120> protected<00:02:14.689> by<00:02:14.749> the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
nice and solid protected by the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.090 
nice and solid protected by the
windshield<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.939> there<00:02:16.939> you<00:02:16.999> go
