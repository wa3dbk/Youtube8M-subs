00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.630
Kris is going to try some processed American
foods today. Most of them are snacks but there

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.770
are two things that can possibly be eaten
as dinner. I picked out some snacks and foods

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.650
that I think you can only find in the U.S.
Some of them swear to be an excellent source

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.420
of calcium. This one has 30% less fat, but
than what?! I'd just like to see how he'll

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.670
react to them. Yeah, we'll take it from there.
Alright, the one I'm most excited about Kris

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.390
trying is the Twinkie. I think it's the iconic
American junk food. It's basically sponge

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.000
cake filled with filling. - I just heard it
exists. That's all I know. Ehh. Ughhh. I don't like it

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.800
 Sweetest come back ever. This is
cereal. Frosted, toasted oat cereal with marshmallows.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.800
Oh my god, this is so sweet, like pure sugar.
- Pop tarts, which are pastries with filling

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.509
inside and this one has s'more filling. A
s'more is a bonfired classic. It's a graham

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.869
cracker with marshmallows and chocolate in
between. So that's the filling for this one.

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.520
Mmmh, not that bad. It's pretty normal, I
guess. Cream filling and some raspberries maybe.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.520
-No, it's chocolate. 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.170
 Oh, ok, thanks
for letting me know. - Beverages; Arizona Ice

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.100
Tea. Well this one is actually an Arnold Palmer,
which is half ice tea and half lemonade. Zero calories. 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.060
I hate American beverages. Really,
they're too sugary. Ok, this is not particularly

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.939
bad. Iced tea with lots of sugar and lemon.
I guess Arnold Palmer goes with the popular stuff. 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.099
Arizona Ice Teas are available everywhere
but I guess they're classically American.

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:52.029
So this one is ice tea with lemon flavor.
100% natural. If you had children, would you

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:58.249
let them eat any of this? -Maybe the Pop Tarts.
Pfft, this is too sweet. - One to ten, what's

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:03.759
the rating? - One...well ok, it's not that bad.
I give it a three. -My favorite is definitely

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.759
Cool Ranch Doritos. - I like these. - What's the
rating? 8. - Ranch dressing. - I don't really

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.020
know the taste of ranch dressing. I've tried
it but I can't put my finger on what it really

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.930
is. So this tastes like just good quality
chips to me. - Combos are pretzels filled with

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.930
cheese type filling. This one's pizza filled
and it has real cheese.It's healthy because

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.030
among the artificial flavoring they also have
natural flavoring. - Ugh. Pizza flavored. Hmmm, this

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.280
is ok. Maybe a bit too salty. I wouldn't buy
it for myself but if someone had it at a party,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.770
I would catch a take and then probably get
hooked and eat the whole bowl. -That was actually

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.770
a huge american craze for a while, baked snacks.
-And hate myself afterward. -Funyons are chips,

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.890
onion flavored rings. I think they're corn
based. -Funyons...ehh just the name is disgraceful.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.120
It's alright. All of this has the same main
taste which is just an abstract taste of something

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.940
that is bad for you but you also like it at
the same time. -Cheetos, crunchy hot, flamin'

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.940
hots. These are the best. And again, made
with real cheese. -Wow, these look, they're

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:32.210
red. What's red like that? Mmmm, they're more
spicy than any other spicy chip I've had.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.040
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna have one more. This
is alright. -My favorite is a can of cheese.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.980
It's made with real cheese and it's an excellent
source of calcium. -How am I supposed to eat

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.890
it even? Like put it in my mouth? -Yeah, squeeze
the tip or something. -Mmm, hmm, well ok, I

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.510
give them that, this is good. - Available flavors;
cheddar and bacon, American flavor, I think

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.970
that's what we have. -Chemical dangerous shit,
but it's good. Quality time with a can of cheese. 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.240
And the serving size is two fucking
tablespoons. Two tablespoons. - It kind of creeps

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.240
me out that you can keep cheese in this form.
-And mac and cheese which is macaroni and cheese.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.840
Real cheese. Yay. -I guess there's more mac
than cheese. It's alright. My thinking right?

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:35.150
Ehhhhh. When you are in the States, chances
are you're going to get extra cheese on everything

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.289
you order. Or extra butter, extra butter garlic,
melted gravy bacon sauce. That's what you

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.930
get. Extra cheese, this is good. I hate myself.
-These are SpaghettiOs. This is an option for

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.460
kids to eat if their parents can't cook for
them, I guess. -SpaghettiOs, mmmh. -So what's

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.740
in it? -Meatballs and macaronis. -But they're
O-shaped, that's where the name comes from,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.740
SpagettiOs. -AHhh. Not very original but I
would consider buying this if I was hungry

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:11.139
and didn't want to cook or something. Oh my
god. -How do you feel? So much food. I think

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.580
I gained like 5 kg since we started recording
the video. -What's 5 kg for people watching

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.580
in the U.S.?- Ughh, I don't know.- Like 12 pounds
or something, 12 pounds. -12 pounds. - I think.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:31.020
On to the candy. Butterfingers. A peanut buttery
type of snack. -Mmmm, mm yeah. Peanut butter,

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:35.979
but it's very crunchy. It has a surprising
texture for a bar. - I don't like peanut butter

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.789
but actually this one I like more than other
peanut butter based snacks. For example, a

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.199
very popular one is Reese's and I don't like
Reese's. I like this one more. Milk Duds.

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:51.199
Just caramely, caramel topped off with chocolate.
- Hard to chew. - They look like raisins covered

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:59.139
with chocolate but they're worse. They're
caramel covered with chocolate. -Meh. 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:04.360
Finally one of my favorite candies, Nerds. These are
just really tiny tangy candies. T here's

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:11.360
really, I don't know how else to describe
them. -So I dunno, got it? This is horrible.

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:19.949
Too sweet and too sour at the same time. - Warheads,
so warheads became popular as this sour candy.

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.839
It was a hard candy filled with sour filling
and now they've extended into jelly beans.

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:32.800
Warheads, oh my god, this is really sour but
not that bad. I don't want to have it ever in my life again. 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.200
American snacks in general
have a bad stigma around them but as I've

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:49.259
shown you some of them have real cheese and
calcium so hopefully you can make an excuse

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:54.219
for yourself and try them. Kris enjoyed some
of them, hated some of them as I expected.

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:59.279
I should be having a sugar high right now
but I feel sugar low. I guess you're not supposed

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:04.639
to have 20 different snacks in one meal. My
state is justified. Yeah, and all of this

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:11.169
is obviously very healthy. Real cheese, calcium,
low sugar, no sugar. So I feel healthy as

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:16.439
fuck at this moment. I might not even workout
today because I've had a very nutritious meal.

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:21.279
Were you going to workout anyway? - Yeah, sure,
do cross fit. - Please subscribe, we'll be in

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:28.279
Japan soon so we'll be posting more cool videos
and we'd like for you to see them.
