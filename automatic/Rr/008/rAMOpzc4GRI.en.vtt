00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.140
 hello good to everyone I'm comment and 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.150
 well here we are again in watercress 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.040
 as I promised and I did very round 954 and 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.910
 good in berrugo here I am in the round 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.670
 44 what that comparing the maps and seeing 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.080
 the difficulties round 44 would equate 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.699
 that 's about 54 or 55 of the world 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.370
 so then I will explain 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.930
 teach a little how I'm doing 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.489
 the strategy although you already know it but 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.430
 now it has changed has changed a lot 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.370
 the things up holding 38 was 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.900
 doing those that you commented on 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.100
 previous strategies that in the middle 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:09.760
 map below used the beam 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.530
 and the local league but now no longer 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.500
 you can because it's already super difficult 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.090
 kill the zombies leave many trolleys is 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.850
 impossible then what are we going to do 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.310
 of grouping them and we're going to method the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.070
 'pull' in the trap been up here 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.770
 we solve it well we make a ball with 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.500
 them and we're going to put them in this trap 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.179
 it's the only way because I already tell you it 's 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.850
 super difficult to kill him on the other side 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.429
 with these weapons and we could put them 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.590
 trap of that one there but it has 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.509
 enough difficulty can be done but 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.939
 has enough difficulty then for 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.679
 do not take risks I leave it there for 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.200
 that you see it and that you put it 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.679
 in practice you already know round 45 I'm going 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.530
 hours 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.710
 Well, I'm going to kill the zombie and 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.810
 that you see 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.810
 and I'm going to do a little bit of the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.420
 strategy 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.320
 because they are already very hard this is already 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.320
 Hard Hard Hard Hard 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.100
 it is called to kill it narrow 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.740
 and this is good and everything that 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.110
 we give the thomson gives but I know 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.380
 how much marchena font good remembered 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.540
 those of the hammers here is 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.720
 important not to take a hammer 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.720
 important s 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.590
 let's start 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.120
 he no longer has the amount he gives us 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.270
 fondue you do not want for a window is 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.580
 incredible and what is coming 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.740
 and we always give you time to 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.630
 that regroup back 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.950
 of three windows look at what has 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.950
 gone is a barbarity 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.890
 and almost everything pretty 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.810
 we give them time to come back 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.810
 behind 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.430
 that puts you in some story quoted there is no 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.430
 program without any program 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.130
 we have an idea 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.910
 We close this window if ever 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.940
 we get some but it's weird is 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.910
 rare that we leave 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.770
 already leave so fast that there are here by 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.130
 example I take advantage of a little bit of 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.130
 dots 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.160
 and now here we hope we can hold a 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.319
 little to begin to leave it and 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.330
 we do not start and here it is super important 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.480
 we do a little bit like that but quickly 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.370
 we go because I look what happens here 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.860
 As you are late they are dead 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.239
 dead then is the margin that 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.700
 we have time to be able to session 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:43.680
 I'm going to repeat for you to see 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.680
 but it is the time frame that we have 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.910
 here in front just do a little 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.629
 time because always some others 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.629
 it does not come out there 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.290
 we have them all there 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.719
 and isolated recharge are without problems 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.939
 and here I could try to kill him 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:04.159
 but I leave a number of trolleys 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:06.879
 which is that they are abnormal is that impossible 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.879
 to notice 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.879
 we do not do it like that 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.780
 and always close by custom closes the 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.190
 window because always in rounds 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.410
 caesar above provided some by 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.550
 they 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.550
 we do not notice that now 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.470
 let's put up with a bit of those 56 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.470
 there behind 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.789
 and already the 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:41.270
 the margin of time we have and 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.270
 we hold a bit 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.740
 and has started again 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.840
 the whole round is already endless 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.370
 They last for a long time and well what we 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.090
 taught a little bit so you can see it as 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.560
 it's not good 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.650
 another more range is that I have high round 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.440
 you already know how to keep watching videos that I've 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.760
 been drawing map with high rents and 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.070
 good and see if I can keep going up 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.070
 this come up later gentlemen
