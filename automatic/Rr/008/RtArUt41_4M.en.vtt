00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
improved and there are respective days I

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.920 
improved and there are respective days I
wanted<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:56.970> in<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.210> slightly<00:00:57.449> different<00:00:57.570> way

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
wanted to do in a slightly different way

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.800 
wanted to do in a slightly different way
so<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.710> started<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.340> look<00:00:59.730> around<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.390> make<00:01:00.540> sure

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
so I started to look around to make sure

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.530 
so I started to look around to make sure
that<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.200> could<00:01:01.440> implement<00:01:02.430> an<00:01:02.790> online<00:01:03.180> system

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
that we could implement an online system

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.510 
that we could implement an online system
that<00:01:04.080> was<00:01:04.199> more<00:01:04.229> live<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.040> more<00:01:05.130> accessible

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
that was more live and more accessible

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.609 
that was more live and more accessible
for<00:01:05.820> staff<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.080> was<00:01:07.259> when<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.410> came

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
for staff and that was when I came

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.609 
for staff and that was when I came
across<00:01:07.770> blue<00:01:08.160> wave<00:01:08.869> yes<00:01:09.869> when<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.140> originally

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
across blue wave yes when I originally

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.550 
across blue wave yes when I originally
started<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:11.580> with<00:01:11.940> PMR<00:01:12.899> it<00:01:13.229> was<00:01:13.410> all

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
started out with PMR it was all

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.800 
started out with PMR it was all
paper-based<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.490> did<00:01:14.640> talk<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.119> out<00:01:15.300> but<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
paper-based we did talk it out but it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.420 
paper-based we did talk it out but it
would<00:01:15.990> start<00:01:16.259> off<00:01:16.410> as<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> piece<00:01:17.160> of<00:01:17.310> paper

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
would start off as a piece of paper

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.150 
would start off as a piece of paper
filling<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> form<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.140> then<00:01:19.410> typing<00:01:19.920> that

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
filling in a form and then typing that

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.270 
filling in a form and then typing that
up<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.390> would<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.810> emailed<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.740> whoever

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
up and it would be emailed to whoever

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.480 
up and it would be emailed to whoever

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
sent to your leadership team link who

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.889 
sent to your leadership team link who
would<00:01:29.880> then<00:01:30.030> share<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.450> with<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> head

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
would then share that with the head

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.600 
would then share that with the head
teacher<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.649> if<00:01:31.979> there<00:01:32.130> were<00:01:32.220> any<00:01:32.369> concerns

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
teacher and if there were any concerns

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.430 
teacher and if there were any concerns
about<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.600> imagine<00:01:33.899> you're<00:01:34.110> talking

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
about that you imagine you're talking

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.650 
about that you imagine you're talking
probably<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.920> month's<00:01:35.310> turnaround<00:01:35.910> get<00:01:36.539> to

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
probably a month's turnaround get to

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.719 
probably a month's turnaround get to
that<00:01:36.780> point<00:01:37.080> you<00:01:37.679> would<00:01:37.800> then<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.190> that<00:01:38.399> sent

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that point you would then have that sent

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.710 
that point you would then have that sent
back<00:01:38.940> to<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.539> be<00:01:39.630> modified<00:01:41.420> one<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.539> the

back to you to be modified one of the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.290 
back to you to be modified one of the
main<00:01:43.440> concerns<00:01:43.979> was<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.429> we<00:01:44.700> needed<00:01:44.910> to<00:01:45.060> be

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
main concerns was that we needed to be

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.240 
main concerns was that we needed to be
able<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.720> implement<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.380> full<00:01:46.709> Academy

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
able to implement a full Academy

able to implement a full Academy
development<00:01:47.759> plan<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.720> ensure<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
development plan and to ensure that

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.139 
development plan and to ensure that
everybody<00:01:49.440> within<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.369> institution<00:01:51.030> was

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
everybody within the institution was

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.730 
everybody within the institution was
fully<00:01:51.390> aware<00:01:51.690> of<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.259> were<00:01:52.289> trying<00:01:52.649> to

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
fully aware of what we were trying to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.330 
fully aware of what we were trying to
achieve<00:01:52.950> within<00:01:53.459> any<00:01:54.000> academic<00:01:54.720> year<00:01:54.959> and

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
achieve within any academic year and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.660 
achieve within any academic year and
that<00:01:56.340> was<00:01:56.640> quite<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.330> difficult<00:01:57.929> thing<00:01:58.289> to<00:01:58.740> to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
that was quite a difficult thing to to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.760 
that was quite a difficult thing to to
get<00:01:59.819> the<00:01:59.940> message<00:02:00.270> across<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.929> everybody

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
get the message across to everybody

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.880 
get the message across to everybody
because<00:02:02.179> if<00:02:03.179> it's<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.479> piece<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.780> paper<00:02:03.990> or<00:02:04.619> if

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
because if it's a piece of paper or if

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.010 
because if it's a piece of paper or if
it's<00:02:05.009> one<00:02:05.250> email<00:02:05.580> then<00:02:06.360> there's<00:02:06.690> no<00:02:06.810> guarantee

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
it's one email then there's no guarantee

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.020 
it's one email then there's no guarantee
that<00:02:07.380> people<00:02:07.890> will<00:02:07.979> look<00:02:08.130> at<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.490> use<00:02:08.789> it

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
that people will look at it use it

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.999 
that people will look at it use it
implement<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.959> or<00:02:10.080> add<00:02:10.229> evidence<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.890> it

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
implement it or add evidence to it

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.520 
implement it or add evidence to it
necessarily<00:02:11.550> but<00:02:11.880> if<00:02:12.270> it's<00:02:12.450> an<00:02:12.660> online<00:02:12.959> live

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
necessarily but if it's an online live

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.890 
necessarily but if it's an online live
document<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.430> we<00:02:14.550> use<00:02:14.760> all<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:14.970> time<00:02:15.300> then

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
document that we use all the time then

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.380 
document that we use all the time then
it's<00:02:16.080> far<00:02:16.500> more<00:02:16.680> effective<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.120> was<00:02:18.270> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
it's far more effective so that was the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.140 
it's far more effective so that was the
first<00:02:18.660> objective<00:02:19.080> for<00:02:19.440> me

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
first objective for me

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.330 
first objective for me
secondly<00:02:20.750> we<00:02:21.049> do<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> huge<00:02:21.530> amount<00:02:21.829> of<00:02:21.920> staff

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
secondly we do a huge amount of staff

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.210 
secondly we do a huge amount of staff
training<00:02:22.579> we<00:02:23.510> have<00:02:23.689> done<00:02:23.900> for<00:02:24.439> around<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.189> year

training we have done for around a year
now<00:02:25.760> we<00:02:26.599> needed<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.959> really<00:02:27.140> concise<00:02:27.709> way<00:02:28.069> of

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
now we needed a really concise way of

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.610 
now we needed a really concise way of
illustrating<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.930> number<00:02:30.140> of<00:02:30.230> hours<00:02:30.590> that

literally<00:04:10.549> hundreds<00:04:11.060> of<00:04:11.120> observations

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:11.719 
literally hundreds of observations

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.379 
literally hundreds of observations
across<00:04:12.019> our<00:04:12.290> Academy<00:04:12.829> and<00:04:13.579> when<00:04:13.699> I<00:04:13.730> arrived<00:04:14.150> it

across our Academy and when I arrived it

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.210 
across our Academy and when I arrived it

that we need to deal with immediately
it's<00:04:45.470> just<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:45.860> tool<00:04:46.250> for<00:04:46.280> self-reflection<00:04:46.849> you

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
invaluable tool it's becoming imperative

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.010

to be honest to use it in everyday
practice<00:04:54.320> if<00:04:55.130> I<00:04:55.250> didn't<00:04:55.520> use<00:04:55.699> it<00:04:56.259> it<00:04:57.259> would

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
practice if I didn't use it it would

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.560 
practice if I didn't use it it would
become<00:04:57.620> very<00:04:57.830> hard<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.639> really<00:04:58.820> know<00:04:59.090> what

become very hard to really know what
particular<00:04:59.870> CPD<00:05:00.530> needs<00:05:01.009> I<00:05:01.220> need<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:01.909> so<00:05:02.150> just

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
different different events that I can

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.350 
different different events that I can
pick<00:05:09.139> and<00:05:09.289> choose<00:05:09.349> which<00:05:09.860> ones<00:05:09.889> get<00:05:10.759> suited<00:05:11.210> to

me and I can use them so sister it's an
invaluable<00:05:14.120> resource<00:05:14.509> it's<00:05:15.409> one<00:05:15.560> of<00:05:15.650> those

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
invaluable resource it's one of those

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.930 
invaluable resource it's one of those
things<00:05:16.009> that<00:05:16.099> we'll<00:05:16.280> probably<00:05:16.400> look<00:05:16.610> back<00:05:16.759> on

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
things that we'll probably look back on

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.730 
things that we'll probably look back on
and<00:05:17.030> thinking<00:05:17.330> of<00:05:17.449> how<00:05:17.539> did<00:05:17.780> how<00:05:18.320> do<00:05:18.380> we<00:05:18.560> get

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
and thinking of how did how do we get

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.670 
and thinking of how did how do we get
away<00:05:18.830> with<00:05:19.039> not<00:05:19.190> using<00:05:19.340> it<00:05:19.610> to<00:05:19.639> be<00:05:19.759> honest

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680

now<00:05:23.820> yes<00:05:24.820> it's<00:05:25.030> like<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.180> mobile<00:05:25.450> phone<00:05:25.840> you

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
now yes it's like the mobile phone you

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.720 
now yes it's like the mobile phone you
can't<00:05:26.500> figure<00:05:26.680> out<00:05:26.800> how<00:05:26.920> you<00:05:26.980> you<00:05:27.520> lived

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.490 
have a phrase here it works smarter not
harder<00:06:03.430> and<00:06:03.970> we<00:06:04.690> think<00:06:04.960> that<00:06:05.020> blue<00:06:05.260> wave

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
harder and we think that blue wave

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.800 
harder and we think that blue wave
allows<00:06:05.800> us<00:06:05.980> to<00:06:06.130> be<00:06:06.250> smarter<00:06:06.760> it<00:06:07.390> means<00:06:07.630> that

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
allows us to be smarter it means that

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.300 
allows us to be smarter it means that
we're<00:06:07.900> not<00:06:07.930> chasing<00:06:08.500> around<00:06:08.590> for<00:06:08.950> pieces<00:06:09.160> of

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
we're not chasing around for pieces of

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.760 
we're not chasing around for pieces of
evidence<00:06:09.580> pieces<00:06:10.180> of<00:06:10.270> paper<00:06:10.570> and<00:06:11.230> I<00:06:11.410> can<00:06:11.590> tell

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
evidence pieces of paper and I can tell

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.590 
evidence pieces of paper and I can tell
you<00:06:11.919> immediately<00:06:12.160> who's<00:06:12.760> been<00:06:13.030> recommended

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
you immediately who's been recommended

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.480 
you immediately who's been recommended
for<00:06:13.630> pay<00:06:13.900> progression<00:06:14.470> as<00:06:14.590> a<00:06:14.620> percentage<00:06:15.250> who

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
for pay progression as a percentage who

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.420 
for pay progression as a percentage who
hasn't<00:06:15.910> and<00:06:16.120> why<00:06:16.300> etc<00:06:17.080> and<00:06:17.320> so<00:06:18.160> the

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
hasn't and why etc and so the

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.280 
hasn't and why etc and so the
implementation<00:06:19.270> for<00:06:19.450> me<00:06:19.600> was<00:06:19.750> relatively

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
implementation for me was relatively

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.230 
implementation for me was relatively
simple<00:06:20.740> we<00:06:20.860> decided<00:06:21.400> that<00:06:21.430> we<00:06:21.730> believed<00:06:22.060> in

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
simple we decided that we believed in

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.750 
simple we decided that we believed in
this<00:06:22.450> system<00:06:22.690> I<00:06:23.110> pioneered<00:06:24.070> it<00:06:24.250> we<00:06:24.430> trained

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
this system I pioneered it we trained

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.090 
this system I pioneered it we trained
staff<00:06:25.090> regularly<00:06:25.390> and<00:06:25.900> they<00:06:26.530> realized<00:06:26.980> that

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
staff regularly and they realized that

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.310 
staff regularly and they realized that
it<00:06:27.250> benefited<00:06:27.880> them<00:06:28.060> hugely<00:06:28.480> and<00:06:28.810> therefore

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
it benefited them hugely and therefore

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.100 
it benefited them hugely and therefore
the<00:06:29.440> students<00:06:30.040> and<00:06:30.220> now<00:06:30.820> it's<00:06:31.090> an<00:06:31.300> integral

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
the students and now it's an integral

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.860 
the students and now it's an integral
very<00:06:32.560> highly<00:06:32.980> embedded<00:06:33.460> part<00:06:33.760> of<00:06:33.940> our<00:06:34.360> process

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
very highly embedded part of our process

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.200 
very highly embedded part of our process
within<00:06:35.050> the<00:06:35.169> institution<00:06:35.919> as<00:06:36.669> I<00:06:36.850> said<00:06:37.000> we<00:06:37.150> were

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
within the institution as I said we were

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.600 
within the institution as I said we were
in<00:06:37.270> special<00:06:37.570> measures<00:06:38.050> in<00:06:38.410> for<00:06:38.830> a<00:06:39.160> little<00:06:39.520> over

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.780 
in special measures in for a little over
a<00:06:39.850> year<00:06:40.150> and<00:06:40.330> the<00:06:41.200> office<00:06:42.070> of<00:06:42.190> inspectors<00:06:42.669> were

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
a year and the office of inspectors were

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.640 
a year and the office of inspectors were
very<00:06:42.970> clear<00:06:43.360> that<00:06:43.570> they<00:06:43.660> wanted<00:06:44.020> to<00:06:44.169> see<00:06:44.350> it<00:06:44.500> a

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
very clear that they wanted to see it a

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.320 
very clear that they wanted to see it a

robust and rigorous Quality Assurance

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.680 
robust and rigorous Quality Assurance
process<00:06:47.200> so<00:06:47.830> when<00:06:48.070> they<00:06:48.190> arrived<00:06:48.660> we<00:06:49.660> were

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
process so when they arrived we were

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.840 
process so when they arrived we were
able<00:06:49.960> from<00:06:50.530> any<00:06:50.740> angle<00:06:51.190> and<00:06:51.280> any<00:06:51.460> member<00:06:51.820> of

staff to illustrate to them the
processes<00:06:54.820> that<00:06:55.030> we<00:06:55.150> went<00:06:55.360> through<00:06:55.540> using

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
processes that we went through using

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.620 
processes that we went through using
blue<00:06:56.590> wave<00:06:56.830> and<00:06:57.130> the<00:06:57.820> report<00:06:58.210> that<00:06:58.270> we<00:06:58.450> got

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:58.630 
blue wave and the report that we got

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.050 
blue wave and the report that we got
back<00:06:58.810> from<00:06:59.050> them<00:06:59.550> stated<00:07:00.550> that<00:07:00.729> our<00:07:00.850> quality

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.060 
back from them stated that our quality

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.630 
back from them stated that our quality
assurance<00:07:01.390> was<00:07:02.140> extremely<00:07:02.860> rigorous<00:07:03.100> and

assurance was extremely rigorous and

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.120 
assurance was extremely rigorous and
robust<00:07:04.210> and<00:07:04.540> in<00:07:04.720> fact<00:07:04.960> the<00:07:05.169> institution<00:07:05.919> could

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130 
robust and in fact the institution could

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.800 
robust and in fact the institution could
