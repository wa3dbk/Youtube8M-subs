00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640

because<00:02:30.640> when<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.120> flip<00:02:31.570> open<00:02:31.720> my<00:02:32.050> macbook<00:02:32.500> I

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
because when I flip open my macbook I

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.620 
because when I flip open my macbook I
don't<00:02:32.830> like<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.160> when<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.700> leans<00:02:33.910> back<00:02:34.210> in<00:02:34.240> a

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
don't like it when it leans back in a

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.200 
don't like it when it leans back in a
catch<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.290> something<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.890> falls<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:37.030> i<00:02:37.090> know

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
catch of something and falls so i know

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.280 
catch of something and falls so i know
i'm<00:02:37.270> just<00:02:37.360> going<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.570> set<00:02:37.840> this<00:02:37.930> up<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.200> I'm

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
i'm just going to set this up and I'm

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.340
