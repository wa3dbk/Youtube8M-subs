long after that wand boom we got another

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.010 
long after that wand boom we got another
seismic<00:00:44.579> singularity<00:00:45.180> drop<00:00:45.390> which<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
seismic singularity drop which was a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.319 
seismic singularity drop which was a
twenty<00:00:46.350> seven<00:00:46.649> point<00:00:46.680> six<00:00:47.070> mil<00:00:47.340> split<00:00:47.730> so

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
before I used to do Soul Reaper tests

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.000 
before I used to do Soul Reaper tests
every<00:01:03.390> day<00:01:03.539> since<00:01:03.750> i<00:01:03.870> came<00:01:04.049> out<00:01:04.229> i<00:01:04.470> actually

had 90 straight tests done before i

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.179 
had 90 straight tests done before i
decided<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> stop<00:01:07.049> doing<00:01:07.350> them<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:07.920> since

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
decided to stop doing them but since

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.380 
decided to stop doing them but since
i've<00:01:08.310> been<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.760> final<00:01:09.060> boss<00:01:09.180> more

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
i've been going for final boss more

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.179 
i've been going for final boss more
seriously<00:01:09.810> now<00:01:09.900> i<00:01:10.229> started<00:01:10.770> doing<00:01:10.860> them<00:01:11.070> again

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
seriously now i started doing them again

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.670 
seriously now i started doing them again
every<00:01:12.030> 300<00:01:12.479> reaper<00:01:12.689> points<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.049> get<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
every 300 reaper points that you get you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.320 
every 300 reaper points that you get you
can<00:01:13.830> buy<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> hydrex<00:01:14.490> which<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.970> anywhere<00:01:15.270> from

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
can buy a hydrex which is anywhere from

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480 
can buy a hydrex which is anywhere from
15<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> 20<00:01:16.259> mil<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:16.979> definitely<00:01:17.310> worth

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
15 to 20 mil so it's definitely worth

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.460 
15 to 20 mil so it's definitely worth
doing<00:01:17.729> however<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.540> didn't<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:18.960> anything<00:01:19.229> good

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
doing however I didn't get anything good

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.230 
doing however I didn't get anything good
from<00:01:19.619> Kree<00:01:19.860> ara<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.280> did<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> few<00:01:20.850> hard<00:01:21.090> mode

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
from Kree ara I did a few hard mode

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
from Kree ara I did a few hard mode
kills<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.869> few<00:01:22.080> regular<00:01:22.439> kills<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:23.009> failed

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
kills and a few regular kills but failed

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
kills and a few regular kills but failed
to<00:01:23.340> get<00:01:23.490> anything<00:01:23.729> interesting<00:01:24.330> last<00:01:25.140> but

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to get anything interesting last but

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.960 
to get anything interesting last but
certainly<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.799> least<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.369> started<00:01:26.729> putting

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
certainly not least I started putting

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.819 
certainly not least I started putting
