King<00:03:16.400> G<00:03:16.580> shock<00:03:16.820> with<00:03:17.780> atomic<00:03:18.250> released

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
King G shock with atomic released

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.760 
King G shock with atomic released
outside<00:03:19.580> of<00:03:19.910> Japan<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:21.170> for<00:03:21.350> much<00:03:21.500> lower

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
outside of Japan and for much lower

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.820 
outside of Japan and for much lower
price<00:03:22.270> I'm<00:03:23.270> not<00:03:23.570> sure<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.110> official<00:03:24.440> retail

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
price I'm not sure the official retail

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.650 
price I'm not sure the official retail
price<00:03:25.070> I<00:03:25.370> think<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:26.030> might<00:03:26.150> be<00:03:26.890> 170<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.660> in

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
price I think it might be 170 and in

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.449 
price I think it might be 170 and in
Japan<00:03:30.050> the<00:03:30.650> street<00:03:30.890> price<00:03:31.070> in<00:03:31.190> these<00:03:31.310> is

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
Japan the street price in these is

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.210 
Japan the street price in these is
around<00:03:31.610> 270<00:03:32.330> or<00:03:32.450> 280<00:03:32.630> with<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.440> retail<00:03:33.770> price<00:03:33.980> I

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
around 270 or 280 with a retail price I

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.760 
around 270 or 280 with a retail price I
think<00:03:34.400> maybe<00:03:34.550> over<00:03:34.910> $300<00:03:35.690> so<00:03:36.380> it's<00:03:36.590> almost

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
think maybe over $300 so it's almost

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.910 
think maybe over $300 so it's almost
half<00:03:37.040> as<00:03:37.220> much<00:03:37.400> in<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.720> US<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.320> hopefully<00:03:39.680> in

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
half as much in the US and hopefully in

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.040 
half as much in the US and hopefully in
other<00:03:40.010> markets<00:03:40.280> too<00:03:40.640> so<00:03:41.239> it's<00:03:41.360> great<00:03:41.540> deal<00:03:41.690> for

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
about that at all it's just interesting

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.550 
about that at all it's just interesting
that<00:04:53.090> they<00:04:53.330> decided<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:53.720> move<00:04:53.930> it<00:04:54.110> you<00:04:54.289> know

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.029 
g-shock same size as all the other ones
check<00:05:13.430> out<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:13.639> other<00:05:13.760> videos<00:05:14.060> I<00:05:14.240> did<00:05:14.300> and

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
check out the other videos I did and

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.750 
check out the other videos I did and
it's<00:05:16.039> just<00:05:16.160> that<00:05:16.250> nice<00:05:16.430> to<00:05:16.520> have<00:05:16.610> in<00:05:16.669> two

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
it's just that nice to have in two

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.159 
it's just that nice to have in two
different<00:05:16.970> color<00:05:17.270> option<00:05:17.660> this<00:05:17.900> one's<00:05:18.110> a

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
different color option this one's a

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.370 
different color option this one's a
little<00:05:18.260> more<00:05:18.410> stealthy<00:05:20.050> probably<00:05:21.050> closest

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
little more stealthy probably closest

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.620 
little more stealthy probably closest
one<00:05:21.500> to<00:05:21.590> this<00:05:21.680> would<00:05:21.860> be<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:22.360> black<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:23.599> red

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
one to this would be the black and red

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.800 
one to this would be the black and red
one<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:24.289> the<00:05:24.800> red<00:05:24.979> one<00:05:25.010> really<00:05:25.630> leaked<00:05:26.630> out

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
one and the red one really leaked out

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.450 
one and the red one really leaked out
more<00:05:27.110> with<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.500> red<00:05:27.620> buttons<00:05:28.010> those<00:05:28.190> bright

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
more with the red buttons those bright

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.460 
more with the red buttons those bright
red<00:05:28.669> this<00:05:29.270> one<00:05:29.450> being<00:05:29.630> blue<00:05:29.870> is<00:05:29.930> a<00:05:30.080> little<00:05:30.139> more

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
red this one being blue is a little more

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:36.339 
red this one being blue is a little more
toned<00:05:30.680> down<00:05:34.419> yeah<00:05:35.419> just<00:05:35.870> kind<00:05:36.020> of<00:05:36.080> warm<00:05:36.260> you

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:36.349 
toned down yeah just kind of warm you

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:37.719 
toned down yeah just kind of warm you
know<00:05:36.440> so<00:05:36.590> it's<00:05:36.770> by<00:05:36.889> the<00:05:36.949> plainest

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
know so it's by the plainest

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.040 
know so it's by the plainest
of<00:05:37.849> the<00:05:38.840> King<00:05:39.050> G<00:05:39.199> shocks<00:05:39.470> out<00:05:39.680> so<00:05:39.830> far<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:41.050> does

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
of the King G shocks out so far and does

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.439 
of the King G shocks out so far and does
have<00:05:42.169> another<00:05:42.410> negative<00:05:42.560> display<00:05:43.300> so<00:05:44.300> it's

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
have another negative display so it's

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:45.310 
have another negative display so it's
nice<00:05:44.570> that<00:05:44.599> you<00:05:44.870> know<00:05:44.960> there's<00:05:45.229> obviously

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
nice that you know there's obviously

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.680 
nice that you know there's obviously
been<00:05:45.680> successful<00:05:46.310> series<00:05:47.240> of<00:05:47.330> watches<00:05:47.449> and

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
been successful series of watches and

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
been successful series of watches and
they're<00:05:48.020> probably<00:05:48.169> more<00:05:48.440> in<00:05:48.560> different

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
they're probably more in different

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.189 
they're probably more in different
colors<00:05:49.099> so<00:05:49.910> you<00:05:50.300> know<00:05:50.389> if<00:05:50.599> you<00:05:50.720> like<00:05:50.870> this<00:05:51.020> one

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
colors so you know if you like this one

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.980 
colors so you know if you like this one
go<00:05:51.349> for<00:05:51.500> it<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:51.800> color<00:05:52.090> if<00:05:53.090> not<00:05:53.330> a.m.<00:05:53.750> and

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
go for it the color if not a.m. and

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.420 
go for it the color if not a.m. and
there<00:05:54.500> probably<00:05:54.740> be<00:05:54.889> some<00:05:55.070> more<00:05:55.250> and<00:05:55.340> be

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
there probably be some more and be

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.409 
there probably be some more and be
interesting<00:05:55.729> see<00:05:55.910> like<00:05:56.060> supposed<00:05:56.240> to<00:05:56.300> do<00:05:56.389> a

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
but there seems like there's probably

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.710 
but there seems like there's probably
gonna<00:06:01.760> be<00:06:01.820> a<00:06:01.880> good<00:06:02.000> number<00:06:02.150> more<00:06:02.419> to<00:06:02.510> choose

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
gonna be a good number more to choose

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.450 
gonna be a good number more to choose
from<00:06:02.990> so<00:06:03.410> there<00:06:03.979> you<00:06:04.070> go<00:06:04.160> the<00:06:04.580> gxw<00:06:05.500> 56e<00:06:06.500> King<00:06:07.250> G
