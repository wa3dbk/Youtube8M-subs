00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello one more week behind and we 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.799
 happy to share the latest news 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.950
 today in the final issue you would be without 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.550
 favorites and outsiders Strait team 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.480
 dignitas 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.660
 the tanks of Vegas and the 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.660
 master class from lefties 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.770
 there was a draw for the final tournament 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.620
 world games 2013 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.739
 well what can I say we have a group 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.800
 death but first things first in the tournament 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.989
 there will be a team from 16 countries all of them 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.670
 divided into four groups of each 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.699
 group in the quarter-finals and goes on 2 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.330
 teams then play the flight to one 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.000
 defeats 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.129
 now about the composition of groups in group d 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.620
 clear favorites look china and 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.780
 germany great britain last year 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.690
 I remember only the bright wigs and 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.000
 good mood so if she or 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.430
 japan shot this year i will 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.030
 strongly surprised in group c will perform 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.850
 vietnam france korea and australia clear 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.880
 vietnam team leader on the past total 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.160
 they ranked fourth in korea position 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.560
 in tanks is not so no tag from others 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.140
 eSports disciplines about teams 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.300
 from france and australia i heard not 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.610
 more you can wait here 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.159
 any turn of events but I think that 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.530
 the top two lines will go to Vietnam 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.630
 and korea go to group b 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.880
 here against the backdrop of a team from Thailand and 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.430
 Taiwan's favorites are Mouse Port and 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.119
 Of course Falk run gaming bronze 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.490
 prize winner of 2012 games is not expected 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.330
 Usa and Poland surely no problem 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.810
 will come out on his 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.119
 Well, at the end of the heat in a group 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.509
 the poor fellow Canadians will be 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.220
 Belarusians Ukrainians and Russians unfortunately 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.740
 how could we all be worried take away 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.159
 Slavs, but some of our stay for 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.320
 overboard 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.880
 remembering the victory of the duster on the team 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.430
 dignitas recent friendly match 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.110
 send 2 Russian team in advance 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.090
 outsider and i won't become 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.400
 I think from this group will be those who 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.440
 can cope with nerves and better 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.720
 others prepare to play rivals 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.910
 comforts one team from one group 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.709
 fall into different halves of the tournament 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.930
 file table means that 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.380
 Slavic final is still possible 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.090
 meat grinder for the title of world champion 2013 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.990
 socialist revolution took place 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.360
 perhaps the main match of the season 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.760
 european league wargaming dignitas 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.040

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.230
 but navi players have few streams on

 word left-handed and see you next week 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.620
 hello everyone with you left-handed and I still 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.930
 I'm afraid the camera in this issue I will tell 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.390
 you about the optimal setup for the team 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.310
 battlefield at the moment can not choose 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.200
 pick a specific card for it 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.330
 the most convenient setup and calm 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.820
 play has to come up 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.890
 universal setups for all cards 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.240
 nearly nine pieces and you need to pick up 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.710
 such a setup so that you can effectively 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.470
 play on all cards 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.550
 and at least 2 of these sites are for those 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.070
 who shoots 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.890
 Exclusively fiercely or secondly 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.300
 for the build of arrows the optimal setup without 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.500
 years and it looks like this is 1390 50100 of 3 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.970
 2 pieces 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.920
 t-34 premium barely t-first inside us 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.480
 90 weak armor piercing to 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.430
 you will need to realize his drum 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.340
 drive into the stern of an enemy tank 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.720
 but in general, because of this you have Tanchiki 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.980
 you can borrow at the beginning of the battle 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.510
 aggressive stance and give in color 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.790
 lip makeup a good breakthrough as on 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.570
 swearing and fighting both on the scum and his 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.470
 can be quite used on all maps 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.120
 only for him not comfortable cards 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.150
 This degree prokhorovka but on them can be 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.530
 realize your drum in most 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.870
 team you fights you will play against 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.200
 heavy setup and you can not do without of 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.570
 3 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.490
 he has a high armor piercing 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.410
 projectile it has alpha damage and 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.970
 good mobility for heavy tank 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.930
 allowing you to play more 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.480
 varied tactics that's 34 good 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.440
 turn and armored tower 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.200
 positioning it will look very 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.330
 not bad in contrast to the same t32 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.400
 he has high armor piercing and 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.820
 you will not be difficult to break through the enemy 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.890
 tanks 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.800
 First I will tell you a little bit 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.960
 later now let's talk about the setup 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.980
 where players shoot gold but in it 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.100
 also left 1390 and 50100 and 1390 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.770
 podkalibera 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.570
 it will be much more effective without any problems 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.330
 you can punch the same is-3 on 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.520
 city ​​map next comes Pershing 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.700
 the advantage of this tank is high pierce 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.120
 and scythe good declension guns 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:22.949
 strong mask and high rate of fire 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.569
 heart of the tank will go well t32 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.639
 it can be used as 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.400
 city ​​maps in the same hospitals 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.289
 also on the terrain where it is so maps 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.900
 will have an edge over their 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:37.199
 rivals at the cost of their impenetrable 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.419
 your choice and 5 tank depends on your 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.469
 wishes she personally i would choose an object 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:42.210
 416 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:44.759
 if you want a harder start 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.370
 remove 50100 or from 3 if more 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:50.900
 mobile then take the virginity 2 or 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:53.669
 Pershing but I would take object 416 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.979
 friends what about you first not 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:58.529
 neglect these tanks take them with 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:01.229
 a fight is not so but of course willing 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:03.150
 but finding at least one firefly can 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:06.629
 as well as shoot down the base how to capture it 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:09.509
 so cut you whole flank just and 

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:12.449
 cut in general on this all do not forget 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:15.229
 leave your comments with criticism and 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:18.979
