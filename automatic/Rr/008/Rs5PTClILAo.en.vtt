they're also associated with Aquarius if
you<00:03:02.290> want<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.530> look<00:03:02.650> at<00:03:02.769> it<00:03:02.890> from<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.130> Western

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
you want to look at it from a Western

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.539 
you want to look at it from a Western

standpoint because Aquarius is governed
by<00:03:06.610> gharanas<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:08.019> number<00:03:08.319> four<00:03:08.620> is<00:03:08.890> a

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
by gharanas and the number four is a

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.550 
by gharanas and the number four is a
your<00:03:09.280> honest<00:03:09.640> number<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:10.569> this<00:03:10.780> will<00:03:10.930> give<00:03:11.140> for

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
your honest number so this will give for

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.250 
you look at a square it always has an
opposing<00:03:56.799> part<00:03:57.299> always<00:03:58.299> has<00:03:58.540> an<00:03:58.720> opposing

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
opposing part always has an opposing

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.129 
opposing part always has an opposing
part<00:03:59.530> afford<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.400> square<00:04:00.940> always<00:04:01.720> has<00:04:01.930> an

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
part afford a square always has an

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.289 
part afford a square always has an
opposing<00:04:02.680> part<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:03.579> when<00:04:03.819> you<00:04:03.910> put<00:04:04.120> that

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
opposing part so when you put that

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.259 
opposing part so when you put that
together<00:04:04.560> then<00:04:05.560> number<00:04:05.799> four<00:04:06.280> using<00:04:07.060> what

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
together then number four using what

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.539 
together then number four using what
have<00:04:07.450> an<00:04:07.600> ideal<00:04:07.989> but<00:04:08.829> then<00:04:09.010> come<00:04:09.250> across

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
have an ideal but then come across

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:10.640 
have an ideal but then come across
something<00:04:09.850> that<00:04:09.940> opposed

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
something that opposed

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.789 
something that opposed
that<00:04:10.890> ideal<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.030> becomes<00:04:12.420> sort<00:04:12.750> of<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:13.110> left

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
that ideal so it becomes sort of a left

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.189 
that ideal so it becomes sort of a left
and<00:04:14.040> right<00:04:14.129> they<00:04:14.790> think<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.329> way<00:04:15.569> one<00:04:15.840> minute

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
and right they think this way one minute

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.199 
and right they think this way one minute
think<00:04:16.470> that<00:04:16.709> opposite<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.400> next<00:04:17.759> minute<00:04:18.060> is

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
think that opposite the next minute is

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.699 
think that opposite the next minute is
because<00:04:18.810> they're<00:04:19.019> trying<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.320> find<00:04:19.560> that

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
because they're trying to find that

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.740 
because they're trying to find that
perfect<00:04:20.009> balance<00:04:20.430> once<00:04:21.269> they<00:04:21.419> find<00:04:21.660> that

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
perfect balance once they find that

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.290 
perfect balance once they find that
perfect<00:04:22.019> balance<00:04:22.259> it's<00:04:22.770> our<00:04:22.919> rap<00:04:23.220> it's<00:04:24.000> in

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
perfect balance it's our rap it's in

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.990 
perfect balance it's our rap it's in
