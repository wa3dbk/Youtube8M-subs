00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.860 
comment section below if you think
acceleration<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.820> more<00:00:57.270> important<00:00:57.750> than

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
acceleration is more important than

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.750 
acceleration is more important than
sprint<00:00:58.230> speed<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.949> year's<00:00:59.250> ultimate

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
sprint speed in this year's ultimate

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.880 
sprint speed in this year's ultimate
team<00:00:59.910> because<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.180> feel<00:01:00.510> acceleration<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.289> more

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
team because I feel acceleration is more

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.500 
team because I feel acceleration is more
important<00:01:02.430> than<00:01:02.579> sprint<00:01:02.940> speed<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.270> this

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
important than sprint speed in this

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.119 
important than sprint speed in this
year's<00:01:03.719> ultimate<00:01:04.080> team<00:01:04.199> because<00:01:04.439> Soros<00:01:05.100> has

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
year's ultimate team because Soros has

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.950 
year's ultimate team because Soros has
very<00:01:05.580> high<00:01:05.640> acceleration<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:06.600> he<00:01:06.720> drops

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
very high acceleration but then he drops

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.300 
very high acceleration but then he drops
down<00:01:07.110> when<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.380> comes<00:01:07.530> down<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> sprint<00:01:08.130> speed

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
down when it comes down to sprint speed

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.910 
down when it comes down to sprint speed
but<00:01:08.970> he<00:01:09.150> seems<00:01:09.510> very<00:01:09.600> very<00:01:10.080> fast<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.619> think<00:01:10.830> he

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
but he seems very very fast I think he

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.130 
but he seems very very fast I think he
does<00:01:11.070> live<00:01:11.280> up<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.580> his<00:01:11.670> pace<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.479> his<00:01:12.600> constant

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
does live up to his pace on his constant

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.320 
does live up to his pace on his constant
now<00:01:13.590> he's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.860> very<00:01:14.280> good<00:01:14.549> finisher<00:01:14.970> he's<00:01:15.119> very

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
now he's a very good finisher he's very

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480 
now he's a very good finisher he's very
clinical<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> penalty<00:01:16.200> area<00:01:16.490> amazing

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
clinical in the penalty area amazing

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
clinical in the penalty area amazing
like<00:01:17.640> everything<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.570> shoot<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.110> him

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
like everything you you shoot for him

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.140 
like everything you you shoot for him
inside<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.740> penalty<00:01:20.009> area<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.729> will<00:01:20.939> most

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
inside the penalty area it will most

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.330 
inside the penalty area it will most
likely<00:01:21.360> be<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.630> go<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.080> what<00:01:22.350> makes<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.040> nice
