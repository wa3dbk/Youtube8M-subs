00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.410
 Review 8 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.240
 a scene on the cover Kassel in Munich 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.299
 the personal life came 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.570
 Here he made two short breaks and interviewed her 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:15.720
 the influence of each piece of artist on the stage 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.449
 Comic is amazing 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.640
 Rainer all the great superheroes are from artists of Jewish descent 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.640
 The project is the way to the litter 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.659
 karl-josef Neukirchen are in my opinion, these artists do not have 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.530
 consciously incorporate their protégés in their stories 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.879
 It just happened because they were June because of their experiences 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.809
 Thus, they have been described as writing 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.300
 Guardians of the Universe who founded the Green Lantern Corps 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.500
 for example, on the founding fathers of the State of Israel 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.090
 Warnecke in Mainz out 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.600
 that was also better networked 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.160
 but also in the American comics often Jewish topics are too 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.180
 Find 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.560
 Leistner has made a name for himself as the inventor of the graphic novel 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.860
 The Grand Master often deals with his in the comics 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.340
 Fate of Jewish immigrants 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.750
 as Biedermann has with Müh Mouse a unique work on the track 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.060
 created in the Jews as mice represents the Nazis as cats 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.550
 is a milestone today 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.979
 Now two new volumes have appeared which in their own way are Jewish themes comic 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:28.890
 to treat 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.760
 the American Jason Terry with rare market day a day in the life of the poet 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.230
 People at the beginning of the twentieth century no 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.660
 Due to lack of demand 7 mm threatens its existence and represents the 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.480
 Future of his craft 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.030
 and he does not mean to be just 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.650
 because actually I do not have the intention to start a business at all 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.090
 do 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.799
 I chose the story in this only because of that 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.049
 Frame play 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.799
 if I have photos about East European life before the Holocaust on the subject 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:03.940
 have addressed 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.260
 Looking at these pictures was always very sad for me, that I was with him 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.980
 All humans had to be killed and murdered 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.389
 but I did not like to see them only in the light of this tragedy 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.099
 I tried something in the life of these people again 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.869
 nobody needs to return 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:22.679
 w 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.679

 Misstöne the self-director of a comic school in the United States Kleindienst 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.249

 his cartilage forces are doing just as elaborately wrapped the rugs the 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.569
 People trying to sell 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.599
 his portrait of the market at the beginning of industrialization is emotional 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.009
 tells it wise reforms are sprouts a new proof that the 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.390
 Comment in the bites as a serious narrative form 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.390
 interpret that way 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.659
 this also applies to the travel journal Israel understand in 60 days or 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:02.279
 fewer

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.550
 for young people between 18 and 26 years 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.470
 the more about their Jewish identity and about the history of the country and 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.169
 want to drive his

 it is the tester it is a very subjective carries the story 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.310
 It is about the inner struggle of a man who tries his Jewish 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:28.570
 To reconcile identity with it 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.070
 that you are too strong as us americans israel so it is more 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.440
 It's about a personal journey and less about telling the reader 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.070
 in the middle east conflict or something like that, Israel is Paris 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.589
 The form of autobiographical travel reportage suffered this 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:47.120
 Comic is becoming more popular 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.670
 In the McLaren, the author wants to take a journey deep into the heart of the center

 Land under these three titles and he holds a unique history lesson 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.199
 besides telling, he sets himself apart from her experiences and her doubts 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.519
 These touches on the descriptions can be difficult to escape 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.009
 now it applies too 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:05.010
 when he was there 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.510
 as you get older it is important to lack one's viewpoints

 checked and sometimes the perspective changes to the other side of a 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.650
 To consider problems 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.739
 or to hear another opinion the crucial thing is the difference 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.360
 between understanding another position and agreeing to it 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.249
 recognize 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:25.669
 You do not always have to agree with one but you should always 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.219
 try to put yourself in their position to understand why they are so 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:32.339
 think even if you disagree with others 

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:36.229
