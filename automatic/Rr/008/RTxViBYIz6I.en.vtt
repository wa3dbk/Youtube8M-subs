now<00:00:18.740> found<00:00:19.010> as<00:00:19.220> a<00:00:19.250> more<00:00:19.550> power<00:00:19.970> to<00:00:20.450> our<00:00:20.480> science

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
now found as a more power to our science

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.260 
now found as a more power to our science
because<00:00:21.349> as<00:00:21.529> we<00:00:21.680> all<00:00:21.710> know<00:00:21.860> power<00:00:22.670> equals

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
because as we all know power equals

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.050 
because as we all know power equals
bullion<00:00:24.140> asst<00:00:24.349> here<00:00:25.160> UL<00:00:25.400> it<00:00:25.580> so<00:00:25.880> let's

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
bullion asst here UL it so let's

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.999 
bullion asst here UL it so let's
supersize<00:00:26.869> our<00:00:27.110> size<00:00:27.410> and<00:00:27.680> give<00:00:27.770> it<00:00:27.860> some<00:00:27.980> more

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
supersize our size and give it some more

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.640 
supersize our size and give it some more
foul<00:00:28.640> one<00:00:28.939> now<00:00:29.360> hell<00:00:29.930> it<00:00:30.050> could<00:00:30.079> you<00:00:30.349> please

I<00:00:55.960> remember<00:00:56.960> this<00:00:57.080> one<00:00:57.140> mmm<00:00:57.770> you<00:00:58.040> poured<00:00:58.370> some

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
I remember this one mmm you poured some

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.400 
I remember this one mmm you poured some
liquid<00:00:59.060> nitrogen<00:00:59.510> onto<00:00:59.840> a<00:01:00.140> bowl<00:01:00.380> of

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
liquid nitrogen onto a bowl of

room-temperature water and straight away

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.140 
room-temperature water and straight away
we<00:01:02.930> got<00:01:03.050> this<00:01:03.140> spooky<00:01:03.860> fog<00:01:04.160> bubbling<00:01:04.850> over<00:01:04.970> the

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
we got this spooky fog bubbling over the

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.110 
we got this spooky fog bubbling over the
edge<00:01:05.270> of<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.510> bowl<00:01:05.810> but<00:01:06.770> how<00:01:07.160> are<00:01:07.760> you<00:01:07.970> gonna

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.560 
edge of the bowl but how are you gonna
supersize<00:01:08.540> that<00:01:09.940> hey<00:01:11.620> whoa<00:01:12.640> with<00:01:13.640> war<00:01:14.030> liquid

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
supersize that hey whoa with war liquid

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.560 
supersize that hey whoa with war liquid
nitrogen<00:01:15.050> and<00:01:15.380> a<00:01:15.440> bigger<00:01:15.950> tub<00:01:16.310> of<00:01:16.490> water<00:01:16.820> you

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
nitrogen and a bigger tub of water you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.740 
nitrogen and a bigger tub of water you
mean<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.780> pool<00:01:18.140> I<00:01:18.590> mean<00:01:19.070> a<00:01:19.100> swimming<00:01:19.760> pool<00:01:20.030> Yeah

mean a pool I mean a swimming pool Yeah
right<00:01:21.070> get<00:01:22.070> your<00:01:22.250> liquid<00:01:22.580> nitrogen<00:01:23.050> suck<00:01:24.050> it

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
right get your liquid nitrogen suck it

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:42.070 
right get your liquid nitrogen suck it
in<00:01:27.880> that<00:01:28.880> is<00:01:29.090> awesome<00:01:29.300> let's<00:01:29.960> go<00:01:40.630> lost<00:01:41.630> Elliot
