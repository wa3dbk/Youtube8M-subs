power power it will usually kill with

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.650 
power power it will usually kill with
one<00:01:08.710> shot<00:01:09.009> on<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.340> close<00:01:09.520> range<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.090> the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
one shot on the close range and to the

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.990

two week shots on the middle range most

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.600 
two week shots on the middle range most
shotguns<00:01:13.330> are<00:01:13.750> useless<00:01:14.380> in<00:01:14.530> middle<00:01:14.920> range<00:01:15.130> but

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
shotguns are useless in middle range but

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.330 
shotguns are useless in middle range but
Soto<00:01:15.970> can<00:01:16.390> actually<00:01:16.660> do<00:01:16.810> pretty<00:01:17.200> well<00:01:17.560> it<00:01:18.039> can

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
Soto can actually do pretty well it can

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.430 
Soto can actually do pretty well it can
kill<00:01:18.550> enemy<00:01:19.000> with<00:01:19.149> two<00:01:19.360> shots<00:01:19.630> sometime<00:01:20.229> if

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
kill enemy with two shots sometime if

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.010 
kill enemy with two shots sometime if
you<00:01:20.530> get<00:01:20.680> really<00:01:20.890> lucky<00:01:21.160> and<00:01:21.640> you<00:01:22.149> can<00:01:22.539> enter

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
you get really lucky and you can enter

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.590 
you get really lucky and you can enter
the<00:01:23.110> head<00:01:23.290> or<00:01:23.530> your<00:01:23.830> bullets<00:01:24.250> shot

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the head or your bullets shot

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.690 
the head or your bullets shot
accidentally<00:01:25.600> or<00:01:25.900> not<00:01:26.260> accidentally<00:01:26.860> shot<00:01:27.490> to

accidentally or not accidentally shot to
the<00:01:27.820> head<00:01:28.000> then<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:28.810> probably<00:01:29.170> are<00:01:29.350> going<00:01:29.470> to

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
the head then you probably are going to

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.170
