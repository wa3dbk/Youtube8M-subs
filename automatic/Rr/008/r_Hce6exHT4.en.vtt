you that's a work in progress mutant 2.0
from<00:00:05.819> petty<00:00:06.210> SAP<00:00:06.450> what<00:00:07.440> it<00:00:07.560> finished<00:00:07.980> and

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
from petty SAP what it finished and

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.799 
from petty SAP what it finished and
still<00:00:08.460> some<00:00:08.610> improvements<00:00:09.150> can<00:00:09.330> be<00:00:09.360> made<00:00:09.480> but

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
still some improvements can be made but

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.339 
still some improvements can be made but
I<00:00:09.870> think<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.500> will<00:00:10.650> like<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.099> video<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:12.349> one

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
I think you will like that video and one

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.240 
I think you will like that video and one
thing<00:00:13.620> upfront

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
thing upfront

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.039 
thing upfront
I<00:00:14.370> am<00:00:14.519> at<00:00:14.700> home<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.179> I'm<00:00:15.269> using<00:00:15.509> some<00:00:15.900> very

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
I am at home and I'm using some very

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.470 
I am at home and I'm using some very
cheap<00:00:16.470> recording<00:00:17.010> equipment<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.670> somehow

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
cheap recording equipment and somehow

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.800 
cheap recording equipment and somehow
the<00:00:18.750> sound<00:00:19.400> recording<00:00:20.400> from<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.820> n64<00:00:21.449> games

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
the sound recording from the n64 games

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.380 
the sound recording from the n64 games
is<00:00:22.109> very<00:00:22.470> weird<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:23.010> pitches<00:00:23.820> up<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.150> down<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
is very weird it pitches up and down a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.720 
is very weird it pitches up and down a
bit<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:24.930> sounds<00:00:25.380> well<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.220> sometimes<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
bit and in sounds well it's sometimes it

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.419 
bit and in sounds well it's sometimes it
sounds<00:00:27.150> just<00:00:27.420> wrong<00:00:27.949> that's<00:00:28.949> only<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
sounds just wrong that's only the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.269 
sounds just wrong that's only the
recording<00:00:30.150> though<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:31.170> comes<00:00:31.439> correctly<00:00:32.160> out

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
recording though it comes correctly out

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.430 
recording though it comes correctly out

of the Pandora well and now enjoy the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.030 
of the Pandora well and now enjoy the
video<00:00:35.809> that<00:00:36.809> start<00:00:37.110> was<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> bit<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.649> Paper

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
video that start was a bit of Paper

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.819 
video that start was a bit of Paper
Mario<00:00:38.300> a<00:00:39.300> few<00:00:39.690> graphical<00:00:40.110> glitches<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:40.770> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
Mario a few graphical glitches here and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.030 
Mario a few graphical glitches here and
there<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.430> as<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.030> fully<00:00:42.329> playable

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
there but as you can see fully playable

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.470 
there but as you can see fully playable
and<00:00:44.040> only<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> bit<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.730> sound<00:00:45.059> soldering

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and only a bit of sound soldering

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.229 
and only a bit of sound soldering
whenever<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.289> open<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.070> menu<00:00:47.219> or<00:00:47.610> come<00:00:47.969> into

whenever you open the menu or come into

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.010 
whenever you open the menu or come into
a<00:00:48.270> battle<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.809> think<00:00:49.140> that's<00:00:49.590> ok<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.899> work<00:00:51.899> in

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
a battle I think that's ok for work in

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:32.990 
a battle I think that's ok for work in
progress

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.490 

right<00:01:34.000> now<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.540> configuration<00:01:34.840> is<00:01:35.290> being

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
right now the configuration is being

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.850 
right now the configuration is being
done<00:01:35.650> through<00:01:35.860> text<00:01:36.220> files<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.820> there's<00:01:37.060> no

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
done through text files and there's no

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.100 
done through text files and there's no
saving<00:01:38.860> per<00:01:39.100> game<00:01:39.400> but<00:01:40.030> that's<00:01:40.240> what's<00:01:40.600> pretty

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
saving per game but that's what's pretty

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.710 
saving per game but that's what's pretty
simple<00:01:41.770> would<00:01:41.950> like<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.520> improve<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.330> new<00:01:43.480> GUI

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
simple would like to improve a new GUI

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.020 
simple would like to improve a new GUI
so<00:01:44.080> that<00:01:44.350> each<00:01:44.650> game<00:01:45.040> can<00:01:45.370> save<00:01:45.670> its<00:01:45.880> own

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
so that each game can save its own

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.430 
so that each game can save its own
settings<00:01:46.510> and<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:46.900> it<00:01:47.020> will<00:01:47.170> be<00:01:47.260> more

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
settings and that it will be more

00:01:47.440 --> 00:02:55.640 
settings and that it will be more
comfortable<00:01:47.680> for<00:01:48.550> the<00:01:48.610> public<00:01:48.940> release

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.470 

what's<00:02:56.650> also<00:02:56.890> neatest<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.640> glad<00:02:58.000> allows<00:02:58.300> you

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
what's also neatest that glad allows you

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.680 
what's also neatest that glad allows you
to<00:02:58.660> use<00:02:58.870> high<00:02:59.650> res<00:02:59.860> texture<00:03:00.220> pegs<00:03:00.580> which<00:03:00.970> make

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
to use high res texture pegs which make

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.750 
to use high res texture pegs which make
the<00:03:01.930> games<00:03:02.170> look<00:03:02.800> a<00:03:02.950> lot<00:03:03.280> better

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
the games look a lot better

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.840 
the games look a lot better
of<00:03:04.630> course<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:05.080> slows<00:03:05.410> down<00:03:05.520> things<00:03:06.520> a<00:03:06.670> bit

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
of course it slows down things a bit

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.470 
of course it slows down things a bit
because<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.450> needs<00:03:07.660> more<00:03:07.990> memory<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:09.330> need<00:03:10.330> to

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
because it needs more memory and need to

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.170 
because it needs more memory and need to
load<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.750> textures<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.380> SD<00:03:11.770> card<00:03:12.040> but<00:03:12.850> as

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
load the textures of the SD card but as

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.290 
load the textures of the SD card but as
you<00:03:13.300> can<00:03:13.480> see<00:03:13.660> with<00:03:13.840> Mario<00:03:14.350> 64<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.250> looks<00:03:15.670> great

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
you can see with Mario 64 it looks great

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.190 
you can see with Mario 64 it looks great
and<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:17.260> playable<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.660> case<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:20.050> won't

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
and is playable so in case you won't

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.050 
and is playable so in case you won't
believe<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.709> it's<00:03:20.950> really<00:03:21.400> running<00:03:21.760> alive

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
believe it it's really running alive

00:03:22.060 --> 00:04:27.140 
believe it it's really running alive
Endora<00:03:22.420> here's<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.050> proof

he's on banjo kazooie first with
texturepack<00:04:30.550> enhancement<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.530> bit<00:04:32.530> slower<00:04:32.800> and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
texturepack enhancement a bit slower and

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.080 
texturepack enhancement a bit slower and
it<00:04:33.130> is<00:04:33.250> battery<00:04:33.580> but<00:04:33.820> looking<00:04:34.600> stunning<00:04:36.090> 12

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
it is battery but looking stunning 12

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
it is battery but looking stunning 12
and<00:04:37.270> that<00:04:37.510> is<00:04:37.690> without

and that is without

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.270 
and that is without
texturepack<00:04:38.710> enhancement<00:04:40.979> now<00:04:41.979> with

time runs okay of course slows down when

00:05:36.169 --> 00:06:00.520 
time runs okay of course slows down when

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530
