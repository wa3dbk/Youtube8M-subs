basically<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.150> just<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.420> syncing<00:00:18.750> and

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
basically it's just a syncing and

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.990 
basically it's just a syncing and
charging<00:00:19.260> cable<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.760> indicates<00:00:20.760> the

now<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.670> pretty<00:00:24.240> interesting<00:00:24.449> because

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
now this is pretty interesting because

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.420 
now this is pretty interesting because
instead<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.320> having<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.710> take<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.980> look<00:00:26.220> at<00:00:26.310> your

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
instead of having to take a look at your

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.620 
instead of having to take a look at your
device<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> see<00:00:26.939> if<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.150> charged<00:00:27.449> or<00:00:27.539> not

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
device to see if it's charged or not

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.029 
device to see if it's charged or not
you'll<00:00:27.900> be<00:00:27.960> able<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.380> check<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.740> out

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
you'll be able to check it out

thanks<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> lighting<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.660> cable<00:00:31.050> so

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
thanks to the lighting in the cable so

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.990 
thanks to the lighting in the cable so
it<00:00:31.590> lights<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:31.949> when<00:00:32.219> it's<00:00:32.369> charging<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.820> fact

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
it lights up when it's charging in fact

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.600 
it lights up when it's charging in fact
there's<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.210> little<00:00:33.829> animation<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> little<00:00:35.160> sort

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
there's a little animation a little sort

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.549 
there's a little animation a little sort
of<00:00:35.640> pattern<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.780> cable<00:00:37.140> while<00:00:37.350> it's

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
of pattern to the cable while it's

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.660 
of pattern to the cable while it's
charging<00:00:37.620> we'll<00:00:37.980> take<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> look<00:00:38.309> at<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.520> once

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
charging we'll take a look at that once

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.490 
charging we'll take a look at that once
we<00:00:38.790> get<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.059> plugged<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.719> then<00:00:40.170> once<00:00:40.350> it's

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
we get it plugged in and then once it's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.869 
we get it plugged in and then once it's
done<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:40.920> turns<00:00:41.190> off<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.730> know

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
done it just turns off and so you know

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.490 
done it just turns off and so you know

or green so I have the white cable with
the<00:00:53.579> blue<00:00:53.969> lighting<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.870> we're<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.260> to

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the blue lighting and we're going to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.660 
the blue lighting and we're going to
take<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> look<00:00:55.590> around<00:00:55.710> now<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.309> important<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
take a look around now it's important to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.549 
take a look around now it's important to
note<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.840> LED<00:00:58.350> technology

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
note that this is not an LED technology

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.560 
note that this is not an LED technology
this<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.129> electro<00:00:59.730> luminescence<00:01:00.210> that's

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
this is electro luminescence that's

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.810 
this is electro luminescence that's
actually<00:01:00.960> technology<00:01:01.289> used<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.949> car<00:01:02.280> interior

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
actually technology used in car interior

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.820 
actually technology used in car interior
lighting<00:01:03.059> now<00:01:03.660> taking<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> close<00:01:04.290> look<00:01:04.320> at<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
lighting now taking a close look at the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.960 
lighting now taking a close look at the
cable<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.700> very

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
cable you can see we have this very

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.960 
cable you can see we have this very
large<00:01:06.180> USB<00:01:06.750> housing<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:07.229> power<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.740> that

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
large USB housing which power is that

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.219 
large USB housing which power is that
electroluminescent<00:01:08.970> lighting<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> cable

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
electroluminescent lighting in the cable

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.780 
electroluminescent lighting in the cable
so<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.680> course<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.979> needs<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.250> larger<00:01:11.640> now

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
so of course it needs to be larger now

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.730 
so of course it needs to be larger now
if<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.180> look<00:01:12.360> at<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> standard<00:01:12.930> apple<00:01:13.439> cable

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
if you look at a standard apple cable

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.499 
if you look at a standard apple cable
you<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.100> there's<00:01:14.700> almost<00:01:14.850> three<00:01:15.299> times

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
you can see there's almost three times

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.840 
you can see there's almost three times
or<00:01:15.930> four<00:01:15.960> times<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.590> big<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> apple<00:01:17.520> cable

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
or four times as big as the apple cable

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.149 
or four times as big as the apple cable
same<00:01:18.360> story<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.229> dock<00:01:19.500> connector<00:01:19.710> it's

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
same story with the dock connector it's

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.060 
same story with the dock connector it's
also<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.330> low<00:01:21.540> profile<00:01:22.140> as<00:01:22.350> Apple's<00:01:22.710> cable

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
also not as low profile as Apple's cable

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.190 
also not as low profile as Apple's cable
now<00:01:23.700> they<00:01:23.880> also<00:01:24.030> threw<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.630> deck<00:01:24.960> some

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
now they also threw in this deck some

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.260 
now they also threw in this deck some
branded<00:01:25.770> wire<00:01:26.220> tie<00:01:26.549> which<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.970> don't<00:01:27.030> believe

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
branded wire tie which I don't believe

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.270 
branded wire tie which I don't believe
is<00:01:27.420> permanent<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> fact<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.799> think<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.130> can

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
is permanent the fact I can think I can

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.770 
is permanent the fact I can think I can
kill<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.520> right<00:01:29.729> off<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.119> go<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
kill this right off there you go so you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
kill this right off there you go so you
can<00:01:30.840> keep<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.350> or<00:01:31.770> take<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.189> off<00:01:32.340> now<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
can keep it on or take it off now the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.429 
can keep it on or take it off now the
other<00:01:33.270> difference<00:01:33.720> between<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
other difference between this and the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.080 
other difference between this and the
Apple<00:01:34.740> cable<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> fact<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.700> dexon

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
Apple cable is the fact that the dexon

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.510 
Apple cable is the fact that the dexon
cable<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.840> shorter<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.250> match<00:01:38.490> it

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
cable is shorter so if we match it

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.700 
cable is shorter so if we match it
end-to-end<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.360> see<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.320> dexon

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
end-to-end you can see that the dexon

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.580 
end-to-end you can see that the dexon
cable<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.189> maybe<00:01:41.729> six<00:01:42.450> inches<00:01:42.750> shorter<00:01:43.200> than

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
cable is maybe six inches shorter than

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.830 
cable is maybe six inches shorter than
the<00:01:43.799> apple<00:01:44.159> cable<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> laser<00:01:45.659> we

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the apple cable so in the laser we

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.120 
the apple cable so in the laser we
actually<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> bit<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.470> information<00:01:47.009> which

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
actually have a bit of information which

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.100 
actually have a bit of information which
is<00:01:47.250> useful<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.540> see<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
is useful here so we can see that the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.410 
is useful here so we can see that the
pattern<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.100> light<00:01:50.430> strobing<00:01:51.000> along<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
pattern of the light strobing along the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.510 
pattern of the light strobing along the
cable<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.930> indicative<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.710> its<00:01:52.950> charging

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
cable is indicative of its charging

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.130 
cable is indicative of its charging
status<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.149> well<00:01:54.360> since<00:01:54.630> not<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:54.990> whether

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
status as well since not just whether

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.870 
status as well since not just whether
it's<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.409> or<00:01:55.590> off<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.579> see<00:01:56.700> that

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
it's on or off so if you can see that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.370 
it's on or off so if you can see that
the<00:01:57.000> pattern<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.329> moving<00:01:57.659> fast<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.229> see

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the pattern is moving fast you can see

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.370 
the pattern is moving fast you can see
that<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.189> about<00:01:59.909> 65%<00:02:00.600> battery<00:02:01.200> life<00:02:01.350> or

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
that we have about 65% battery life or

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.100 
that we have about 65% battery life or
less<00:02:01.740> slow<00:02:02.640> means<00:02:02.909> we're<00:02:03.090> almost<00:02:03.360> charged<00:02:03.869> so

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
less slow means we're almost charged so

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.889 
less slow means we're almost charged so
about<00:02:04.229> 65<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.920> 99<00:02:05.520> percent<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.540> shuts<00:02:06.750> off

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
about 65 to 99 percent and it shuts off

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.169 
about 65 to 99 percent and it shuts off
once<00:02:07.200> we're<00:02:07.380> at<00:02:07.409> 100%<00:02:08.099> already<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:08.970> let's<00:02:09.119> go

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
once we're at 100% already so let's go

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.699 
once we're at 100% already so let's go
ahead<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.360> connect<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.869> my<00:02:09.899> macbook<00:02:10.560> air

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
ahead and connect it to my macbook air

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.140 
ahead and connect it to my macbook air
to<00:02:10.830> take<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> look<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.340> see<00:02:11.400> how<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.730> cable

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
to take a look to see how this cable

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.110 
to take a look to see how this cable
looks

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
looks

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.059 
looks
and<00:02:13.300> I<00:02:13.360> can<00:02:13.510> see<00:02:13.629> it<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:14.019> illuminated<00:02:14.830> has<00:02:14.950> this

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
and I can see it is illuminated has this

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.190 
and I can see it is illuminated has this
nice<00:02:15.310> strobing<00:02:16.000> pattern<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.599> begins<00:02:17.019> from

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
nice strobing pattern that begins from

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.110 
nice strobing pattern that begins from
the<00:02:17.319> tip<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:18.099> dot<00:02:18.280> connector<00:02:18.700> all<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.060> way

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
the tip of the dot connector all the way

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.600 
the tip of the dot connector all the way
to<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.420> base<00:02:19.629> of<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.930> USB<00:02:20.440> housing<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.489> can

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
to the base of the USB housing you can

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.130 
to the base of the USB housing you can
see<00:02:21.760> it's<00:02:21.879> strobing<00:02:22.450> even<00:02:22.870> though<00:02:22.930> it's<00:02:23.080> not

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
see it's strobing even though it's not

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.420 
see it's strobing even though it's not
connected<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.560> anything<00:02:23.650> right<00:02:24.040> now<00:02:24.099> this

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
connected to anything right now this

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.100 
connected to anything right now this
will<00:02:24.670> stop<00:02:25.000> eventually<00:02:25.420> this<00:02:25.510> will<00:02:25.720> power<00:02:25.900> off

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
will stop eventually this will power off

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.630 
will stop eventually this will power off
onto<00:02:26.349> determines<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:26.980> nothing<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.459> actually

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
onto determines that nothing is actually

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.940 
onto determines that nothing is actually
connected<00:02:28.300> but<00:02:29.200> soon<00:02:29.379> as<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.500> connect<00:02:29.769> to<00:02:29.860> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
connected but soon as you connect to the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.009 
connected but soon as you connect to the
device<00:02:30.160> like<00:02:30.430> an<00:02:30.610> iPhone<00:02:30.730> here<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.780> can<00:02:31.900> see

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
device like an iPhone here you can see

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.360 
device like an iPhone here you can see
that<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.349> strolling<00:02:32.860> pattern<00:02:33.190> will<00:02:33.340> change

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
that the strolling pattern will change

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.509 
that the strolling pattern will change
it<00:02:33.970> speeds<00:02:34.390> up<00:02:34.629> as<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:35.680> reads<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.250> device

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
it speeds up as it reads the device

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.910 
it speeds up as it reads the device
first<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.450> determine<00:02:37.750> that's<00:02:38.080> charged<00:02:38.500> as<00:02:38.709> you

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
first to determine that's charged as you

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.470 
first to determine that's charged as you
can<00:02:39.010> see<00:02:39.160> it's<00:02:39.280> almost<00:02:39.430> fully<00:02:39.790> charged<00:02:40.239> here

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
can see it's almost fully charged here

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.330 
can see it's almost fully charged here
so<00:02:41.019> once<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:41.319> determine<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:41.830> charge<00:02:42.069> test

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
so once this determine the charge test

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.100 
so once this determine the charge test
it<00:02:42.519> will<00:02:42.640> slow<00:02:42.940> down<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.420> indicate<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.780> it's

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
it will slow down to indicate that it's

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.190 
it will slow down to indicate that it's
almost<00:02:44.349> fully<00:02:44.650> charged<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:46.780> can<00:02:46.900> see<00:02:47.079> it's

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
almost fully charged so you can see it's

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.949 
almost fully charged so you can see it's
adjusted<00:02:47.709> now<00:02:48.069> this<00:02:48.310> device<00:02:48.730> was<00:02:49.180> low<00:02:49.599> it

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
adjusted now this device was low it

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.240 
adjusted now this device was low it
would<00:02:50.170> be<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.560> would<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.010> same

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
would be it would have that same

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.670 
would be it would have that same
high-speed<00:02:52.110> strobe<00:02:53.110> when<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.260> saw<00:02:53.470> him<00:02:53.620> when

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
high-speed strobe when you saw him when

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.830 
high-speed strobe when you saw him when
I<00:02:53.739> initially<00:02:54.069> connected<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.849> so<00:02:55.420> once<00:02:55.690> it's

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
I initially connected it so once it's

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.080 
I initially connected it so once it's
done<00:02:55.959> charging<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.709> turns<00:02:57.130> solid<00:02:57.579> and<00:02:57.760> then<00:02:57.940> it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
done charging it turns solid and then it

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.479 
done charging it turns solid and then it
powers<00:02:58.510> off<00:02:58.769> of<00:02:59.769> course<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.129> can<00:03:00.250> see<00:03:00.370> this

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
powers off of course you can see this

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.640 
powers off of course you can see this
also<00:03:00.730> works<00:03:01.150> with<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.569> iPad<00:03:02.110> so<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.319> can<00:03:02.500> see

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
also works with the iPad so you can see

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.339 
also works with the iPad so you can see
even<00:03:02.860> though<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.160> iPad<00:03:03.819> is<00:03:03.970> at<00:03:04.090> 94%<00:03:04.690> charge

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
even though this iPad is at 94% charge

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.559 
even though this iPad is at 94% charge
you<00:03:05.890> do<00:03:06.010> have<00:03:06.190> this<00:03:06.280> high-speed<00:03:06.640> strobing

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
you do have this high-speed strobing

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.970 
you do have this high-speed strobing
effect<00:03:07.660> which<00:03:08.019> indicates<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.860> battery

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
effect which indicates that the battery

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.309 
effect which indicates that the battery
is<00:03:09.280> lower<00:03:09.519> than<00:03:09.730> 65%<00:03:10.239> so<00:03:10.959> I<00:03:10.989> think<00:03:11.079> this

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
is lower than 65% so I think this

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.660 
is lower than 65% so I think this
behaves<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.769> little<00:03:11.860> differently<00:03:11.980> with<00:03:12.579> the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
behaves a little differently with the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.330 
behaves a little differently with the
iPad<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.420> does<00:03:13.599> the<00:03:13.750> iPhone<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:14.620> keep<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:15.040> in

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
iPad and does the iPhone so keep that in

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.580 
iPad and does the iPhone so keep that in
mind<00:03:15.670> now<00:03:16.599> something<00:03:16.930> I've<00:03:17.079> also<00:03:17.230> discovered

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
mind now something I've also discovered

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.680 
mind now something I've also discovered
here<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.250> iPod<00:03:18.700> nanos<00:03:19.209> do<00:03:19.450> not

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
here is that the iPod nanos do not

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.690 
here is that the iPod nanos do not
display<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.530> lighting<00:03:21.190> effect<00:03:21.519> when

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
display the lighting effect when

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.309 
display the lighting effect when
charging<00:03:22.209> so<00:03:22.420> for<00:03:22.840> example<00:03:23.139> I<00:03:23.170> have<00:03:23.260> a

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
charging so for example I have a

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.050 
charging so for example I have a
partially<00:03:23.769> charged<00:03:24.250> nano<00:03:24.549> here<00:03:24.819> and<00:03:24.940> it's

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
partially charged nano here and it's

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.509 
partially charged nano here and it's
charging<00:03:25.510> right<00:03:25.660> now<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:25.989> my<00:03:26.139> macbook<00:03:26.410> air<00:03:26.799> but

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
charging right now on my macbook air but

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.920 
charging right now on my macbook air but
it's<00:03:27.819> not<00:03:27.970> drawing<00:03:28.209> enough<00:03:28.450> current<00:03:28.780> to

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
it's not drawing enough current to

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.860 
it's not drawing enough current to
activate<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:30.299> Lightning<00:03:31.299> effect<00:03:31.389> in<00:03:31.780> the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
activate the Lightning effect in the

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.020 
activate the Lightning effect in the
cable<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.680> when<00:03:33.069> you're<00:03:33.160> charging<00:03:33.430> nanos<00:03:33.880> you

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
cable so when you're charging nanos you

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.430 
cable so when you're charging nanos you
will<00:03:34.180> not<00:03:34.299> see<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:34.599> effect<00:03:34.930> but<00:03:35.139> everything

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
will not see this effect but everything

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.990 
will not see this effect but everything
else<00:03:35.590> does<00:03:35.859> seem<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.130> display<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.849> line

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
else does seem to display the line

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.420 
else does seem to display the line
effects<00:03:37.450> so<00:03:37.599> that<00:03:37.630> includes<00:03:38.079> iPod<00:03:38.859> classics

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
effects so that includes iPod classics

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.490 
effects so that includes iPod classics
even<00:03:39.639> the<00:03:39.760> old<00:03:40.060> IFI<00:03:40.450> classics<00:03:40.989> like<00:03:41.139> the<00:03:41.260> fifth

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
even the old IFI classics like the fifth

generation the iPod Touch iPhone in iPad

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.240 
generation the iPod Touch iPhone in iPad
all<00:03:46.150> work<00:03:46.419> fine<00:03:46.840> but<00:03:47.109> when<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.650> comes<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:47.919> nanos

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
all work fine but when it comes to nanos

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.830 
all work fine but when it comes to nanos
you<00:03:48.430> do<00:03:48.579> get<00:03:48.760> charging<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.329> syncing<00:03:49.359> but<00:03:49.780> you

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
you do get charging and syncing but you

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.599 
you do get charging and syncing but you
don't<00:03:50.049> get<00:03:50.169> the<00:03:50.349> lighting<00:03:50.560> effect<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:51.459> in

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
don't get the lighting effect so in

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:52.770 
don't get the lighting effect so in
conclusion<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:52.030> definitely<00:03:52.359> think<00:03:52.569> it's<00:03:52.720> worth

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
conclusion I definitely think it's worth

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.140 
conclusion I definitely think it's worth
the<00:03:53.109> $20<00:03:53.799> just<00:03:54.069> to<00:03:54.220> have<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.370> cable<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:54.819> tells

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
the $20 just to have a cable that tells

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.240 
the $20 just to have a cable that tells
you<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.480> charging<00:03:55.870> status<00:03:56.079> of<00:03:56.319> your<00:03:56.500> device

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
you the charging status of your device

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.550 
you the charging status of your device
certainly<00:03:57.819> this<00:03:58.060> is<00:03:58.239> better<00:03:58.510> than<00:03:58.989> having<00:03:59.260> to

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
certainly this is better than having to

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.050 
certainly this is better than having to
turn<00:03:59.739> on<00:03:59.919> the<00:04:00.069> screen<00:04:00.310> every<00:04:00.519> time<00:04:00.549> to<00:04:00.790> find

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
turn on the screen every time to find

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.819 
turn on the screen every time to find
out<00:04:01.209> if<00:04:01.329> your<00:04:01.450> phone<00:04:01.690> or<00:04:01.989> your<00:04:02.079> iPad<00:04:02.440> is<00:04:02.590> fully

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
out if your phone or your iPad is fully

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.379 
out if your phone or your iPad is fully
charged<00:04:03.250> definitely<00:04:03.849> something<00:04:04.090> I<00:04:04.209> can

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
charged definitely something I can

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.539 
charged definitely something I can
recommend<00:04:04.599> especially<00:04:04.780> at<00:04:05.260> $20<00:04:06.010> on<00:04:06.160> Amazon

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
recommend especially at $20 on Amazon

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:07.319 
recommend especially at $20 on Amazon
I'll<00:04:06.700> post<00:04:06.880> a<00:04:06.940> link<00:04:06.970> at<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.299> description

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
I'll post a link at the description

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.670 
I'll post a link at the description
below<00:04:07.870> so<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.049> can<00:04:08.169> pick<00:04:08.319> one<00:04:08.470> up<00:04:08.500> for

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
below so you can pick one up for

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.610 
below so you can pick one up for
yourself<00:04:09.120> but<00:04:10.120> at<00:04:10.359> $20<00:04:10.959> which<00:04:11.349> is<00:04:11.500> the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
yourself but at $20 which is the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.140 
yourself but at $20 which is the
equivalent<00:04:12.099> cost<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.579> Apple<00:04:12.849> cable<00:04:13.090> I

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
equivalent cost of the Apple cable I

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.309 
equivalent cost of the Apple cable I
think<00:04:13.359> it's<00:04:13.480> definitely<00:04:13.569> something<00:04:14.019> to<00:04:14.139> take

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
think it's definitely something to take

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.170 
think it's definitely something to take
a<00:04:14.349> look<00:04:14.470> at<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:15.220> only<00:04:15.430> drawback<00:04:15.760> here<00:04:15.940> is<00:04:16.060> of

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
a look at the only drawback here is of

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.779 
a look at the only drawback here is of
course<00:04:16.450> that<00:04:16.599> large<00:04:17.019> USB<00:04:17.590> housing<00:04:18.099> and<00:04:18.280> the

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
course that large USB housing and the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.460 
course that large USB housing and the
fact<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.299> is<00:04:19.450> shorter<00:04:19.810> than<00:04:20.139> Apple's

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
fact that it is shorter than Apple's

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.440 
fact that it is shorter than Apple's
cable<00:04:20.769> which<00:04:20.919> might<00:04:21.250> be<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.430> advantage<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.300> some

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
cable which might be a advantage to some

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.779 
cable which might be a advantage to some
people<00:04:22.690> who<00:04:22.810> don't<00:04:23.020> want<00:04:23.409> a<00:04:23.590> long<00:04:23.800> cable<00:04:24.039> so

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
people who don't want a long cable so

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.190 
people who don't want a long cable so
that's<00:04:24.969> going<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.120> do<00:04:25.240> for<00:04:25.419> me<00:04:25.539> guys<00:04:25.690> thanks

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
that's going to do for me guys thanks

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.640 
that's going to do for me guys thanks
