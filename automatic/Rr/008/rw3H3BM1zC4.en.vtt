 Hi, I'm Alejandra Coghlan and you're in my 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.160
 house that is your house on this occasion 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.620
 I'm going to teach you how to make these palettes 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.930
 we made them with foam and 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.210
 after being of many colors the 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.279
 you can do combined and it's super 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.739
 simple to make them here I leave you with what 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.329
 first thing we're going to do is mark the 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.329
 bald with a stick 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.350
 very easy 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:38.670
 solitos solitos marcas and then the 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:41.790
 You can cut with scissors or with exact 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.820
 once you have them cut off from 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.820
 the two colors the assemblies the joints 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.860
 and you have to start them to turn as 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.860
 you fixed yourself I left the white longer 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.770
 and you cut what was left over 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.450
 see how cute now and nothing faster 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.390
 fast I want to talk to you like the 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.030
 accommodate in this case we accommodate them 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.700
 in a blue bottle this jars of 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.540
 perfumery of people a white monkey 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.270
 and we arranged them very nice and in this 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.960
 another case is a fish tank we fill it with 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.030
 some blue sweets and now over 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.580
 we're going to put some candy 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.580
 whites and you will see well parents 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.200
 uy 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.119
 and is that as they are combined, not what 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.600
 I want to move a lot because if they do not go to 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.600
 stir 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.390
 it's a nice arrangement like for a christening 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:54.159
 a baby shower something that has to do 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.159
 as babies with children 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.830
 and now we are going to combine the palette 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.830
 I stay pretty great until 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.600
 a bow tie 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.000
 you know everything we are in the blue ones and the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.299
 let's combine with these with these 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.650
 sweets that are super beautiful that are 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.650
 as well 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.530
 and we're going to put the little olive trees 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.610
 here 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.860
 around here and see what parents were left and what 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.200
 we are also combining with the touch 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.069
 of candy according to which this 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.560
 we already did it 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:47.810
 and with the paper flower sphere and 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.790

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.790

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.370
