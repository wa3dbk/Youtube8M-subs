00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.450
 city skylines is the new messiah under 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.309
 the town planning simulation the sheer 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.349
 infinite modding possibilities 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.549
 expand the paradise almost every hour 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.839
 to have new maps mods and buildings but 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.180
 actually someone already struggles 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.779
 made cities out of reality or 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.550
 play other games and whether my 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.890
 colleague benny danneberg has become the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.199
 effort to look at them all 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:34.020
 Here are the best five cities 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:36.149
 replicas the first city in the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.579
 skylines was recreated is one 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.340
 Fictional city inspired by one 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.040
 Real City from Los Angeles has been in 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.050
 grand theft car 5 los santos and one 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.180
 Hardworking player suspended the city 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.090
 the gangster epic in city 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.430
 skylines above let's see if we have jeffers 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.400
 find a caravan 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.200
 not so much but the cards 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.660
 After all, Bauer had to take what 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.090
 we can even compare that here 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.620
 original on the game 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.970
 and here the replica incity skylines 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.620
 but not only in the overview is the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.810
 city ​​absolutely succeeded and remembered 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.600
 crystal clear to the prototype the gta 5 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.229
 also individual places and buildings are very 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.800
 well imitated but it works 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.900
 then yes not really going on 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.630
 santos makes a lousy dick there is one 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.979
 big power problem at the airport and the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.560
 Property values ​​are actually almost 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.750
 everywhere but the rest seems bad 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.940
 otherwise work very well 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.740
 for the great visual implementation 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:43.410
 There are five out of five stars 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.350
 new york new york 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.600
 that city the sinatra 1 in a song 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.000
 Of course, moving immortal also moved 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.590
 the skylines players with the metropolis 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.410
 The statue of liberty must of course 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.060
 be rebuilt 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.549
 mainhattan looks ever very familiar 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.040
 from the central park is clearly back 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.830
 to recognize and this is probably the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.560
 Broadway or the Statue of Liberty 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.929
 is not yet the start of the island 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.110
 but there are already 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.920
 but fits the replica to the template here 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.680
 the original and here the replica 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.420
 looks very good but is still 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.840
 not quite finished the surrounding 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.950
 districts still have to be built 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.500
 And what about the functionality 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.650
 Apart from the money, it works quite well 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.870
 or good but not finished 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.620
 that's fine on top of that 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.970
 is working 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.970
 four out of five stars 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.010
 hmm 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.250
 hmm also san francisco has already been 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.290
 often in songs and movies 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.950
 processed a replica of the city 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.810
 Therefore we also find in city skylines 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.790
 schools sights and parks 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.980
 should be placed so close to reality 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.580
 have been as the machiner possible 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.880
 was and they are even appropriately named 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.290
 Here is a top view on San Francisco 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.240
 and here the replica 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.020
 but somebody has it very clean 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.550
 worked that looks really great 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.380
 the former headquarters of the bank of 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.830
 america in the financial district of 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.460
 California Street is also in 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:29.630
 skylines works all the way 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:32.570
 then no, the city is actually 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.610
 do not stand there and do not corpse everywhere 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.720
 enough water energy and debts 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.760
 are crushing 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.010
 Nevertheless, the replica looks great 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.960
 even if the functionality is the truest 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.970
 sense of the word is underground 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:51.310
 three and a half stars from us for this 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:52.700
 great replica london cosmopolitan city 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.660
 financial metropolis 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.820
 well in this replicate city skyline 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.430
 you do not see much of that yet 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.830
 actual eight-million-city but 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.120
 the cornerstone is laid thames with 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.890
 her press is visible 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.950
 and a little something around it 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.750
 from the british capital is because 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.959
 it's really something to see 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.120
 true to detail as you the original and 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.850
 here the replica that looks already 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.520
 apart from the whole electricity pylon in 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.560
 the thames quite well mannered and leaves 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.660
 We hope to see the whole British soon 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.919
 metropolis in its replica broke 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.919
 to admire 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.900
 and how is going on apart from 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.000
 london has few customers everywhere 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.650
 relatively little problems for the good 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.650
 At the beginning there are three out of five stars 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.530
 she is known for the prater the 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.900
 opera ball and a lot of culture 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.970
 Austria's capital Vienna also has it 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.910
 into the series of skylines replicas 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.910
 managed according to author was trying all 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.030
 districts streets lines buildings parks and 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.700
 places as accurately as possible 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.790
 has done the original in here 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.919
 the top view and here the city the 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.110
 skylines impressive or 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.570
 but works in Austria 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.190
 Traffic and the service a few 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.200
 there are problems with the energy supply 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.380
 it and in some districts are too 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.000
 many corpses around but at 340,000 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.220
 inhabitant in such a detailed 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.300
 reconstruction should not be too 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.910
 be fussy 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.400
 Vienna in the city ​​skylines has made us perfect 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.400
 convinced full five stars 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.100
