this size so I really like it
so<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.600> transform<00:02:04.259> Optimus<00:02:05.630> just<00:02:06.630> my<00:02:06.750> camera

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
so to transform Optimus just my camera

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.550 
so to transform Optimus just my camera
what<00:02:07.500> we're<00:02:07.590> gonna<00:02:07.680> do<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:09.000> are<00:02:09.090> going<00:02:09.239> to

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
what we're gonna do is we are going to

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.050 
what we're gonna do is we are going to
rip<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.590> piece<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.280> back<00:02:11.489> section<00:02:11.730> just

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
rip this piece this back section just

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.380 
rip this piece this back section just
fold<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.330> out

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390

take this piece fall it down I'm gonna

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.850 
take this piece fall it down I'm gonna
rotate<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:15.880> like<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.870> we're<00:02:17.620> gonna<00:02:17.740> take

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
rotate it like so and we're gonna take

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.390 
rotate it like so and we're gonna take
this<00:02:17.950> piece<00:02:18.390> extend<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.480> legs<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:21.130> it's<00:02:21.280> like

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
this piece extend the legs so it's like

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.550 
this piece extend the legs so it's like
little<00:02:21.550> bit<00:02:21.670> longer<00:02:21.850> really<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:23.319> have<00:02:23.440> to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
little bit longer really you have to

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.750 
little bit longer really you have to
make<00:02:23.680> sure<00:02:23.800> these<00:02:23.890> time<00:02:24.130> into<00:02:24.340> place<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.700> I

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
make sure these time into place that I

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.790 
make sure these time into place that I
was<00:02:24.850> noting<00:02:25.120> me<00:02:25.240> right<00:02:25.450> there<00:02:26.350> we<00:02:26.440> go

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
was noting me right there we go

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.890 
was noting me right there we go
and<00:02:27.670> over<00:02:27.819> there<00:02:27.970> his<00:02:28.090> leg<00:02:28.270> he's<00:02:28.450> got<00:02:28.630> kind<00:02:28.780> of

spindly looking legs and then we're

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.760 
spindly looking legs and then we're
gonna<00:02:31.120> take<00:02:31.270> these<00:02:31.360> pieces<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.810> folding

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
gonna take these pieces and folding

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.130 
gonna take these pieces and folding
forward<00:02:33.160> take<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.180> piece<00:02:34.390> back<00:02:34.630> here<00:02:34.660> gonna

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
forward take this piece back here gonna

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.690 
forward take this piece back here gonna
push<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.530> down<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:36.040> will<00:02:36.160> reveal<00:02:36.280> his<00:02:36.459> head

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
push that down that will reveal his head

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.140 
push that down that will reveal his head
like<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:37.920> then<00:02:38.920> we're<00:02:39.010> gonna<00:02:39.130> do<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.700> we're

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
like so then we're gonna do is we're

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.770 
like so then we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:02:40.209> take<00:02:40.480> this<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:40.900> rotate<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.770> up<00:02:42.690> then<00:02:43.690> we

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
gonna take this and rotate it up then we

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.949 
gonna take this and rotate it up then we
can<00:02:43.930> rotate<00:02:44.130> or<00:02:45.130> not<00:02:45.730> rotate<00:02:46.150> I'm<00:02:46.630> gonna<00:02:46.750> push

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
can rotate or not rotate I'm gonna push

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.229 
can rotate or not rotate I'm gonna push
this<00:02:47.110> back<00:02:47.380> like<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.850> then<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.150> will

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
this back like that and then that will

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.259 
this back like that and then that will
just<00:02:49.270> peg<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.340> like<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:51.610> that'll<00:02:51.850> peg<00:02:52.000> into<00:02:52.180> the

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
just peg in like so that'll peg into the

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.000 
just peg in like so that'll peg into the
torso<00:02:52.480> then<00:02:53.200> we<00:02:53.260> can<00:02:53.410> just<00:02:53.560> fold<00:02:53.709> down<00:02:53.890> the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
torso then we can just fold down the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.600 
torso then we can just fold down the
arms<00:02:54.930> like<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:55.989> and<00:02:56.440> there<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:56.680> Prime<00:02:57.160> in<00:02:57.580> his

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
arms like that and there is Prime in his

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.280 
arms like that and there is Prime in his
robot<00:02:57.880> mode<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.690> looks<00:02:58.870> really<00:02:59.140> really

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290

robot mode and it looks really really
nice<00:03:00.150> that's<00:03:01.150> for<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.600> jetpack<00:03:01.959> you<00:03:02.320> can

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
nice that's for this jetpack you can

nice that's for this jetpack you can
really<00:03:02.709> do<00:03:02.860> what<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.040> want<00:03:03.220> with<00:03:03.340> it

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.500 
yeah it's kind of got a weird little
little<00:03:09.310> joint<00:03:09.610> it's<00:03:09.730> kind<00:03:09.850> of<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:09.970> double<00:03:10.269> joint

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
little joint it's kind of a double joint

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.540 
little joint it's kind of a double joint
on<00:03:10.660> here<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.560> one<00:03:11.739> of<00:03:11.800> these<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.100> for<00:03:12.130> vehicle

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
on here so one of these is for vehicle

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.920 
on here so one of these is for vehicle
mode<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:12.820> one's<00:03:13.000> for<00:03:13.150> his<00:03:13.239> vehicle<00:03:13.600> mode<00:03:13.630> and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
mode this one's for his vehicle mode and

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.210 
mode this one's for his vehicle mode and
this<00:03:14.080> one's<00:03:14.290> for<00:03:14.500> his<00:03:14.590> very<00:03:14.800> well<00:03:14.920> road<00:03:15.070> so

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
this one's for his very well road so

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.580 
this one's for his very well road so
you've<00:03:15.310> got<00:03:15.430> coming<00:03:15.640> up<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.910> little<00:03:16.320> pegs<00:03:17.320> in

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
you've got coming up to little pegs in

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.789 
you've got coming up to little pegs in
one<00:03:18.060> then<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.150> just<00:03:19.299> have<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.540> kind<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.930> try

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
one then you just have to kind of try

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.670 
one then you just have to kind of try
and<00:03:20.980> angle<00:03:21.640> this<00:03:21.760> on<00:03:21.940> here<00:03:22.530> sometimes<00:03:23.530> it

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
and angle this on here sometimes it

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.979 
and angle this on here sometimes it
works<00:03:23.860> sometimes<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.340> doesn't

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
works sometimes it doesn't

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.210 
works sometimes it doesn't
it's<00:03:25.989> really<00:03:26.410> really<00:03:26.590> kind<00:03:26.769> of<00:03:26.890> fiddly

back<00:05:28.550> heavy<00:05:28.819> I<00:05:29.120> mean<00:05:30.039> it<00:05:31.039> takes<00:05:31.219> a<00:05:31.339> lot<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.550> get

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 
back heavy I mean it takes a lot to get

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.700 
back heavy I mean it takes a lot to get
it's<00:05:31.939> kind<00:05:32.089> of<00:05:32.180> stand<00:05:32.419> up<00:05:32.569> and<00:05:32.990> he<00:05:33.199> just<00:05:33.529> keeps

falling<00:05:33.860> over<00:05:34.069> with<00:05:34.310> it<00:05:34.460> so<00:05:35.000> it's<00:05:35.330> kind<00:05:35.539> of

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:35.629 
falling over with it so it's kind of

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.860
