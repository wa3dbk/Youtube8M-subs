00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.500
 no beauties i have one a deposition of mundane condition 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.590
 wanted to tell 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.339
 that's a slightly funny story 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:13.290
 Dan first Twitter has been aware that it is indeed a new option 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:14.409
 could be 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.339
 it's about gray nail polish 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:21.029
 and I have somehow recently bought crawling nail polishes and they too 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.829
 Customers who are constantly wearing 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.319
 and for so long until somehow I did mashups from Dimplex 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:28.310
 adjusted 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.759
 under then we would operate over Enie 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.050
 Stone problems barely need nail polishes and 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.650
 and there I place 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.460
 RSH 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.800
 because that's pretty much the case 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.160
 Single nail polish colors really are the ones I've been buying lately 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.640
 of this kind some of which one notes that Porsche 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.840
 I think that you were in the info box so 60 was better again 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.500
 can 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.219
 because you usually do that 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.030
 To see in the photos that said iPad may differ between individual 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.250
 that is us and i hope i still got the different names together because 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.230
 the Mannheim woman a little bit bad 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.780
 Memphis nail advice very strange 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.579
 such teams at cosmetics costs and which I now completely in demand 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.540
 a son 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.540
 there assists 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.390
 I want is a dazzling because I forgot again but I have that 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.330
 ever on the blog post 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.000
 I wrote Barroso 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.010
 and i hope i am one now she is really warm otherwise i will still be here 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.250
 note above 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.920
 I believe that here is the Poland break from the Sepp Herberger with game tables 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.450
 is from Esther and that it is national of Oak Rast of Katrins 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 they look that way 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.550
 Montes next to it makes 18 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.180
 this is the one of Patrice from Aspect the Havixbecker little notes 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.430
 namely looking red 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.049
 and I love you only, Manet does not even mouthed completely again 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.749
 I opened it now with 14 hits 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:09.139
 or the day before yesterday I do not know any more 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.469
 Unfortunately, later on, such a little bit of rehearsals took off at the 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.569
 the Dornier painted number 19 are a bit too 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:19.989
 this is Dr 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:20.870
 f5 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.920
 who has come out now the rent does not pay almost 30 years a kind 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.799
 A preview of the newest range eagerly awaited 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.989
 Percent moviestar on 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.010
 I also took that away, however, the motto Feel your 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.439
 largely powerless 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.799
 the message also bought since then 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.969
 I also painted it and I was totally surprised how great it is 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.149
 Lately this is one of the best works she has tried 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.089
 but should be completed without bass 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:50.899
 these too 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:55.059
 they are happy so this is really extreme 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.779
 it rarely has a nail that has really played so extreme 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.980
 Of course it can be that has dated differently than usual, namely without 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.349
 Westcott and keep watching 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.559
 the majority of those who do not like the color in wrinkles really like me 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.559
 this one is a bit blue-eyed here 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.859
 I have that in my head 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.859
 I have to say I like it 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:24.369
 I'm probably just Ehlers jokes dark gray phase and with 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:28.119
 less and has Thuringia but it is definitely not a Laki take away 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.859
 would 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.110
 because I find it quite unique I think so 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.700
 you will not be able to get back that fast, so I'll be back in somewhere 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.149
 the corner is waiting for that 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.629
 an obsession with a shade of gray he develops a ball and counters 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:43.870
 and do not say 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.300
 like bass so i have it as a full passion born the money yes me 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.279
 knows that at h &amp; m was still a grenade 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:54.590
 I might even drop dolls there I do not have it on purpose 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:57.929
 taken away because I somehow it is the same as with 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:02.610
 Those with the color blue this summer he has against this time I try 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.540
 not even look at it because it will not be there I'll have it then 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.650
 most likely to come home a very very similar colors 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.409
 already to own therefore 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.549
 I leave it from the beginning 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.449
 that's like going from the other into the other women I have nothing 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.870
 Suspicious 11 8 May at 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.520
 Synopsis the Praunheimer way but this unfortunately all Limited wipe 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.969
 this is broke Platinum from SCEA 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:28.849
 the process 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.770
 be directed 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.869
 from nic out Dr Run I think 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.789
 Ben and the percent 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.289
 Combe buy Beijing 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.490
 and they are all EA like that 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.110
 to the light gray 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.809
 and sooner 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:50.229
 not so blue-eyed I is painfully subject 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.740
 so handy 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.849
 very different 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.279
 that's what Nacke has been doing lately 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.579
 What I also very much liked to wear was the paradox of the Lord 

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:04.139
 Time trial Shanghai 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.830
 If you do not know that, I can sometimes wrestle a blog post in the info box 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:09.650
 move 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.200
 that was practically everything so I paradoxically Alex once worn then I have 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.820
 The Jake going off also seem to be dying out in Trier 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.740
 the CDU from Yemen 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.270
 the Growler approx 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.599
 and percent the Wars 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.469
 I have not had anything else on the media 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:31.729
 When I think you can do that you can already call it an obsession 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.279
 it's curious is Hoffer percent like that's again 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:39.109
 I'll try such a colorful one again soon 

00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:41.759
 classic boat because 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.250
 I think so scared as always at most brands and now seriously 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:48.580
 Year in Steinbach really to the question then I can not see him anymore 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.400
 That's never happened with Kathrin 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.110
 by Opi a from Provence damage apparently identical 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.340
 and rarely do I think so 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.000
 worn for two or three weeks at a time and since then I never have it again 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.520
 touched 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.500
 this is a danger I do not want to take because this well 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.339
 felt 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:12.649
 that she somehow totally sprouts from the ground and should 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.599
 because every company somehow makes such a gray out as I suppose 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.509
 let's say it's a trend 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:20.819
 no idea 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.479
 So I thought that was already awesome first thing with the first usable what 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.580
 has brought 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.580
 I think that is actually even 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:31.619
 the most beautiful dirty mourning 

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:32.569
 because it really is 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:36.759
 has no blue confidence at all and Haid the Movistar that's the one 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.800
 I like both extremely well 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.969
 and who thinks with the Liechtenstein Sandfang but has Dr 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:48.129
 At least now, and he could buy the beast I think 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:51.129
 the cost below two euros this Carline Brouwer 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:54.909
 As I said so I found he was the particle Palazzi 

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:58.129
 Surely there is still a miracle to have decided 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:02.459
 Wait a minute if you have the quest tender or son the MAK percent video that comes 

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:06.110
 must cut now no longer is already a little while to this it comes 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.499
 to cut because I am now 

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:10.999
 Do not suffer because Lichtsteiner just is not 

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:12.849
 why stop 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.300
 Goal in St 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.559
 So let's be your barrique 

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:19.659
 that simple down below 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:23.339
 Erich Heitzer himself a few ideas deviant me because if you know that 

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:25.800
 not too important to vote with 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.070
 around Abs 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.279
 Things heart nail polishes and around 

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:33.649
 Decide fall and so I think I'll do anyway to Medion 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.919
 Türkiye 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:36.610
 Chile is
