00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:32.559
 I started from my idea of ​​rigor 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.719
 warmed by fabric and color e 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.149
 of the matter combination 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.850
 I love castings and in this color it was 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:43.470
 in this case it was a fusion of color 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.300
 of materials and small touches of embroidery 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.180
 like the incrustations turned hinton that 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.190
 they never have too much color either 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.150
 too much shine is a woman 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.770
 sophisticated contemporary that loves the 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.600
 cleanliness and rigor but also knows how to be

 in fact, architecture is an image 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:32.799
 well structured with the perfect fighter 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.899
 by overlapping in fact studied 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.509
 with many interchangeable pieces 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.270
 sites a dynamic woman very heavily 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.850
 attentive to the attention to detail and 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.420
 which represents social life has

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.790
 but certainly the inspiration and the 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.760
 research and color so I wanted 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.080
 proposing is a print that was 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.090
 became the focus of 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.070
 collection variant ata on reds and on 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.840
 blue then the idea of ​​working on 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.750
 a color that is a color that is a color 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.360
 as strong as red white blacks 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.790
 but not the idea of ​​making total looks 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.340
 monochromatic but the idea of ​​mixing i 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.470
 colors to then give these nonce 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.910
 new I worked a lot with the 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.040
 furrier like you could see that 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.750
 for me a testing ground 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.490
 incredible is that from a luxurious appeal 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.190
 to the collection that makes it 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.930
 immediately couture however also in 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.520
 this case the fur is not treated 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.590
 in a classical manner in a canonical manner 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.830
 but it was really well structured 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.480
 assembled materials creating your own 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.980
 of three-dimensional effects 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.500
 last element holes that characterizes me 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.300
 the embroidery that is not sequin beads 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.070
 a manipulation I did on 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.170
 fabrics for which these clothes he saw 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.810
 you in effect in France are actually 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.570
 a printed chiffon fabric that is 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.610
 been reduced to and then embroidered a 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.210
 squeezes to give this malt effect 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:22.320

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.030
 I started from these drawings of mine 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.549
 they are paintings inspired by the world 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.310
 primitive so it can be South Africa 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.290
 rather than south america i liked it 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.540
 much to use them to create a linearity 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.980
 in all the forms that it was also later 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.500
 the theme that was used for the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.659
 paper pattern or there was one 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.150
 very rigorous simplicity with some 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.489
 geometric shapes in the pattern and then 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.290
 I made these bursts of colors and 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.870
 processes that have best expressed 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.020
 I think about my design e 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.889
