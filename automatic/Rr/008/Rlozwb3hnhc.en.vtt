really focused on to improve for the new

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.990 
really focused on to improve for the new
prototype<00:00:20.400> was<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.359> how<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> make<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.800> easy

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
prototype was the how to make it so easy

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.990 
prototype was the how to make it so easy
200<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.539> know<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.990> are<00:00:25.140> very<00:00:25.320> proud<00:00:25.560> when<00:00:25.920> we

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
announced last year the early prototype

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.519 
announced last year the early prototype
no<00:00:29.670> first<00:00:30.000> prototype<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:31.140> know<00:00:31.260> how<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
no first prototype you know how the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.280 
no first prototype you know how the
headset<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.579> designed<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.899> weight

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
headset is designed so that the weight

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.830 
headset is designed so that the weight
of<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.739> unit<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:36.059> know<00:00:36.210> supported<00:00:36.660> on

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
of the unit is a you know supported on

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.470 
of the unit is a you know supported on
the<00:00:36.960> head<00:00:37.170> not<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.040> face<00:00:38.250> yeah<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.210> we

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the head not on the face yeah so we

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.720 
the head not on the face yeah so we
heard<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.079> was<00:00:40.230> very<00:00:40.469> comfortable<00:00:40.920> however

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
heard it was very comfortable however

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.090 
heard it was very comfortable however
because<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.270> had<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> tube<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
because it had like a tube and in a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.310 
because it had like a tube and in a
plastic<00:00:44.309> band<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.030> soft<00:00:45.390> pan<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.140> bit

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
plastic band and soft pan it a bit

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.200 
plastic band and soft pan it a bit
complicated<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:47.280> people<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.730> handle<00:00:47.940> by

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
complicated for people to handle by

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.479 
complicated for people to handle by
themselves<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.410> always<00:00:49.590> needed<00:00:50.160> someone

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
themselves so we always needed someone

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.510 
themselves so we always needed someone
to<00:00:50.670> support<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.930> person<00:00:52.440> will<00:00:52.590> try<00:00:52.829> so

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
to support you know a person will try so

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.060 
to support you know a person will try so
the<00:00:53.730> Indian<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.570> worked<00:00:54.780> hard<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.980> improve

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the Indian really worked hard to improve

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.520 
the Indian really worked hard to improve
it<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.760> make<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.090> very<00:00:57.120> very<00:00:57.570> simple<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.170> put<00:00:58.350> it

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it to make it very very simple to put it

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040 
it to make it very very simple to put it
on<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.980> take<00:00:59.039> off<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.120> one<00:01:00.480> thing<00:01:00.719> you

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
on and take off so that one thing you

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.990 
on and take off so that one thing you
know<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.320> long<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:02.070> only<00:01:02.399> investing<00:01:02.850> right

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
know be long it's only investing right

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.429 
know be long it's only investing right
now<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> experiences<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.140> will<00:01:04.350> be

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
now and the experiences that will be

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.260 
now and the experiences that will be
available<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:05.100> his<00:01:05.189> launches<00:01:05.580> there<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.240> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
available with his launches there is a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.730 
available with his launches there is a
mostly<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.840> tech<00:01:07.049> demos<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.680> stuff

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
mostly going to be tech demos and stuff

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.300 
mostly going to be tech demos and stuff
