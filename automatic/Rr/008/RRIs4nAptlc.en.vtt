00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.020
 since the beginning of time, the armies of heaven and hell are in one 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.789
 endless war 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.809
 from this conflict the fiery council was drafted an entity by the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.049
 tied to ancient laws was also to obtain federal balance 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:20.969
 Anyone who was not kept in check was a threat to that 

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:23.969
 Matter of the universe 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.259
 In time, heaven and hell began to apply the counsel and its laws in their own lives 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.280
 Because nobody could stand up to the terrible executors of the council 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.060
 oppose 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.560
 they were called the frightening brotherhood by the name of the four 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.900

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.480
 from the tumults 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.840
 He grew up in the first humans 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.250
 The council previously said that weak but Gary Smith creatures are the

 once for the balance become vain 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.530
 a third kingdom was named 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.530
 that's enough for humanity 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.659
 by order of the council, a pact was forged between heaven and hell 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.000
 this great pact was sealed by seven seals 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.590
 which should be broken at the right time, namely, when the kingdom of 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.910
 Humanity ready for war 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.660
 to restore a battle as the balance and the fate of 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.660
