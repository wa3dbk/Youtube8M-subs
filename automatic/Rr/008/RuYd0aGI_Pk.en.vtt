tonight
now<00:04:26.960> here's<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.620> strategy<00:04:27.920> John

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:29.569 
now here's the strategy John

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.230 
now here's the strategy John
it<00:04:30.110> behooves<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:31.069> to<00:04:31.099> miss<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.699> free<00:04:31.969> throw

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
it behooves you to miss the free throw

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.320 
it behooves you to miss the free throw
because<00:04:32.449> if<00:04:32.719> you<00:04:32.869> go<00:04:32.990> up<00:04:33.169> to<00:04:33.469> can<00:04:34.460> you<00:04:34.610> CoA<00:04:34.939> can

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
because if you go up to can you CoA can

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.080 
because if you go up to can you CoA can
throw<00:04:35.689> it<00:04:35.899> length<00:04:36.199> of<00:04:36.439> the<00:04:36.589> floor<00:04:36.979> okay

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
throw it length of the floor okay

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.840 
throw it length of the floor okay
so<00:04:39.330> if<00:04:39.540> you<00:04:39.750> miss<00:04:40.050> it<00:04:40.370> it's<00:04:41.370> gonna<00:04:41.490> be<00:04:41.610> very

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
so if you miss it it's gonna be very

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.760 
so if you miss it it's gonna be very
little<00:04:42.180> time<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.570> catch<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.230> as<00:04:43.320> well<00:04:43.560> at<00:04:43.650> the

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
little time to catch it as well at the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.940 
little time to catch it as well at the
length<00:04:43.980> of<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.220> floor

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
length of the floor

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.820 
length of the floor
but<00:04:45.280> Mario<00:04:45.550> Rital<00:04:46.150> must<00:04:46.630> hit<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.080> rim

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
but Mario Rital must hit the rim

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.189 
but Mario Rital must hit the rim
they're<00:04:49.340> about<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.849> check<00:04:50.120> Jeff<00:04:50.599> Withey<00:04:50.870> into

they're about to check Jeff Withey into
the<00:04:51.319> game<00:04:51.530> I'm<00:04:51.740> assuming<00:04:52.340> that<00:04:52.580> might<00:04:52.789> mean

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
the game I'm assuming that might mean

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.910 
the game I'm assuming that might mean
that<00:04:53.060> they're<00:04:53.360> gonna<00:04:53.479> make<00:04:53.750> it

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.400 

to<00:04:57.490> have<00:04:57.700> him<00:04:57.850> go<00:04:58.060> on<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.450> ball<00:04:58.660> I<00:04:58.930> wouldn't

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
to have him go on the ball I wouldn't

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.560 
to have him go on the ball I wouldn't
make<00:04:59.530> this<00:04:59.770> because<00:05:00.190> it's<00:05:00.910> gonna<00:05:01.120> have<00:05:01.390> to<00:05:01.420> be

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
make this because it's gonna have to be

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.110 
make this because it's gonna have to be
a<00:05:01.720> three-point<00:05:02.380> shot<00:05:02.620> so<00:05:02.950> one<00:05:03.250> being<00:05:03.640> up<00:05:03.850> one

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120
