and they did that with this and this is

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.580 
and they did that with this and this is
why<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.640> really<00:02:51.000> like<00:02:51.330> this<00:02:51.510> shoe<00:02:51.780> because<00:02:51.930> the

why I really like this shoe because the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.440 
why I really like this shoe because the

shoe is a nice shoe it just they're not

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.570

lot of them some of them are hot just

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.770 
lot of them some of them are hot just
because<00:02:59.490> of<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.790> colorway<00:03:00.210> just<00:03:00.450> being<00:03:00.660> a

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
because of the colorway just being a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.290 
because of the colorway just being a
loud<00:03:01.050> color<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.860> it's<00:03:02.430> something<00:03:02.670> new<00:03:03.000> but

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
loud color and it's something new but
