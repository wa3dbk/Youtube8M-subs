00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.799
 we are in huarte 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.510
 let's start with the gameplay though 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.840
 you are watching a pretty title 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.490
 quite pretty powerful inti the video 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.220
 that is of play finished and me and I 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.970
 explain it I hope it did not take me more than 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.490
 one minute to explain all the gameplay 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.210
 because we see this gameplay with precision 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.070
 I've taken it out of my brother's channel and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.579
 of my brother is watching this is going to be 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.670
 a game made by my brother so 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.739
 you're going to see a three minute fashion and I 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.220
 it's getting pretty short a very 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.510
 very good good soup and I have a 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.100
 brother who has a friend who 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.809
 they made a channel but good they left it 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.809
 since they started with the university 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.720
 and all the rolls the channel had I do not know 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.970
 that I believe that 500 subscribers in a 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.430
 click and when I say clicks 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.619
 it means days and more so 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.020
 imagine and well they left it for 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.880
 what they started with the university 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.189
 but good I have there are many many 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.580
 videos on the channel of my brother and david 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.860
 mask the prodigy in any case very very 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.409
 very very good those who would like to take it out 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.460
 and put it in the channel that already 16 as well 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.750
 how good I want you to put the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.030
 comments if you want to see any 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.189
 departure from my brother's channel that I 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.530
 I think I do ask for permission to both the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.230
 mask as good to david as to my 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.420
 Brother though good without permission 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.860
 but if you put it in the comments go 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.600
 to see many videos of them that the 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.430
 truth is that they are very very very funny 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.540
 and it's worth seeing as well as the 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.030
 comments that we will make videos of 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.470
 masks and we want mask videos 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.910
 come this you have to put the 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.820
 comments for to encourage you already 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.670
 that gave me good permission we're 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.610
 seeing in the title in the title we are 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.270
 watching modern warfare 4 white 3 that 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.830
 happens the other day he visited and we put several 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.110
 youtube videos apologizing to us 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.960
 subscribers in false information that 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.950
 we saw about white 3 but 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.319
 and the codeine carmina or if they commend t 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.940
 you do not know them and I'll leave the channel in 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.770
 descriptions since all this is 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.630
 thanks to it, not the face but what 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.340
 I am going to say 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.550
 information about the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.440
 white 3 and another company that is the one 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.870
 he did warfare 3 that's why I have 43 the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.270
 company that did force 3 wrong line yes 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.590
 I think the pronounced well slender ham 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.590
 hammer game 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.840
 apart from other studies like infinity 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.599
 ward and activision could human but 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.930
 schlinder jaime game I think it's called 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.670
 so and if they did not put fire to the fire 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.329
 and it looks like they are going to be divided 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.840
 Between infinity world slender game and 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:55.079
 treyarch in 2014 that we are going to see in 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.980
 this 2014 to 2015 we will see a game 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:01.379
 of slender ham game in modern warfare 4 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.790
 I call it that but I do not think that it 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.560
 call modern warfare 4 since they 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.380
 they made a modern warfare 3 previously 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.880
 formerly sorry 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.970
 cast 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.370
 / jr 3 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.910
 with 3 has already confirmed for 2015 the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.250
 company sell more sell hummer 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.160
 game I do not know if it's confirmation at last 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.170
 its existence for 2014 but good 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.800
 you can maybe be one of the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.090
 productions that you do for 2014 there 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.440
 It's also pretty fast fashion 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.950
 Now let's see why I want the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.950
 video follow 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.359
 and good now go to see it I assure you the 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.920
 very cool logo that has made me and we kill 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:44.180
 seven o'clock right here flag of 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.159
 the afternoon of May 22 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.439
 a good logo has edited it in what I 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.599
 he liked a lot and good what 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:53.659
 it is already just a minute and I know 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.489
 I have been short the video but 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:59.739
 Well, I just have to explain that 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.739
 I will leave the channel anti sicom 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.560
 and yale codelco about all good 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.560
 although they also eat you and deserve it 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.700
 that to say it some way that he has 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.610
 removed the information since they are 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.169
 Franc franco friends of the character 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.389
 principal of white campaign 1 and 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.889
 white 2 good white 2 was medium 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.220
 dead but white 1 yes that 's fine 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.560
 and good they have done to be a talking 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.150
 with frank ut and that has taken a couple of 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.190
 information has said that so good 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.229
 in the video leave both the video of 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.020
 circus as the a as the channel of 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.729
 psychedelic as well as the videos of 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.650
 boy and yale co 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.990
 in the video of him that I think a lot 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.849
 more complete so I'll put it first and 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.620
 well I think it goes through his channel and we 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.620
 we see without following video
