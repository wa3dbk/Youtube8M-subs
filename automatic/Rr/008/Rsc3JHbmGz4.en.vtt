00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.650
 ntuli zuma 2 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.070
 is what we know as asylum 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.279
 attracting them the review of the sony 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.650
 headset press edit the lead if you have not 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.600
 seen the unboxing I invite you to go 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.510
 and look at it, I think it 's my penultimate 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.950
 video then let's see what wave 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.440
 because I had already been told to be 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.250
 bring but let's start with what's going 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:39.610
 has been the model with us that 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.020
 I had had as you see are a little 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.840
 More smalls 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.560
 these are a little more grotesque more 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.440
 big 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.050
 and very resistant the truth as well as 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.050
 but as I say they are a 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.900
 little bit smaller but they are very 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.300
 good very very comfortable go to the mere 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.050
 they are really comfortable I liked a 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.450
 chingo 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.240
 come out then let's see what wave people 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.190
 I'm not going to this with the difference 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.190
 of these new ones that if they cost 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.979
 150 dollars to these that are worth 100 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.470
 dollars not if there is too much difference 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.460
 the truth and to begin with I'm going to start 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.110
 with this these headsets only 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.330
 they have the function for what is coming 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.560
 being gaming that is only for 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.259
 play play station 3 if like 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.899
 can watch blu-ray movies the truth 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.509
 that gives you a good sound in both 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.880
 video game like in very good movies 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.240
 as they see here nothing else has what 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.729
 is the button where is the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.640
 virtual his role the vectra his role that you see 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.429
 can turn on and off and what comes 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.470
 being the audio volume of the day be 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.160
 of the game of the movie and on the other 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.530
 side we have what is the audio of the 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.950
 coming integrated microphone that comes 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.759
 here as they see a fucking dick there 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.110
 then this are very good they are very 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.780
 I liked very much very 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.110
 resistant as you see they are nothing nothing 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.720
 damaged I have fallen several times to 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.760
 the senses on the floor and it got bad 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.340
 kept in very good condition with 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.349
 this broker over a year and a half with 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.870
 they very good I recommend it 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.230
 one hundred dollars worth in these and then 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.260
 let's move on to the others that these people there are 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.840
 many more options very many more 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.660
 ways so that not only for the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.290
 gaming and movies such that 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.940
 they will train six modes here comes 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.000
 bringing the button where are we doing 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.900
 look for this button that I do not know if 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.099
 reach to see here here is for 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.410
 select the mode in which you 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.560
 you want to use brings the game mode that 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.709
 it's not very game is not optimized better 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.079
 how is that intensity of the game brings 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.450
 mode for music the equal you get us 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.420
 we optimize the music better 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.290
 they know the movies, it's the same 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.629
 very much 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.760
 and also not just for that, but 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:16.900
 as I repeat 3 various game modes 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.450
 like the shooting that is for how you 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.750
 I will say with which you can follow the steps 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.079
 of the enemies and extends the effects of 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.379
 the explosions and the shots without more 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:32.739
 if I explain myself like in the fights 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:35.170
 of the tram enters fight mode that we 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.019
 optimizes the impact of bergasses that 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.519
 we get in like it brings another mode 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.579
 which is the last one that is career mode 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:46.389
 that optimizes us the sound of the 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:49.900
 competition and accelerations and 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:51.489
 band collisions the truth are very good and 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.040
 as I tell you, nothing else brings those 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.889
 options here there are more as you know 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.840
 this one no more such as 22 volumes like this 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:02.769
 this one does not act and what has been 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.870
 equal the volume of the music of the of the 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.629
 tri- foot television game 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.519
 this is the impact bus that is the effect 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.190
 I tell them that it is like 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.920
 listen last hype explained I'm the most 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.079
 chin 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.019
 this also to this is the button that brings 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.740
 this up here that is the virtual south and 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.470
 on this side I am not what it is to be 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.240
 the sound of the microphone the volume of the 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.290
 microphone to listen to hear us 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.389
 more and to be able to be and to understand us 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.690
 and have a better better understanding 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:40.639
 with the comrades not here is the button 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.389
 of lion and turn on 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.770
 as you see there it did not go on anymore and there 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.080
 I turn off the truth that I liked 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.529
 enough people to tell them that the peanut 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.060
 gamer I think that in his team was 5 thousand 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:55.009
 subscribers I think it's going to give this away 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.529
 because he also has these he told me that 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.539
 he was going to give them to thank us 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:02.749
 because you wanted to buy these that then 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.610
 I also love her very much the truth of 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:07.370
 this model to this one there is something that has not 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.169
 liked as you see with this as I said 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.770
 I have more than a year with them and they 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:15.199
 They keep in very good condition 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.289
 and what I did not like about this as you see 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.819
 here this part is as I will tell you 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:23.270
 for those who have the playstation fat 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:25.940
 it tends to scratch very easy to mess 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.659
 how are you seeing I think that's how it is 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.150
 like the type like the feet type vita yes 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.919
 look and if you notice then you can tend to 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.009
 scratching is something that I did not like 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.270
 because the truth is they have their design is 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.800
 very pretty 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.810
 so as to have other scratches 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.759
 Well, I do not think that the best 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.400
 what I'm going to have to do is buy a 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:48.740
 mica to be able to protect them 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.620
 something else that the microphone has not 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.590
 has integrated as it comes 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.060
 this but they do not bring it in this part 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.949
 see this through these pinches 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.460
 little holes here this is the 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:04.610
 microphone sends very good truth not 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.970
 the most they serve for that as I tell them with 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.690
 these headset you can hear your 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:16.310
 audio of your feet vita the audio of your 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:19.100
 iphone of your iphone and the audio of your 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.110
 floor and keep a sample of more or 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.479
 less how are they heard so that 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.770
 you guys say I'm going to upload you 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.569
 the whole volume of what is the 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.689
 computer 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:33.339
 for you to give yourselves a quest and 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.339
 say that Peru is going 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.430
 and I have more or less like half 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.430
 I'm going to upload everything once 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.140
 I do not know if you can appreciate the music 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.740
 if they heard people then how they see and 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:58.590
 you hear quite loud lick there will be 7 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.419
 daze me is it possible that I have 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.419
 the beats as they saw so I have some 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:05.970
 beats this I think I compare them with 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.220
 the beats are in the audio because it 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.770
 they hear quite tough and they are very good 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.780
 we did another thing that brings these 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.349
 bosses and I think already to give for 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:19.800
 finished this is that you can use them 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:22.620
 as a microphone for your iphone microphone 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.210
 for your feet vita and microphone for your 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.909
 floor or like who says 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:30.870
 with these streamer powers with the band 

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:32.400
 with those guys and basically 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.889
 is the microphone that is not in 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.669
 human the microphone no nothing nothing nothing 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:43.050

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:44.879
 We will serve only for this it 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.409
 that is the foot estrelle banda I got confused 

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:49.110
