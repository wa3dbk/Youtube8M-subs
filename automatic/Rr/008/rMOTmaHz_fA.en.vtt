 family when m 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.280
 Germanic 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.190
 hostel where she goes 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.920
 m 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.610
 their rate can be forgotten 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.390
 brazilian forces keller 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.900
 tagging it's crazy but thomas müller 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.900
 ground 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.640
 the score 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.940
 as against France in the lead 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.810
 the 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.810
 you will see 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.110
 as it's excellent and marking 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.910
 david luiz who finds himself at the end with 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.590
 him but I do not know who was 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.280
 really at the beginning we do not see on 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.280
 this image 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.910
 certainly that there was a system of 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.300
 blog that is loved opposite in place by 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.520
 the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.450
 by the Germans were passing 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.829
 improbable that a player can 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.210
 found at this level there and in half 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.210
 World Cup final also alone 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.479
 and 1 0 for germany that cools 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.479
 the atmosphere of the mineirao stadium 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.030
 a month available that the Germans 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.380
 when we beat muller 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.030
 on all our souls the efforts they 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.420
 make for a touch of balloons and cool 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.210
 various 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.490
 the static it is very difficult to 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.470
 to play is really 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.850
 a champion completely outside the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.850
 Brazilian collective 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.049
 yet 3 from 10 to 15 and more 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.470
 German attackers probably to be 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.470
 bad 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.470
 toni kroos 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.470
 we will make the project surface 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.470
 Oh 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.600
 16th round 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.850
 absolute 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.870
 and this Brazilian defense 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.730
 it's a real other tribute 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.110
 incroya 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.270
 l incredible than 2 0 for german 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.990
 she was doing marcel hossa m practically 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.810
 behind 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.970
 central defense 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.520
 julio cesar the poor do what he can 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.840
 be possible first time attempt 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.840
 of klose and but not two 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.010
 this action happens without any 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.440
 comment look at moving to 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.019
 marcelo who is completely thoughtless 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.990
 it looks like a little junior who is a 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.310
 junior player and where there is palace 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.530
 the offside only in the 16 meters and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.940
 it's crazy it's crazy what marcel 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.040
 oms has just done here finally the image of 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.409
 match of the beginning match that comes 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.790
 composed him like he did since the 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.630
 start of the match will be placed between 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.160
 lines and behind 2 0 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.440
 remarkable also what weak 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.200
 the action of the action that shines 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.530
 klose and 2 to 0 for germany by train 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.270
 to head to the final must cook 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.250
 they do not believe their eyes 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:00.640
 and we no longer 3 to 0 ab the horizon 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.230
 24 minutes toni kroos 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.120
 what actions what actions to look at 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.159
 again the number of players 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.230
 which is found in the last thirty 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.989
 Brazilian meters it's just remarkable 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.060
 with ozil who is wearing his right side 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.500
 to shift there but behind there is some 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.750
 world in the 16 meters it means 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.819
 practically six players in the thirty 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.400
 last Brazilian meters to score 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.349
 the third goal after 24 minutes 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.890
 it's remarkable as mentality like 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.660
 state of mind on the side of the German side 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.150
 with müller at first that 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.650
 misses his recovery but cros luynes 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.230
 catch of the posters problem 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.040
 global 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.110
 passage for the Brazilian selection the 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.180
 seleçao between our even shattered 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.010
 in his worst nightmares party would have 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.290
 probably not imagined that 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.430
 three goals 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.880
 three minutes 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.350
 1 0 for germany 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.630
 improbable improbable which 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.069
 is going on there in addition and the Germans 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.780
 are to add 1 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.700
 always just 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.760
 the offsets just make the bressans 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.260
 are just just too strong 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.510
 for the Brazilian shoulder currently 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.510
 which are actually perdition 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.980
 which page which slap 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.519
 let's go he has lost more for 12 years 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.769
 a match 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.889
 what his lands 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.930
 and 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.520
 not only do they still have this 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.159
 that she will go again the third in 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:32.300
 hold for ozil khedira drop of 5.0 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:34.699
 for the mojhette 104 0 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.249
 semi- finals of the World Cup at 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.149
 Brazil 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.149
 to be brazil 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.449
 walfisz on this axis to die we go in 

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:47.479
 laugh because finally khedira takes 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.930
 the ball 45 meters from the goals and he goes 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.270
 straight ahead 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.399
 he's going straight ahead he's shifting a moment 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.849
 given and he finds himself watching it go 

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:55.339
 straight ahead 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.020
 it's going straight at no time ago 

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:58.569
 a side pass yes at that moment 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.860
 but behind there is still a 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.289
 almost a numerical superiority of 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.789
 the es16 to 4 3 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:08.199
 maybe a very very light in game two 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.199
 Islets words that will tell him 2 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.430
 the 115 euros 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.430
 there is absolutely no brake on the side 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.410
 Brazilian midfield 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.060
 the team is she is split in two 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.440
 five players defend five players 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.810
 attack but those who attack do not 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.610
 do not defend and those who defend do not 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.350
 do not take the markings and when 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.350
 Germany is paid cash 5 0
