match port friendly bots on as high as
possible<00:00:26.550> which<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.300> believe<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.779> 11<00:00:28.380> but

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
possible which I believe is 11 but

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.089 
possible which I believe is 11 but
difficulty<00:00:29.670> as<00:00:29.849> veteran<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.750> then<00:00:31.199> all<00:00:31.890> you

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
difficulty as veteran and then all you

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.340 
difficulty as veteran and then all you
want<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.520> your<00:00:32.550> friendly<00:00:33.149> fire<00:00:33.390> enabled<00:00:34.110> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
want is your friendly fire enabled and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.970 
want is your friendly fire enabled and
then<00:00:34.680> all<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.980> do<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.250> start<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.700> match<00:00:35.940> and

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
then all you do is start the match and

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.920 
then all you do is start the match and
essentially<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.309> will<00:00:38.520> find<00:00:38.910> someone<00:00:39.809> on

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
multiplayer as of yet but like I said

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.070 
multiplayer as of yet but like I said
you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:02.010> some<00:01:02.219> practice<00:01:02.760> there<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.899> no

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
veteran box I believe and if there is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.850 
veteran box I believe and if there is
you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.210> actually<00:01:09.390> turn<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.020> off<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.799> you

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you can actually turn this off so you

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.380
