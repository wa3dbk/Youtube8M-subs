00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.710
 game footage and in case you want 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.390
 to start certain footage I do not know 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.430
 I want to start on the two thousand meters that is 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.810
 where the scenery starts, you only have to pay 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.670
 with a coin that has there of the game that 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.200
 you will hardly find her anymore 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.030
 yes a coin you pay there you 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.350
 start at the check point you want 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.720
 then you can start in such a scenario 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.119
 just paying a penny the game 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.400
 requires much content has had to 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.079
 you 're exploring things are a 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.759
 Little guys in it, yes it will play a lot 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.420
 to buy a suit to improve 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.460
 some item 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.619
 but it's cool because the game is fun 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.630
 As I said his gameplay went very well. 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.130
 essential large games right 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.110
 if a snake appears here to give 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.479
 whipped at her for you to see 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.479
 This part of the game works. 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.549
 it's no longer a normal game, but here's a 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.200
 thing is also that it is a 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.149
 game that you play with your device 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.640
 lying down for example tablet is that it does not 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.680
 he's in the horizontal position is not in the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.079
 vertical most of the games joÃ£o you 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.390
 do not play in that perspective show 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.799
 Divert here, okay, I'm saying down and 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.840
 normal slips like any game 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.670
 support my audience and as I said before 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.069
 you tap the screen is one it uses 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.480
 whip to end the enemy 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.819
 is showing up in front of me I'll see 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.150
 if a snake appears to you soon 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.340
 You see, demonstrating this, we go there a lot. 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.049
 nice enough and have played played 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.060
 I picked it up today but I really liked it and it looks 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.459
 this string also skip it and 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.260
 Cliffs is typical is classic and the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.180
 Original pitico as I said not me 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.219
 I threw the original order unfortunately 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.780
 but I know well I've seen several videos 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.359
 At the beginning of the game he gives an inclusive 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.760
 it shows the rhythm going through a 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.319
 check point you go through these 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.760
 birds it means that it has passed through 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.959
 one point check what the scenario will already 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.909
 be a little different 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.739
 Look what a snake a touch on the screen 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.540
 he gave a whip on the snake and 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.629
 pass quietly for two 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.699
 times by the snake I die I scoured the 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.739
 gameplay but they were not even the video of 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:57.569
