00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 ah 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.240
 I'm really scared, you're all 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.810
 in everything that is happening as in the 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.810
 previous world 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.910
 social mobilizations the claims of 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.050
 those of the workers 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.820
 at three o'clock and break it out 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.800
 This is the problem, I say 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.520
 I wish I was wrong but if Brazil 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.520
 it is outside 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.180
 Imagine a world cup in Brazil without 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.090
 Brazil 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.710
 what can happen to me it seems that there 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.260
 that be realistic that world famous 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.870
 that made chile that was in 62 me 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.870
 it seems that he did it with what he had 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.239
 I started a nonsense this requirement 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.950
 of the end fan 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.369
 I do not know if Spain 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.479
 can also recover after the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.790
 successes can support the demands that 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.950
 Will have 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.430
 as the last world champion will come 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.250
 the footballers also very demanded 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.430
 and it is very important how is it 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.560
 I do not recover as important and do not see 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.990
 javi like 4 years ago he did not see him 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.400
 iniesta but good but maybe 30 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.229
 days recovering but I do not know if you win 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.320
 they are a show window I think today is the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.479
 the world's best so much good 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.550
 but the world public opinion what 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.530
 they all see and it would be good to have a 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.330
 good world cup not to win it because to win 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.650
 global is also very difficult and there 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.850
 thousands of circumstances that 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.860
 what can happen but what what 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.770
 show with a personality of a 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.290
 a captain of the Argentine national team 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.190
 they appealed they did not count on any 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.630
 my other supernatural pellets is not a 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.430
 human being 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.930
 he is a soccer player that there will not be because no 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.710
 You can believe I was lucky 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.010
 be with him 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.560
 the saint can not believe there is no German 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.150
 neither English nor iu nor and Japanese nor 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.830
 Argentinian that they can complete 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.470
 technically an athletic physicist and 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.980
 privileged like the one he had these 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:46.020
 footballers that we name are all 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.830
 big footballer diego the frank cruyff 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.440
 alfredo messi-cristiano ronaldo 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.650
 rivelino rivelino great 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:00.080
 beckenbauer great players but 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.080
 the paper was from another planet
