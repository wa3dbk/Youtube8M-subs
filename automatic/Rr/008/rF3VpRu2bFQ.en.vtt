00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 At the beginning of the 1510s, the first appeared 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.540
 tractors including tracked 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.059
 American Holt they produced a big 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.840
 impressed only by peaceful agrarians 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.940
 and on the military 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.650
 the development of the first combat vehicles opened 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.690
 in almost all military powers 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.640
 By the way Russia was by no means an exception. 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.220
 the inventor's machine 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.170
 he called her rover turned out to be quite 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.189
 original design and even partly 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.769
 successful 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.960
 let's say all-terrain vehicle first in the world knew how 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.029
 to overcome water obstacles had 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.099
 layered armor was very fast 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.899
 however, the military has serious 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.000
 doubts caused only rubber 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.190
 caterpillar of the car because of which it was 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.170
 almost doomed to go do not turn off 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.820
 the project abruptly closed the word as 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.280
 Porokhovschikova requested money 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.260
 issued for its implementation did not work 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.450
 Russia become a tank power and 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.590
 second try this scumbag pugal 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.379
 Moscow Region mushroom pickers 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.440
 right up to 1500 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.570
 dismantled to screw the king-tank or in 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.390
 people bat Nikolai Lebedenco 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.579
 built in 1915 and still 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.680
 remains the largest combat vehicle in 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.630
 stories true to practical value 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.000
 she didn't have a couple of shots 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.549
 the wheels of the huge wheels were taken out 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.680
 out of action first real battle tank 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.290
 created the british he got the name 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.850
 mark 1 that is model 1 to the front 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.680
 the Englishman left a new weapon in 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.150
 secrecy under the guise 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.970
 water tanks 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.080
 hence the name tank tank cistern 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.630
 true in the Russian pre-revolutionary 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.150
 print words translated as tub 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.890
 the first cars were very imperfect 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.540
 they were not only badly armored 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.000
 slow and reliable 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.920
 let's say have a big led so still called 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.750
 Mark 1 had trouble withdrawing 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.689
 exhaust gas and the temperature in 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.009
 the cockpit has reached 60 degrees so 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.090
 ferry somebody die just 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.009
 being inside 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.689
 and he could not have been driven by one driver 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.090
 but four at once 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.610
 however, in the first battle of the river somma 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.579
 great led showed its potential though 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.549
 half of the 49 tanks simply bogged down 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.470
 or broke down on the way to enemy trenches 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.630
 the rest managed to break through the front for 5 km 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.850
 and enthusiastic English general and quickly 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.369
 telegraphed request send more 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.190
 a thousand of the same as it turned out 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.990
 impressions of ordinary soldiers went exactly 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.570
 moral impact on the enemy 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.270
 became the main weapon of these monsters 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.910
 the tanks were once the object of ridicule 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.220
 steel now water out and moving with 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.290
 long chained in armor they 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.170
 seem to us the most visible embodiment 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.270
 the horrors of war so they wrote a note 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.860
 the British gradually finished their 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.590
 tank and logically put it on 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.730
 conveyor of cars of all brands they are french 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.520
 during the war years produced 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.890
 about 8000 and here is the German account 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.870
 copies went only in the top ten true 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.470
 the Germans tried to answer their enemies 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.230
 the quality of their a7v was so great that carried in 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.000
 myself as many as 18 people he was also 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.310
 well armored armed 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.200
 however, he did not avoid the ridiculous mistakes 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.180
 first cars and let's say the driver could 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.140
 see space only 9 meters away 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.550
 in front of them these were the pioneers 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.290
 tank building however in the first world 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.830
 nevertheless entered the episode the very first 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.840
 head-on tank battle in history 24 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.090
 april 1100 seventeenth year three 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.050
 a7v unexpectedly stumbled upon three 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.480
 english tanks 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.760
 two German confusedly got up two 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.400
 English shot down and ended the battle 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.620
 the duel from which the winner went all 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.510
 same English tank formally field 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.420
 battles seemed to be for the British 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.620
 in fact, they also have the upper hand, and in all 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.019
 first world 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.019
 first tank war in history
