on it to the 1970s Chevelle specs it's
now<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> vehicle<00:01:54.450> drive<00:01:54.780> as<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.470> was<00:01:55.620> in

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
now a vehicle drive as it was in

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
to from that error there's a lot of risk

the<00:02:12.290> SOA<00:02:12.650> process<00:02:13.330> dramatically<00:02:14.330> reduces
