like a pineapple the technique that I'm
using<00:00:38.000> at<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:38.420> moment<00:00:38.450> is<00:00:38.810> just<00:00:39.020> straight<00:00:39.260> up

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
using at the moment is just straight up

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.930 
using at the moment is just straight up
to<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.530> ceiling<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.130> then<00:00:40.640> at<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:40.910> last

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
to the ceiling and then at the last

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.460 
to the ceiling and then at the last
minute<00:00:41.300> curve<00:00:41.630> it<00:00:41.750> to<00:00:41.810> the<00:00:41.900> right<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:42.350> I'm

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
minute curve it to the right so I'm

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.150 
minute curve it to the right so I'm
trying<00:00:42.710> to<00:00:42.740> get<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:42.890> desired<00:00:43.370> wave<00:00:43.820> effect<00:00:45.160> as

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
exaggerate it now and that will allow it

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.440 
exaggerate it now and that will allow it
to<00:00:51.050> stick<00:00:51.470> up<00:00:51.590> for<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.800> rest<00:00:51.950> of<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.250> day

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
after the next few steps then we'll calm

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.700
