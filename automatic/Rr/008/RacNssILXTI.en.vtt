00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 I remember we spoke last week 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.160
 about 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.630
 two weeks ago when people 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.850
 confess you confess a failure 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.160
 The more you confess failure 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.150
 more failure increases is not true 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.680
 So you tell the person that you 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.310
 considers that you love that you finally 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.590
 you have a certain intimacy you 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.969
 account their problems 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:41.629
 their pain and confesses that his 12 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:47.850
 person in good faith to help you 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:52.350
 brings messages that will add more 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.610
 doubts within you and if you hear 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.600
 another person will see another county and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:05.159
 other county and you are getting 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.110
 more lost for so much advice 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.350
 that one speaks one thing another speaks the other 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:16.700
 Tell me which advice I'm going to follow. 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.369
 worst of all is that those counties 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.490
 add doubts add doubts inside 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.180
 When you come here, will you? 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.409
 comes down here with the word of 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:36.780
 God with prayer with the message of faith 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:45.920
 so you forget those voices of the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:52.049
 world and there begins the emergence of faith 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:54.799
 inside you start you believe in 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.420
 God you start to believe in yourself. 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.420
 then you start to get strong 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.799
 deep in the background what is happening 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:12.880
 doubts are removed or removed or 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:16.710
 and the level of faith under 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:22.720
 and then you feel good it 's a good 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:26.440
 very large but does not solve it not 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.650
 solve because whats the use of you is 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.650
 feel very good here in the church but 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:38.860
 when you leave the church 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:44.190
 you return to the same thoughts of 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:52.030

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:55.870

 Each one's head is different and one is a 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.540

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:19.450
