tweaking I with the white gouache I've
I've<00:02:03.979> lightened<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.640> horizon<00:02:05.210> slightly

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
I've lightened the horizon slightly

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.630 
I've lightened the horizon slightly
there<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.380> putting<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:07.070> little<00:02:07.369> bit<00:02:07.490> more

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640
