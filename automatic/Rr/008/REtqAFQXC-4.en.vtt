really matter and right below that a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.499 
really matter and right below that a
little<00:02:04.409> bit<00:02:04.530> i<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:04.950> my<00:02:05.130> hook<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:06.299> hook

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
little bit i have my hook and this hook

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.479 
little bit i have my hook and this hook
i'm<00:02:06.689> using<00:02:07.020> right<00:02:07.049> here<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.890> size<00:02:08.190> 8

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
i'm using right here this is a size 8

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.630 
i'm using right here this is a size 8
hook<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.720> i<00:02:09.750> usually<00:02:10.110> use<00:02:10.410> size<00:02:10.950> 10<00:02:11.370> hooks

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
hook but i usually use size 10 hooks

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.460 
hook but i usually use size 10 hooks
because<00:02:12.120> size<00:02:12.599> 10<00:02:12.930> hooks<00:02:13.170> are

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
because size 10 hooks are

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.380 
because size 10 hooks are
smaller<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.040> especially<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.240> you're

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
this works excellent for trout I fish

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.010 
this works excellent for trout I fish
but<00:05:38.470> all<00:05:38.680> different<00:05:39.160> color<00:05:39.750> rooster<00:05:40.750> tails

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
but all different color rooster tails

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.560 
but all different color rooster tails
and<00:05:41.320> I've<00:05:42.070> always<00:05:42.340> done<00:05:42.700> better<00:05:42.910> on<00:05:43.060> the<00:05:43.270> pink

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
and I've always done better on the pink

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.680 
and I've always done better on the pink
