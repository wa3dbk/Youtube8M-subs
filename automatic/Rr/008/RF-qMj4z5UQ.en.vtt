00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:25.369
What's the last thing you remember?
I had a glimpse into the past.

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:41.340
You're going to have to do for me what I once
did for you.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:51.500
You'll need me as well...
Side by side to end this war...before it ever

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.780
begins.
So...I wake up in my younger body and...then

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.430
what?
Find me. Convince me of all this.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.600
It's going to take the two of us.
And where do I find you?

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:14.490
A different path. A darker path.
Logan, I was a very different man.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.820
Lead me.
Guide me.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.380
Be patient with me.
Patience isn't my strong suit.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:02:00.720
I don't...want your suffering!
I don't want...YOUR FUTURE!

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.710
Please...
We need you to hope again.
