segment is the Easton s17 this is one of
the<00:00:12.599> sticks<00:00:12.840> again<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.320> our<00:00:13.710> viewers<00:00:14.070> here

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
the sticks again that our viewers here

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.180 
the sticks again that our viewers here
asked<00:00:14.639> us<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:15.320> profile<00:00:16.320> which<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:16.680> will<00:00:16.800> do<00:00:16.920> for

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
asked us to profile which we will do for

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.029 
asked us to profile which we will do for
you<00:00:17.400> today<00:00:17.720> this<00:00:18.720> basically<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.230> almost<00:00:19.830> built

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
you today this basically is almost built

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.710 
you today this basically is almost built
on<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.220> same<00:00:20.369> construction<00:00:20.910> same<00:00:21.210> platform

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
on the same construction same platform

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.359 
on the same construction same platform
as<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.910> se16<00:00:23.910> far<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.470> shaft<00:00:25.740> up<00:00:26.010> until

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
as the se16 far as the shaft up until

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.759 
as the se16 far as the shaft up until
about<00:00:26.660> this<00:00:27.660> point<00:00:27.990> right<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.289> where<00:00:28.680> you're

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
about this point right here where you're

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.290 
about this point right here where you're
going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.949> see<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> s17<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> bottom<00:00:30.240> of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
going to see the s17 on the bottom of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.700 
going to see the s17 on the bottom of
the<00:00:30.359> shaft<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:31.050> pretty<00:00:31.230> much<00:00:31.349> built<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the shaft it's pretty much built the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.549 
the shaft it's pretty much built the
same<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.730> an<00:00:32.880> elliptical<00:00:33.450> profile<00:00:34.230> is

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
same this is an elliptical profile is

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.350 
same this is an elliptical profile is
what<00:00:34.770> they<00:00:34.920> call<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.309> down<00:00:35.489> here<00:00:35.820> which

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
what they call it down here which

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.790 
what they call it down here which
basically<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.930> they<00:00:37.050> did<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.320> instead<00:00:37.469> of

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
basically what they did is instead of

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.459 
basically what they did is instead of
instead<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> squaring<00:00:39.450> off<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.960> shaft<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
instead of squaring off the shaft and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.529 
instead of squaring off the shaft and
doing<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:43.040> blade<00:00:44.040> insertion<00:00:44.670> they<00:00:45.300> did<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
doing just a blade insertion they did a

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.790 
doing just a blade insertion they did a
whole<00:00:45.750> sock<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.710> made<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.010> elliptical

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
whole sock and they made this elliptical

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.220 
whole sock and they made this elliptical
basically<00:00:49.800> profile<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.329> thick<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.960> what

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
basically profile to this thick and what

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.410 
basically profile to this thick and what
this<00:00:52.350> does<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:52.890> gives<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.460> full<00:00:54.000> torque

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
this does is this gives you full torque

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.139 
this does is this gives you full torque
the<00:00:55.320> energy<00:00:55.649> actually<00:00:55.949> gets<00:00:56.430> displaced

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the energy actually gets displaced

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.349 
the energy actually gets displaced
through<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.899> shaft<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.530> through<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> blade

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
through the shaft and through the blade

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.029 
through the shaft and through the blade
so<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.629> more<00:01:00.840> power<00:01:01.079> more<00:01:01.620> accurate

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
so you have more power more accurate

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.490 
so you have more power more accurate
shot<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:03.780> would<00:01:03.989> notice<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.320> difference

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
shot you would notice a difference

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.280 
shot you would notice a difference
actually<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.460> had<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> pleasure<00:01:06.450> again<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.930> using

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
actually I had a pleasure again of using

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.260 
actually I had a pleasure again of using
one<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.470> these<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.520> stick<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:08.970> had<00:01:09.240> a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
one of these and the stick just had a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.109 
one of these and the stick just had a
phenomenal<00:01:09.570> phenomenal<00:01:10.260> feel<00:01:11.030> handling<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
phenomenal phenomenal feel handling the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.630 
phenomenal phenomenal feel handling the
puck<00:01:12.360> even<00:01:13.229> when<00:01:13.409> you're<00:01:13.590> skating<00:01:14.280> down<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
puck even when you're skating down the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.789 
puck even when you're skating down the
ice<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.000> you're<00:01:15.150> handling<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.619> far

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
ice and you're handling the is far

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.770 
ice and you're handling the is far
stickhandling<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.460> actually<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.939> feel<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
stickhandling you actually can feel the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.080 
stickhandling you actually can feel the
response<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.250> puck<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.880> blade

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
response of the the puck on the blade

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.359 
response of the the puck on the blade
itself<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.710> know<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:23.070> where<00:01:23.250> it's

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
itself and you know you know where it's

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.770 
itself and you know you know where it's
at<00:01:23.490> all<00:01:23.670> at<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:23.909> times<00:01:24.240> you're<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.659> look

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
at all at all times you're not to look

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.719 
at all at all times you're not to look
down<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> make<00:01:25.560> sure<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.189> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
down for it to make sure you have it it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.749 
down for it to make sure you have it it
doesn't<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> real<00:01:27.360> tinny<00:01:27.630> feel<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.759> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
doesn't have a real tinny feel to it the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.980 
doesn't have a real tinny feel to it the
only<00:01:29.939> problem<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.360> had<00:01:30.570> what<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.869> is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
only problem that I had what this is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.200 
only problem that I had what this is
didn't<00:01:31.200> last<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.860> long<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.430> broke<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
didn't last really long I broke the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.789 
didn't last really long I broke the
blade<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.570> there<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> think<00:01:34.110> maybe<00:01:34.290> Easton

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
blade on there so I think maybe Easton

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.160 
blade on there so I think maybe Easton
should<00:01:35.390> should<00:01:36.390> look<00:01:36.509> into<00:01:36.659> making<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.990> blade

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
should should look into making the blade

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.319 
should should look into making the blade
a<00:01:37.200> little<00:01:37.470> stronger<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.909> stick<00:01:39.150> is

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
a little stronger but this stick is

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.359 
a little stronger but this stick is
really<00:01:39.689> nice<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.079> light<00:01:40.320> again<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.280> don't

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
really nice it's light again we don't

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.560 
really nice it's light again we don't
have<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> weights<00:01:41.820> for<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.119> which<00:01:42.299> will<00:01:42.450> be

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
have the weights for you which will be

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.969 
have the weights for you which will be
probably<00:01:42.810> posting<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> website

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
probably posting up on the website

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.130 
probably posting up on the website
sometime<00:01:44.430> soon<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.540> particular<00:01:45.810> version

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
sometime soon this particular version

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.120 
sometime soon this particular version
that<00:01:46.439> i<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> sakic<00:01:47.750> 100<00:01:48.750> flex

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
that i have here is the sakic 100 flex

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.830 
that i have here is the sakic 100 flex
and<00:01:50.130> again<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:50.970> all<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> east<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.540> sticks

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and again like all the east and sticks

elliptical profile is on this on a stick

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.850 
elliptical profile is on this on a stick
itself<00:02:30.860> again<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.190> Easton<00:02:32.780> s17<00:02:33.860> you

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
itself again this is the Easton s17 you

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.230 
itself again this is the Easton s17 you
saw<00:02:35.070> here<00:02:35.340> hockey<00:02:35.790> us<00:02:36.230> calm
