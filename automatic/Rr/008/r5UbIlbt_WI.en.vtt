right<00:00:51.510> there<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> thermal<00:00:52.860> paste<00:00:53.070> because

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
right there on the thermal paste because

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.819 
right there on the thermal paste because
I'm<00:00:53.340> going<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.520> reuse<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.199> to<00:00:55.199> cool<00:00:55.500> down<00:00:55.530> on

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
I'm going to reuse this to cool down on

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.340 
I'm going to reuse this to cool down on
my<00:00:55.949> wife's<00:00:56.190> computer<00:00:56.489> because<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.930> makes<00:00:58.140> too

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
my wife's computer because it makes too

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.319 
my wife's computer because it makes too
much<00:00:58.500> noise<00:00:58.820> makes<00:00:59.820> way<00:01:00.120> too<00:01:00.149> much<00:01:00.719> noise<00:01:01.050> so

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
much noise makes way too much noise so

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.899 
much noise makes way too much noise so
what<00:01:03.329> if<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.539> replaced<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.199> well<00:01:04.920> let<00:01:05.670> me

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
what if I replaced it with well let me

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:14.990 
what if I replaced it with well let me
show<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:07.460> this<00:01:09.710> read<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> box<00:01:11.479> is<00:01:13.760> my<00:01:14.760> new

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
show you this read the box is my new

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.240 
show you this read the box is my new
cooling<00:01:15.450> system<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.729> is<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.180> corsair<00:01:18.780> h50<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
cooling system it is the corsair h50 and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.030 
cooling system it is the corsair h50 and
i<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> say<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.810> works<00:01:22.049> incredibly<00:01:22.920> well

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
i have to say it works incredibly well

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.149 
i have to say it works incredibly well
better<00:01:23.820> than<00:01:23.909> expected<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
better than expected for what it is is a

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.510 
better than expected for what it is is a
self-contained<00:01:26.970> water<00:01:27.810> cooling<00:01:28.290> system<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
self-contained water cooling system it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
self-contained water cooling system it
simply<00:01:29.820> has<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.000> power<00:01:30.420> connectors<00:01:31.020> one<00:01:31.320> for

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
simply has to power connectors one for

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.940 
simply has to power connectors one for
the<00:01:31.590> pump<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.180> one<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> fan<00:01:34.290> comes<00:01:34.770> with

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the pump and one for the fan comes with

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.260 
the pump and one for the fan comes with
a<00:01:34.979> fan<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.189> course<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.820> connect<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
a fan of course and you connect up the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.370 
a fan of course and you connect up the
fan<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.990> put<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.979> your<00:01:38.070> system<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.380> that's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
fan and put it in your system and that's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380 
fan and put it in your system and that's
it<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.549> I'm<00:01:41.579> going<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.880> show<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:42.299> it

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it so I'm going to show you what it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.389 
it so I'm going to show you what it
looks<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:42.720> here<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.380> maybe<00:01:43.979> give<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.340> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
looks like here and maybe give you a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.490 
looks like here and maybe give you a
little<00:01:44.549> bit<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.850> how<00:01:45.299> much<00:01:45.479> noise<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.990> produces

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
little bit of how much noise it produces

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.200 
little bit of how much noise it produces
so<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> let's<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.659> look<00:01:48.810> at<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.079> setup

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
so so let's go look at the setup

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.320

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.759 
behind it it's all it really is it's
just<00:02:23.420> something<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.989> put<00:02:24.140> in<00:02:24.200> front<00:02:24.500> or

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
just something you put in front or

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.560 
just something you put in front or
behind<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:25.310> fan<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.030> can<00:02:26.150> get<00:02:26.209> a<00:02:26.269> good<00:02:26.450> angle

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
behind a fan so you can get a good angle

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.360 
behind a fan so you can get a good angle
on<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.930> light<00:02:27.110> on<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:29.769> flashlight<00:02:30.769> from<00:02:31.250> the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
on the light on this flashlight from the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.449 
on the light on this flashlight from the
camera<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.900> same<00:02:33.230> time<00:02:33.530> but<00:02:34.190> yeah<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.370> can

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
camera the same time but yeah you can

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.630 
camera the same time but yeah you can
see<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.700> radiator<00:02:35.180> there<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:36.680> basically

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
see the radiator there and basically

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.509 
see the radiator there and basically
that's<00:02:38.380> that's<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.560> cooling<00:02:39.890> system<00:02:39.920> the

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
that's that's the cooling system the

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.890 
that's that's the cooling system the
whole<00:02:40.970> job<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.420> radiator<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.170> pump<00:02:42.350> the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
whole job of the radiator is to pump the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.620 
whole job of the radiator is to pump the
the<00:02:44.900> heat<00:02:45.170> out<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.860> water<00:02:46.280> which<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.390> all

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
the heat out of the water which is all

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.449 
the heat out of the water which is all
self<00:02:48.110> contained<00:02:48.440> in<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:48.769> entire<00:02:49.040> system

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
self contained in this entire system

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.059 
self contained in this entire system
here<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.670> get<00:02:49.819> the<00:02:49.880> two<00:02:50.000> hoses<00:02:50.239> on<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.600> bottom

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
here you get the two hoses on the bottom

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.020 
here you get the two hoses on the bottom
you<00:02:52.069> don't<00:02:52.220> really<00:02:52.340> have<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.580> mess<00:02:52.819> with<00:02:53.000> it

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
you don't really have to mess with it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.540 
you don't really have to mess with it
too<00:02:53.150> much<00:02:53.330> I<00:02:53.900> mean<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:54.890> got<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.040> hose<00:02:55.280> that

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
too much I mean you got the hose that

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.289 
too much I mean you got the hose that
runs<00:02:55.730> right<00:02:57.010> there<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:58.280> there's<00:02:58.910> actually<00:02:59.269> a

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
runs right there so there's actually a

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.380 
runs right there so there's actually a
remarkably<00:02:59.840> easy<00:03:00.500> setup<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:01.310> was<00:03:02.030> surprised

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
remarkably easy setup I was surprised

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.900 
remarkably easy setup I was surprised
how<00:03:02.750> easy<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.110> was<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.260> install<00:03:03.799> it's<00:03:04.730> not

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
how easy it was to install it's not

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.050 
how easy it was to install it's not
without<00:03:05.090> its<00:03:05.209> minor<00:03:05.510> hiccups<00:03:05.930> but<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.760> worked

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
without its minor hiccups but it worked

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.360 
without its minor hiccups but it worked
overall<00:03:08.450> pretty<00:03:08.600> well<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:08.900> it's<00:03:09.049> completely

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
overall pretty well and it's completely

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.680 
overall pretty well and it's completely
quiet<00:03:10.370> you're<00:03:10.670> probably<00:03:10.880> hearing<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.420> fan

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
quiet you're probably hearing the fan

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.590 
quiet you're probably hearing the fan
the<00:03:12.110> other<00:03:12.310> exterior<00:03:13.310> case<00:03:13.760> fan<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.329> blows

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
the other exterior case fan that blows

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.810 
the other exterior case fan that blows
all<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.440> heat<00:03:15.739> out<00:03:15.769> of<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.040> case<00:03:16.280> because

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
all the heat out of the case because

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.220 
all the heat out of the case because
we're<00:03:17.000> right<00:03:17.180> next<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:17.690> it's<00:03:17.959> just<00:03:18.110> like

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
we're right next to it it's just like

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.440 
we're right next to it it's just like
right<00:03:18.440> there<00:03:18.970> but<00:03:21.160> yeah<00:03:22.160> so<00:03:22.459> that's<00:03:23.120> my<00:03:23.329> new

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
right there but yeah so that's my new

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.630 
right there but yeah so that's my new
cooling<00:03:23.810> system<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.190> works<00:03:25.220> pretty<00:03:25.489> well

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
cooling system and it works pretty well

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.940 
cooling system and it works pretty well
I'm<00:03:26.090> thinking<00:03:26.690> about<00:03:26.870> adding<00:03:27.019> a<00:03:27.290> second<00:03:27.680> fan

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
I'm thinking about adding a second fan

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.810 
I'm thinking about adding a second fan
to<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:29.140> be<00:03:30.140> as<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.160> can<00:03:31.250> see<00:03:31.400> here<00:03:31.640> you<00:03:31.790> can

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
to the be as you can see here you can

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.270 
to the be as you can see here you can
attach<00:03:32.180> another<00:03:32.329> fan<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.079> so<00:03:33.829> maybe<00:03:33.980> adding

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
attach another fan to it so maybe adding

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.620 
attach another fan to it so maybe adding
a<00:03:34.340> fan<00:03:34.579> to<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.790> front<00:03:35.000> of<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.359> get<00:03:35.480> more

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
a fan to the front of it to get more

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.319 
a fan to the front of it to get more
performance<00:03:35.810> out<00:03:36.350> of<00:03:36.410> it<00:03:36.620> be<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.459> cool<00:03:38.180> idea<00:03:38.620> so

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
performance out of it be a cool idea so

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.520 
performance out of it be a cool idea so
maybe<00:03:41.329> I<00:03:41.420> can<00:03:41.630> take<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:41.840> up<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.049> 4<00:03:42.200> gigahertz

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
maybe I can take it up to 4 gigahertz

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.400 
maybe I can take it up to 4 gigahertz
who<00:03:42.920> knows<00:03:43.130> right<00:03:44.019> that's<00:03:45.019> all<00:03:45.200> for<00:03:45.380> now

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
who knows right that's all for now

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.100 
who knows right that's all for now
thanks<00:03:45.950> for<00:03:45.980> watching
