use<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.700> wheel<00:02:21.030> from<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.420> closet<00:02:21.989> this<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.590> going

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
use a wheel from a closet this is going

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.560 
use a wheel from a closet this is going
to<00:02:22.860> allow<00:02:22.980> me<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.160> attach<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.640> laser<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.270> so

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
to allow me to attach the laser to it so

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.479 
to allow me to attach the laser to it so
that<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.720> will<00:02:24.840> do<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:24.989> full<00:02:25.290> 360<00:02:25.560> spin<00:02:26.160> without

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
that it will do a full 360 spin without

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.430 
that it will do a full 360 spin without
much<00:02:26.670> problem

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.930 

make<00:02:33.440> sure<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.770> only<00:02:34.010> glue<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.730> outer

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
make sure you only glue the outer

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.120 
make sure you only glue the outer
portion<00:02:35.600> down<00:02:35.750> because<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.530> want<00:02:36.710> that<00:02:36.770> screw

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
portion down because you want that screw

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.800 
portion down because you want that screw
to<00:02:37.160> spin<00:02:38.080> when<00:02:39.080> that's<00:02:39.230> done<00:02:40.510> glue<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.630> laser

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
to spin when that's done glue the laser

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.120 
to spin when that's done glue the laser
down<00:02:42.080> as<00:02:42.260> well<00:02:43.540> once<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.690> sets<00:02:45.050> you<00:02:45.770> should<00:02:45.980> be

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
down as well once it sets you should be

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.850 
down as well once it sets you should be
able<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.310> spin<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.790> no<00:02:46.910> problem<00:02:47.500> we<00:02:48.500> are<00:02:48.620> well

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
able to spin it no problem we are well

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.800 
able to spin it no problem we are well
on<00:02:48.890> our<00:02:49.070> way<00:02:52.090> now<00:02:53.090> for<00:02:53.240> this<00:02:53.330> next<00:02:53.390> part<00:02:53.750> I'm

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
on our way now for this next part I'm

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.330 
on our way now for this next part I'm
going<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:53.990> use<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.260> springs<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:54.950> removed

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
going to use the springs that I removed

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.760 
going to use the springs that I removed
so<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.180> can<00:02:56.330> hook<00:02:56.480> them<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.840> laser<00:02:57.110> so

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
so that I can hook them to the laser so

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.200 
so that I can hook them to the laser so
that<00:02:57.920> when<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.130> apparatus<00:02:58.400> turns<00:02:58.790> left<00:02:59.060> to

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
that when the apparatus turns left to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.080 
that when the apparatus turns left to
right<00:02:59.680> we<00:03:00.680> can<00:03:00.860> guide<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.310> laser<00:03:01.520> along<00:03:01.880> with

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
right we can guide the laser along with

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.270 
right we can guide the laser along with
it<00:03:02.270> I'll<00:03:02.840> do<00:03:03.080> this<00:03:03.170> with<00:03:03.320> hot<00:03:03.530> glue<00:03:03.740> as<00:03:04.070> it's

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
it I'll do this with hot glue as it's

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.540 
it I'll do this with hot glue as it's
simple<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.030> easy<00:03:05.710> so<00:03:06.710> I've<00:03:06.800> got<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.070> two<00:03:07.250> here

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
simple and easy so I've got the two here

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:18.130 
simple and easy so I've got the two here
let's<00:03:08.330> hook<00:03:08.570> them<00:03:08.660> up<00:03:16.630> okay<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:17.660> now<00:03:18.020> we're

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
let's hook them up okay and now we're

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.410 
let's hook them up okay and now we're
doing<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.380> other<00:03:18.470> side<00:03:18.740> we<00:03:19.640> are<00:03:19.760> almost<00:03:19.940> ready

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
doing the other side we are almost ready

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.760 
doing the other side we are almost ready
to<00:03:20.570> give<00:03:20.690> this<00:03:20.840> thing<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:21.110> test<00:03:23.590> alright<00:03:24.590> let's

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
to give this thing a test alright let's

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.830 
to give this thing a test alright let's
see<00:03:24.920> how<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.130> works

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
see how it works

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.340 
see how it works
hey<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:31.450> works<00:03:32.450> pretty<00:03:32.600> good<00:03:32.840> now<00:03:33.200> you'll

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
hey you works pretty good now you'll

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.170 
hey you works pretty good now you'll
notice<00:03:33.530> that<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.890> radius<00:03:34.280> isn't<00:03:34.520> huge<00:03:34.940> but

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
notice that the radius isn't huge but

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.640 
notice that the radius isn't huge but
you<00:03:35.210> don't<00:03:35.420> really<00:03:35.600> need<00:03:35.840> that<00:03:35.900> for<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.380> dog

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
you don't really need that for a dog

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.380 
you don't really need that for a dog
what<00:03:37.370> we're<00:03:37.490> going<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.730> try<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:38.060> do<00:03:38.180> is<00:03:38.300> get

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
what we're going to try and do is get

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.210 
what we're going to try and do is get
the<00:03:38.510> dog<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.900> run<00:03:39.050> forward<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.560> then<00:03:40.100> by

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
the dog to run forward and then by

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.740 
the dog to run forward and then by
shifting<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.760> laser<00:03:40.940> left<00:03:41.300> or<00:03:41.510> right

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
shifting the laser left or right

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.120 
shifting the laser left or right
hopefully<00:03:42.380> he<00:03:42.500> follows<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:44.950> this<00:03:45.950> is

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
hopefully he follows it and this is

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.949 
hopefully he follows it and this is
