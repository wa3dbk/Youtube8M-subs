00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.090
 so hello to all of you 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.500
 present my name is not that we are 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.330
 here in the kitchen of my restaurant 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.590
 I am creating myself today how 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.620
 to assemble a mayonnaise 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.510
 then the ingredients for mayonnaise 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.400
 days 2 salt and pepper 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.710
 mustard and oil then him he 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.779
 always took an oil for the 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.190
 Reunionese seasonings do not 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.980
 do not take a wii for free fear 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.810
 says nose on rapeseed oil can 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.910
 to be a mixed oil and the oil 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.769
 peanut that will serve both to 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.290
 seasonings only for cooking 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.960
 did not take once again especially not 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.050
 one night he offered turdi sunflower 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.510
 that's the principle we 're going to separate 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.980
 the yellows of the whites will separate 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.170
 yellow of the whites we tape on a cup 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.730
 lightly egg on a surface there 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.710
 never on the bench in a container 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.270
 because that's how we put them 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.649
 shells in the whites and that's 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.210
 pity because the whites we can 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.090
 perfectly the covers and by the 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.500
 then we go up the lamboeuf breath in 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.020
 game it's not people 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.590
 momentum in this way we come the 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.989
 put in the game 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.270
 then we have the quantities I invite you to 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.480
 download the file this 3 under this 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.480
 city 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.740
 1 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.740
 we do not know well 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.800
 the yellows of the whites like this then 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:31.270
 we'll put a pinch know wav and 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.740
 your tablespoon of mustard 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.960
 so we will try to always ask a 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.110
 dish towel under his flight to prevent that 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.610
 when we whip the bowl goes in all 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.070
 the senses that the maintenance and the work 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.070
 your daughter is healthy 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:54.950
 we will say how these articles and the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:59.810
 mountain blends one takes on him 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.630
 first of all slowly a net that 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.420
 we go but we we will search for 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.300
 continuous way rather stunning 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.600
 the oil at the start really everything 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.600
 slowly 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.040
 we wait for abandonment eyes and 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:22.870
 see the simple flight 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.870
 that then continues for her 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.280
 mayonnaise that allows me 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:46.970
 and here is your mayonnaise to finish and 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.040
 a good mayonnaise 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.810
 it's a mayonnaise wanting to turn and 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.810
 it does not fall
