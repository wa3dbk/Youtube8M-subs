00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.900
Welcome, sir.

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:21.072
Hello, my boy. I'd like a glass of rum.

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.871
Yes, it's coming.

00:00:25.953 --> 00:00:27.953
Let me, mum. I'll do it.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.068
Here you go. That does six pence.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.117
Thank you.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.300
Is Billy in his room?

00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:42.695
The man with a scar on his face.

00:00:45.543 --> 00:00:47.543
You must mean the captain.

00:00:49.514 --> 00:00:51.814
Yes, where is his room?
Can you take me there?

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.699
Yes, but who are you anyway?

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.720
His friend. His best friend to be exact.

00:00:59.182 --> 00:01:00.882
His room must be up there.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.900
He's not there at the moment.
He's having a walk on the cliffs.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.810
Interesting. Then I'll allow myself
to wait for him in his room.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.100
Is that clear?

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:15.122
Wait a moment!

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.439
No doubt. It's his room.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.200
Sir, what are you doing there?

00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:28.565
Blabbermouth!

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.500
I want the key to the room!

00:01:32.272 --> 00:01:34.272
No way! This is an honourable inn.

00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:37.501
We don't let anyone into the rooms
when the guests aren't there.

00:01:38.684 --> 00:01:40.484
But I'm his friend.

00:01:40.493 --> 00:01:42.493
Not even if you're his friend.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.030
The captain will surely be back soon.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.537
Wait here.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.527
Damn!

00:01:50.626 --> 00:01:52.626
A very hospitable house.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.890
So, you think Billy is on the cliffs?

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.150
He's coming.

00:02:20.382 --> 00:02:21.882
This will be fun.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.432
I'll welcome him nicely.

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:44.969
Watch out!

00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:56.251
It's you, Black Dog.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.200
You recognised me.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600
Not so fast.

00:03:02.827 --> 00:03:05.827
We could sit down and have a talk.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.700
You come from the man with one leg.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.400
Now listen.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.180
If you give everything to me,
I won't harm a hair on your head.

00:03:28.765 --> 00:03:31.365
Hey, you're bothering us! Get lost!

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.890
Come.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.804
Now the odds are fifty fifty.

00:04:24.446 --> 00:04:27.246
Surely you aren't going to kill me?

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.584
Get out of here!

00:04:54.908 --> 00:04:57.908
Go to town and get me a horse or a carriage!

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.800
I have to get out of here as soon as possible.

00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:05.902
The man with one leg...

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.500
will look for me everywhere.

00:05:23.016 --> 00:05:25.700
Run to Dr. Livesey! He should come at once!

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.815
Yes, mum.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.390
He had a stroke. I told him not to
drink so much.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.788
Bring me a bowl. We need to let blood.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.872
Yes.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.800
This tattoo says, "Long live Captain Flint".

00:06:03.493 --> 00:06:06.493
And here reads, "Billy Bones his fancy".

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.400
Flint was a great pirate ten years ago.

00:06:12.128 --> 00:06:14.528
It means that this man is also one.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.426
He can't drink alcohol when he wakes up.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.650
He would never survive that.

00:06:33.655 --> 00:06:34.739
Goodbye.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.488
Pirates are hanged or
imprisoned for life, right?

00:06:44.998 --> 00:06:46.398
Yes, that's right.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.200
Will the captain be taken before
the law when he has recovered?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.197
I'm a judge, but today I was a doctor.

00:06:53.724 --> 00:06:56.624
I must respect my vow of silence,
if you know what I mean.

00:06:57.026 --> 00:06:59.026
I can't say more about that.

00:07:22.795 --> 00:07:24.995
You must stay at least one week in bed.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.740
Did you hear?

00:07:27.498 --> 00:07:28.798
Look at my chest.

00:07:30.628 --> 00:07:33.028
Do you see signs that it was opened by force?

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.208
No. Not at all.

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:36.554
Has anyone tried to break it open?

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.200
Good.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Did Black Dog hand out anything
like a black spot?

00:07:45.362 --> 00:07:46.662
A black spot?

00:07:47.262 --> 00:07:48.862
What's that supposed to be?

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.800
It's about ten centimetres in diameter
and looks like a disc.
