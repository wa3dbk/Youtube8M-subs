sometimes you were you out on the trail
you're<00:00:13.890> not<00:00:14.040> always<00:00:14.070> going<00:00:14.520> to<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.640> enough

when<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.360> need<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.660> start<00:00:19.110> using<00:00:19.290> your

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
when you need to start using your

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.460 
when you need to start using your
drivetrain<00:00:19.860> to<00:00:20.760> gain<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.270> momentum<00:00:21.810> let's

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
drivetrain to gain that momentum let's

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.410 
drivetrain to gain that momentum let's
take<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> closer<00:00:22.920> look<00:00:23.040> as<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.820> what<00:00:23.970> exactly

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
take a closer look as to what exactly

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.320 
take a closer look as to what exactly
goes<00:00:24.750> into<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.200> useful<00:00:25.470> skill

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.320 

I<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:32.650> generate<00:00:33.040> plenty<00:00:33.310> of<00:00:33.580> momentum<00:00:33.850> to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
I can generate plenty of momentum to

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.510 
I can generate plenty of momentum to
clear<00:00:34.570> this<00:00:34.720> log<00:00:34.960> by<00:00:35.650> doing<00:00:35.980> three<00:00:36.190> quarters

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
clear this log by doing three quarters

clear this log by doing three quarters
of<00:00:36.550> a<00:00:36.700> pedal<00:00:37.000> stroke<00:00:37.239> with<00:00:37.720> my<00:00:37.870> drivetrain<00:00:38.440> I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
of a pedal stroke with my drivetrain I

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.770 
of a pedal stroke with my drivetrain I
want<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.520> finish<00:00:39.700> with<00:00:39.820> my<00:00:40.120> comfortable<00:00:40.510> foot

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
want to finish with my comfortable foot

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.490 
want to finish with my comfortable foot
forward<00:00:41.220> by<00:00:42.220> doing<00:00:42.610> that<00:00:42.640> I<00:00:43.050> have<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.230> start

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
forward by doing that I have to start

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.750 
forward by doing that I have to start
with<00:00:45.129> my<00:00:45.250> bad<00:00:45.460> foot<00:00:45.760> right<00:00:45.970> here<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.640> here<00:00:48.640> we

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
with my bad foot right here so here we

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.259 
with my bad foot right here so here we
go<00:00:48.820> three<00:00:49.540> quarters<00:00:50.050> of<00:00:50.080> a<00:00:50.260> stroke<00:00:51.150> got<00:00:52.150> my

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
go three quarters of a stroke got my

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.150 
go three quarters of a stroke got my

good foot forward ready to do a solid
unweight<00:00:54.970> of<00:00:55.150> the<00:00:55.330> rear<00:00:55.510> tire<00:00:59.160> if<00:01:00.160> you<00:01:00.309> don't

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
unweight of the rear tire if you don't

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.460

manage to get your body weight up and
forward<00:01:02.739> during<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.220> pedal<00:01:03.549> stroke<00:01:03.820> here's

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
forward during the pedal stroke here's

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.580 
forward during the pedal stroke here's
what<00:01:04.690> happens

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.870 

your<00:01:10.590> back<00:01:10.770> tire<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.040> going<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.370> get<00:01:11.490> hooked<00:01:11.670> up

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
your back tire is going to get hooked up

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.660 
your back tire is going to get hooked up
and<00:01:12.090> you're<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.300> to<00:01:12.360> go<00:01:12.510> nowhere<00:01:16.670> when

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and you're going to go nowhere when

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.000 
and you're going to go nowhere when
you're<00:01:17.790> coming<00:01:18.180> down<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:19.320> backside<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
you're coming down the backside of the

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.340 
you're coming down the backside of the
log<00:01:20.190> you<00:01:20.970> want<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.300> extend<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> bike<00:01:21.960> forward

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
log you want to extend the bike forward

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.340 
log you want to extend the bike forward
and<00:01:22.680> shift<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.460> body<00:01:23.670> weight<00:01:23.820> backwards

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
and shift your body weight backwards

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.080 
and shift your body weight backwards
that'll<00:01:25.350> prevent<00:01:25.620> you<00:01:26.160> from<00:01:26.190> doing<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.910> big

this is a skill that's pretty versatile

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.990 
this is a skill that's pretty versatile
and<00:01:41.810> all<00:01:42.140> sorts<00:01:42.560> of<00:01:42.620> situations<00:01:42.890> if<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.850> can
