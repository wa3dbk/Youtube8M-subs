00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 more often customers find you or you find 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.900
 customers on these when dad says son 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.370

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.650
 yourself if you yourself will not fit 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.000
 beautiful girls to you then yourself 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.980
 will be ugly the same 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.769
 customers you can until you lose heart rate 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.050
 sit in the office with the phone and wait a 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.260
 a big customer will call me soon and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.630
 your customers will not wait 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.510
 well, what before you visited 15 places 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.980
 sixteenth place he calls you already 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.719
 has some bunch of negativity about you already 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.489
 visited competitors like nobody 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.129
 nowhere does not take it to you himself came 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.410
 called the lowest price 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.680
 and a large client from the test back someone 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.600
 caring I tell you secretly good 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.620
 big customers often with him 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.989
 make an appointment 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.300
 easier than with small customers know 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.770
 why is a large client more confident 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.879
 to myself 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.920
 major customer he is always ready 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.350
 see alternative he realizes that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.239
 Now I have one supplier and if 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.519
 An alternative will appear to me it will be easier 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.260
 I can bend this supplier 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.340
 getting better conditions is always better 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
 have a spare airfield 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.360
 always be aware of what's going on 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.369
 the marketplace so large meet with 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.610
 pleasure and a little military yourself 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.259
 customer he is afraid of this means if creta 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.810
 find you most likely there aren't the most 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.759
 fatty most likely and how to get to 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.799
 the most bold call yourself 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.080
 offer may be something even 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.400
 some kind of semi free projects 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.369
 how to do something for them to at least 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.020
 begin to be friends with them how to look for them these 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.750
 large customers this is a separate article 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.520
 there are separate trainings on this topic but 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.450
 the question you have to ask yourself is my 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.409
 sales department 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.869
 he responds or initiates if 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.000
 It initiates this longing if it reacts 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.890
 well you can even do such a thing 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.350
 each manager at the beginning of the month give 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.200
 list name list name account list 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.180
 there are 20 customers say what I expect 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.009
 that at the end of the month you will give me a report on 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.590
 each one of them that you got through 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.640
 everyone traveled everyone made his way with anyone 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.490
 talked all show 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.960
 because so when they themselves are chaotic 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.119
 looking for it hard 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.120
 and when you mean there's your 20 clients here 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.740
 you have 30 customers here 40 everything should be 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.100
 we measure 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.890
 we if you tell the seller you run 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.100
 you could work a little better at him 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.600
 says well it seemed like a second 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.000
 measure what it means a little bit better 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.100
 work this month spent five become 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.830
 the next 6 should be some 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.840
 procedures on this topic should be that hell 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.900
 the rate for a new seller is 40 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.730
 cold calls a day are two meetings 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.610
 in a week which he spends one deal 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.240
 I do not know of these two meetings should be 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.920
 there must be some rules of procedure you 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.280
 will not be able to manage if you will not 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.280
 to measure
