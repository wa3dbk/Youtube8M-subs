00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
up here I got a pretty steady pace of

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.260 
up here I got a pretty steady pace of
course<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.370> racers<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.970> make<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270

course it's the racers that make the
race<00:00:42.420> hard<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.500> guys<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.890> really<00:00:44.040> giving

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
race hard so if guys are really giving

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.250 
race hard so if guys are really giving
the<00:00:44.399> gas<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.880> can<00:00:45.000> see<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.810> once<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.110> get<00:00:46.200> over

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the gas we can see but once we get over

way<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.450> finish<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.930> think<00:00:49.380> we'll<00:00:50.040> probably

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
way to the finish I think we'll probably

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.520 
tomorrow but of course a daylight today
could<00:00:57.030> take<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.450> much<00:00:57.600> strength<00:00:58.200> out<00:00:58.380> of<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
could take so much strength out of a

rider<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.040> could<00:00:59.640> be<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> difference

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
rider that could be the difference

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.549 
rider that could be the difference
between<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.690> few<00:01:00.870> seconds<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.350> time

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
between just a few seconds and then time

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
sketchy once you get in forward momentum

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.330 
sketchy once you get in forward momentum
