environment<00:02:45.040> which<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.310> what<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.459> particularly

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
environment which is what I particularly

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.550 
environment which is what I particularly
like<00:02:46.239> about<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:46.810> get<00:02:46.959> in<00:02:47.110> behind<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
like about it you get in behind the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.259 
like about it you get in behind the
wheel<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.370> think<00:02:48.580> for<00:02:48.670> people<00:02:48.880> who<00:02:49.060> haven't

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
wheel and I think for people who haven't

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.850 
wheel and I think for people who haven't
driven<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.690> class<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:50.140> vehicle<00:02:50.260> before<00:02:50.560> it's

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
driven this class of vehicle before it's

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.559 
driven this class of vehicle before it's
going<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.040> be<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.280> one<00:02:51.489> which<00:02:52.180> is<00:02:52.209> going<00:02:52.510> to

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
going to be the one which is going to

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.770 
going to be the one which is going to
make<00:02:52.750> make<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.410> easiest<00:02:54.069> to<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.970> transition

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
make make it easiest to to transition

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.470 
make make it easiest to to transition
from<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.500> passenger<00:02:56.980> car<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.459> what<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.120> after

I think vehicles are pretty much very

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.900 
I think vehicles are pretty much very
closely<00:04:17.780> matched<00:04:18.169> but<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.980> moment<00:04:19.340> outsides

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
closely matched but a moment outsides

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:30.060 
closely matched but a moment outsides
