00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.930 

hey<00:00:03.750> everyone<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.890> UC<00:00:05.279> was<00:00:05.460> released<00:00:05.790> today

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
hey everyone the UC was released today

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.519 
hey everyone the UC was released today
and<00:00:06.330> where<00:00:06.509> they<00:00:06.600> came<00:00:06.810> quite<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.170> number<00:00:07.379> of

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
and where they came quite a number of

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.169 
and where they came quite a number of
changes<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:08.040> had<00:00:08.429> not<00:00:08.550> been<00:00:08.610> implemented

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
changes that had not been implemented

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.549 
changes that had not been implemented
yet<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.660> beta<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.110> I'm<00:00:10.200> going<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.440> go

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
yet in the beta so I'm going to go

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.350 
yet in the beta so I'm going to go
through<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.830> few<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.070> them<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.490> first<00:00:12.120> off

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
through a few of them and first off

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.270 
through a few of them and first off
probably<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.960> most<00:00:13.080> important<00:00:13.559> interesting

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
probably the most important interesting

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.880 
probably the most important interesting
is<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.820> equipment<00:00:15.389> menu<00:00:15.690> as<00:00:15.839> shown<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.680> screen

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
is the equipment menu as shown on screen

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.490 
is the equipment menu as shown on screen
here<00:00:17.250> they've<00:00:17.640> changed<00:00:18.029> how<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.690> works<00:00:18.990> most

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
here they've changed how it works most

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.710 
here they've changed how it works most
notably<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.220> bottom<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:20.789> where<00:00:21.570> it

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
notably on the bottom here where it

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.689 
notably on the bottom here where it
shows<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.260> attacking<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.460> defending

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
shows the attacking and defending

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.179 
shows the attacking and defending
bonuses<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.480> get<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.949> main

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
bonuses that you get and so the main

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.589 
bonuses that you get and so the main
difference<00:00:26.550> for<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.269> rather<00:00:27.449> than

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
difference for this is that rather than

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.630 
difference for this is that rather than
some<00:00:27.960> weird<00:00:28.410> star<00:00:28.740> system<00:00:29.220> which<00:00:29.340> didn't

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
some weird star system which didn't

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.339 
some weird star system which didn't
really<00:00:29.820> make<00:00:29.939> sense<00:00:30.000> now<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.019> shows<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
really make sense now it shows the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.200 
really make sense now it shows the
actual<00:00:31.529> effectiveness<00:00:32.160> versus<00:00:32.880> different

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
actual effectiveness versus different

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.420 
actual effectiveness versus different
combat<00:00:33.510> styles<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.920> see<00:00:35.070> here<00:00:35.280> I'm

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
combat styles so as you can see here I'm

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.150 
combat styles so as you can see here I'm
wearing<00:00:35.820> full<00:00:36.030> torva<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.320> decent

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
wearing full torva and I have decent

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.310 
wearing full torva and I have decent
Meili<00:00:38.579> defense<00:00:38.879> low<00:00:39.270> mage<00:00:39.480> defense<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.110> high

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
Meili defense low mage defense and high

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.170 
Meili defense low mage defense and high
range<00:00:40.590> defense<00:00:40.980> which<00:00:41.520> makes<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.910> lot<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.090> sense

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
range defense which makes a lot of sense

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600 
range defense which makes a lot of sense
that's<00:00:42.570> how<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.809> supposed<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.610> also

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
that's how it's supposed to be and also

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.630 
that's how it's supposed to be and also
as<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.989> armor<00:00:46.920> rating<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.579> I

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
as you can see the armor rating that I

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.750 
as you can see the armor rating that I
have<00:00:47.820> total<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.420> my<00:00:48.539> armor<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.809> 520<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.890> so

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
have total for my armor is 520 and so

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.990 
have total for my armor is 520 and so
any<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.989> my<00:00:52.230> defenses<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> different

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
any of my defenses for the different

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.639 
any of my defenses for the different
combat<00:00:54.239> styles<00:00:54.629> they're<00:00:55.170> all<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> be

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
combat styles they're all going to be

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.189 
combat styles they're all going to be
below<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.160> or<00:00:56.399> equal<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.000> at<00:00:57.180> best<00:00:57.390> so

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
below that or equal to that at best so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.529 
below that or equal to that at best so
since<00:00:58.440> I'm<00:00:58.590> informally<00:00:59.250> gear<00:00:59.489> my<00:01:00.120> armor

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
since I'm informally gear my armor

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.200 
since I'm informally gear my armor
rating<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:01.350> 520<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.460> my<00:01:02.550> range<00:01:02.789> armor<00:01:03.090> rating

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
rating is 520 and my range armor rating

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.840 
rating is 520 and my range armor rating
is<00:01:03.480> 520<00:01:03.989> my<00:01:04.589> mage<00:01:04.830> armor<00:01:05.010> rating<00:01:05.250> though<00:01:05.580> is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
is 520 my mage armor rating though is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.200 
is 520 my mage armor rating though is
162<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:08.189> pretty<00:01:08.400> straightforward<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
162 so that's pretty straightforward the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.480 
162 so that's pretty straightforward the
same<00:01:09.420> thing<00:01:09.630> applies<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.140> weapons<00:01:10.500> as<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.369> can

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
same thing applies to weapons as you can

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.160 
same thing applies to weapons as you can
see<00:01:11.610> with<00:01:11.820> my<00:01:11.970> dual<00:01:12.119> cata<00:01:12.360> crossbows<00:01:12.869> if<00:01:13.049> I'm

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
see with my dual cata crossbows if I'm

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.070 
see with my dual cata crossbows if I'm
in<00:01:13.290> range<00:01:13.439> gear<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:14.670> accuracy<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.659> at<00:01:15.900> eight

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
in range gear my accuracy is at eight

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.380 
in range gear my accuracy is at eight
hundred<00:01:16.110> against<00:01:16.890> magic<00:01:17.100> 400<00:01:17.909> against<00:01:18.090> range

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
hundred against magic 400 against range

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.109 
hundred against magic 400 against range
160<00:01:19.200> against<00:01:19.470> melee<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:20.490> pretty<00:01:20.729> much<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
160 against melee it's pretty much the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.420 
160 against melee it's pretty much the
same<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.869> old<00:01:21.900> system<00:01:22.320> where<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.220> had

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
same as the old system where you had

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.480 
same as the old system where you had
your<00:01:23.869> stab<00:01:24.869> slash<00:01:25.140> crush<00:01:25.590> defence<00:01:25.979> magic

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
your stab slash crush defence magic

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.420 
your stab slash crush defence magic
defense<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.030> range<00:01:27.689> defense<00:01:28.130> except<00:01:29.130> now

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
defense and range defense except now

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.359 
defense and range defense except now
it's<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.450> mailee<00:01:30.990> magic<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.770> range<00:01:31.950> defense

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
it's just mailee magic and range defense

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.640 
it's just mailee magic and range defense
and<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.579> don't<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.850> any<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
and you don't have any of the

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.230 
and you don't have any of the
subdivisions<00:01:34.650> there<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.610> that's<00:01:36.000> pretty

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
subdivisions there so that's pretty

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240 
subdivisions there so that's pretty
straightforward<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.470> next<00:01:37.740> thing<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.009> wanted

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
straightforward the next thing I wanted

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.100 
straightforward the next thing I wanted
to<00:01:38.310> show<00:01:38.430> since<00:01:39.060> I'm<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.210> fight<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:39.960> is

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
to show since I'm in fight it's here is

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.289 
to show since I'm in fight it's here is
what<00:01:40.920> they've<00:01:41.070> done<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> hybrid<00:01:41.939> armors

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
what they've done to the hybrid armors

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.200 
what they've done to the hybrid armors
now<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.320> beta<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.189> hybrid<00:01:44.430> armors<00:01:44.909> were

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
now in the beta the hybrid armors were

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.590 
now in the beta the hybrid armors were
not<00:01:45.689> quite<00:01:46.110> right<00:01:46.850> what<00:01:47.850> they<00:01:47.970> did<00:01:48.119> was<00:01:48.299> just

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
not quite right what they did was just

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.960 
not quite right what they did was just
uh<00:01:48.899> they<00:01:49.710> gave<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> same<00:01:50.159> stats<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:50.610> an<00:01:50.700> excuse

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
uh they gave the same stats as an excuse

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.300 
uh they gave the same stats as an excuse
except<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> little<00:01:51.899> bit<00:01:51.990> better<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.770> for

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
except a little bit better so for

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.880 
except a little bit better so for
example<00:01:53.340> your<00:01:53.790> Vanguard<00:01:54.270> gear<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.560> I

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
example your Vanguard gear was the I

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.280 
example your Vanguard gear was the I
believe<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> was<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.579> mail<00:01:56.909> mailee<00:01:57.780> gear<00:01:58.020> so

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
believe it was the mail mailee gear so

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.219 
believe it was the mail mailee gear so
it<00:01:58.530> was<00:01:59.240> about<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:00.450> good<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.689> torva<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it was about as good as torva but a

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.780 
it was about as good as torva but a
little<00:02:01.439> bit<00:02:01.560> better<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:02.399> now<00:02:02.549> they've

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
little bit better but now they've

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.069 
little bit better but now they've
changed<00:02:02.820> them<00:02:03.299> back<00:02:03.450> into<00:02:03.659> being<00:02:03.840> hybrid

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
changed them back into being hybrid

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.109 
changed them back into being hybrid
gears<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:05.070> they<00:02:05.189> seem<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> little<00:02:05.909> bit

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
gears but they seem to be a little bit

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.660 
gears but they seem to be a little bit
bugged<00:02:06.420> or<00:02:06.719> at<00:02:07.259> least<00:02:07.439> they<00:02:08.009> switched<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
bugged or at least they switched the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.969 
bugged or at least they switched the
combat<00:02:09.209> effectiveness<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:10.800> see

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
combat effectiveness so as you can see

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.430 
combat effectiveness so as you can see
Vanguard<00:02:11.459> here<00:02:12.260> 637

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
Vanguard here 637

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.850 
Vanguard here 637
defense<00:02:13.920> for<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.430> full<00:02:14.820> set<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.290> it's<00:02:16.290> good

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
defense for the full set and it's good

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.530 
defense for the full set and it's good
at<00:02:16.980> defending<00:02:17.250> against<00:02:17.490> magic<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.270> range

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
at defending against magic and range

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.110 
at defending against magic and range
which<00:02:19.260> previously<00:02:19.710> was<00:02:19.950> what<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.640> trickster

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
which previously was what the trickster

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.390 
which previously was what the trickster
set<00:02:21.360> was<00:02:21.510> good<00:02:21.690> at<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.710> yeah<00:02:22.920> each<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
set was good at but yeah each of the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.610 
set was good at but yeah each of the
other<00:02:23.520> sets<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:24.600> just<00:02:24.840> quite<00:02:25.170> similar<00:02:25.470> to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
other sets it's just quite similar to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.160 
other sets it's just quite similar to
that<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:26.640> for<00:02:26.970> example<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.510> trickster<00:02:27.960> set

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
that so for example the trickster set

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.120 
that so for example the trickster set
here<00:02:28.440> as<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.490> can<00:02:29.520> see<00:02:29.670> give<00:02:30.650> 637<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.830> Meili

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
here as you can see give 637 to Meili

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.620 
here as you can see give 637 to Meili
and<00:02:32.430> magic<00:02:32.910> defense<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:35.270> this<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
and magic defense so this is this is the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.560 
and magic defense so this is this is the
equivalent<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:38.130> battle<00:02:38.820> mage<00:02:38.940> before<00:02:39.330> and

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
equivalent of a battle mage before and

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.650 
equivalent of a battle mage before and
then<00:02:40.260> battle<00:02:40.590> mage<00:02:40.770> now<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.610> good<00:02:42.210> against

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
then battle mage now is good against

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.990 
then battle mage now is good against
Bailey<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.680> range<00:02:43.950> which<00:02:44.310> doesn't<00:02:44.880> really

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
Bailey and range which doesn't really

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.430 
Bailey and range which doesn't really
make<00:02:45.210> sense<00:02:45.270> because<00:02:45.840> it's<00:02:45.990> supposed<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.320> be

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
make sense because it's supposed to be

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.220 
make sense because it's supposed to be
mage<00:02:46.620> gear<00:02:46.920> or<00:02:47.670> at<00:02:47.850> least<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.210> was<00:02:48.360> before<00:02:48.570> so<00:02:49.200> I

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
mage gear or at least it was before so I

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.590 
mage gear or at least it was before so I
think<00:02:49.590> they<00:02:49.770> switched<00:02:50.280> around<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:51.060> stats<00:02:51.390> by

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
think they switched around the stats by

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.960 
think they switched around the stats by
mistake<00:02:51.930> but<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.500> get<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.710> general<00:02:52.890> idea<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
mistake but you get the general idea the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.810 
mistake but you get the general idea the
hot<00:02:54.150> cup<00:02:54.540> it's<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:55.200> Thai<00:02:55.950> bird<00:02:56.100> armor<00:02:56.340> again<00:02:56.550> so

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
hot cup it's a Thai bird armor again so

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.180 
hot cup it's a Thai bird armor again so
that's<00:02:57.180> quite<00:02:57.660> good<00:02:57.750> it's<00:02:58.380> better<00:02:58.860> than<00:02:59.040> it

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
that's quite good it's better than it

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.070 
that's quite good it's better than it
just<00:02:59.220> being<00:02:59.460> next<00:03:00.030> equivalents<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.660> guess<00:03:00.840> and

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
just being next equivalents I guess and

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.110 
just being next equivalents I guess and
um<00:03:02.450> okay<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.480> let's<00:03:04.440> see<00:03:04.590> what<00:03:04.620> else<00:03:04.890> they<00:03:05.880> also

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
um okay so let's see what else they also

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.660 
um okay so let's see what else they also
graphically<00:03:06.990> redid<00:03:07.500> quite<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.010> few<00:03:08.220> other<00:03:08.340> sets

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
graphically redid quite a few other sets

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.290 
graphically redid quite a few other sets
and<00:03:09.090> things<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:10.580> this<00:03:11.580> is<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.910> our<00:03:12.060> middle

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
and things so this is the our middle

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.150 
and things so this is the our middle
battle<00:03:12.540> staff<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:13.440> looks<00:03:13.860> significantly

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
battle staff it looks significantly

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.360 
battle staff it looks significantly
better<00:03:14.760> now<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.090> my<00:03:15.240> opinion<00:03:15.770> it's<00:03:16.770> does<00:03:16.980> the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
better now in my opinion it's does the

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.490 
better now in my opinion it's does the
little<00:03:17.580> green<00:03:17.820> effect<00:03:18.150> there<00:03:18.360> but<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:19.050> looks<00:03:19.320> a

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
little green effect there but it looks a

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.370 
little green effect there but it looks a
lot<00:03:19.770> better<00:03:20.120> they've<00:03:21.120> also<00:03:21.420> some<00:03:22.050> people<00:03:22.290> were

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
lot better they've also some people were

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.160 
lot better they've also some people were
wondering<00:03:22.560> about<00:03:22.800> this<00:03:23.040> with<00:03:23.220> royal<00:03:23.550> bolts

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
wondering about this with royal bolts

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.960 
wondering about this with royal bolts
whether<00:03:25.170> they<00:03:25.380> were<00:03:26.220> going<00:03:26.520> to<00:03:26.580> make<00:03:26.820> them

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
whether they were going to make them

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.300 
whether they were going to make them
only<00:03:27.180> work<00:03:27.390> for<00:03:27.600> real<00:03:27.720> crossbows<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.500> no<00:03:29.130> they

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
only work for real crossbows and no they

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.270 
only work for real crossbows and no they
do<00:03:29.370> work<00:03:29.610> for<00:03:29.790> all<00:03:29.910> crossbows<00:03:30.920> I've<00:03:31.920> got<00:03:32.100> some

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
do work for all crossbows I've got some

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.850 
do work for all crossbows I've got some
implied<00:03:32.700> robes<00:03:33.120> here<00:03:33.390> these<00:03:34.050> these<00:03:34.530> are<00:03:34.590> just

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
implied robes here these these are just

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.790 
implied robes here these these are just
one<00:03:34.980> of<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.130> new<00:03:35.280> sets<00:03:35.520> its<00:03:36.450> level<00:03:36.900> 10<00:03:37.290> magic

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
one of the new sets its level 10 magic

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.650 
one of the new sets its level 10 magic
gear<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.250> can<00:03:38.489> make<00:03:38.760> by<00:03:38.970> killing<00:03:39.330> imps

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
gear that you can make by killing imps

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.070 
gear that you can make by killing imps
and<00:03:40.850> crafting<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.940> hides<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.480> it's<00:03:42.720> not

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
and crafting the hides so it's not

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.640 
and crafting the hides so it's not
really<00:03:43.140> anything<00:03:43.500> special<00:03:43.739> but<00:03:44.930> it<00:03:45.930> looks

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
really anything special but it looks

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.490 
really anything special but it looks
okay<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.010> guess<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.810> don't<00:03:48.810> have<00:03:48.900> any<00:03:49.050> clips<00:03:49.260> for

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
okay I guess I don't have any clips for

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.890 
okay I guess I don't have any clips for
it<00:03:49.620> but<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.980> ring<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.370> vigor<00:03:50.550> has<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.450> different

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
it but the ring of vigor has a different

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.890 
it but the ring of vigor has a different
effect<00:03:51.989> of<00:03:52.620> sort<00:03:53.100> of<00:03:53.190> different<00:03:53.519> then<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.540> the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
effect of sort of different then in the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.970 
effect of sort of different then in the
regular<00:03:55.380> game<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:56.540> right<00:03:57.540> now<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:58.230> ring<00:03:58.860> of

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
regular game so right now the ring of

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.350 
regular game so right now the ring of
vigor<00:03:59.220> when<00:03:59.550> you<00:03:59.640> do<00:03:59.760> an<00:03:59.850> ultimate<00:04:00.180> ability

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
vigor when you do an ultimate ability

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.090 
vigor when you do an ultimate ability
it'll<00:04:01.110> keep<00:04:01.260> ten<00:04:01.560> percent<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:02.010> your

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
it'll keep ten percent of your

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.979 
it'll keep ten percent of your
adrenaline<00:04:02.610> bar<00:04:02.790> which<00:04:03.390> is<00:04:03.420> actually<00:04:03.690> quite

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
adrenaline bar which is actually quite

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.800 
adrenaline bar which is actually quite
good<00:04:04.250> that's<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.640> lot<00:04:06.000> saved<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.540> it's<00:04:06.660> really

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
good that's a lot saved and it's really

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.750 
good that's a lot saved and it's really
helpful<00:04:07.110> for<00:04:07.739> certain<00:04:08.010> abilities<00:04:08.430> where<00:04:08.670> you

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
helpful for certain abilities where you

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.370 
helpful for certain abilities where you
want<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.000> get<00:04:09.120> back<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.420> using<00:04:09.570> thresholds<00:04:10.260> as

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
want to get back to using thresholds as

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.100 
want to get back to using thresholds as
soon<00:04:10.530> as<00:04:10.650> possible<00:04:11.209> also<00:04:12.209> if<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.720> use<00:04:13.080> the

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
soon as possible also if you use the

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.680 
soon as possible also if you use the
invigorate<00:04:14.010> aura<00:04:14.310> which<00:04:14.880> is<00:04:14.910> actually

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
invigorate aura which is actually

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.270 
invigorate aura which is actually
another<00:04:16.019> thing<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.440> want<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.709> mention<00:04:16.859> auras

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
another thing to want to mention auras

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.550 
another thing to want to mention auras
are<00:04:17.400> discounted<00:04:18.030> by<00:04:18.810> twenty-five<00:04:19.410> percent

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
are discounted by twenty-five percent

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.279 
are discounted by twenty-five percent
for<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.220> next<00:04:20.489> two<00:04:20.640> weeks<00:04:20.669> I<00:04:21.090> made<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.080> video

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
for the next two weeks I made a video

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.930 
for the next two weeks I made a video
about<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:22.979> I'll<00:04:23.250> link<00:04:23.400> that<00:04:23.520> one<00:04:23.820> on

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
about that so I'll link that one on

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.230 
about that so I'll link that one on
screen<00:04:24.270> here<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:25.680> at<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.010> end<00:04:26.130> of<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.250> video

screen here and at the end of the video

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.939 
screen here and at the end of the video
so<00:04:27.479> next<00:04:27.690> it's<00:04:28.020> just<00:04:28.229> a<00:04:28.319> few<00:04:28.500> little<00:04:28.620> small

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
so next it's just a few little small

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.249 
so next it's just a few little small
things<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:29.430> first<00:04:29.699> off<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.300> Barrow<00:04:30.539> set<00:04:30.870> the

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
things so first off the Barrow set the

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.680 
things so first off the Barrow set the
great<00:04:31.500> cost<00:04:31.770> has<00:04:31.979> been<00:04:32.009> greatly<00:04:32.460> increased<00:04:33.180> it

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
great cost has been greatly increased it

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.439 
great cost has been greatly increased it
used<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.020> cost<00:04:34.139> 330<00:04:35.069> k<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.370> repair<00:04:35.819> a<00:04:35.849> full<00:04:36.210> set

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
used to cost 330 k to repair a full set

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.230 
used to cost 330 k to repair a full set
after<00:04:36.870> 15<00:04:37.199> hours<00:04:37.349> of<00:04:37.580> being<00:04:38.580> combat<00:04:39.000> at<00:04:39.120> which

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
after 15 hours of being combat at which

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.059 
after 15 hours of being combat at which
point<00:04:39.419> it<00:04:39.569> would<00:04:39.690> be<00:04:39.810> fully<00:04:39.990> degraded<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.560> at

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
point it would be fully degraded and at

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:44.809 
point it would be fully degraded and at
99<00:04:41.460> smithing<00:04:41.759> it<00:04:42.150> would<00:04:42.330> go<00:04:42.720> down<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.990> 166<00:04:43.889> k<00:04:44.190> so

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
99 smithing it would go down to 166 k so

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.180 
99 smithing it would go down to 166 k so
that<00:04:44.970> price<00:04:45.240> has<00:04:45.479> been<00:04:45.509> tripled<00:04:46.139> so<00:04:46.440> now<00:04:46.860> if

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
that price has been tripled so now if

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.580 
that price has been tripled so now if
you're<00:04:47.520> if<00:04:47.970> you<00:04:48.210> repair<00:04:48.599> it<00:04:48.630> at<00:04:48.930> Bob's<00:04:49.139> axes

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
you're if you repair it at Bob's axes

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.460 
you're if you repair it at Bob's axes
and<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:49.830> do<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:50.699> then<00:04:51.270> it's<00:04:51.449> a<00:04:51.599> mill<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:52.110> earn

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
and you do that then it's a mill to earn

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.740 
and you do that then it's a mill to earn
on<00:04:52.680> 90<00:04:53.009> k<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.639> repair<00:04:53.849> the<00:04:53.940> full<00:04:54.120> set<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.539> if

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
on 90 k to repair the full set and if

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.180 
on 90 k to repair the full set and if
you're<00:04:54.870> not<00:04:54.960> in<00:04:55.110> on<00:04:55.199> smithing<00:04:55.620> then<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:55.889> costs

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
you're not in on smithing then it costs

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.170 
you're not in on smithing then it costs
around<00:04:57.020> 450<00:04:58.020> k<00:04:58.139> or<00:04:58.289> so<00:04:58.440> so<00:04:59.069> it's<00:04:59.580> definitely

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
around 450 k or so so it's definitely

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.760 
around 450 k or so so it's definitely
more<00:05:00.300> expensive<00:05:00.780> but<00:05:00.870> it's<00:05:01.050> still<00:05:01.259> not<00:05:01.500> all

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
more expensive but it's still not all

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.309 
more expensive but it's still not all
that<00:05:01.830> overpriced<00:05:02.550> at<00:05:02.789> all<00:05:02.909> and<00:05:03.120> that<00:05:03.150> was<00:05:04.020> to

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:04.319 
that overpriced at all and that was to

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.409 
that overpriced at all and that was to
balance<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:04.770> since<00:05:05.039> bandos<00:05:05.789> is<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.240> same

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
balance it since bandos is the same

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.110 
balance it since bandos is the same
level<00:05:06.720> as<00:05:07.289> barrows<00:05:07.680> now<00:05:07.860> so<00:05:08.250> if<00:05:08.550> you<00:05:08.880> want<00:05:09.060> to

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
level as barrows now so if you want to

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.909 
level as barrows now so if you want to
get<00:05:09.330> bandos<00:05:09.750> then<00:05:10.259> you<00:05:10.380> don't<00:05:10.530> have<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.770> deal

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
get bandos then you don't have to deal

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.350 
get bandos then you don't have to deal
with<00:05:11.039> the<00:05:11.099> repair<00:05:11.430> costs<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.150> get<00:05:12.270> the

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
with the repair costs and you get the

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.059 
with the repair costs and you get the
same<00:05:12.539> stats<00:05:12.870> but<00:05:13.590> if<00:05:13.680> you<00:05:13.770> want<00:05:13.919> to<00:05:13.979> use

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
same stats but if you want to use

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:15.559 
same stats but if you want to use
barrows<00:05:14.370> then<00:05:14.550> you<00:05:14.639> get<00:05:14.759> the<00:05:14.909> repair<00:05:15.150> cost<00:05:15.389> so

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
barrows then you get the repair cost so

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.290 
barrows then you get the repair cost so
that's<00:05:15.750> nice<00:05:15.960> they<00:05:16.680> also<00:05:16.889> very<00:05:17.759> much<00:05:17.940> nerfed

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
that's nice they also very much nerfed

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.839 
that's nice they also very much nerfed
polypore<00:05:18.960> because<00:05:19.289> in<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:20.009> beta<00:05:20.400> it<00:05:20.669> was

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
polypore because in the beta it was

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.089 
polypore because in the beta it was
equivalent<00:05:21.449> to<00:05:21.569> a<00:05:21.659> chaotic<00:05:21.930> staff<00:05:22.319> which<00:05:22.919> was

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
equivalent to a chaotic staff which was

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:24.800 
equivalent to a chaotic staff which was
not<00:05:23.250> right<00:05:23.490> they<00:05:23.849> dropped<00:05:24.090> it<00:05:24.270> down<00:05:24.389> to<00:05:24.539> level

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
not right they dropped it down to level

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.469 
not right they dropped it down to level
75<00:05:25.319> so<00:05:26.190> it's<00:05:26.310> still<00:05:26.460> quite<00:05:26.669> good<00:05:26.909> it's<00:05:27.210> just

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
75 so it's still quite good it's just

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.390 
75 so it's still quite good it's just
not<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.870> best<00:05:27.990> staff<00:05:28.259> in<00:05:28.409> the<00:05:28.560> game<00:05:28.710> it

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
not the best staff in the game it

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.820 
not the best staff in the game it
another<00:05:30.060> 75<00:05:30.569> makes<00:05:30.930> sense<00:05:31.169> because<00:05:31.409> it<00:05:31.710> goes

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
another 75 makes sense because it goes

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.200 
another 75 makes sense because it goes
along<00:05:31.979> with<00:05:32.219> the<00:05:32.340> other<00:05:32.430> ganoderma<00:05:33.000> gear

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
along with the other ganoderma gear

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.540 
along with the other ganoderma gear
which<00:05:33.360> is<00:05:33.509> also<00:05:33.750> at<00:05:33.810> level<00:05:34.020> 75<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.800> then<00:05:35.400> the

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
which is also at level 75 and then the

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.040 
which is also at level 75 and then the
final<00:05:35.699> thing<00:05:35.880> for<00:05:36.180> this<00:05:36.270> video<00:05:36.570> was<00:05:36.840> just

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
final thing for this video was just

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.480
