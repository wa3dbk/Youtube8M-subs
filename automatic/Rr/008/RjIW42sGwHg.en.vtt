00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.509
 world as they are here commenting on a 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.240
 gameplay a decoration video tutorial 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.630
 and we are going to learn how to make chairs or 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.760
 armchairs a pot a table this ones 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.689
 styles like east bunks for the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.570
 beach and all that and it's the final surprise 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.220
 that already elaborate and well let's start 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.580
 first to do one if I need 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.160
 wooden stairs and signs 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.850
 what is passionate if we already put here 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.680
 well for example we can 3 well or what 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.680
 we want and we will put the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.629
 signs to the side and we do not put anything and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.900
 then you can see how it is 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.800
 well that's not a way and so like 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.440
 you can do any of this 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.680
 one size can do so too one 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.530
 individual so small and good we go 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.530
 with the next one the next 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.600
 do as a bed and good 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.159
 durÃ¡n we have to put a slab of 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.560
 wood and and here a staircase here so 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.940
 while as they see it makes the effect as if 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.830
 outside a bed or is not seen in the 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.369
 staircase but what are cameras but 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.530
 then we repeat stair and slab 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.140
 then it seems here we go to bed 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.780
 quietly a little while to take the 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.640
 sun not quite well 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.399
 as you see, he is helping us 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.330
 subscribers friends boy barc and health 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.570
 for you vaart 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.840
 and the following today we are going to learn how 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.600
 make a table 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.090
 of a table we need berries and we are 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.409
 the ace the table we are going to do so we are going to 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.210
 put on the floor as if it were a 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.829
 square or if you want to sit 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.899
 rectangular or whatever you want it to be let's go 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.960
 to put them as if they were our legs 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:54.090
 and very easy above this simple and 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.490
 we are simply going to put the slabs 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.490
 and how I have been pretty enough 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.189
 well our table 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.820
 worth the next thing would be to make a pot 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:09.830
 for the pot will need ground 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.989
 seedlings with a tree and I actually 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.819
 for each pot and four hatches 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.319
 also for each pot we are going to put 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:22.130
 earth and in each there is forgiveness in each 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:25.940
 from its sides of the cube we are going to put 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.500
 hatches like that 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.410
 and then already having this we the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.320
 let's close 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.930
 and ready we close up with about the 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.960
 seedling and as a victor quite 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.780
 pretty well the little tree this one yes 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:46.030
 it seems like a 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:51.190
 a this pot then the next 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.710
 let's do in an armchair 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.280
 this is the one of the ways of prayer 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.340
 and if you like them then take and 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.370
 good is done in this way 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.110
 to these as he mentally reaches 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.790
 appreciate that we are like this what are 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.680
 armchairs pretty nice like the maki 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.629
 we can sit down and talk for a while 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.700
 what's up, how are you going? 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.810
 as it is and it will be endowed quite well 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.530
 as decoration I repeat 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.739
 and good this one in terms of decoration that 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.160
 it's basically everything and good the surprise 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.390
 it's special we're going to need 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.060
 pumpkin with the inside and short and 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.410
 anything to recharge new ones in 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.950
 she 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.600
 then we start with the example let's go 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.910

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.480

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.230
 the one who made it 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.099
 I did not have anything to pour 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.760
 and good as you see here this is done and 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:55.580
 this is a scarecrow that the truth 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.519

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.909
 here we go what the 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.909
