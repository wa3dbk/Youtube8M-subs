00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.269
 hi how about everyone in this video 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.010
 I'll teach you how to cut a blouse the 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.870
 materials that they will need are a 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.280
 blouse does not have to be a new thing 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.410
 it may be one that you no longer like and that 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.079
 want to give a new style some 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.939
 scissors tape to measure a pen or a 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.439
 the first thing that they are going to do is 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.029
 flip your bust upside down 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.099
 then they are going to put a cardboard between 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.660
 middle of the bag this is very important 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.880
 so they will not cut the bag by 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.949
 the two sides will then measure more or 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.140
 least an inch and a half of 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.000
 neck inwards because there is 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.540
 where are we going to start our measurement 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.649
 to cut a great 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.649
 [Music] 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.800
 then they will measure 5 inches and mark them 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.440
 with your pen because this is where we're going 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.760
 to cut our horizontal lines 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.590
 As you can see, this blouse already has 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.440
 horizontal lines this is going to 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.059
 facilitate the work a little but if 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.430
 it's nice that you're going to cut 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.960
 have these lines you have to 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.960
 paint them with a tuba 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.070
 two 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.619
 in this case I also had to paint 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.440
 a line to the blouse because I wanted that 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.909
 the lines were more glued more 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.799
 close 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.369
 so I had to paint one as 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.369
 marker 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.290
 the next step is to start shortening 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.360
 your lights be very careful with this 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.760
 do not go to cut they're going to grab their 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.979
 scissors there are special scissors for 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.050
 cut fabrics but I'm going to use these 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.869
 that I have that I only use them for 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.500
 this take time for them to 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.500
 come out very well 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.010
 this idea of how to cut this light on 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.900
 author of a store I went to is 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.390
 hard to believe that the lights come 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.690
 cut and that people buy them but 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.720
 What can I tell you is fashion 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.610
 I bought it at the exxon gus store 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.860
 [Music] 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.200
 before cutting my lines grabs the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.690
 scissors and I make a small curtain 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.870
 to the light then I put the scissors that 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:14.050
 I start counting the signal 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:14.880
 [Music] 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:34.600
 you 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:34.600
 [Music] 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.930
 LOL 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.010
 all right 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.010
 i 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.350
 [Music] 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.650
 ah 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.650
 Look 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.240
 the love 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.260
 no no 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:14.250
 [Music] 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.740
 ah 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.740
 [Music] 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.269
 is not true 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.590
 and finally they turn their blouse the right 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.870
 and they will stretch lines is bruces 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.760
 he throws a lot for that reason it seems that the 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.730
 pulling a lot but be very careful 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.250
 doing it because it can break them 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.799
 those lights that I have cut that I have 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.290
 other videos of how to cut blouses the 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.860
 of the wash and I've used them and you never know 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.860
 they have undone 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.099
