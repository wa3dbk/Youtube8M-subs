through potassium twice as fast as men

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.810 
through potassium twice as fast as men
do<00:01:55.259> that's<00:01:55.740> why<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.430> use<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> little

potassium now at this point if I were

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.899 
potassium now at this point if I were
just<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.110> blend<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.799> whole<00:02:05.369> juice<00:02:05.670> it
