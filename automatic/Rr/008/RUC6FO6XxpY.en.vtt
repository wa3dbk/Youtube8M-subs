glacier<00:00:08.660> which<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.840> for<00:00:10.050> crystal<00:00:10.440> Maiden<00:00:11.810> now

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:12.810 
glacier which is for crystal Maiden now

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.740 
glacier which is for crystal Maiden now
what<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.650> thought<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.430> it<00:00:14.760> was<00:00:15.030> like<00:00:15.060> you<00:00:15.630> know

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
what I thought that it was like you know

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.680 
what I thought that it was like you know
if<00:00:16.019> you<00:00:16.170> remove<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.620> ki-netic<00:00:16.920> gem<00:00:17.570> from<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
if you remove the ki-netic gem from the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.330 
if you remove the ki-netic gem from the
Europe's<00:00:18.960> aureus<00:00:19.350> glacier<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.950> you<00:00:20.039> put<00:00:20.220> it

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
Europe's aureus glacier and you put it

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.010 
Europe's aureus glacier and you put it
into<00:00:20.580> another<00:00:20.700> item<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.390> will<00:00:21.420> actually<00:00:21.660> give

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
into another item it will actually give

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.840 
into another item it will actually give
these<00:00:22.200> customisation<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.250> know<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.520> crystal

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
these customisation you know the crystal

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.210 
these customisation you know the crystal
no<00:00:23.970> way<00:00:24.119> fat<00:00:24.390> sound<00:00:25.170> an<00:00:25.320> ability<00:00:25.560> icon<00:00:26.330> so

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
no way fat sound an ability icon so

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.010 
no way fat sound an ability icon so
because<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.490> model<00:00:29.820> itself<00:00:30.210> look<00:00:30.510> like

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
because the model itself look like

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.340 
because the model itself look like
and<00:00:31.350> I<00:00:31.830> really<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.369> really<00:00:32.399> don't<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.450> so

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and I really you really don't like it so

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.990 
and I really you really don't like it so
that's<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.860> thought<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.790> thing<00:00:35.970> is

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
that's what I thought but the thing is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.479 
that's what I thought but the thing is
when<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.480> look<00:00:36.930> into<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.470> dota<00:00:37.770> wiki<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
when I look into the dota wiki it

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.810 
when I look into the dota wiki it
actually<00:00:39.030> says<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.300> these<00:00:39.840> three

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
actually says that these three

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.310 
actually says that these three
customizations<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:42.180> bound<00:00:42.630> to<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> item

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
customizations are bound to the item

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
customizations are bound to the item
itself<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.340> yeah<00:00:44.520> that's<00:00:44.850> my<00:00:45.030> bad

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
itself so yeah that's my bad

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.350 
itself so yeah that's my bad
and<00:00:45.540> I<00:00:45.840> didn't<00:00:46.110> read<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.590> earlier<00:00:47.149> but<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and I didn't read it earlier but the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.670 
and I didn't read it earlier but the
thing<00:00:48.540> is<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.950> what<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.840> kinetic<00:00:51.840> gem<00:00:52.260> does

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
thing is that what this kinetic gem does

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.780 
thing is that what this kinetic gem does
is<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.700> I'll<00:00:54.450> show<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> game<00:00:55.790> so

glacier gem into my other item and let
me<00:01:05.430> show<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> what<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.799> does<00:01:07.799> you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
know it just changes the animation not

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.280

I'm sure many of you like me have this
confusion<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.250> okay<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:22.229> I'm

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
confusion and so here it is okay so I'm

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.679 
confusion and so here it is okay so I'm
gonna<00:01:22.650> try<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> show<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.400> what<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.270> actually

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
gonna try to show you what this actually

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.969 
gonna try to show you what this actually
does<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:26.180> you<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.450> see<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.960> icon<00:01:28.439> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
does as you can see the icon and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.219 
does as you can see the icon and
whatever<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.479> still<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> same<00:01:31.200> as

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
whatever is so it's still the same as

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.020 
whatever is so it's still the same as
the<00:01:31.680> custom<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.430> doesn't<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.759> any

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the custom one it doesn't have any

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.440 
the custom one it doesn't have any
changes<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.409> only<00:01:35.100> when<00:01:35.820> she<00:01:36.060> cast<00:01:36.330> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
changes to it so only when she cast the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.350 
changes to it so only when she cast the
spell<00:01:36.780> she<00:01:37.170> actually<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.130> jumps<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> then

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
spell she actually like jumps and then

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.840 
spell she actually like jumps and then
casts<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.900> spell<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.460> that's<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.729> only

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
casts the spell so that's the only

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.690 
casts the spell so that's the only
difference<00:01:42.060> between<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:43.939> ki<00:01:44.939> netic<00:01:44.970> gem<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
difference between the ki netic gem and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.609 
difference between the ki netic gem and
you<00:01:47.700> know<00:01:47.820> they<00:01:48.000> morel<00:01:48.360> itself<00:01:48.720> because<00:01:49.229> i

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
you know they morel itself because i

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.440 
you know they morel itself because i
don't<00:01:50.610> know<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.909> little<00:01:51.150> bit<00:01:51.240> confusing

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
don't know it's a little bit confusing

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.429 
don't know it's a little bit confusing
so<00:01:52.670> that's<00:01:53.670> what<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.329> does<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.079> kind<00:01:55.320> of

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
so that's what it does for the kind of

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.999 
so that's what it does for the kind of
gem<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.070> doesn't<00:01:56.520> change<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.180> whole

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
gem it doesn't change the whole

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.370 
gem it doesn't change the whole
animations<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.460> fact<00:01:59.670> because<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:01.140> one

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
animations and in fact because that one

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.499 
animations and in fact because that one
is<00:02:01.619> item<00:02:01.860> bounce<00:02:02.220> so<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.149> see<00:02:03.360> these

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
is item bounce so as you can see these

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.380 
is item bounce so as you can see these
are<00:02:03.720> both<00:02:03.899> empty<00:02:04.890> socket<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.909> doesn't<00:02:06.240> have

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
are both empty socket it doesn't have

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.479 
are both empty socket it doesn't have
any<00:02:06.600> gems<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.649> when<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.979> play<00:02:08.249> it<00:02:08.309> in

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
any gems to it but when you play it in

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.679 
any gems to it but when you play it in
the<00:02:08.609> game<00:02:10.099> okay

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.089 

so<00:02:16.689> when<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.109> played<00:02:17.319> in<00:02:17.469> the<00:02:17.560> game<00:02:17.739> it<00:02:17.950> still

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
so when you played in the game it still

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.940 
so when you played in the game it still
has<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.870> effects<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.109> animations<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.799> it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
has the effects and animations to it

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.610 
has the effects and animations to it
even<00:02:21.340> though<00:02:21.519> I<00:02:21.849> remove<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.989> gems<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:25.620> you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
even though I remove the gems so you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.590 
even though I remove the gems so you
give<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.099> a<00:02:27.189> try

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.890 

let's<00:02:31.600> cool<00:02:32.220> as<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.820> see<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.300> icon<00:02:34.720> is

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
let's cool as you can see the icon is

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.500 
let's cool as you can see the icon is
still<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.200> same<00:02:35.470> even<00:02:35.860> without<00:02:35.980> gem<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:39.510> now

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
still the same even without gem and now

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.390 
still the same even without gem and now
look<00:02:40.780> at<00:02:40.870> her<00:02:41.080> animation<00:02:41.650> okay<00:02:41.770> without<00:02:42.190> the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
look at her animation okay without the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.000 
look at her animation okay without the
gem<00:02:42.970> her<00:02:43.450> animation<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:44.200> like<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.560> normal

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
gem her animation is like the normal

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.030 
gem her animation is like the normal
custom<00:02:45.400> animation<00:02:46.020> that's<00:02:47.020> it<00:02:47.290> she<00:02:47.710> just<00:02:47.890> do

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
custom animation that's it she just do

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.680 
custom animation that's it she just do
that<00:02:48.220> she<00:02:48.460> doesn't<00:02:48.640> do<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.030> jumping<00:02:49.450> thing

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
that she doesn't do the jumping thing

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.790 
that she doesn't do the jumping thing
and<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.410> know<00:02:50.560> ape<00:02:51.280> stuff<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:52.300> that's<00:02:53.080> about

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
and you know ape stuff so that's about

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.080 
and you know ape stuff so that's about
it<00:02:53.980> you<00:02:54.130> know<00:02:54.250> like<00:02:54.460> this<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.970> only

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
it you know like this is the only

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.210 
it you know like this is the only
difference<00:02:55.300> because<00:02:55.960> I<00:02:56.170> don't<00:02:56.470> know<00:02:56.530> why<00:02:56.770> they

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
difference because I don't know why they

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.560 
difference because I don't know why they
made<00:02:57.490> something<00:02:57.850> so<00:02:58.270> terribly<00:02:59.020> ugly<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:01.330> just

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
made something so terribly ugly it just

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.060 
made something so terribly ugly it just
looked<00:03:01.750> like<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.260> mean<00:03:02.500> from<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.770> front

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
looked like I mean from the front

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.810 
looked like I mean from the front
okay<00:03:03.750> as<00:03:04.750> she<00:03:05.110> turns<00:03:05.440> around<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:06.160> she<00:03:06.610> looks

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
okay as she turns around and she looks

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.640 
okay as she turns around and she looks
like<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.210> know<00:03:07.360> someone<00:03:07.900> chopped<00:03:08.200> her<00:03:08.380> head

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
like you know someone chopped her head

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.640 
like you know someone chopped her head
off<00:03:08.710> or<00:03:09.220> something<00:03:09.700> from<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.910> back<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.380> it

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
off or something from the back so it

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.580 
off or something from the back so it
looks<00:03:11.860> kind<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.400> ugly<00:03:12.840> anyways<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.200> this<00:03:14.410> is

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
looks kind of ugly anyways so this is

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.500 
looks kind of ugly anyways so this is
what<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:15.010> actually<00:03:15.160> does<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.910> doesn't<00:03:16.270> change

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
what it actually does it doesn't change

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.540 
what it actually does it doesn't change
the<00:03:16.930> holy<00:03:17.530> fat<00:03:17.860> because<00:03:18.160> what<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.370> was

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
the holy fat because what I was

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.490 
the holy fat because what I was
expecting<00:03:18.940> was<00:03:19.360> that<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.630> could<00:03:20.080> just<00:03:20.200> remove

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
expecting was that I could just remove

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.110 
expecting was that I could just remove
the<00:03:20.650> gym<00:03:20.830> and<00:03:20.980> put<00:03:21.040> in<00:03:21.280> my<00:03:21.430> other<00:03:21.610> item<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.090> I

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120
