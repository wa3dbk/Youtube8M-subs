 new jacket and it just becomes one 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.140
 can adjust super well to it 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.109
 comments of the Netherlands is 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.590
 committee boxes and the best game place of it 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.989
 The Netherlands 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.770
 so yes perfect channel the dutch branch 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.080
 of opi main channel of course or power 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.490
 so yes yes i will be a very nice one 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.290
 good channel tic 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.420
 now they subscribe already and I will 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.310
 late can still have more to come 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.840
 but what you see in the background 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.570
 and not so to me from you 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.580
 culture so okay to what you the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.310
 to see this tom far is 2 camper 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.490
 and here that cool cycling goal 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.590
 kwak kwak where and other in the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.350
 other jars and jews at the kiosk what happened 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.009
 grows exactly everywhere but yes this 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.579
 so two change already know one 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.210
 so also this one and another at prison 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.560
 break 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.270
 and therefore a very nice weapon 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.310
 and I can use many more 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.899
 to go for the double 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.909
 it becomes to you that you are busy in russia 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.979
 Seeing that was actually a double a lot 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.659
 because I finally went for a high one 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.409
 wind elephants exciting a sniper 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.079
 behind me 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.299
 me when I was dead and then later had 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.340
 I have another 1818 string 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.960
 I still had so maybe if I had something 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.149
 had been felled before 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.739
 because the first trick wherever I am 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.160
 cam hands was finally clicked 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.440
 to become 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.060
 so if I was 13 before I was with it 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.140
 then I had my double cab there 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.980
 probably had it but yes 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.510
 whatever 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.220
 Finally, a very good game play and 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.080
 jazz orchestra just very nice to 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.799
 keep his very chill weapon for close 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.660
 range 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.780
 because it's no i've got it on 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.519
 and suppressor and that worked so fucking 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.370
 good at close quarters really think so 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.579
 almost about park where you almost say me 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.709
 you don't have to zoom in completely 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.629
 no the spray are good dennis is good 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.879
 and so your donal trump fire so hope so 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:46.349
 just makes it tough 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:48.750
 copy of power en no makes it whole 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.459
 good weapon so yes certainly in counter 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.930
 want to consume 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.340
 i can't tell completely and flat 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.180
 so the cloth once again in one 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.769
 class a the video but class that's how it works 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.079
 to be named son in my own sense 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.700
 can only know what i think so chief 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.750
 of course but it is a bit one 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.910
 Update fit you 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.260
 from what I now meet my channel and stuff 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.260
 if so 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.650
 I try to upload as much as possible 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.470
 that we point only 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.650
 well so nice are some things now 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.340
 and so I am not going so well 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.200
 it's just a bit hard and stuff 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.790
 and youtube live and that 's how it is 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.500
 of course because to experience and that is 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.730
 just a little harder to do a lot now 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.620
 release videos and so and yes me 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.060
 want my best of course from gideon 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.680
 there is also a lot of possible videos best 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.720
 games so then I would have lots of games 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.620
 we have strengthened yet 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.150
 time for you but yes I wanted so 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.140
 keep doing much more because that something 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.750
 takes less time 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.080
 so that will come again this week 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.540
 And yes then I am going to try we jump 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.270
 lies in bed but can drop and here 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.890
 another triple with change soon 0 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.660
 really a huge look weapon 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.400
 I swear I have almost one whole 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.340
 day with just team not playing too 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.780
 but when I go so just what 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.120
 upload more live 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.190
 takes less time for me it's something 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.360
 easier to upload and ago and 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.350
 this you are also pretty good 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.540
 on a video of many god stop 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.950

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.720
 Viewed 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.490
 so there I am happy because of a video 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.140

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.130

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.400
 very nice in cozy the ghost it is but 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.530
 a little too at times 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.870
 I annoy it that I just go to 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.660
 it does not make it say that I am very close 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.990
 could only die because of stupid things like that 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.930
 so I want you to know 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.790
 with questions I class a puzzle myself 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.919
 I know because it's so important 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.130
 find weapons in a nuclear battle 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.600
 I do not mind that can be with any autism 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.820
 there is nothing that fascinates me at all 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.240
 ass and which way more try collection 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.720
 to get 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.240
 perth also like to set up yourself so if you 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.860
 just arm with it is like that 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.510
 would try to get there 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.560
 and therefore also nice to have for you 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.660
 and so that I too 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.880
 with other up as the chain would 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.740
 for example a cam from her leader would 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.330
 not just that story of the 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.840

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.730

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.680
 and that 's it so well let it go 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.460
