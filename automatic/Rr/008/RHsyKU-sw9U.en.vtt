00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello my dear needlewomen 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.290
 Welcome to the video channel 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.179
 Irina seven today we will be with you 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:18.180
 consider a cornflower flower assembly 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.020
 take the octagon figure of two 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.019
 tissue 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:28.250
 one side white other pigeons we put 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:34.730
 we mark its center we fix the center and 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:38.040
 Now we divide each edge in half 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.870
 divided lebron in half and fold in 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.930
 side of the middle ie the side of the center 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:50.670
 our edges will turn out 4 edges that is 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:55.789
 square we fold this way for 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:00.510
 this we were looking for the middle 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:06.140
 each side to have a corner with us 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:10.130
 converged so here the corners converged 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.130
 we fix with a needle 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.550
 can be fixed with a needle with an iron 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.230
 thread fasten every middle 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:28.820
 now every little corner 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:30.910
 turn down the sides to the very edge so 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.710
 way we get for a strong point 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:38.140
 in the middle of the ribs and the corners lie on 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:50.450
 angle 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:58.070
 we pin with needles so the next edge 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:01.610
 we lay out the ribs so we 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:06.980
 you have secured the tops of the corners now 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:13.880
 turn over to the other side and yourself 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:19.490
 wrap corners to the center turned to 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:27.380
 center one laid out all commerce 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:29.720
 example turned 2 and fix the 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.260
 center we fix in this way 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.520
 it turns out that such a figure is now 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.940
 I 'll show you this little corner of the future 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.940
 will be 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.049
 so we fix to the center all the little corners 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:53.909
 we spread cameras on measured 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:55.640
 sew the center button and little corners 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.190
 who we are pre 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.989
 secured can be detached to form 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.989
 was more free
