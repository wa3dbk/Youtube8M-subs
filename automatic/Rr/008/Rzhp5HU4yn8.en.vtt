00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello today i'm going to talk to you about the boxes she cries a lot in full 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.169
 following one pronounced in English or French 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.240
 then not job he knew what to say 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.599
 well between 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.660
 outside a crease and full mouth 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.750
 doc taken 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.230
 so we did not 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.940
 a small Templar who connects directly 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.310
 on the diack output of the guitar 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.329
 love them full mouth comes in three is a different player we did not 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.019
 this one who for that give us lessons the project of the voc sa c30 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.940
 this one 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.850
 who he is rather typed rock so the citroen that 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.090
 and 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.980
 for the big bad guys 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.780
 at the example type is metal 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.899
 however, they all work the same way 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.320
 they all need 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.060
 since 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.760
 for energy 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.540
 and it has all three 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.970
 a good 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.960
 a tone 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.460
 a volume 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.240
 that can be set here 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.690
 the connection is simple 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.930
 a headphone output 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.630
 sword an entry line to plug in your mp3 or your cd player and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.150
 play with 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.600
 normally I should have plugged in the headphones 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.080
 on the job of May at that time you would not have heard anything 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.420
 what we did was we took the headphone output and we 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.980
 did not send to a mixer so you can enjoy it 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.659
 so here we have a planetary plan 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.330
 at 7 30 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
 we will see what it gives 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.030
 I play on the tone 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.150
 a sport also add volume 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.779
 good 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.689
 we then go to classic rock, which as its name indicates 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.120
 cover her a range of her role that classic rock up to the borders 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.120
 hard rock 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.019
 we end with the example the metal 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.090
 for which we preferred to take a guitar equipped with skips 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.090
 is now more coherent 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.429
 you've been able to see that job it's really the perfect companion for 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:13.830
 go on a trip to play in his garden to play 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.519
 without disturbing its neighbors whatever the musical style we do not like we are going 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.170
 find 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.880
 the shoe to his foot and then saw the price that it costs one can even 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.099
 pay 3 finally good me I leave you anyway there 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.610
 I found what I like 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.710
 so alberto
