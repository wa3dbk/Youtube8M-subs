00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
electronics and it wouldn't do very well

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.639 
electronics and it wouldn't do very well

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
build a carrying case out of this uh

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.869 
build a carrying case out of this uh
caboodles<00:00:53.969> case<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.140> found<00:00:55.440> over<00:00:55.829> at

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
caboodles case that I found over at

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.950 
caboodles case that I found over at
Walmart<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.899> nerve<00:00:58.649> struck<00:00:59.370> model

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
Walmart it's the nerve struck model

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.549 
Walmart it's the nerve struck model
anyway<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.500> I'll<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.430> inside<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.750> it's

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
anyway what I'll do is inside here it's

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.920 
anyway what I'll do is inside here it's
got<00:01:04.830> these<00:01:05.070> trays<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.549> open<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.869> this
