00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.340 
reason I just spray it over my hair is
because<00:01:55.530> water<00:01:55.920> breaks<00:01:56.700> down<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.780> hydrogen

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
because water breaks down the hydrogen

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.430 
because water breaks down the hydrogen
bonds<00:01:58.850> in<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.030> molecules<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> hair<00:02:01.230> I

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
bonds in the molecules in the hair I

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.230 
bonds in the molecules in the hair I
don't<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:01.800> it<00:02:01.950> works<00:02:02.130> what<00:02:02.370> supposing<00:02:03.060> does

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
don't have it works what supposing does

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.150 
don't have it works what supposing does
what<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.450> does<00:02:03.479> well<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.260> me<00:02:04.650> that's<00:02:04.860> what<00:02:05.040> it

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
what it does well to me that's what it

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.190 
what it does well to me that's what it
does<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.880> when<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.150> hydrogen<00:02:06.690> bonds<00:02:07.020> are

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
does so when the hydrogen bonds are

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.980 
does so when the hydrogen bonds are
broken<00:02:07.310> your<00:02:08.310> hair<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.880> it's<00:02:09.270> much<00:02:09.540> easier<00:02:09.570> to

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
broken your hair is it's much easier to

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.590 
broken your hair is it's much easier to
make<00:02:10.290> finagle<00:02:10.800> here's<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.070> bit<00:02:11.280> more<00:02:11.490> ready<00:02:12.300> to

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
make finagle here's a bit more ready to

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.080 
make finagle here's a bit more ready to
move<00:02:12.900> without<00:02:13.590> just<00:02:13.950> snapping<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.580> breaking

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
move without just snapping and breaking

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.190 
move without just snapping and breaking
being<00:02:15.900> really<00:02:16.290> tough<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.250> once<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.850> spray<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.200> so

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
being really tough so once I spray it so

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.790 
being really tough so once I spray it so
something<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.560> soaking<00:02:19.980> wet<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.310> stamp<00:02:20.640> it

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
something you soaking wet to stamp it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.830 
something you soaking wet to stamp it
stretches<00:02:22.800> more<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.730> know<00:02:23.840> more

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
stretches more and it's you know more

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.430 
stretches more and it's you know more
willing<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.470> do<00:02:25.680> what<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.920> want<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.340> do<00:02:26.610> so

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
willing to do what I want it to do so

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.900 
willing to do what I want it to do so
what<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.470> do<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.920> take<00:02:29.660> two<00:02:30.660> pieces<00:02:31.880> like<00:02:32.880> that

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
what I do is I take two pieces like that

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.100 
what I do is I take two pieces like that
too<00:02:34.489> I'm<00:02:35.489> going<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.570> try<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.750> show<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.020> our

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
too I'm going to try and show you our

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.020 
too I'm going to try and show you our
can't<00:02:37.320> even<00:02:37.530> talk<00:02:37.620> for<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.920> but<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.580> just<00:02:38.760> and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
can't even talk for it but you just and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.080 
can't even talk for it but you just and
then<00:02:39.060> there's<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.600> third<00:02:39.870> piece<00:02:40.140> there<00:02:41.090> so

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
then there's a third piece there so

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.640 
then there's a third piece there so
basically<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.660> have<00:02:42.750> three<00:02:42.989> pieces<00:02:45.170> one<00:02:46.170> two

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
basically you have three pieces one two

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.750 
basically you have three pieces one two
three<00:02:48.709> leaves<00:02:49.709> my<00:02:49.890> front<00:02:50.190> edges<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.670> I

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
three leaves my front edges that I

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.800 
three leaves my front edges that I
little<00:02:51.000> bit<00:02:51.120> nappy<00:02:51.390> but<00:02:52.290> literally<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.070> just

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
I don't need a mirror to do this because

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.600

be mean because no one seeing my hair so

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:16.650 
be mean because no one seeing my hair so
an<00:03:08.680> hour<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.780> up<00:03:11.820> over<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:15.360> hope<00:03:16.360> you<00:03:16.480> can

see how this has been done but like this
piece<00:03:19.240> here<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:21.310> going<00:03:21.700> on<00:03:21.820> duh<00:03:24.690> it's

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
piece here that is going on duh it's

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.680 
piece here that is going on duh it's
kind<00:03:25.780> of<00:03:25.900> twisting<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.650> other<00:03:26.770> one<00:03:27.510> now<00:03:28.510> we'll

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
kind of twisting the other one now we'll

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.620 
kind of twisting the other one now we'll
go<00:03:28.720> there<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:30.070> all<00:03:30.250> goes<00:03:30.430> under<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.480> just

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
go there that all goes under you just

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.300 
go there that all goes under you just
keep<00:03:31.750> going<00:03:32.050> under<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.650> taking<00:03:33.010> another

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
keep going under and taking another

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.570 
keep going under and taking another
piece<00:03:33.580> to<00:03:33.610> take<00:03:33.970> under<00:03:34.450> very<00:03:35.230> easy<00:03:35.560> as<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.430> can

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
piece to take under very easy as you can

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.210 
piece to take under very easy as you can
see<00:03:36.700> your<00:03:36.880> partings<00:03:37.300> are<00:03:37.420> not<00:03:37.930> straight<00:03:38.709> they

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
see your partings are not straight they

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.250 
see your partings are not straight they
are<00:03:39.340> not<00:03:39.610> straight<00:03:39.970> but<00:03:40.480> I<00:03:40.690> want<00:03:40.930> going

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
are not straight but I want going

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.930 
are not straight but I want going
anywhere<00:03:41.650> like<00:03:41.890> this<00:03:42.100> this<00:03:42.340> is<00:03:42.400> just<00:03:42.640> a<00:03:42.730> me<00:03:42.880> to

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
anywhere like this this is just a me to

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.090 
anywhere like this this is just a me to
chill<00:03:43.360> in<00:03:43.540> my<00:03:43.570> yard<00:03:44.489> or<00:03:45.489> stay<00:03:45.790> at<00:03:45.910> home<00:03:46.830> so<00:03:47.830> let

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
chill in my yard or stay at home so let

00:03:48.100 --> 00:04:02.490 
chill in my yard or stay at home so let
me<00:03:48.190> do<00:03:48.310> that<00:03:48.340> quickly

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.440 

so<00:04:03.070> basically<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.520> do<00:04:03.670> that<00:04:03.970> all<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.180> way<00:04:04.330> to

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
so basically I do that all the way to

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.740 
so basically I do that all the way to
the<00:04:04.660> end<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.770> I'll<00:04:06.760> have<00:04:06.940> it<00:04:06.970> just<00:04:07.300> looking

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
the end and I'll have it just looking

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.600 
the end and I'll have it just looking
like<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.500> haven't<00:04:09.100> finished<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.430> back

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
like that I haven't finished the back

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.580 
like that I haven't finished the back
book<00:04:09.790> I'd<00:04:10.390> open<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.690> video<00:04:10.960> to<00:04:11.020> take<00:04:11.290> too<00:04:11.440> long

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
book I'd open the video to take too long

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.070 
book I'd open the video to take too long
by<00:04:11.830> simple<00:04:12.190> as<00:04:12.310> that<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.760> hope<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.540> was<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:13.870> good

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
by simple as that I hope it was a good

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.930 
by simple as that I hope it was a good
