00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.090 
this team in somewhere I would probably
take<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> hundred<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.960> two<00:01:58.500> hundred<00:01:58.530> stamps<00:01:59.040> a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
take a hundred to two hundred stamps a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.000 
take a hundred to two hundred stamps a
day<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.490> just<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.930> keep<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.260> motor<00:02:01.560> system

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
day and just to keep that motor system

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.350 
day and just to keep that motor system
because<00:02:02.340> really<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:02.970> second<00:02:03.330> nature

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
because really it's just second nature

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.649 
because really it's just second nature
to<00:02:03.570> me<00:02:03.690> now<00:02:03.840> or<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.710> should<00:02:04.979> be<00:02:05.100> second<00:02:05.460> nature

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
to me now or it should be second nature

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.330 
to me now or it should be second nature
to<00:02:06.659> me<00:02:06.810> enough<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.770> know<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:08.039> being<00:02:08.190> able

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
to just keep that that muscle muscle

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.880 
to just keep that that muscle muscle
memory<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:12.780> making<00:02:12.989> sure<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.379> that

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
memory and just making sure that that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.960 
memory and just making sure that that
movement<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:14.940> me<00:02:15.060> as<00:02:15.239> fluid<00:02:15.690> as<00:02:15.750> possible

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
movement for me as fluid as possible
