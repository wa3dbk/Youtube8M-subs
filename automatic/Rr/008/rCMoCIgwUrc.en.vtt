this is a scene that I can find that
brand<00:00:41.840> there<00:00:42.840> yeah<00:00:44.210> Kilner<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.719> see<00:00:45.899> that

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
brand there yeah Kilner can see that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.750 
brand there yeah Kilner can see that
it's<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.059> kiln<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.480> jam<00:00:49.340> funnel<00:00:51.140> that<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.760> actually

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
it's a kiln a jam funnel that I actually

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.430 
it's a kiln a jam funnel that I actually
brought<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.840> bought<00:00:55.230> off<00:00:55.559> ebay<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.809> from<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.079> UK

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
brought a bought off ebay on from the UK

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.069 
brought a bought off ebay on from the UK
I<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.820> because<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.899> got<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
I like this one because it's it's got a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.359 
I like this one because it's it's got a
nice<00:01:01.320> shape<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:03.830> and<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.949> doesn't<00:01:05.220> have

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
nice shape to it and and it doesn't have

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.060 
nice shape to it and and it doesn't have
that<00:01:05.420> handle<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.600> most<00:01:06.840> jam<00:01:07.110> jars<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that handle that most jam jars do to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.469 
that handle that most jam jars do to
actually<00:01:08.369> looks<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> hopper<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.390> you

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
actually looks like a hopper so if you

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.760 
actually looks like a hopper so if you
look<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.960> mean<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.350> looks<00:01:10.560> quite

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
look at that I mean that looks quite

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.630 
look at that I mean that looks quite
nice<00:01:11.030> now<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:13.560> issue<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.280> it's

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
nice now the issue with this is it's

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.530 
nice now the issue with this is it's
it's<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.720> five<00:01:16.080> mill<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:17.540> OD

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
it's on the it's five mill like up OD

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.060 
it's on the it's five mill like up OD
here<00:01:18.900> outside<00:01:19.530> diameter<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:21.900> neck<00:01:22.740> here

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
here outside diameter so this neck here

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.640 
here outside diameter so this neck here
is<00:01:23.250> actually<00:01:23.610> slightly<00:01:24.600> larger<00:01:25.200> there's<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
is actually slightly larger there's a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.730 
is actually slightly larger there's a
bit<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.920> free<00:01:26.159> movement<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.909> see<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:28.110> if<00:01:28.650> I

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
bit of free movement you can see so if I

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.390 
bit of free movement you can see so if I
just<00:01:28.920> leave<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.369> there<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
just leave it on there like that and

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.440 
just leave it on there like that and
turn<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:33.770> it's<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:34.860> too<00:01:35.100> bad<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.700> little<00:01:36.299> bit

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
turn it on it's not too bad a little bit

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.510 
turn it on it's not too bad a little bit
of<00:01:36.890> black<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.520> would<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.900> know

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
of black if you would like and you know

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.789 
of black if you would like and you know
touching<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.820> it'll<00:01:42.450> move<00:01:42.720> around<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.710> what

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
touching it it'll move around so what

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.590 
touching it it'll move around so what
I've<00:01:43.979> done<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:45.210> bought<00:01:45.920> three<00:01:47.450> Moka<00:01:48.450> pot
