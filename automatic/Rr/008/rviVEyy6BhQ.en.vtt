00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.299
 it's 11 o'clock 30 in 100 minutes goes the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.870
 machine of the type boeing 757 direction 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.990
 from sal 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.030
 to madeira for rampage germania sala 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.809
 and his colleagues 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.519
 Ground transportation services remains only a little 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.400
 time to load the plane 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.990
 2,133 passengers want to leave today 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.660
 Frankfurt will start at least 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.189
 as much luggage with germania sala 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.170
 do not lose the overview and about 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.949
 Everything is informed he needs one 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.869
 lageplan 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.939
 he is the most important document for the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.130
 ramp agent in the data to 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.340
 number of passengers container flight number 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.630
 or the travel destination summarized 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.610
 important, of course, among other things 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.050
 that's why I always have it off 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.710
 register that friendly 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.940
 license plate of the plane that all 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.590
 base data stored 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.340
 So if you are here now in the map 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.350
 where, for example, instead of the lka 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.930
 stands and that is a l 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.620
 then the flade plan is wrong then 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.030
 also choose everything else wrong in 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.379
 But in this case everything has its own 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.210
 correctness with that 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.129
 Airplane clearance also runs smoothly 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.010
 must be able to go from the ground 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.930
 control center coordinate everything 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.580
 organize and plan since the second 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.280
 august is the control center 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.560
 ground handling services in the building 181 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.689
 a new construction between the terminal 1 and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.759
 in the terminal 2 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.130
 every day from 1200 to 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.530
 1400 aircraft handling logistical 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.479
 altogether there are 39 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.220
 jobs of which the luggage 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.259
 distribution of passengers is controlled 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.670
 as well as the new cruze put together 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.600
 and for the manufacturing processes from 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.549
 sent 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.259
 the challenge is to stop the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.680
 Matching staff customize the plane too 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.450
 to have 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.070
 the problem is us work is running yes 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.310
 not on the conveyor belt but we have as 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.759
 many features will get later 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.500
 early or unplanned or in flight 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.680
 or something happens 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.860
 allows the personnel strength too 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.509
 strengthen 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.310
 yes and that is the problem the people 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.990
 We also have such need or art 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.399
 so fast enough from one place to 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.469
 for example, to get others completely 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.469
 Imagine this staff is in the south 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.299
 The need partially 20 minutes 25 clock 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.330
 Half an hour to the south one 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.729
 position here in the building again 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.620
 on-site logistics is not that today 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.630
 problem that a plane was delayed 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.420
 it often starts with the passengers 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.450
 even it is unfortunately always the same 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.550
 and the time the machine goes by 10 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.600
 1 is missing passengers 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.220
 yes and this is a nightmare because now 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.640
 We will have to change the luggage to red 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.740
 say we have set accordingly 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.270
 We need the info to unload 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.370
 the faster we find the suitcase the more 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.100
 rather the probability is that 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.330
 then later under in go out 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.350
 because the passengers are not 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.209
 We are allowed to bring the suitcase 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.120
 logically, he does not want to have to get out 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.920
 and then one thing leads to another 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.020
 because of all the suitcase of the out 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.780
 must have been loaded first 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.520
 that means for germania sala he has to 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.650
 his crew all already instruct 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.690
 to clear out loaded items of luggage 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.250
 He must also inform the pilot 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.750
 give that to the flier not on time 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.940
 from the position can and 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.790
 set a new time accordingly 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.150
 but last minute if you want that 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.190
 luck 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.390
 Now the two passengers are where we are 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.750
 now actually have the luggage 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.910
 have to unload again shortly before 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.019
 come close yes that means you have to 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.660
 cancel everything here 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.489
 logically and can be quite normal 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.570
 carry on well 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.130
 yes of course that is the rescue with only 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.560
 few minutes late 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.330
 germano masala released the machine 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.070
 not only he is happy but also 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.630
 all passengers and the pilot 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.700
 that's why it's important 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.590
 to be on time with his plane 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.680
 so that the journey also start on time 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.680
 can
