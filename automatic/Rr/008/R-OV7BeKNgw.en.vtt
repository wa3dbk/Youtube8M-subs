00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
these things a lot of envel timing has

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.569 
these things a lot of envel timing has
to<00:02:19.209> do<00:02:19.360> with<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:20.049> know<00:02:20.280> unbolting<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.400> end

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
to do with you know unbolting the end

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.309 
to do with you know unbolting the end
bell<00:02:21.879> and<00:02:22.209> kind<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.540> moving<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:22.930> around<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.290> a

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
bell and kind of moving and around on a

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.350 
bell and kind of moving and around on a
little<00:02:23.560> dial<00:02:23.769> here<00:02:24.069> you<00:02:24.790> actually<00:02:24.939> just<00:02:25.269> have

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
little dial here you actually just have

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.199 
little dial here you actually just have
these<00:02:25.569> little<00:02:25.840> blocks<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.939> position<00:02:27.939> your

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
these little blocks that position your

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.180 
these little blocks that position your
sensor<00:02:28.659> plug<00:02:28.959> at<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.200> different<00:02:29.530> angle<00:02:29.739> thus

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
sensor plug at a different angle thus

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.430 
sensor plug at a different angle thus
giving<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.760> different<00:02:31.180> timings<00:02:31.659> so<00:02:31.750> will

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
giving you different timings so will

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.509 
giving you different timings so will
kind<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.680> show<00:02:32.799> you<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.010> here<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:33.280> just<00:02:33.430> a

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
kind of show you that here in just a

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.000 
kind of show you that here in just a
second<00:02:33.879> and<00:02:34.569> then<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.079> bottom<00:02:35.409> here<00:02:35.709> we<00:02:35.860> got

inside here and wow this thing has a
nice<00:03:07.420> heft<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.079> but<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.709> know<00:03:08.829> it's

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
nice heft to it but you know it's

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.699 
nice heft to it but you know it's
definitely<00:03:09.220> lightweight<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:11.230> uses<00:03:11.560> all<00:03:12.120> 7075

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
definitely lightweight it uses all 7075

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
nice markings right here if you can see

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.789 
nice markings right here if you can see
that<00:03:20.819> 12.5<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:22.329> that<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.139> going<00:03:23.349> to<00:03:23.440> be<00:03:23.590> the

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
that 12.5 and that is going to be the

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.460 
that 12.5 and that is going to be the
diameter<00:03:24.549> of<00:03:24.579> the<00:03:24.790> rotor<00:03:25.030> they're<00:03:25.359> all<00:03:25.569> H<00:03:25.989> on

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
diameter of the rotor they're all H on

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.849 
diameter of the rotor they're all H on
the<00:03:27.540> actual<00:03:28.540> shaft<00:03:28.810> right<00:03:29.109> there<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.440> tell<00:03:29.680> you

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
the actual shaft right there to tell you

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.580 
the actual shaft right there to tell you
what's<00:03:30.099> inside<00:03:30.370> there<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:31.449> very<00:03:32.139> nice<00:03:32.349> and

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
what's inside there so very nice and

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.860 
what's inside there so very nice and
cool<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:33.040> has<00:03:33.669> all<00:03:33.940> these<00:03:34.090> cool<00:03:34.389> cutouts

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
cool and has all these cool cutouts

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.869 
cool and has all these cool cutouts
right<00:03:35.109> there<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.410> then<00:03:35.530> also<00:03:35.650> some<00:03:36.099> kind<00:03:36.790> of

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
right there and then also some kind of

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.270 
right there and then also some kind of
ribbing<00:03:37.269> right<00:03:37.419> here<00:03:37.720> on<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.470> case<00:03:38.739> I

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
ribbing right here on the case I

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.280 
ribbing right here on the case I
that's<00:03:39.849> for<00:03:40.090> heat<00:03:40.329> dissipation<00:03:40.359> that's<00:03:41.109> to

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
that's for heat dissipation that's to

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.930 
that's for heat dissipation that's to
make<00:03:41.440> this<00:03:41.650> motor<00:03:41.980> run<00:03:42.220> as<00:03:42.400> cool<00:03:42.730> as<00:03:42.910> possible

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
make this motor run as cool as possible

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.229 
make this motor run as cool as possible
and<00:03:43.720> keeps<00:03:44.349> you<00:03:44.530> efficient<00:03:45.129> cool<00:03:45.790> running<00:03:46.150> on

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
and keeps you efficient cool running on

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.869 
and keeps you efficient cool running on
the<00:03:46.389> track<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:46.750> very<00:03:47.379> cool<00:03:47.709> you<00:03:48.519> have<00:03:48.639> some

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
the track so very cool you have some

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:55.170 
the track so very cool you have some
copper<00:03:49.780> heavy<00:03:50.230> copper<00:03:53.819> points<00:03:54.819> right<00:03:54.970> there

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
copper heavy copper points right there

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.390 
copper heavy copper points right there
so<00:03:55.389> you<00:03:55.449> can<00:03:55.629> do<00:03:55.720> your<00:03:55.810> soldering<00:03:56.400> right

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
so you can do your soldering right

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.830 
so you can do your soldering right
here's<00:03:57.730> what<00:03:57.879> I'm<00:03:58.000> talking<00:03:58.359> about<00:03:58.419> that<00:03:58.780> a

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
here's what I'm talking about that a

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.949 
here's what I'm talking about that a
little<00:03:59.500> end<00:03:59.799> blocks<00:04:00.069> for<00:04:00.609> the<00:04:01.239> motor<00:04:01.480> timing

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
little end blocks for the motor timing

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.080 
little end blocks for the motor timing
pretty<00:04:02.230> much<00:04:02.409> that<00:04:02.799> one<00:04:03.069> screw<00:04:03.340> comes<00:04:03.579> out<00:04:03.819> and

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
pretty much that one screw comes out and

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.569 
pretty much that one screw comes out and
you're<00:04:04.959> able<00:04:05.079> to<00:04:05.230> position<00:04:05.769> that<00:04:06.190> thing<00:04:06.430> at

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
you're able to position that thing at

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.689 
you're able to position that thing at
different<00:04:06.760> angles<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:08.139> get<00:04:08.769> your<00:04:09.129> end<00:04:09.370> belt

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
different angles to get your end belt

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:13.740 
different angles to get your end belt
timing<00:04:10.239> if<00:04:10.419> you<00:04:10.930> choose<00:04:11.169> to<00:04:11.379> do<00:04:11.500> so<00:04:11.669> on<00:04:12.750> the

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
timing if you choose to do so on the

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.800 
timing if you choose to do so on the
flip<00:04:13.989> side<00:04:14.019> over<00:04:14.470> here

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
flip side over here

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.409 
flip side over here
very<00:04:16.810> nice<00:04:17.909> can't<00:04:18.909> wait<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.150> get<00:04:19.239> this<00:04:19.359> thing

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
very nice can't wait to get this thing

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.370 
very nice can't wait to get this thing
installed<00:04:19.930> in<00:04:20.260> my<00:04:20.709> de<00:04:21.010> TC<00:04:21.669> 410<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.690> think<00:04:23.260> it's

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
installed in my de TC 410 I think it's

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.590 
installed in my de TC 410 I think it's
definitely<00:04:23.530> going<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.919> give<00:04:24.130> me<00:04:24.580> some
