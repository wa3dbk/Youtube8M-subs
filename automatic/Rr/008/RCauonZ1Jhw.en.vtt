this is frosted in action for us that is
the<00:00:17.730> Frostbite<00:00:18.180> engine<00:00:18.619> editor<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.279> is

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
the Frostbite engine editor so this is

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.130 
the Frostbite engine editor so this is
our<00:00:20.520> sequence<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.119> all<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> events<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.020> are

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
our sequence and all the events that are

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.810 
our sequence and all the events that are
happening<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.619> sequence<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.609> actually

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
happening in the sequence I can actually

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.599 
happening in the sequence I can actually
start<00:00:24.240> playing<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.720> anytime<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.619> want<00:00:25.980> real

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
start playing this anytime I want real

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.279 
start playing this anytime I want real
easy<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.060> even<00:00:27.390> watch<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.689> chopper<00:00:28.080> fly

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
easy I can even watch this chopper fly

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.779 
easy I can even watch this chopper fly
around<00:00:28.410> make<00:00:28.949> sure<00:00:28.980> all<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.310> effects<00:00:29.670> are

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
around make sure all the effects are

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.310 
around make sure all the effects are
looking<00:00:30.060> good<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.750> actually<00:00:30.900> just

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
looking good so I can actually just

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.380 
looking good so I can actually just
scrub<00:00:31.800> right<00:00:32.040> through<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.640> let<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
scrub right through this and let the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.990 
scrub right through this and let the
animation<00:00:33.899> play<00:00:34.170> itself<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.890> really<00:00:35.850> go

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
animation play itself out and really go

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.580 
animation play itself out and really go
in<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.360> fine-tune<00:00:36.780> something<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.530> can

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
in and fine-tune something so I can

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.619 
in and fine-tune something so I can
literally<00:00:38.010> open<00:00:38.760> up<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> track<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
literally open up the track for the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.560 
literally open up the track for the
forklift<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:41.969> modify<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.920> keyframes

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
forklift and I can modify the keyframes

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.029 
forklift and I can modify the keyframes
anyway<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.600> want<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.140> let's<00:00:46.410> say<00:00:46.530> right<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:46.800> i

want it to now tip over i can just do a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.080 
want it to now tip over i can just do a
tip<00:00:50.750> save<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.780> keyframe<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.820> now<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.879> can

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
tip save that keyframe and now you can

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.630 
tip save that keyframe and now you can
see<00:00:54.559> it'll<00:00:55.559> hit<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.070> then<00:00:56.160> fall<00:00:56.370> over

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
see it'll hit that and then fall over

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.599 
see it'll hit that and then fall over

answer for a black box guy working on
frostbite<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.580> well<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.030> okay<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.140> look

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
frostbite as well so okay so if we look

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.560 
frostbite as well so okay so if we look
at<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.130> undestroyed<00:01:20.850> environment<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
at the the undestroyed environment the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.999 
at the the undestroyed environment the
Unruh<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.080> unrendered<00:01:22.380> environment<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:22.979> can

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
Unruh the unrendered environment you can

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.219 
Unruh the unrendered environment you can
see<00:01:23.280> some<00:01:23.490> walls<00:01:23.700> are<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.119> these<00:01:24.509> guys<00:01:24.780> are

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
see some walls are here these guys are

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.630 
see some walls are here these guys are
on<00:01:25.530> by<00:01:25.799> default<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.369> they're<00:01:26.549> all

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
on by default and they're all

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.070 
on by default and they're all
destructible<00:01:27.180> props<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.869> shoot

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
destructible props that we can shoot

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.140 
destructible props that we can shoot
with<00:01:28.229> our<00:01:28.350> gun<00:01:28.530> break<00:01:29.130> them<00:01:29.280> apart<00:01:29.340> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
with our gun break them apart so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.960 
with our gun break them apart so
frostbites<00:01:30.869> built<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.710> way<00:01:31.979> specifically

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
frostbites built this way specifically

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.760 
frostbites built this way specifically
because<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.479> games<00:01:33.720> originally<00:01:34.380> were

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
because the games originally were

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.100 
because the games originally were
designed<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.340> destroyed<00:01:36.180> environments<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
designed to be destroyed environments a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.590 
designed to be destroyed environments a
lot<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.979> games<00:01:38.100> don't<00:01:38.310> need<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
lot of games don't need that that's a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.850 
lot of games don't need that that's a
lot<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.750> extra<00:01:40.110> overhead<00:01:40.350> that's<00:01:40.680> not

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
lot of extra overhead that's not

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.889

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
lot of situations where the players are

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.150 
lot of situations where the players are
not<00:02:34.099> together<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.819> can't<00:02:35.150> do<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.510> linear

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
not together so you can't do a linear

not together so you can't do a linear
take<00:02:37.160> on<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.400> cinematic<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.090> need<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.480> really

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
take on a cinematic you need to really

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.050 
take on a cinematic you need to really
make<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.739> visible<00:02:39.860> from<00:02:40.220> all<00:02:40.370> angles<00:02:40.519> the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
make it visible from all angles the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.520 
make it visible from all angles the
other<00:02:41.180> part<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:41.630> we<00:02:41.870> got<00:02:42.019> to<00:02:42.110> speak<00:02:42.319> a<00:02:42.410> lot

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
other part is that we got to speak a lot

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.960 
other part is that we got to speak a lot
with<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.890> level<00:02:43.220> designers<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.730> make<00:02:43.850> sure

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
with the level designers to make sure

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.670 
with the level designers to make sure
that<00:02:44.180> what<00:02:44.330> we're<00:02:44.450> doing<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.750> not<00:02:44.959> disrupting

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
that what we're doing is not disrupting

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.610 
that what we're doing is not disrupting
the<00:02:45.769> game<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.580> in<00:02:46.850> this<00:02:47.000> situation<00:02:47.510> we<00:02:47.989> have<00:02:48.590> a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
the game so in this situation we have a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.059 
the game so in this situation we have a
case<00:02:48.950> where<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:50.269> players<00:02:50.510> are<00:02:50.720> split<00:02:50.989> up<00:02:51.069> one

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.059 
air and the chopper and the guy in the
ground<00:02:56.000> needs<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.299> get<00:02:56.510> across<00:02:57.319> but<00:02:57.769> he<00:02:57.860> can't

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
ground needs to get across but he can't

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.009

off here to get to the end of level so
you<00:03:05.209> kind<00:03:05.480> of<00:03:05.569> get<00:03:06.230> help<00:03:06.440> from<00:03:06.560> your<00:03:06.769> chopper

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
you kind of get help from your chopper

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.000 
you kind of get help from your chopper

just<00:03:12.530> listen<00:03:12.830> for<00:03:12.860> that<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.220> be<00:03:13.340> broken<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:13.760> we

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
just listen for that to be broken and we

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.099 
just listen for that to be broken and we
start<00:03:14.090> playing<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.420> cinematic<00:03:14.900> at<00:03:14.989> that

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
start playing the cinematic at that

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.220 
start playing the cinematic at that
point<00:03:15.380> so<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.910> smashed<00:03:17.209> down<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.019> ground

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
point so it smashed down to the ground

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.440 
point so it smashed down to the ground
if<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.769> go<00:03:18.950> into<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.310> non<00:03:19.730> rendered<00:03:20.090> view<00:03:20.269> you

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
if I go into the non rendered view you

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.000 
if I go into the non rendered view you
can<00:03:20.600> see<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:20.780> have<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:20.959> bunch<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.290> these<00:03:21.799> little

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
can see I have a bunch of these little

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.310 
can see I have a bunch of these little
red<00:03:22.160> icons<00:03:22.609> here<00:03:22.850> are<00:03:23.000> our<00:03:23.510> particle<00:03:24.079> emitter

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
red icons here are our particle emitter

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.080 
red icons here are our particle emitter
we're<00:03:24.739> also<00:03:24.950> doing<00:03:25.190> something<00:03:25.730> on<00:03:25.819> this<00:03:25.910> side

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
we're also doing something on this side

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.090 
we're also doing something on this side
because<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.480> antenna<00:03:27.470> falls<00:03:27.739> through<00:03:28.010> this

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
because the antenna falls through this

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.640 
because the antenna falls through this
wall<00:03:28.340> over<00:03:28.400> here<00:03:28.640> so<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:30.019> way<00:03:30.140> we've<00:03:30.319> handled

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
wall over here so the way we've handled

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.039 
wall over here so the way we've handled
this<00:03:30.799> is<00:03:31.040> x<00:03:31.400> is<00:03:32.000> x<00:03:32.239> just<00:03:32.480> triggering<00:03:32.810> these

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
this is x is x just triggering these

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.039 
this is x is x just triggering these
objects<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.590> break<00:03:33.829> these<00:03:34.220> are<00:03:34.400> not<00:03:35.049> cinematic

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
objects to break these are not cinematic

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.080 
objects to break these are not cinematic
objects<00:03:36.530> they're<00:03:36.650> just<00:03:36.829> regular<00:03:37.010> game<00:03:37.760> props

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
objects they're just regular game props

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.449 
objects they're just regular game props
that<00:03:38.389> we've<00:03:38.540> told<00:03:38.780> them<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.109> bust<00:03:39.319> a<00:03:39.590> suit<00:03:40.069> you

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
that we've told them to bust a suit you

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.550 
that we've told them to bust a suit you
know<00:03:40.579> through<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.329> schematic<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:41.989> then<00:03:42.440> they

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
know through the schematic and then they

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.770 
know through the schematic and then they
get<00:03:43.040> obliterated<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.090> path<00:03:44.269> gets<00:03:44.510> open

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
get obliterated and the path gets open

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.690 
get obliterated and the path gets open
for<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:44.989> player<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.200> crawl<00:03:45.470> across<00:03:45.700> frostbite

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
for the player to crawl across frostbite

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.990 
for the player to crawl across frostbite
is<00:03:47.290> we<00:03:48.290> like<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.560> call<00:03:48.739> future-proof<00:03:49.340> we<00:03:49.850> have

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
is we like to call future-proof we have

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.539 
is we like to call future-proof we have
to<00:03:50.120> work<00:03:50.269> with<00:03:50.299> really<00:03:50.750> old<00:03:50.870> tech<00:03:51.519> seven<00:03:52.519> years

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
to work with really old tech seven years

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.930 
to work with really old tech seven years
is<00:03:53.049> ancient<00:03:54.049> in<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.350> technology<00:03:54.650> world<00:03:54.940> but

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
is ancient in the technology world but

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.309 
is ancient in the technology world but
frasca<00:03:56.299> actually<00:03:56.630> makes<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:56.870> really<00:03:57.019> easy<00:03:57.139> for

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
frasca actually makes it really easy for

frasca actually makes it really easy for
us<00:03:57.560> to<00:03:57.590> have<00:03:57.799> really<00:03:58.220> really<00:03:58.370> nice<00:03:58.609> they<00:03:59.060> I

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
us to have really really nice they I

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.530 
us to have really really nice they I
think<00:03:59.600> that<00:03:59.720> they<00:04:00.109> call<00:04:00.350> it<00:04:01.540> next-generation

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
think that they call it next-generation

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.819 
think that they call it next-generation
technology<00:04:03.350> on<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.500> current<00:04:03.739> generation

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
technology on the current generation

technology on the current generation
consoles<00:04:04.639> and<00:04:04.880> you<00:04:05.209> really<00:04:05.420> feel<00:04:05.569> like<00:04:05.600> that

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.210 
EA seems very open using frostbite it'll
probably<00:04:08.420> be<00:04:08.720> seen<00:04:09.139> quite<00:04:09.380> quite<00:04:10.040> often
