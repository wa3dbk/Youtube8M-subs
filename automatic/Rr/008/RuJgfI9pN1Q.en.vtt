would actually be walking like this and
not<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.860> few<00:00:37.890> people<00:00:38.070> they'd<00:00:38.520> walk<00:00:38.820> from

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
there wasn't really a lot of foot

there wasn't really a lot of foot
traffic<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:48.270> down<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.050> from<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
traffic going down it was just from the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
bottom to the top and it didn't really

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.200

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
make a lot of sense to me when you see

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.360 
make a lot of sense to me when you see
there's<00:00:54.390> cars<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.809> by<00:00:55.110> sure<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.070> dirt

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370

road but Jesus Christ this is a huge
mountain<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.510> go<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.219> think<00:01:02.219> about<00:01:02.489> what

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
mountain to go up just think about what

seen multiple agents get fired because

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.910 
seen multiple agents get fired because
they<00:01:31.439> try<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.979> walk<00:01:32.310> up<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.360> mountain

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
they try and walk up the mountain

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.230 
they try and walk up the mountain
instead<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.040> driving<00:01:35.310> their<00:01:35.579> little<00:01:35.820> car<00:01:36.060> up

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240

the<00:01:36.390> dirt<00:01:36.600> road<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.079> they<00:01:37.200> move<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:37.590> they

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the dirt road if they move here they

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.920 
the dirt road if they move here they
should<00:01:37.890> know<00:01:38.009> better<00:01:38.040> perhaps<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.090> because

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
should know better perhaps and because

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.630 
should know better perhaps and because
they<00:01:40.020> don't<00:01:40.170> get<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> work<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.770> time<00:01:40.829> they

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
they don't get to work on time they

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.210 
they don't get to work on time they
don't<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> job<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:43.290> what<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.530> they<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.740> they

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
don't have a job so what do they do they

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.700 
don't have a job so what do they do they
slink<00:01:44.820> back<00:01:45.290> down

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
slink back down

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.120 
slink back down
it's<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:48.119> ridiculous<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.930> just<00:01:49.439> goes<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it's just ridiculous it just goes to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.530 
it's just ridiculous it just goes to
show<00:01:50.310> there's<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.820> lot<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.240> fundamental

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
show there's a lot of fundamental

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.889 
show there's a lot of fundamental
problems<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.890> how<00:01:53.100> SimCity<00:01:53.820> handles<00:01:54.720> its

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
problems with how SimCity handles its

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.690 
problems with how SimCity handles its
agents<00:01:55.350> handles<00:01:55.680> its<00:01:55.829> passing<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.399> even

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
agents handles its passing and even

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.480 
agents handles its passing and even
though<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.299> says<00:01:57.659> 2.0<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.560> hasn't<00:01:58.890> been<00:01:58.950> fixed

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
though it says 2.0 it hasn't been fixed

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.149 
though it says 2.0 it hasn't been fixed
I<00:01:59.549> mean<00:01:59.759> look<00:01:59.939> people<00:02:00.689> drive<00:02:00.930> cars<00:02:00.979> cars<00:02:01.979> are

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
I mean look people drive cars cars are

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.520 
I mean look people drive cars cars are
actually<00:02:02.310> going<00:02:02.759> up<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.570> road<00:02:03.810> here<00:02:04.290> and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
actually going up the road here and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.310 
actually going up the road here and
there's<00:02:05.399> still<00:02:05.759> people<00:02:06.180> walking<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.110> dirt

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
there's still people walking up the dirt

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.889 
there's still people walking up the dirt
road<00:02:07.649> as<00:02:07.950> well<00:02:08.640> even<00:02:09.179> though<00:02:09.300> there<00:02:09.509> are<00:02:09.629> cars

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
road as well even though there are cars

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.750 
road as well even though there are cars
just<00:02:10.410> hauling<00:02:11.220> up<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:12.540> city<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.319> top

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
just hauling up the city to the top

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.910 
just hauling up the city to the top
so<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:15.180> don't<00:02:15.840> know<00:02:15.959> what<00:02:16.200> there<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.620> say

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
so I don't know what there is to say

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.770 
so I don't know what there is to say
about<00:02:17.159> this<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.549> really<00:02:18.030> want<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.329> like<00:02:18.480> SimCity

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
about this I really want to like SimCity

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.449 
about this I really want to like SimCity
2<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.260> know<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.620> lot<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.920> people<00:02:20.220> were<00:02:20.310> very

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
2 I know a lot of people were very

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.929 
2 I know a lot of people were very
excited<00:02:20.670> about<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.299> but<00:02:21.739> you<00:02:22.739> can<00:02:22.890> slap<00:02:23.129> 2.0<00:02:23.760> on

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
excited about it but you can slap 2.0 on

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.390 
excited about it but you can slap 2.0 on
something<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:24.659> it's<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.049> same<00:02:25.290> as<00:02:25.500> 1.0<00:02:26.129> or

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
something but it's the same as 1.0 or

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.259 
something but it's the same as 1.0 or
worse

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
worse

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.710 
worse
so<00:02:28.079> that's<00:02:29.069> agent<00:02:29.549> pathing<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.359> still<00:02:30.689> a

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
so that's agent pathing it is still a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.030 
so that's agent pathing it is still a
problem<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.859> needs<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.459> be<00:02:32.579> fixed
