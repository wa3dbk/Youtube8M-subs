00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
was actually the cheapest shit the world

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.860 
was actually the cheapest shit the world
like<00:00:04.470> her<00:00:04.710> range<00:00:04.980> was<00:00:05.310> so<00:00:05.580> ridiculously<00:00:06.480> long

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
like her range was so ridiculously long

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.620 
like her range was so ridiculously long
like<00:00:07.319> what<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.460> fuck<00:00:08.730> like<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.330> was<00:00:09.450> like

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
like what the fuck like it was like

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.259 
like what the fuck like it was like
that's<00:00:10.200> way<00:00:10.679> too<00:00:10.740> long<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.730> reason<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.150> was

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
that's way too long the reason it was

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.629 
that's way too long the reason it was
that<00:00:12.420> long<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:13.259> because<00:00:13.469> she's<00:00:13.950> such<00:00:14.250> an<00:00:14.400> old

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
that long is because she's such an old

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.630 
that long is because she's such an old
champion<00:00:15.330> like<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.839> was<00:00:15.990> her<00:00:16.109> original<00:00:16.640> like

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
champion like that was her original like

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.310 
champion like that was her original like
auto<00:00:18.029> attack<00:00:18.420> range<00:00:18.630> for<00:00:18.869> whatever<00:00:19.140> fucking

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
auto attack range for whatever fucking

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.349 
auto attack range for whatever fucking
reason<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:20.189> hopefully<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:20.670> game<00:00:20.880> ends<00:00:21.119> like

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
reason so hopefully this game ends like

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.700 
reason so hopefully this game ends like
