one thing I haven't mentioned in these

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.590 
one thing I haven't mentioned in these
these<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.950> 5<00:01:29.310> inch<00:01:29.549> scale<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.420> can

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
these are on a 5 inch scale if you can

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.170

pegs or something so you can use like

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.150 
pegs or something so you can use like
different<00:03:24.060> action<00:03:24.570> figure<00:03:24.810> basis<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:25.500> well

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
different action figure basis but well

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.440 
different action figure basis but well
not<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.030> problem

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
not a problem

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.050 
not a problem
they<00:03:28.140> stand<00:03:28.380> up<00:03:28.500> fine<00:03:28.799> but<00:03:29.579> it'd<00:03:29.760> be<00:03:29.790> cool<00:03:30.030> to

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
they stand up fine but it'd be cool to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.210 
they stand up fine but it'd be cool to
use<00:03:30.329> like<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.690> know<00:03:30.720> like<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.470> Kix<00:03:31.739> dance<00:03:31.860> like

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
use like you know like a Kix dance like

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.910 
use like you know like a Kix dance like
this<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.730> use<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:32.940> base<00:03:33.299> like<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.260> stand<00:03:34.590> on<00:03:34.709> one

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
this and use a base like a stand on one

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.009 
this and use a base like a stand on one
foot<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.400> we've<00:03:35.610> been<00:03:35.760> cool<00:03:35.970> cuz<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.870> don't
