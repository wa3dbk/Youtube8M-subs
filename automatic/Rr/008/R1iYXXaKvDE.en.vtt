the<00:00:01.319> big-picture<00:00:01.500> question<00:00:02.220> that<00:00:02.340> we're

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
the big-picture question that we're

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.329 
the big-picture question that we're
asking<00:00:02.760> is<00:00:03.240> how<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.870> bats<00:00:04.170> fly<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.859> what

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
asking is how to bats fly and what

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.789 
asking is how to bats fly and what
attributes<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.180> bat<00:00:06.450> wings<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.470> flight

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
attributes of bat wings and flight

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.190 
attributes of bat wings and flight
performance<00:00:08.160> can<00:00:08.580> i<00:00:08.670> mimic<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.929> trying<00:00:10.139> to

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
performance can i mimic and trying to

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.440 
performance can i mimic and trying to
build<00:00:10.380> my<00:00:10.559> own<00:00:10.590> robotic<00:00:11.490> wings<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.090> think

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
build my own robotic wings I think

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.209 
build my own robotic wings I think
that's<00:00:12.809> our<00:00:13.110> just<00:00:13.380> really<00:00:13.889> amazing

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
that's our just really amazing

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.900 
that's our just really amazing
spectacular<00:00:14.730> fliers<00:00:15.299> their<00:00:16.080> wings<00:00:16.440> are

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
spectacular fliers their wings are

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.220 
spectacular fliers their wings are
extremely<00:00:17.910> dynamic<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.660> much<00:00:18.840> more<00:00:19.050> dynamic

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
extremely dynamic so much more dynamic

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.620 
extremely dynamic so much more dynamic
than<00:00:19.650> birds<00:00:19.920> or<00:00:20.189> insects<00:00:20.580> if<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.300> look<00:00:21.449> at<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
than birds or insects if you look at the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.029 
than birds or insects if you look at the
wings<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.050> bat<00:00:22.199> they're<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.710> like<00:00:22.859> our

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
wings of a bat they're just like our

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.009 
wings of a bat they're just like our
hands<00:00:23.430> they<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:23.730> all<00:00:23.910> these<00:00:24.090> joints<00:00:24.359> that

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
hands they have all these joints that

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.290 
hands they have all these joints that
let<00:00:25.199> their<00:00:25.350> wings<00:00:25.590> adapt<00:00:26.430> into<00:00:26.789> lots<00:00:27.119> of

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
let their wings adapt into lots of

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.519 
let their wings adapt into lots of
different<00:00:27.630> shapes<00:00:27.689> giving<00:00:28.349> them<00:00:28.470> a

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
different shapes giving them a

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.009 
different shapes giving them a
tremendous<00:00:28.740> range<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.670> aerodynamic<00:00:30.660> forces

and maneuver abilities they fly much

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.080 
and maneuver abilities they fly much
better<00:00:33.180> than<00:00:33.450> anything<00:00:33.780> we've<00:00:34.200> engineered

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
biology background and I was more of a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.440 
biology background and I was more of a
field<00:01:16.979> biologist<00:01:17.189> running<00:01:18.180> around<00:01:18.270> the

came to graduate school I wanted to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.950 
came to graduate school I wanted to
study<00:01:22.320> flight<00:01:22.770> which<00:01:23.369> required<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.240> bit<00:01:24.750> more

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
study flight which required a bit more

motions<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> joints<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.149> everything

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
motions so the joints and everything

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.300 
motions so the joints and everything
were<00:01:54.540> aligned<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.110> way<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.130> could

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
were aligned in a way that they could

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.830 
were aligned in a way that they could
move<00:01:56.460> at<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> appropriate<00:01:57.329> speeds<00:01:57.659> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
move at the appropriate speeds and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.230 
move at the appropriate speeds and
magnitudes<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> would<00:01:59.310> put<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> wing<00:02:00.090> into

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
magnitudes so I would put the wing into

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.570 
magnitudes so I would put the wing into
a<00:02:00.360> wind<00:02:00.600> tunnel<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.049> flap<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.920> at<00:02:02.130> real

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
a wind tunnel and flap it at real

the emotions fairly accurately of the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
real batwing what to do so I have to use

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.390 
real batwing what to do so I have to use
very<00:02:09.119> large<00:02:09.450> motors<00:02:09.930> that<00:02:10.290> weigh<00:02:10.590> much<00:02:11.040> more

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
very large motors that weigh much more

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.670 
very large motors that weigh much more
than<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.940> real<00:02:12.180> bat<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.780> really<00:02:13.230> kind<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.440> tells

than a real bat it really kind of tells

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.530 
than a real bat it really kind of tells
you<00:02:13.770> how<00:02:13.950> spectacular<00:02:14.190> muscle<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.090> there's

you how spectacular muscle is there's

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.180 
you how spectacular muscle is there's

many ways our creativity and our

imagination is limited by our
inspiration<00:02:26.910> when<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.510> was<00:02:27.750> building<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
inspiration when I was building the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.750 
inspiration when I was building the
robot<00:02:28.530> there's<00:02:28.770> many<00:02:29.010> times<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.550> would

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
robot there's many times that I would

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.430 
robot there's many times that I would
get<00:02:29.910> stuck<00:02:30.210> that<00:02:30.450> something<00:02:30.810> would<00:02:30.960> break<00:02:31.170> and

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
get stuck that something would break and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.200 
get stuck that something would break and
I<00:02:31.530> didn't<00:02:31.770> know<00:02:31.890> how<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.070> fix<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.670> whenever

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
I didn't know how to fix it and whenever

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.970 
I didn't know how to fix it and whenever
I<00:02:33.300> came<00:02:33.570> up<00:02:33.720> against<00:02:34.050> one<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.290> those<00:02:34.410> walls<00:02:34.680> I

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
I came up against one of those walls I

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.910 
I came up against one of those walls I
was<00:02:35.460> able<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.730> look<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.840> nature<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.470> see<00:02:37.800> how

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
was able to look to nature to see how

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.170 
was able to look to nature to see how
they<00:02:38.100> would<00:02:38.220> fix<00:02:38.490> it<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.820> take<00:02:39.000> that

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
they would fix it and take that

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.300 
they would fix it and take that
inspiration<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.080> be<00:02:40.620> able<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.860> use<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.190> to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
inspiration and be able to use it to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.699 
inspiration and be able to use it to
improve<00:02:42.030> my<00:02:42.360> own<00:02:42.480> model<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.050> fix<00:02:43.560> any

that<00:02:45.750> we<00:02:45.870> had<00:02:45.990> worked<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.320> whenever<00:02:46.950> they

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
that we had worked with whenever they

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.800 
that we had worked with whenever they
got<00:02:47.310> stuck<00:02:47.580> they<00:02:47.790> didn't<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.420> same

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
got stuck they didn't have that same

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.770 
got stuck they didn't have that same
opportunity<00:02:50.450> eventually<00:02:51.450> we<00:02:51.540> were<00:02:51.600> able<00:02:51.660> to

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
opportunity eventually we were able to

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.390 
opportunity eventually we were able to
share<00:02:52.320> with<00:02:52.500> them<00:02:52.650> things<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.130> we<00:02:53.220> had

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
share with them things that we had

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.180 
share with them things that we had
learned<00:02:53.610> having<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.540> advantage<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.230> knowing

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
learned having the advantage of knowing

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.949 
learned having the advantage of knowing
both<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.670> biology<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.510> engineering

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
both the biology and the engineering

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.840 
both the biology and the engineering
side<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.740> there<00:02:58.890> was<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> lot<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.340> things<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.790> I

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
side so there was a lot of things that I

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.699 
side so there was a lot of things that I
learned<00:03:00.180> from<00:03:00.330> trying<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.959> build<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.290> bat<00:03:01.470> and

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
learned from trying to build a bat and

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.949 
learned from trying to build a bat and
particularly<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.820> failures<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.450> trying<00:03:03.810> to

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
particularly the failures in trying to

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.320 
particularly the failures in trying to
build<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.230> bat<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:05.010> told<00:03:05.430> me<00:03:05.520> much<00:03:05.910> about<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
build a bat that told me much about the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.259 
build a bat that told me much about the
biology<00:03:06.600> our<00:03:07.019> elbow<00:03:07.470> kept<00:03:08.010> breaking<00:03:08.489> in<00:03:08.790> one

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
biology our elbow kept breaking in one

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.940 
biology our elbow kept breaking in one
particular<00:03:09.570> spot<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.050> we<00:03:10.350> noticed<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.709> the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
particular spot and we noticed that the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.190 
particular spot and we noticed that the
real<00:03:11.130> bat<00:03:11.340> wings<00:03:11.580> are<00:03:12.000> reinforced<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:12.959> that

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
real bat wings are reinforced in that

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.710 
real bat wings are reinforced in that
same<00:03:13.440> area<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.519> so<00:03:14.760> far<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.000> have<00:03:15.120> not<00:03:15.300> been<00:03:15.540> able

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
same area so so far I have not been able

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.680 
same area so so far I have not been able
to<00:03:16.489> produce<00:03:17.489> anything<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.180> worked<00:03:18.450> better

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
to produce anything that worked better

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.190 
to produce anything that worked better
than<00:03:18.810> nature<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.980> materials<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:21.780> nature<00:03:22.080> is

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
than nature the materials that nature is

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.850 
than nature the materials that nature is
able<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.500> produce

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
able to produce

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.440 
able to produce
m-v<00:03:23.160> motors<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.730> nature<00:03:24.090> is<00:03:24.180> able<00:03:24.390> to

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
m-v motors that nature is able to

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.759 
m-v motors that nature is able to
produce<00:03:24.630> are<00:03:24.900> still<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:25.410> much<00:03:25.530> more

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
produce are still so much more

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.400 
produce are still so much more
spectacular
