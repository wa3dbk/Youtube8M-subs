00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
your friction is right here that's your

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.289 
your friction is right here that's your
friction<00:01:25.290> wheel<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.770> right<00:01:26.759> here<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
friction wheel and right here is the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.929 
friction wheel and right here is the
friction<00:01:27.869> disk<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> spin<00:01:29.820> my

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
friction disk so you can see I spin my

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.060 
friction disk so you can see I spin my
wheels<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.630> that's<00:01:30.869> pins<00:01:31.229> now<00:01:31.860> when<00:01:31.979> you

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
wheels and that's pins now when you

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.450 
wheels and that's pins now when you
engage<00:01:32.189> put<00:01:33.180> your<00:01:34.070> snowboard<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.250> first

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
engage put your snowboard on a first

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.030 
engage put your snowboard on a first
gear<00:01:35.759> that's<00:01:36.270> gonna<00:01:36.420> push<00:01:36.689> down<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.380> that's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
gear that's gonna push down and that's

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.490 
gear that's gonna push down and that's
gonna<00:01:38.189> create<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.030> spin<00:01:39.329> now<00:01:40.049> what<00:01:40.409> you

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
gonna create it to spin now what you

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.590 
gonna create it to spin now what you
want<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.710> do<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.979> clean<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.340> because<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:42.390> it

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
want to do is clean it because if it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.480 
want to do is clean it because if it
gets<00:01:42.689> greasy<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.710> gonna<00:01:43.860> want<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.159> spin

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
gets greasy it's not gonna want to spin

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.630 
gets greasy it's not gonna want to spin
it's<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.390> gonna<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.659> slipping<00:01:46.310> like<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.430> said

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
it's just gonna be slipping like I said

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880 
it's just gonna be slipping like I said
get<00:01:47.759> your<00:01:47.790> gasoline<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:49.290> want<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.560> clean<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
get your gasoline you want to clean it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.310 
get your gasoline you want to clean it
up<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.369> there

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
up in there

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.750 
up in there
you<00:01:53.320> want<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.560> clean<00:01:53.770> everything<00:01:54.070> good<00:01:54.520> and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
you want to clean everything good and

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.660 
you want to clean everything good and
look<00:01:55.510> at<00:01:55.600> all<00:01:55.720> that<00:01:55.840> grease<00:01:56.110> chemo<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:57.490> I

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
look at all that grease chemo and I

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.400 
look at all that grease chemo and I
think<00:01:57.910> that's<00:01:58.060> why<00:01:58.270> my<00:01:58.450> thing<00:01:58.780> was<00:01:58.900> slipping<00:01:59.320> a

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
think that's why my thing was slipping a

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.570 
think that's why my thing was slipping a
bit<00:02:04.200> different<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.229> can<00:02:05.590> see<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:05.860> just<00:02:06.040> go<00:02:06.310> to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
bit different you can see it just go to

please<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:15.550> I'm<00:02:15.640> using<00:02:15.790> gasoline<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.540> because

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
please so I'm using gasoline is because

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.050 
please so I'm using gasoline is because
gasoline<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.620> basically<00:02:18.010> like<00:02:18.670> rubbing

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
gasoline is basically like rubbing

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.740 
gasoline is basically like rubbing
alcohol<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:20.110> it's<00:02:20.290> all<00:02:20.440> clear<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.070> clean<00:02:21.750> if

that off you want to clean the friction

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.470 
that off you want to clean the friction
wheel<00:02:44.340> simply<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.459> clean<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.820> friction<00:02:46.270> wheel

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
wheel simply to clean the friction wheel

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.100 
wheel simply to clean the friction wheel
get<00:02:47.410> gas<00:02:47.680> in<00:02:47.709> one<00:02:48.100> area<00:02:48.459> like<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:49.060> put<00:02:49.989> it

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
get gas in one area like this put it

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.030 
get gas in one area like this put it
over<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.410> wheel<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:51.040> spin<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.489> background

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
over the wheel and spin the background

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.039 
over the wheel and spin the background
and<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.070> can<00:02:54.730> see<00:02:54.850> it's<00:02:55.360> getting<00:02:55.480> lotta

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
and you can see it's getting lotta

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.130 
and you can see it's getting lotta
grease<00:02:56.350> off<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:58.209> want<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.480> keep<00:02:58.630> doing<00:02:58.989> that

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
grease off you want to keep doing that

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.490 
grease off you want to keep doing that
until<00:03:00.420> when<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.540> spin<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.870> it's<00:03:02.170> going<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.380> be

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
until when you spin it it's going to be

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:14.130 
until when you spin it it's going to be
clear

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.730 
this is just a quick fix if I you find
that<00:04:07.320> your<00:04:07.500> gears<00:04:07.740> aren't<00:04:07.950> working<00:04:08.280> good<00:04:08.490> um

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
that your gears aren't working good um

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.340 
that your gears aren't working good um
maybe<00:04:10.740> cost<00:04:11.040> like<00:04:11.280> two<00:04:11.430> bucks<00:04:11.750> for<00:04:12.750> rags<00:04:13.020> in<00:04:13.260> a

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
maybe cost like two bucks for rags in a

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.980 
maybe cost like two bucks for rags in a
bit<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:13.530> gasoline<00:04:14.120> but<00:04:15.120> that's<00:04:15.270> basically<00:04:15.720> it

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
bit of gasoline but that's basically it

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
bit of gasoline but that's basically it
now<00:04:16.650> we<00:04:16.709> can<00:04:16.890> go<00:04:17.010> ahead<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.400> reassemble<00:04:17.760> this

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
now we can go ahead and reassemble this

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.680 
now we can go ahead and reassemble this
that's<00:04:20.010> really<00:04:20.580> clean<00:04:20.940> now

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
that's really clean now

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.080 
that's really clean now
there's<00:04:22.049> no<00:04:22.200> boy<00:04:22.410> should<00:04:22.470> work<00:04:22.880> already<00:04:23.880> now

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
there's no boy should work already now

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.290 
there's no boy should work already now
you<00:04:24.600> just<00:04:24.720> gotta<00:04:24.930> tighten<00:04:25.170> this<00:04:25.350> last<00:04:25.620> one<00:04:25.860> up

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:46.030 

hope<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.420> guys<00:04:30.570> see
