00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.779 
on the canvas let it sit for a day and I
came<00:00:27.930> back<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.710> didn't<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.609> I

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
came back to it I didn't like it I

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.350 
came back to it I didn't like it I
didn't<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:32.189> big<00:00:32.430> gold<00:00:32.759> candle

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
didn't like the the big gold candle

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.000 
didn't like the the big gold candle
there<00:00:34.010> it<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:36.110> took<00:00:37.110> away<00:00:37.290> too<00:00:37.440> much<00:00:37.770> from

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
there it just took away too much from

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.889 
there it just took away too much from
the<00:00:38.160> main<00:00:39.000> actor<00:00:39.510> which<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:41.750> blue<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the main actor which is the blue and

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.779 
the main actor which is the blue and
white<00:00:43.050> vase<00:00:45.800> but<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.860> wanted<00:00:47.280> something<00:00:47.489> there

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
white vase but I wanted something there

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.490 
white vase but I wanted something there
still<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:51.239> viewers<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.960> would<00:00:52.320> go<00:00:52.469> on

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
still so that the viewers I would go on

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.900 
still so that the viewers I would go on
a<00:00:52.680> triangle<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:53.340> triangular<00:00:54.210> shape<00:00:54.750> from

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
a triangle with triangular shape from

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.420 
a triangle with triangular shape from
them<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.120> highlight<00:00:57.690> or<00:00:58.039> contrast<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
them one highlight or contrast to the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.719 
them one highlight or contrast to the
other<00:00:59.510> like<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:01.129> or<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.399> way<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.430> found

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
other like this or this way so I found

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.330 
other like this or this way so I found
this<00:01:05.850> little<00:01:06.180> red<00:01:06.390> candle<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.220> was

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
this little red candle and it was

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.010 
this little red candle and it was
smaller<00:01:08.729> than<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.119> other<00:01:09.299> candle<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.840> it's

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
smaller than the other candle and it's

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.580 
smaller than the other candle and it's
red<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.610> got<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> contrast<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.140> colors

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
red so you got the contrast and colors

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.530 
red so you got the contrast and colors
here<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.189> make<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.580> go<00:01:14.729> right<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> red

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
here that make you go right to the red

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.289 
here that make you go right to the red
candle<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.979> then<00:01:17.130> your<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> would<00:01:17.759> hopefully

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
candle and then your I would hopefully

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.109 
candle and then your I would hopefully
maybe<00:01:18.479> move<00:01:18.810> up<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.640> for<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> highlight

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
maybe move up to here for the highlight

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.140 
maybe move up to here for the highlight
here<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> base<00:01:22.250> then<00:01:23.250> down<00:01:23.490> over<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:23.939> get

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
here on the base then down over here get

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.940 
here on the base then down over here get
a<00:01:24.180> highlight<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.900> glass<00:01:25.200> bottle<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
a highlight on this glass bottle and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.070 
a highlight on this glass bottle and
then<00:01:26.520> back<00:01:26.729> over<00:01:26.759> again<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.780> roam

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
then back over again so you just roam

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.890 
then back over again so you just roam
the<00:01:28.439> wrong<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.670> then<00:01:29.880> maybe<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.509> would<00:01:30.659> go<00:01:30.810> up

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
the wrong and then maybe you would go up

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.580 
the wrong and then maybe you would go up
this<00:01:31.110> way<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.670> come<00:01:32.670> back<00:01:32.880> down<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.479> go<00:01:34.409> this

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this way and come back down and go this

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.450 
this way and come back down and go this
way<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:37.070> this<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.340> part<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.850> art<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:40.460> this

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
way but this is the part of art and this

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.830 
way but this is the part of art and this
is<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.729> most<00:01:41.909> important<00:01:42.420> part<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
is the most important part of the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.420 
is the most important part of the
painting<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.350> getting<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.680> composition

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
painting is getting the composition

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.020 
painting is getting the composition
right<00:01:44.729> getting<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> way<00:01:46.100> getting<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.549> feel

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
right getting the way getting it to feel

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.469 
right getting the way getting it to feel
right<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.470> look<00:01:49.649> right<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:53.180> think<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
right and to look right and I think a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.080 
right and to look right and I think a
smaller<00:01:54.930> candle<00:01:55.530> works<00:01:55.740> better<00:01:56.009> because<00:01:56.820> it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
smaller candle works better because it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.530 
smaller candle works better because it
helps<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:58.560> main<00:01:58.770> actor<00:01:59.189> here<00:01:59.399> come<00:01:59.610> out<00:01:59.790> more

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
helps the main actor here come out more

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.850 
helps the main actor here come out more
and<00:02:01.500> once<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.250> start<00:02:03.259> doing<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.530> under

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
and once you start doing the under

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.830 
and once you start doing the under
painting<00:02:05.130> you'll<00:02:05.399> see<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.659> probably

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
painting you'll see that it probably

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.380 
painting you'll see that it probably
does<00:02:07.140> work<00:02:07.380> better<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.710> way

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.950 

so<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.510> next<00:02:14.719> video<00:02:15.049> was<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.500> underpainting
