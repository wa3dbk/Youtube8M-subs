evolving<00:03:32.040> but<00:03:32.190> my<00:03:32.340> big<00:03:32.549> issue<00:03:32.729> is<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.000> i

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
evolving but my big issue is that i

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.670 
evolving but my big issue is that i
don't<00:03:33.419> like<00:03:33.540> what<00:03:33.840> street<00:03:34.109> cutter<00:03:34.319> for<00:03:34.500> has

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
don't like what street cutter for has

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.920 
don't like what street cutter for has
evolved<00:03:35.040> into<00:03:35.129> and<00:03:35.699> maybe<00:03:36.419> this<00:03:36.659> could<00:03:36.870> change

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
evolved into and maybe this could change

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.420 
evolved into and maybe this could change
it<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.319> little<00:03:37.349> bit<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.829> might<00:03:38.010> make<00:03:38.159> the<00:03:38.280> game

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
it a little bit it might make the game

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.550 
it a little bit it might make the game
way<00:03:38.760> more<00:03:39.030> scary<00:03:39.540> than<00:03:39.780> what<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.049> used<00:03:40.079> to<00:03:40.409> be

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
way more scary than what it used to be

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.259 
way more scary than what it used to be
but<00:03:41.040> in<00:03:41.159> the<00:03:41.280> same<00:03:41.459> time<00:03:41.729> it's<00:03:41.940> going<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.150> be<00:03:42.239> a

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
but in the same time it's going to be a

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.969 
but in the same time it's going to be a
very<00:03:42.359> fun<00:03:42.810> few<00:03:43.139> months<00:03:43.379> at<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.560> start<00:03:43.829> of<00:03:43.889> it

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:43.979 
very fun few months at the start of it

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:45.619 
very fun few months at the start of it
is<00:03:44.159> like<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:44.639> and<00:03:44.879> there<00:03:45.120> was<00:03:45.209> even<00:03:45.419> another

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
is like this and there was even another

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:46.939 
is like this and there was even another
mechanic<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:46.109> they<00:03:46.290> were<00:03:46.349> talking<00:03:46.680> about

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
mechanic that they were talking about

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:48.229 
mechanic that they were talking about
potentially<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.639> get<00:03:47.760> rid<00:03:47.879> of<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.030> very

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
potentially to get rid of the very

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.869 
potentially to get rid of the very
vortex<00:03:48.870> ii<00:03:49.049> game<00:03:49.349> that<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.769> in<00:03:49.799> super<00:03:50.669> street

vortex ii game that is in super street
fighter<00:03:50.909> 4<00:03:51.329> right<00:03:51.750> now<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.229> they<00:03:52.650> kind<00:03:52.799> of

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
fighter 4 right now and they kind of

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.770 
fighter 4 right now and they kind of
alleviated<00:03:53.609> this<00:03:53.729> a<00:03:53.760> little<00:03:54.150> bit<00:03:54.359> in<00:03:54.540> street

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
alleviated this a little bit in street

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.939 
alleviated this a little bit in street
fighter<00:03:54.959> cross<00:03:55.019> tekken<00:03:55.229> by<00:03:55.590> adding<00:03:55.889> the

fighter cross tekken by adding the

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.619 
fighter cross tekken by adding the
forward<00:03:56.280> roll<00:03:56.459> on<00:03:56.669> get<00:03:56.909> up<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.209> what<00:03:57.510> they're

forward roll on get up and what they're

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.569 
forward roll on get up and what they're
doing<00:03:57.900> now<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.349> something<00:03:58.560> similar<00:03:58.919> to<00:03:59.280> like

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
doing now is something similar to like

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.030 
doing now is something similar to like
Capcom<00:03:59.970> vs.<00:04:00.239> SNK<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.629> see<00:04:01.049> groove<00:04:01.319> which<00:04:01.889> is

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
Street Fighter 4 is and that's how you

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.890 
Street Fighter 4 is and that's how you
get<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.370> lot<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.610> your<00:04:23.820> damage<00:04:24.240> in<00:04:24.360> SF<00:04:24.659> force

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
get a lot of your damage in SF force

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.480 
get a lot of your damage in SF force
from<00:04:25.169> a<00:04:25.320> vortex<00:04:25.919> with

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
from a vortex with

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.700 
from a vortex with
characters<00:04:27.000> so<00:04:27.509> once<00:04:27.690> again<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:28.169> seems<00:04:28.229> like

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
characters so once again it seems like

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.050 
characters so once again it seems like
it<00:04:28.860> seems<00:04:29.069> like<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.370> dudes<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.639> Cal<00:04:29.880> come

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
it seems like the dudes that Cal come

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.309 
it seems like the dudes that Cal come
and<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.240> designers<00:04:30.509> don't<00:04:30.840> want<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.199> just

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
and the designers don't want to just

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.379 
and the designers don't want to just
change<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.370> little<00:04:32.460> bit<00:04:32.610> of<00:04:32.729> frames<00:04:33.030> do<00:04:33.360> a

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
change a little bit of frames do a

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.059 
change a little bit of frames do a
little<00:04:33.780> bit<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:33.960> stuff<00:04:34.229> here<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.680> seems<00:04:34.889> like

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
little bit of stuff here it seems like

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:36.409 
little bit of stuff here it seems like
the<00:04:35.190> time<00:04:35.430> that<00:04:35.610> they're<00:04:35.699> spending<00:04:36.090> making

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
the time that they're spending making

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.240 
the time that they're spending making
this<00:04:36.539> is<00:04:36.720> not<00:04:36.870> just<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.169> slight<00:04:37.470> balance<00:04:38.069> update

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
this is not just a slight balance update

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.939 
this is not just a slight balance update
they're<00:04:39.090> actually<00:04:39.569> spending<00:04:39.930> time<00:04:40.169> changing

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
they're actually spending time changing

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.830 
they're actually spending time changing
the<00:04:41.039> entire<00:04:41.190> management<00:04:41.699> of<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.300> system

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
the entire management of the system

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.900 
the entire management of the system
doing<00:04:43.169> everything<00:04:43.560> differently<00:04:44.310> or<00:04:44.550> taking

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
doing everything differently or taking

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.070 
doing everything differently or taking
things<00:04:45.060> in<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.300> much<00:04:45.419> different<00:04:45.599> direction

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
things in a much different direction

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.749 
things in a much different direction
