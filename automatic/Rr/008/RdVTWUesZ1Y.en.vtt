00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.500

 and the rest of the world let's start emos in colombia 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.200
 President Álvaro Uribe was called to appear before the Supreme Court 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.970
 at the request of a congressman investigated for links with 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.090
 paramilitaries 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.829
 this citation occurs while a video disclosed in the United States 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.690
 revel to the chief executive meeting with a paramilitary leader in the year 2000 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.400
 one 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.170
 the recording broadcast by a US media 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.439
 shows the president with the paramilitary chief prize sánchez carreño 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.980
 alias commander eva 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.219
 the meeting would have taken place on October 31, 2000 1 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.720
 during the first uribe presidential campaign 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.380
 a few weeks later Sanchez Carreño was arrested on charges of 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.400
 homicide but Bogotá assures that the date of the meeting then 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.420
 candidate Álvaro Uribe was unaware of the actions of the chief of the self-defense groups 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.150
 which would be released in 2005 for this reason is still not clarified 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.610
 currently the Colombian government is going through an institutional crisis 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.140
 due to allegations of alleged 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.490
 the paramilitary groups some 20 congressmen uribistas are investigated 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.490
 by the supreme court 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.060
 In an interview to the Spanish newspaper the country the president of Colombia Álvaro 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.590
 Uribe assured that the end of paramilitarism and the nation is near 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.620
 South American 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.800
 the Colombian president said that the next step is the province 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.499
 after having finalized his decision to release more than 150 members 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:10.059
 the revolutionary armed forces of colombia 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:14.349
 For Uribe, the limit of this gesture must be evaluated because it affirms 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.020
 that all the freedoms that democracy provides can not come together 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.020
 in a territory affected by terrorism 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:27.049
 We continue in Colombia where the so-called Chancellor of the Farc Rodrigo Granda 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.129
 denounced that the government of Alvaro Uribe advances steps for the rescue 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.639
 of the 56 people who are in the custody of the armed forces 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:34.420
 armed 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.120

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.499
 presidential benetcourt 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.540
 they have been developing military operations 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.159
 for a blood and fire rescue 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:51.009
 winds is the operative areas are earned 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.989
 it is impossible 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.879
 that the secretariat 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.029
 or its central staff 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:02.239
 I got sent survival corridor granda clarified that he was not authorized 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.129
 for his organization to negotiate a humanitarian agreement nonetheless formulated 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.610
 an approach that can make the swap possible 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.610
 by military of the armed group that are imprisoned 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.689
 very close 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.759
 also interested 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:19.789
 in contributing to the exchange 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:21.689
 to the humanitarian agreement 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.919
 of the entity 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.229
 to Colombia 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:27.489
 a sonia 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.889
 ya simón 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.579
 that were unfairly taken 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.999
 before the courts of the United States 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:37.189
 with crude montages of Colombian intelligence 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:38.899
 supported of course 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.519
 by unscrupulous agents in the area 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.309
 during the interview granted to the agency ap the granda qualified as a 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.210
 strategy for him 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.309
 for the farc 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.489
 the unilateral decision of the Colombian government through which it was 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.599
 released on June 4 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.620
 on the other hand Granda arrived in Havana on Monday 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.460
 to perform medical exams 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.790
 discarded that his presence is related to the mission of manager of 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.309
 peace 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:05.539
 imposed by the Colombian government 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:08.649
 let's change the subject the chancellor of venezuela nicolás madura assured that 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:12.499
 Despite the criticisms and obstacles posed by parliamentarians, the 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:13.689
 the Brazilian right 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.999
 deserves will manage to enter the mercosur does not listen to us 

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:18.120
 right 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.449
 I took the road 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:20.840
 to block 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.960
 The entry of Venezuela into Mercosur 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.770
 we have enough scenario enough field to work that 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.539
 integration 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.340
 with the people of Brazil 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.199
 with businessmen from brazil 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.669
 and with Brazilian national majorities are not going to prevent 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.210
 that these transformational change currents stop 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.469
 will prevent it 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:46.479
 the income for a while but rest assured that the two mechanisms that 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.110
 are opening of articulation of this Latin American union of the case 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.849
 unasur 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.199
 already took a dimension of speed especially in recent months the 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.680
 union of South American nations the case of the dawn that not only integrates in 

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:01.729
 this moment four governments 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.110
 the day more than six governments invited if you already have mechanism 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.259
 particularly special social integration social union 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.450
 with an immediate result it is not about the summit with the speech I will lose it 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.289
 time the dawn is a concrete fact 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.969
 that goes directly to the social life of human beings in other countries the 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.309
 alba is saving the 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:26.949
 life to health 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.990
 is already bringing education to the new integration model so the 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.460
 right does not charge 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.270
 disturb the process 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.580
 joint union insertion of latin america 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.089
 and you can not stop venezuela in your mind 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.319
 on the other hand mature compared the relations of venezuela with states 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:47.729
 united and colombia assuring that with this last nation they are positive 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.969
 we can have vision of 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.770
 a political or ideological point of view and some particular issues 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.680
