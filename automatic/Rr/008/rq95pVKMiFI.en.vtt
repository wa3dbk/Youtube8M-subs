00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 all we want too and how to checkmate everyone 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.189
 hi last video i showed how 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.800
 install ubuntu operating system 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.219
 and here we will see a little bit how she 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.470
 This is my old video sound does not work 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.080
 I had to remove so that youtube did not ban 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.930
 me for someone else's song so I am a little bit 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.390
 in my own words I will comment and so 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.090
 ubuntu operating system which 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.970
 made under the mac system or rather it 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.250
 called mage riot here's the previous one 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.079
 video I told you in more detail how 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.750
 you can put it and for what actually 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.600
 Saying you need it only for 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.320
 if you have a weak computer 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.680
 weak computer and you want 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.320
 hang up the operating system based 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.910
 linux 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.219
 as you can see it works great 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.760
 This is a demo video I performed on 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.510
 your old computer this is mj old man 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.030
 two gigs of ram and here 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.280
 actually it is an operating room 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.229
 I have a system long ago 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.299
 knows how many years ago she stood before 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.460
 installation hackintosh 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.310
 or rather, my computer was impossible 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.830
 put hackintosh i put on 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.229
 similar ubuntu operating system 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.200
 as we see it works perfectly and even 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.960
 windows swing the same way as in 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.299
 mac operating system 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.820
 you can put the Russian language in this 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.740
 moment now see the notice center in 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.610
 the principle is exactly the same as in 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.009
 mac system can be installed any 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.329
 internet browser say in mozilla either 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.240
 google chrome either 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.950
 opera they also work perfectly and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.829
 given that this operating 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.250
 the system does not need antivirus 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.140
 page load pretty quickly 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.420
 You can do it like this 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.850
 shown system mac spread over all 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.030
 screen, you can choose to choose any 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.630
 the screen area that is all pretty 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.729
 smartly works the same in this system 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.700
 can be downloaded for free from the store 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.740
 applications is an analogue of microsoft office 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.479
 you are certainly not professional 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.390
 programs 0 to create 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.760
 small sign or pi 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.760
 text do it enough for you 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.049
 billy gorgeous six windows scattered 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.299
 nothing hangs the windows 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.819
 fold and appear if the cursor 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.439
 mouse move to any side angle 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.200
 you can program it yourself 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.480
 the system is an analogue of the program nira for 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.750
 Windows, you can safely write any 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.769
 information on the 9th drive is analog 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.599
 programs and imovie and flat it is not 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.900
 very heaped up but quite enough for you 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.010
 to edit video 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.440
 view any small there 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.260
 movie edit sound picture what 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.379
 then remove something to add in principle 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.760
 come off naturally then browse 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.120
 and 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.310
 convert need to understand that what 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.799
 in the video that you see now I 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.769
 did another capture from the screen so 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.329
 considering that this is an old computer 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.430
 worked on the mac system and was capture 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.489
 The principle of the screen is quite good 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.440
 quality is she 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.819
 photoshop is also free in general all these 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.879
 applications can be downloaded 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.970
 ubuntu center as i told you before 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.930
 they are absolutely completely free 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.019
 edit small picture 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.069
 quite fit the principle of this and not 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.560
 need it she 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.530
 fayder and here you can scatter folders 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.329
 view my photo documents like this 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.449
 the same system is already installed 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.250
 view photos 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:50.489
 1 som is a ready-made operating system 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.139
 once if you install it then 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.690
 principle additions you download not 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:58.019
 you can, you can specify your weather for 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.480
 your city's top menu is exactly the same 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.730
 same as the mac system that is we see with 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.220
 the left side of the bullseye we see similar 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.060
 programs are similar to the menu on the right side 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.400
 this we see the time can also be downloaded 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.860
 small games that are present in 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.600
 update center ubuntu 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.519
 in this case, I'm here demonstrating 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.590
 big old game naturally 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.239
 the graphics here are not very necessary because 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.840
 understand that a similar operating 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.330
 the system 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.400
 we put on very weak computers on 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.120
 very weak computers as a rule 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.910
 netbooks 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.980
 Well, let's say if you want to old 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.540
 any child there to put 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.020
 just such an operating system 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.870
 so that he could freely here right 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.390
 simple games to play there on the internet 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.370
 walk and not fear for the virus it's in 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.800
 principle of this is normal but now 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.230
 look the most important as you can see everything 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.480
 programs I did not turn off in this video I 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.610
 I was just hiding them now I am again 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.130
 I run all the programs like this 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.290
 a kind of crash test that is, we 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.260
 try to run all the programs 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.090
 which were shown in this video and you 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.970
 You will see that the operating system is not 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.980
 depends that is it not only does not depend 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.040
 but you can freely show each window 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.770
 scatter you can minimize these windows 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.290
 again make them so that they appear 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.750
 This time this once again suggests that 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.580
 the system is stable and in principle 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.300
 ok well here actually and all 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.300
 what I wanted to tell
