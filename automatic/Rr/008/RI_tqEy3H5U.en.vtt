00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.309
 years 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.810
 m hello to all i'm happy to me 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.830
 find for this new video that 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.360
 do mega mega long we'll say for 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.770
 it's almost an eternity because 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.099
 that I had set myself a rhythm 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.360
 quite frantic about videos and we 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.400
 will say that now it's about 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.599
 three weeks that I have not toured so 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.640
 it's a little weird you're going 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.720
 see me stammered and finally short I do 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.640
 I can therefore score 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.860
 the reasons for my absence all 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.660
 I just went on vacation 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.760
 I took a new job so from 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.379
 it's a bit difficult to 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.430
 adapt myself and everything so but now 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.870
 I will try anyway 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.500
 post videos a little bit more 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.970
 regularly 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.309
 but know that it's a little bit 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.559
 complicated so here we will close the 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.229
 passage I tell my life and we go 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.570
 so go on about the video then 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.210
 for one for today's recipe 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.530
 it will be the recipe of the bounties then 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.960
 the bounty is a chocolate bar 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.280
 for those who do not know because 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 that normally everyone knows 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.880
 the good if so it's a bar 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.159
 chocolate and stuffed with coconut 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.990
 it's really something I love jean 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.330

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.150
 so here and I really wanted to do 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.940
 something natural but that keeps 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.980
 still the original taste of politics 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.570
 is there really with this recipe you 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.940

 so I'm going to mix 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:26.250
 that's the goal being really to make 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:29.750
 make a dough with so your your 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.750

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.840
 coconut cool I'm just going to 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.230
 put in film paper so is the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.220
 master five minutes in the freezer 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.480
 once you have left it so 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.610
 five minutes in the freezer 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:04:01.040
 you will come out your little ones 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:01.040
 coconut balls is here so we'll take 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.470
 not take small pieces 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.340
 so here you knead well actually a 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:29.610
 little ball and after you make one 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.610
 small puppet Mac 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.990
 here 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:40.450
 so the 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.450
 it wants to bring back like 6 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.150
 this is so as to have the shape of a 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.250
 bar so once you've done 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.960
 your little sticks you go the master 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.780
 in the fridge for 20 minutes 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.150
 so there in the meantime you will take 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.220
 your chocolate pieces cut them into 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.310
 small pieces so full in squares 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.890
 and you're going to put a spoon to 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.990
 water soup in the bowl and do it 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.790
 spend a minute in the microwave 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.410
 once your chocolate is melted at 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.550
 microwave waves you will add 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:18.190
 So is your butter and mix it 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.960

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.340
 so provide you with a fork 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.340

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.860
 a fork and you go we got it 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:37.410

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.410
 simple that it whitewash 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:59.970
 we repeat the operation for the 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:01.889
 others and so you will relocate the 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.500
 all cool for about 20 minutes 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.690
 in order to really consolidate your 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.159

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.509
