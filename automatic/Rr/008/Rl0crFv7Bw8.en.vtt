00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.350
 l 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.540
 very well today we are in hardcore 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.180
 Parkour 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.950
 that's how I pass from louis and parkour to 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.290
 hardcore so is 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.490
 and well there really are videos in 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.890
 ostrava had already told them that he was going to 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.400
 record parkour every like two per month 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.489
 but he recorded this almost in the same week 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.720
 than the previous one because this I had many 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.210
 problems he records this week 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.030
 I tried to record five videos and the five 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.379
 they ruined 111 the most that the most 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.010
 oblivion was the new series that was 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:49.559
 recording lasted half an hour 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.089
 and in the end I'm very sad but good 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.609
 you have to relax and not be 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.019
 depressed and good obviously one by one 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.969
 things will not always come out and not 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.460
 that's why you have to be able to continue so bad 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.309
 so well this mom is created by the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.750
 Same guy from the previous map and good 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.759
 it will be a little harder than the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.560
 previous map but good I hope to be able 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.460
 happen in this video and we're going to start 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.899
 here good welcome to hard parkour 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.680
 made by cgt to it from the other time already 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.220
 they knew 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.990
 no rules do not break blocks do not put 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.140
 blocks of streets you can fly with 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.540
 creative obviously and unless you're 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.790
 Say that I do not understand your signs but 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.950
 well come on we started guys easy and 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.470
 tranquilito this is how easy come easy 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.200
 easy and I'm practically parkour 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.450

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.530
 skiing new heroes I bring in fact 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.110
 when you play week I remember when 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.000
 I started on YouTube and well I put as 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.180
 nostalgic and good is parent father 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.800
 judge of things I know a start 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.509
 I always say it like you start 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.810
 it's like saying I remember when 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.270
 start high school because I do not know with my 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.940
 friends how was the thing and everything because not 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.920
 I know you wear it because you get happy that 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.300
 you remember how things were I am very 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.110
 bad in parkour and I am also in a 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.310
 bank or do not skip come one day 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.140
 I will record a video when so that 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.330
 see my prints where you put them and how 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.180
 who took it out of the pongo 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.680
 and see how I also do it 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.990
 well but I do it well but I do not 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.200
 they come out or alternatives to the rest or by God 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.070
 what awaits me the suffering that I 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.880
 wait my god come 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.880
 the map I'm also 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.030
 okay 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.500
 easy jumps which is that as it is 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.659
 hardcore but the truth is that I think 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.909
 which are pretty easy jumps and all I've 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:52.080
 seen some maps that the truth is passed 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:54.120
 spear seriously good rhythm but the 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.150
 steps are for professionals in the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.200
 parkour I believe as my compa the I do not believe 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.200
 that he is very good parkour 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.560
 to see and I'm thinking about creating a map 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.540
 from parkour me for many many 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.370
 years good a lot of time i have loved 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.470
 create a map for me 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.630
 not only for me but for the people but 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.730
 done by me and the truth that I'm going to 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.800
 do I am thinking and studying 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.630
 I seriously want to make two one 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.040
 percussion or the complete of monument 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.120
 but the first one I'm going to do is going to be 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.250
 Parkour, in fact, I thought 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.870
 someday record like some map but 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.160
 good as is going to be the first map I think 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.180
 that will not be quite right 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.180
 then I will not record it 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.030
 for now here comes something difficult 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.420
 today is serious 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.060
 they will not see me that much anymore 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.220
 perfect 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.230
 oh god is that these tall imagine me 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.510
 it happens to be like this without always moving 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.970
 always always always fail high 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:11.490
 fingers is that I'm terrible 200 fingers 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.430

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:18.040

 more than anything continue here with the 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.360
 Parkour talks with me the knot of the 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:42.199
 12 that can generate more in doing it but 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.199
