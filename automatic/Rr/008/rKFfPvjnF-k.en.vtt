wire in there same thing for the other
to<00:02:42.410> get<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.910> wire<00:02:44.269> in<00:02:44.540> there<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.349> then<00:02:46.040> we're

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
to get that wire in there and then we're

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.210 
to get that wire in there and then we're
going<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.489> press<00:02:46.790> this<00:02:47.060> button<00:02:47.480> here<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:48.220> put

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
going to press this button here and put

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.910 
going to press this button here and put
the<00:02:49.370> wire<00:02:49.610> in<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.180> now<00:02:50.329> we've<00:02:50.510> got<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.530> whole

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
the wire in so now we've got the whole

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.940 
the wire in so now we've got the whole
assembly<00:02:52.819> wired<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.349> first<00:02:54.590> thing<00:02:54.680> we're

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
assembly wired so the first thing we're

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.140 
assembly wired so the first thing we're
going<00:02:55.069> to<00:02:55.130> do<00:02:55.310> is<00:02:55.459> we're<00:02:55.610> going<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.760> feed<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
going to do is we're going to feed the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:06.900 
going to do is we're going to feed the
wire<00:02:56.329> through<00:02:56.799> that<00:02:57.799> slot

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.120 

right

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
leads going to go into the other jumper

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.840 
leads going to go into the other jumper
like<00:03:35.350> that<00:03:36.090> okay<00:03:37.090> then<00:03:38.370> usually<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.490> can<00:03:39.670> push

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
the slack back into the wall you're

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.260 
the slack back into the wall you're
going<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.570> hang<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:43.960> right<00:03:44.140> on<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.500> screws<00:03:44.890> and

going to hang it right on the screws and

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:52.740 
going to hang it right on the screws and
then<00:03:46.320> you<00:03:47.320> just<00:03:48.900> tighten<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.230> screws<00:03:51.750> you've
