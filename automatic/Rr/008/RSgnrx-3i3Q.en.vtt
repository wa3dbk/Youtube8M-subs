cannabis<00:01:25.870> but<00:01:26.320> it<00:01:26.410> works<00:01:26.620> so<00:01:27.460> then<00:01:28.150> a<00:01:28.510> really

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
cannabis but it works so then a really

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.960 
cannabis but it works so then a really
good<00:01:29.350> tool<00:01:29.530> for<00:01:29.650> thumbnails<00:01:30.070> is<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.700> blend

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
good tool for thumbnails is the blend

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.550 
good tool for thumbnails is the blend
tool<00:01:31.090> we're<00:01:31.570> pretty<00:01:31.750> much<00:01:31.930> you<00:01:32.080> pick<00:01:32.380> that

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
tool we're pretty much you pick that

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.280 
tool we're pretty much you pick that
then<00:01:33.280> you'd<00:01:33.460> get<00:01:33.670> two<00:01:33.850> colors<00:01:34.210> like<00:01:34.450> blue<00:01:34.810> and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
then you'd get two colors like blue and

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.710 
then you'd get two colors like blue and
maybe<00:01:35.800> a<00:01:35.920> lighter<00:01:36.400> blue<00:01:36.520> like<00:01:37.360> I<00:01:37.480> have<00:01:37.690> here

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.440 
maybe a lighter blue like I have here
and<00:01:38.170> then<00:01:39.010> you<00:01:39.190> would<00:01:39.370> kind<00:01:40.000> of<00:01:40.060> move<00:01:40.330> it

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
and then you would kind of move it

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.200 
and then you would kind of move it
around<00:01:40.510> and<00:01:40.990> see<00:01:41.170> what<00:01:41.320> you<00:01:41.470> would<00:01:41.590> like<00:01:42.210> so
