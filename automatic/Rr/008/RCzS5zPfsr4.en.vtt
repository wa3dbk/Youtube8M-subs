00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
coming in you've got to expect it when

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.330

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
so it is gonna be difficult but it's

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.269 
so it is gonna be difficult but it's
definitely<00:00:27.000> worth<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.769> it<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
definitely worth it it is it is a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.470 
definitely worth it it is it is a
temperature<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.730> culture<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.210> winning
