00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.490
 workspace so round the things away 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.050
 he does not really need it 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.980
 should be about the same with the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.609
 have enough space you have what you need 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.309
 go everything 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.149
 a cookbook after this broadcast 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.690
 did not need it anymore 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:43.170
 ok then you need something in your head 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:49.559
 In any case, he needs milk 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.629
 eggs sugar flour 1 mug for emergencies 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.100
 kitchen paper and a whisk 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:00.719
 machine then let's get started 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.340
 So first you do not take that and yes 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.339
 what you really need is 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.280
 of course, a measuring cup, of course, the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.270
 absolutely needed 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.750
 So let's start with 50 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.600
 did not come so as I said needs 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.600
 every case milk and 50 grams of it 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.890
 Of course, the milk is very much 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.720
 important then of course very much 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.479
 important three eggs so then overall 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.100
 I am separating three to four eggs 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.009
 forget I forgot the milter 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.350
 zuzuschÃ¼tten moment so heard the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.740
 of course, too 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.479
 so it has come very far now 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.750
 I already have the milk inside 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:56.479
 the eggs are only with sugar and 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.479
 water for full sugar 1 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:09.979

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:14.510

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.730

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.550
 a bread-baking times also look the word 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.340
 I hope so okay if you are there 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.680
 Never have you got it out of here and 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.989
 of course it would have to kneel and neat 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:33.640
 if her club had one last 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:36.650
 Round his team back in the pot and 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.480
 then off to the gps machine you can do it 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.049
 Also mixer or call it anything else but we 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.670
 always call it snow machine so 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.670
 and mix now 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:57.440
 can mix that after four minutes 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:59.870
 rausholt yes and then you are already 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.880
 Almost done now you just have to do it 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.390
 bring a bread shape and then off in 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.730
 the oven and if he likes his bread 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.290
 did form does so with a 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.290
 Sheet metal and there in the oven 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.180
 Now it works 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.370
 I have and then it was and was 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.340
 always and so on and so forth 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.879
 after a long wait is finally ready 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:47.650

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:50.879
