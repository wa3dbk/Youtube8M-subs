the in the field and the improvements

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.690 
the in the field and the improvements
are<00:00:35.850> enormous<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:37.129> mean<00:00:38.129> even<00:00:38.399> from<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
are enormous I mean even from the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.150 
are enormous I mean even from the
interior<00:00:39.030> outwards<00:00:39.719> basically<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:41.039> got<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
interior outwards basically you got a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.970 
interior outwards basically you got a
lot<00:00:41.340> more<00:00:41.520> options<00:00:41.730> when<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.149> comes<00:00:42.450> to

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
lot more options when it comes to

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.370 
lot more options when it comes to
traction<00:00:43.980> control<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.700> your<00:00:44.790> off-road

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
traction control and your off-road

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.590 
traction control and your off-road
ability<00:00:46.730> which<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.760> controlled<00:00:48.270> from<00:00:48.360> down

here the center console
very<00:00:50.730> nicely<00:00:50.940> laid<00:00:51.150> out<00:00:51.510> maybe<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.260> possibility

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
very nicely laid out maybe a possibility

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.650 
very nicely laid out maybe a possibility
of<00:00:53.250> being<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.880> little<00:00:54.210> bit<00:00:54.329> too<00:00:54.510> much

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660

now I always give cars a little bit of a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.050 
now I always give cars a little bit of a
wiggle<00:01:28.320> test<00:01:28.650> here<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> give<00:01:29.220> me<00:01:29.310> an<00:01:29.400> idea<00:01:29.490> how

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
wiggle test here to give me an idea how

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.430 
wiggle test here to give me an idea how
they're<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> behave<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.170> had<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
they're going to behave if I had to

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.580 
they're going to behave if I had to
swerve<00:01:32.210> even<00:01:33.210> though<00:01:33.330> this<00:01:33.479> one<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.750> soft<00:01:34.260> and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
swerve even though this one is soft and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.240 
swerve even though this one is soft and
rolls<00:01:35.010> it<00:01:35.659> has<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.690> tautness<00:01:37.049> about<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.159> it

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
rolls it has a tautness about it and it

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.000 
rolls it has a tautness about it and it
feels<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.270> controlled<00:01:39.960> movement<00:01:40.799> as

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
feels like a controlled movement as

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.670 
feels like a controlled movement as
opposed<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.760> a<00:01:41.880> car<00:01:42.210> counter<00:01:43.170> affecting

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
opposed to a car counter affecting

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.770 
opposed to a car counter affecting
everything<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> reflexive<00:01:45.210> action<00:01:45.420> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
everything with a reflexive action that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.899 
everything with a reflexive action that
makes<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.110> boat<00:01:46.350> around<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.979> almost<00:01:47.729> makes

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
makes you boat around and almost makes

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.240 
makes you boat around and almost makes
you<00:01:48.000> feel<00:01:48.210> articulated<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:49.710> feel<00:01:50.070> quite

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
you feel articulated so I do feel quite

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460 
you feel articulated so I do feel quite
confident<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.150> this<00:01:51.299> vehicle<00:01:51.570> would

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
confident that this vehicle would

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.280 
confident that this vehicle would
respond<00:01:52.920> well<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.159> us<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> swerve<00:01:54.600> maybe<00:01:55.020> not

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
respond well to us to a swerve maybe not

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.310 
respond well to us to a swerve maybe not
completely<00:01:55.530> as<00:01:56.420> acute<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.600> smaller<00:01:57.990> car

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
completely as acute as a smaller car

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.490 
completely as acute as a smaller car
would<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.759> definitely<00:02:00.570> doesn't<00:02:00.840> bounce

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
would but it definitely doesn't bounce

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.140 
would but it definitely doesn't bounce
all<00:02:01.770> over<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> place<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> jelly<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:03.119> a

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
all over the place like a jelly on a

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.450 
all over the place like a jelly on a
plate<00:02:03.540> that's<00:02:04.140> quite<00:02:04.350> reassuring<00:02:04.680> especially

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
plate that's quite reassuring especially

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.039 
plate that's quite reassuring especially
when<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:05.640> pop<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.880> down<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.150> motorway<00:02:06.390> at<00:02:06.720> 70

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
when you pop it down a motorway at 70

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:07.940 
when you pop it down a motorway at 70
miles<00:02:07.259> an<00:02:07.439> hour

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
miles an hour

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.669 
miles an hour
now<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.789> actual<00:02:09.000> drive<00:02:09.390> itself<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.049> fantastic

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
now the actual drive itself is fantastic
