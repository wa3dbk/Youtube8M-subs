frets right now in case you want to

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.770 
frets right now in case you want to
write<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.830> down<00:00:53.100> or<00:00:53.310> something<00:00:53.490> one<00:00:54.390> starts

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
write this down or something one starts

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.040 
write this down or something one starts
way<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.240> is<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.540> acoustics

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
way up here and this is the acoustics

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.670 
way up here and this is the acoustics
for<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.380> so<00:00:58.470> i<00:00:58.500> don't<00:00:58.650> have<00:00:59.360> from<00:01:00.360> good<00:01:01.260> spacing

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
for it so i don't have from good spacing

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.020 
for it so i don't have from good spacing
so<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> lot<00:01:02.010> harder<00:01:02.220> to<00:01:02.430> reach<00:01:03.410> but<00:01:05.030> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
so it's a lot harder to reach but it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.120 
so it's a lot harder to reach but it
goes<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.630> goes<00:01:07.370> 1210<00:01:11.030> 714<00:01:12.290> 710<00:01:13.290> sorry

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
goes like this goes 1210 714 710 sorry

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:25.359 
goes like this goes 1210 714 710 sorry
1410<00:01:14.880> 7<00:01:16.729> 12<00:01:17.729> 14<00:01:18.540> 15<00:01:18.840> 17<00:01:19.440> 15<00:01:20.340> 14<00:01:20.940> 12<00:01:21.420> 10<00:01:22.729> 12<00:01:23.930> so

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
1410 7 12 14 15 17 15 14 12 10 12 so

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:44.110 
1410 7 12 14 15 17 15 14 12 10 12 so
I'll<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.430> play<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> top

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.910 

so<00:01:45.120> it<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.390> relatively<00:01:46.200> hard<00:01:46.560> with<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.800> guitar

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
so it is relatively hard with the guitar

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.500 
so it is relatively hard with the guitar
like<00:01:47.190> this<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.550> it<00:01:47.610> does<00:01:47.790> go<00:01:47.940> pretty<00:01:48.240> far<00:01:48.450> up

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
like this and it does go pretty far up

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.490 
like this and it does go pretty far up
here<00:01:50.150> but<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.570> strumming<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.200> same<00:01:52.380> as

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
here but the strumming is the same as

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.890 
here but the strumming is the same as
the<00:01:52.560> first<00:01:52.740> video<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.300> if<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.480> don't<00:01:54.630> know<00:01:54.750> how

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
the first video so if you don't know how

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.960 
the first video so if you don't know how
that<00:01:55.080> goes<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.950> watch<00:01:56.220> it<00:01:56.250> but

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
that goes you just have to watch it but

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.140 
that goes you just have to watch it but
I<00:01:58.130> don't<00:01:59.130> know<00:01:59.310> how<00:01:59.430> my<00:01:59.580> battery<00:01:59.880> is<00:01:59.910> doing<00:02:00.120> on

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
I don't know how my battery is doing on

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.370 
I don't know how my battery is doing on
my<00:02:00.240> camera<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.780> might<00:02:00.960> cut<00:02:01.110> off<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
my camera so it might cut off in the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.650 
my camera so it might cut off in the
middle<00:02:01.560> but<00:02:01.880> i'll<00:02:02.880> try<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.240> play<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> whole

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
middle but i'll try and play the whole

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.360 
middle but i'll try and play the whole
thing<00:02:03.840> through<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.800> generally<00:02:05.340> what

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
thing through so this is generally what

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:42.840 
thing through so this is generally what
it<00:02:05.550> sound<00:02:05.790> like

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.360 

and<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:43.970> course<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.330> starts<00:02:44.510> over<00:02:44.720> again<00:02:44.900> um<00:02:45.500> if

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
and of course it starts over again um if

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.270 
and of course it starts over again um if
you<00:02:47.090> want<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.540> know<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.920> chords<00:02:48.920> for<00:02:49.100> that

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
you want to know the chords for that

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.550 
you want to know the chords for that
you'll<00:02:49.490> have<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.880> find<00:02:50.540> tabs<00:02:50.960> or<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.290> because

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
you'll have to find tabs or that because

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.610 
you'll have to find tabs or that because
i<00:02:51.590> have<00:02:52.550> yet<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.540> actually<00:02:53.750> look<00:02:54.080> them<00:02:54.290> up<00:02:54.440> I

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
i have yet to actually look them up I

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.890 
i have yet to actually look them up I
just
