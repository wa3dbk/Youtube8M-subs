and<00:01:06.890> he<00:01:07.039> says<00:01:07.280> in<00:01:07.460> there<00:01:07.640> was<00:01:07.939> the<00:01:08.210> effect<00:01:08.630> to

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
and he says in there was the effect to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.520 
and he says in there was the effect to
understand<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:11.780> humans<00:01:13.210> reptilian

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
understand the humans reptilian

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.169 
understand the humans reptilian
characteristics<00:01:15.530> is<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.250> understand<00:01:16.789> so<00:01:17.000> much

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
characteristics is to understand so much

about<00:01:17.240> human<00:01:18.229> behavior<00:01:18.380> quite<00:01:19.310> right<00:01:19.840> it's<00:01:20.840> in

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
about human behavior quite right it's in

idea of shape-shifting now it's an

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.930 
idea of shape-shifting now it's an

we're<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:52.549> locked<00:01:52.970> into<00:01:53.209> this<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:53.720> reality

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
we're so locked into this this reality

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.900 
we're so locked into this this reality
is<00:01:54.349> real<00:01:54.819> it's<00:01:55.819> like<00:01:55.879> a<00:01:56.300> you<00:01:56.959> physical<00:01:57.910> solid

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
is real it's like a you physical solid

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.680 
is real it's like a you physical solid
human<00:01:59.269> body<00:01:59.769> transforming<00:02:00.769> into<00:02:01.009> a<00:02:01.039> solid

human body transforming into a solid
reptilian<00:02:02.690> body<00:02:02.929> and<00:02:03.140> then<00:02:03.229> back<00:02:03.410> again

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
reptilian body and then back again

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.229 
reptilian body and then back again
because<00:02:03.769> I<00:02:03.920> spend<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:04.250> people<00:02:04.489> all<00:02:04.670> over<00:02:04.700> the

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
because I spend to people all over the

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:07.719 
because I spend to people all over the
world<00:02:05.269> vast<00:02:05.989> numbers<00:02:06.500> now<00:02:06.679> who<00:02:07.280> have<00:02:07.429> seen

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
world vast numbers now who have seen

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.540 
world vast numbers now who have seen
this<00:02:08.110> phenomenon<00:02:09.110> of<00:02:09.289> seeing<00:02:09.739> someone<00:02:10.250> a

this phenomenon of seeing someone a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.880 
this phenomenon of seeing someone a
human<00:02:11.110> suddenly<00:02:12.110> transform<00:02:12.650> into<00:02:12.800> a

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
human suddenly transform into a

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.350 
human suddenly transform into a
reptilian<00:02:13.430> figure<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.879> then<00:02:13.970> come<00:02:14.150> back

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
reptilian figure and then come back

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.869 
reptilian figure and then come back
again<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.260> ancient<00:02:15.650> accounts<00:02:16.190> talk

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
again and the ancient accounts talk

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.920 
again and the ancient accounts talk
about<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.300> same<00:02:17.540> thing<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:19.720> people<00:02:20.720> think

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
about the same thing and people think

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.300 
about the same thing and people think
it's<00:02:20.989> impossible<00:02:21.500> mate

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
it's impossible mate

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.339 
it's impossible mate
how<00:02:22.730> could<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.120> out<00:02:23.360> get<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.599> body<00:02:23.840> change<00:02:24.170> into

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
how could you out get a body change into

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.990 
how could you out get a body change into
another<00:02:24.409> body<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:24.950> mean<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.250> person<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.790> die

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
another body I mean the person to die

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.140 
another body I mean the person to die
wouldn't<00:02:26.390> they<00:02:26.500> well<00:02:27.670> that's<00:02:28.670> not<00:02:28.909> what's

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
wouldn't they well that's not what's

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.960 
wouldn't they well that's not what's
happening<00:02:29.800> as<00:02:30.800> we<00:02:31.220> talked<00:02:31.489> about<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:31.879> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
happening as we talked about in the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.780 
happening as we talked about in the
first<00:02:32.000> half<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:33.349> only<00:02:33.739> place<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.430> the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
first half the only place that the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.089 
first half the only place that the
physical<00:02:35.330> reptilian<00:02:35.930> form<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.620> physical

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
physical reptilian form and the physical

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.119 
physical reptilian form and the physical
human<00:02:37.459> form<00:02:37.489> exists<00:02:38.150> is<00:02:38.390> in<00:02:38.750> here<00:02:39.129> when

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
human form exists is in here when

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.430 
human form exists is in here when
they're<00:02:40.370> energetic<00:02:41.269> form<00:02:41.659> is<00:02:41.959> decoded<00:02:42.920> into<00:02:43.550> a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
they're energetic form is decoded into a

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.670 
they're energetic form is decoded into a
holographic<00:02:45.580> apparently<00:02:46.580> physical<00:02:47.060> form<00:02:47.299> so

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
holographic apparently physical form so

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.360 
holographic apparently physical form so
when<00:02:48.680> something<00:02:49.299> shape-shifting<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:51.680> shifts

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
when something shape-shifting it shifts

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.750 
when something shape-shifting it shifts
in<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:53.569> decoding<00:02:54.290> mechanism<00:02:54.560> by<00:02:55.280> which<00:02:55.310> we

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
in the decoding mechanism by which we

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.420 
in the decoding mechanism by which we
decode<00:02:56.209> different<00:02:57.080> energy<00:02:57.680> fields<00:02:58.130> it's

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
decode different energy fields it's

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.790 
decode different energy fields it's
literally<00:02:58.940> like<00:02:59.300> changing<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.260> telev

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
literally like changing a telev

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.910 
literally like changing a telev
Channel<00:03:01.510> you've<00:03:02.510> got<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.840> human<00:03:03.230> field<00:03:03.590> which

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
Channel you've got the human field which

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.390 
Channel you've got the human field which
is<00:03:05.020> obscuring<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.260> reptilian<00:03:06.800> field<00:03:07.100> because

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
is obscuring the reptilian field because

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.400 
is obscuring the reptilian field because
they<00:03:07.550> they<00:03:08.000> hide<00:03:08.240> behind<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.690> human<00:03:08.960> field<00:03:09.200> so

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
they they hide behind the human field so

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.600 
they they hide behind the human field so
we<00:03:09.530> don't<00:03:09.710> know<00:03:09.800> what<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.010> hell's<00:03:10.130> going<00:03:10.370> on

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
we don't know what the hell's going on

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.660 
we don't know what the hell's going on
and<00:03:11.230> if<00:03:12.230> I'm<00:03:12.440> observing<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.100> human<00:03:13.250> field

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
and if I'm observing the human field

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.850 
and if I'm observing the human field
that's<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.090> prime<00:03:14.330> field<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:14.990> I'm<00:03:15.140> decoding

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
that's the prime field that I'm decoding

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.850 
that's the prime field that I'm decoding
I<00:03:16.010> will<00:03:16.460> see<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.700> human<00:03:17.050> but<00:03:18.050> if<00:03:18.170> this<00:03:18.380> becomes

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
I will see a human but if this becomes

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.980 
I will see a human but if this becomes
the<00:03:19.040> prime<00:03:19.310> field<00:03:19.670> suddenly<00:03:20.540> for<00:03:20.810> whatever

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
the prime field suddenly for whatever

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.650 
the prime field suddenly for whatever
reason<00:03:21.590> I'm<00:03:21.980> now<00:03:22.400> decoding<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.060> reptilian
