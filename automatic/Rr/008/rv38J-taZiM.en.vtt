00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
can find it a log because what we're

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.740 
can find it a log because what we're
going<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:01.820> do<00:02:01.970> with<00:02:02.119> this<00:02:02.240> is<00:02:02.420> we're<00:02:02.570> going<00:02:02.659> to

drill<00:02:02.960> holes<00:02:03.170> in<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:03.740> this<00:02:03.890> one<00:02:04.070> needs<00:02:04.220> to

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
drill holes in it so this one needs to

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.469 
drill holes in it so this one needs to
be<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:05.119> know<00:02:05.270> fairly<00:02:06.070> substantial<00:02:07.360> but<00:02:08.360> I'm

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
be you know fairly substantial but I'm

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
birdhouse is just at the top so they

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.789 
birdhouse is just at the top so they
might<00:03:27.629> be<00:03:27.780> useful<00:03:27.930> for<00:03:28.169> the<00:03:28.349> birds<00:03:28.560> as<00:03:28.769> well

might be useful for the birds as well

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.849 
might be useful for the birds as well
and<00:03:29.359> I've<00:03:30.359> got<00:03:30.780> wood<00:03:30.989> chip<00:03:31.290> on<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.590> floor

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
and I've got wood chip on the floor

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.890 
and I've got wood chip on the floor
which<00:03:32.099> is<00:03:32.280> what<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:32.489> just<00:03:32.940> I've<00:03:33.180> just<00:03:33.209> put<00:03:33.750> in

which is what I just I've just put in

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.559 
which is what I just I've just put in
this<00:03:34.109> area<00:03:34.819> because<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:35.970> grass<00:03:36.180> would<00:03:36.359> never

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
this area because the grass would never

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.020 
this area because the grass would never
grow<00:03:36.840> because<00:03:37.290> we<00:03:38.069> have<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.340> trampoline<00:03:38.790> here

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
grow because we have to trampoline here

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.409 
grow because we have to trampoline here
and<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.349> corner<00:03:40.739> here<00:03:41.000> I've<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:42.269> bought

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
and in the corner here I've just bought

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.140 
and in the corner here I've just bought
a<00:03:42.480> little<00:03:42.780> plant<00:03:42.989> that's<00:03:43.260> just<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:44.150> honeysuckle

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
a little plant that's just a honeysuckle

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.059 
a little plant that's just a honeysuckle
which<00:03:45.599> is<00:03:45.780> just<00:03:46.019> growing<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.470> had<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.769> cut<00:03:46.949> it

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
which is just growing I had to cut it

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.149 
which is just growing I had to cut it
down<00:03:47.099> when<00:03:47.519> we<00:03:47.639> had<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:47.849> fencing<00:03:48.389> put<00:03:48.989> in<00:03:49.199> so<00:03:49.889> I

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
down when we had the fencing put in so I

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.189 
down when we had the fencing put in so I
think<00:03:50.280> for<00:03:51.000> me<00:03:51.030> this<00:03:51.419> is<00:03:51.629> the<00:03:51.780> perfect<00:03:51.959> place

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
think for me this is the perfect place

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.710 
think for me this is the perfect place
to<00:03:52.530> put<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:52.739> now<00:03:53.699> I<00:03:53.729> want<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.269> put<00:03:54.419> it<00:03:54.510> at<00:03:54.629> an

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
to put it now I want to put it at an

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.439 
to put it now I want to put it at an
angle<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:56.400> don't<00:03:56.819> really<00:03:56.970> want<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.209> get<00:03:57.329> the

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
angle and I don't really want to get the

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.360 
angle and I don't really want to get the
sewer<00:03:57.659> out<00:03:57.959> but<00:03:58.229> you<00:03:58.500> know<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:58.919> could<00:03:59.250> always

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
sewer out but you know I could always

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.330 
sewer out but you know I could always
cut<00:04:00.269> this<00:04:00.449> in<00:04:00.690> half<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.409> make<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.769> quite<00:04:02.010> small

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
cut this in half and make it quite small

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.550 
cut this in half and make it quite small
but<00:04:02.669> I'm<00:04:03.120> going<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.389> make<00:04:03.510> my<00:04:03.629> quite<00:04:03.959> large<00:04:04.290> you

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
but I'm going to make my quite large you

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.039 
but I'm going to make my quite large you
can<00:04:04.739> make<00:04:04.949> them<00:04:05.099> whatever<00:04:05.280> size<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.060> want<00:04:06.569> it

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
can make them whatever size you want it

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.979 
can make them whatever size you want it
really<00:04:07.440> doesn't<00:04:08.129> matter<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:09.239> I'm<00:04:09.569> going<00:04:09.959> to

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
really doesn't matter so I'm going to

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.009 
really doesn't matter so I'm going to
put<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:11.449> plank<00:04:12.449> of<00:04:12.599> wood<00:04:12.659> there<00:04:13.139> so<00:04:13.979> that<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.190> know

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
put a plank of wood there so that I know

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.330 
put a plank of wood there so that I know
what<00:04:16.019> size<00:04:16.289> it's<00:04:16.560> going<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.769> be<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.039> where<00:04:17.220> it

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
what size it's going to be and where it

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.550 
what size it's going to be and where it
needs<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.639> go<00:04:17.810> so<00:04:18.810> I'm<00:04:19.049> going<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.289> get<00:04:19.409> my

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
needs to go so I'm going to get my

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.939 
needs to go so I'm going to get my
bricks<00:04:19.949> and<00:04:20.310> I'll<00:04:20.519> put<00:04:20.789> one<00:04:20.820> there<00:04:21.949> because

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
bricks and I'll put one there because

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.700 
bricks and I'll put one there because
that's<00:04:23.130> at<00:04:23.370> one<00:04:23.550> end<00:04:24.289> one<00:04:25.289> at<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.590> other<00:04:25.620> end

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
that's at one end one at the other end

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.730 
that's at one end one at the other end
and<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:27.460> make<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:27.819> super<00:04:28.150> duper<00:04:28.449> sturdy<00:04:28.750> I'll

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
and to make it super duper sturdy I'll

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.140 
and to make it super duper sturdy I'll
put<00:04:30.220> one<00:04:30.250> in<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.669> middle<00:04:30.870> so<00:04:31.870> hopefully<00:04:33.150> it

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
put one in the middle so hopefully it

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.620 
put one in the middle so hopefully it
will<00:04:34.539> go<00:04:34.720> on<00:04:34.750> there<00:04:35.370> just<00:04:36.370> like<00:04:36.610> that<00:04:36.669> but

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
will go on there just like that but

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.589 
will go on there just like that but
that's<00:04:37.810> quite<00:04:38.199> low<00:04:38.819> so<00:04:39.819> what<00:04:40.030> I'm<00:04:40.150> going<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.389> do

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
that's quite low so what I'm going to do

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.040 
that's quite low so what I'm going to do
is<00:04:40.750> I'm<00:04:40.870> going<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.050> put<00:04:41.259> two<00:04:41.830> layers<00:04:42.220> of<00:04:42.580> bricks

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
is I'm going to put two layers of bricks

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.999 
is I'm going to put two layers of bricks
on<00:04:44.050> here<00:04:45.330> just<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.690> give<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:47.289> little<00:04:47.410> bit<00:04:47.949> of

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
on here just to give a little bit of

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.740 
on here just to give a little bit of
extra<00:04:48.430> space<00:04:48.720> underneath<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:50.500> then<00:04:51.690> all<00:04:52.690> i

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
extra space underneath and then all i

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:01.249 
extra space underneath and then all i
need<00:04:53.199> to<00:04:53.229> do<00:04:55.560> is<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.979> put<00:04:57.250> some<00:04:57.699> wood<00:04:57.910> on<00:04:58.120> top

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.379 

whether<00:05:02.259> you'll<00:05:02.530> need<00:05:02.770> two<00:05:03.130> or<00:05:03.460> three<00:05:03.849> it<00:05:04.090> just

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
whether you'll need two or three it just

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.580 
whether you'll need two or three it just
depends<00:05:04.870> on<00:05:05.139> the<00:05:05.740> size<00:05:06.070> of<00:05:06.810> your<00:05:07.810> pieces<00:05:08.289> of

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
depends on the size of your pieces of

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.560 
depends on the size of your pieces of
wood<00:05:08.770> I<00:05:08.919> think<00:05:09.160> I<00:05:09.340> might<00:05:09.550> only<00:05:09.789> actually<00:05:10.509> off

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
wood I think I might only actually off

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.749 
wood I think I might only actually off
at<00:05:10.780> one<00:05:10.960> there<00:05:11.169> and<00:05:11.199> one<00:05:11.380> there<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:12.009> then<00:05:12.610> I'll

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
at one there and one there and then I'll

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.490 
at one there and one there and then I'll
put<00:05:13.000> one<00:05:13.240> in<00:05:13.539> between<00:05:14.410> there<00:05:14.830> so<00:05:16.080> that's<00:05:17.080> our

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
put one in between there so that's our

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.580 
put one in between there so that's our
first<00:05:17.740> layer<00:05:18.130> and<00:05:18.460> we<00:05:19.060> need<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.509> fill<00:05:19.930> each

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
first layer and we need to fill each

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.360 
first layer and we need to fill each
section<00:05:21.400> with<00:05:22.060> something<00:05:22.599> okay<00:05:23.530> now<00:05:24.039> I've

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
section with something okay now I've

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.510 
section with something okay now I've
just<00:05:24.729> found<00:05:26.849> these<00:05:27.849> in<00:05:28.120> my<00:05:28.300> garden<00:05:28.770> this<00:05:29.770> I<00:05:30.190> had

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
just found these in my garden this I had

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.210 
just found these in my garden this I had
left<00:05:30.789> over<00:05:31.210> when<00:05:31.330> I<00:05:31.630> did<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.800> bits<00:05:33.039> around

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
left over when I did the bits around

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.890 
left over when I did the bits around
thee<00:05:33.699> it's<00:05:34.389> log<00:05:35.169> roll<00:05:35.470> which<00:05:36.449> you<00:05:37.449> put<00:05:37.690> round

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
thee it's log roll which you put round

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.950 
thee it's log roll which you put round
the<00:05:38.139> outside<00:05:38.169> and<00:05:39.130> of<00:05:39.820> some<00:05:40.150> beds<00:05:40.389> if<00:05:40.630> you<00:05:40.780> want

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
the outside and of some beds if you want

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.589 
the outside and of some beds if you want
to<00:05:41.229> to<00:05:42.070> stop<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:42.400> soil<00:05:42.639> from<00:05:42.820> falling<00:05:43.240> out<00:05:43.360> so

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
to to stop the soil from falling out so

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.379 
to to stop the soil from falling out so
I've<00:05:44.530> got<00:05:44.680> a<00:05:44.710> few<00:05:44.889> of<00:05:45.009> these<00:05:45.159> left<00:05:45.219> over<00:05:45.880> so<00:05:46.360> I

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
I've got a few of these left over so I

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.070 
I've got a few of these left over so I
think<00:05:46.539> what<00:05:46.870> I<00:05:46.900> might<00:05:47.050> do<00:05:47.919> is<00:05:48.130> I<00:05:48.400> might<00:05:48.729> just

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
think what I might do is I might just

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.520 
think what I might do is I might just
pop<00:05:50.080> these<00:05:50.349> under<00:05:50.800> here<00:05:51.099> especially<00:05:52.030> those

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
pop these under here especially those

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.499 
pop these under here especially those
few<00:05:53.530> there<00:05:53.800> because<00:05:54.039> they<00:05:54.190> fit<00:05:54.610> just

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:55.509 
few there because they fit just

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.450 
few there because they fit just
perfectly<00:05:56.289> and<00:05:56.620> then<00:05:57.550> on<00:05:57.789> top<00:05:58.270> of<00:05:58.479> those<00:05:58.719> i

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
perfectly and then on top of those i

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.300 
perfectly and then on top of those i
think<00:06:00.460> i'm<00:06:00.610> going<00:06:00.789> to<00:06:00.849> put<00:06:01.060> these<00:06:01.210> green<00:06:01.599> bits

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
think i'm going to put these green bits

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.089 
think i'm going to put these green bits
now<00:06:03.310> you<00:06:03.370> don't<00:06:03.820> want<00:06:04.060> to<00:06:04.240> stuff<00:06:04.719> it<00:06:05.099> too

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
now you don't want to stuff it too

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.339 
now you don't want to stuff it too
tightly<00:06:06.639> because<00:06:06.969> if<00:06:07.330> you<00:06:07.659> stuff<00:06:07.960> it<00:06:07.990> too

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:08.349 
tightly because if you stuff it too

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.080 
tightly because if you stuff it too
tightly<00:06:08.820> then<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:10.030> bugs<00:06:10.330> can't<00:06:10.810> get<00:06:11.080> in<00:06:11.849> so<00:06:12.849> I

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
tightly then the bugs can't get in so I

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.810 
tightly then the bugs can't get in so I
didn't<00:06:13.719> pull<00:06:13.960> these<00:06:14.139> off<00:06:14.199> the<00:06:14.530> tree<00:06:14.800> they<00:06:15.759> were

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
didn't pull these off the tree they were

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.870 
didn't pull these off the tree they were
already<00:06:16.240> on<00:06:16.419> the<00:06:16.690> floor<00:06:16.930> so<00:06:17.919> I<00:06:18.280> just<00:06:18.699> went

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
already on the floor so I just went

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.230 
already on the floor so I just went
round<00:06:19.090> with<00:06:19.360> my<00:06:19.479> bag<00:06:19.690> I<00:06:20.669> think<00:06:21.669> everybody<00:06:22.060> must

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
round with my bag I think everybody must

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.629 
round with my bag I think everybody must
have<00:06:22.419> thought<00:06:22.509> I<00:06:22.630> was<00:06:22.659> a<00:06:22.810> bit<00:06:22.960> of<00:06:23.050> a<00:06:23.110> loon<00:06:23.289> and<00:06:23.639> I

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 
have thought I was a bit of a loon and I

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:30.089 
have thought I was a bit of a loon and I
just<00:06:24.849> picked<00:06:25.060> up<00:06:25.479> a<00:06:25.750> load<00:06:26.789> so<00:06:27.789> that's<00:06:28.770> nice<00:06:29.770> in

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
just picked up a load so that's nice in

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.589 
just picked up a load so that's nice in
there<00:06:30.310> oh<00:06:30.580> no<00:06:30.789> it<00:06:30.849> doesn't<00:06:31.090> have<00:06:31.180> a<00:06:31.210> couple<00:06:31.539> of

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
there oh no it doesn't have a couple of

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:35.670 
there oh no it doesn't have a couple of
bits<00:06:31.750> here<00:06:32.280> not<00:06:33.280> stuffed<00:06:33.729> too<00:06:34.060> tightly

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
bits here not stuffed too tightly

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.640 
bits here not stuffed too tightly
but<00:06:36.430> it<00:06:36.550> just<00:06:36.729> gives<00:06:37.000> them<00:06:37.180> some<00:06:37.780> places<00:06:38.050> to<00:06:38.440> go

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
but it just gives them some places to go

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.770 
but it just gives them some places to go
so<00:06:38.919> they<00:06:39.070> can<00:06:39.250> either<00:06:39.370> hide<00:06:39.699> underneath<00:06:40.150> here

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
so they can either hide underneath here

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.580 
so they can either hide underneath here
or<00:06:41.220> there<00:06:42.220> or<00:06:42.490> they<00:06:43.270> can<00:06:43.479> work<00:06:43.630> their<00:06:43.690> way<00:06:44.169> in

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
or there or they can work their way in

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.879 
or there or they can work their way in
between<00:06:44.949> these<00:06:45.400> these<00:06:46.180> leaves<00:06:46.660> here<00:06:47.199> and<00:06:47.380> find

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 
between these these leaves here and find

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.950 
between these these leaves here and find
a<00:06:48.009> nice<00:06:48.160> little<00:06:48.520> place<00:06:48.699> to<00:06:48.910> hide<00:06:49.120> or<00:06:49.509> if<00:06:49.780> they

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
a nice little place to hide or if they

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.279 
a nice little place to hide or if they
want<00:06:50.199> to<00:06:50.460> then<00:06:51.460> they<00:06:51.940> can<00:06:52.210> there's<00:06:52.990> a<00:06:53.080> little

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:53.289 
want to then they can there's a little

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:57.300 
want to then they can there's a little
bit<00:06:53.470> of<00:06:53.530> space<00:06:53.889> over<00:06:54.580> the<00:06:54.699> top<00:06:54.940> here<00:06:56.100> so<00:06:57.100> that

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
bit of space over the top here so that

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.060 
bit of space over the top here so that
they<00:06:57.460> can<00:06:57.789> find<00:06:58.570> a<00:06:58.720> little<00:06:58.870> home<00:06:59.229> there<00:06:59.560> so

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
they can find a little home there so

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.680 
they can find a little home there so

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
I'll fill the next section with

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.229
