00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.820
 Summit meeting of two German power limousines with the stuff to the sports car 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.879
 Shock it start 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.359
 The top model GÃ¤llivare he was short from the house Mercedes 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.919
 Give 60 years 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.859
 Porsche Panamera Turbo 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.279
 While these are the models of the e-class for a few generations 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.510
 Looking back, the researcher is a complete new development 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.820
 The sports car brand is on the way to new clientele with the Panamera 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.530
 Driving pleasure of this kind has its price of all that already costs in the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.719
 Basic equipment over one hundred thousand euros requires even more capital 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.260
 Industry he is around 30 thousand euros more expensive but she is with the portrait 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.540
 Slalom accepts he guested 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.290
 one can only be mixed advertising 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.060
 there was the world for me when the tax theme invest but 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.860
 that we are still very fluid 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.790
 the actors of the Zero ensures that is hardly moved even bows very much 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.620
 precise to measure 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.620
 Until now, Lollar is going to be seen 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.400
 Front strongly changes suspension 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.410
 he too has an active damper 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.900
 and that he's pretty accurate with his band Bon we want some knife researchers 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.300
 continue to conduct fine and is the bottom line and after him 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.300
 just as fast again Porsche which is already a surprise 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.720
 Porsche sets in this Panamera Turbo on the optional can brake 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.870
 they have very large slices and we can see quite well 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.250
 Six pistons then say the car now started therefore feeling that everyone 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.920
 Delay speed safely 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.880
 The special feature of the notch dance system is that they are also after the first stunt 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 Always great there and the pedal feeling on Twitter 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.399
 So even for float comes with extra charge comic brakes 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.599
 for Porsche they cost a good 8000 euros extra 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.360
 how could it be refilled and even after the zipping stunt 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.160
 still a very short braking distance 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.439
 and a high level of security 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.139
 compete for the sport 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.849
 the only four hundredths of a second 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.159
 the industry breaks the 100 the Mercedes needs only three tenths more 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.900
 at the engines of the dispute at least what that in the 2 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.929
 is both are v8 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:42.639
 only that the Porsche comes with four 8 liter engine capacity comes with two 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.929
 Goals on the whole thing pressured 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:48.809
 should come out 500 hp other way indicated 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:51.749
 So this motor of his saab nut has no gate bearing 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:54.910
 but has six times two liter capacity Red even higher 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.320
 and here come out OCHA huge 525 hp 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.320
 and rather aggravated 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.919
 as a special Panamera Turbo 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.549
 it was from Oberstreu 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.730
 he always likes to go up, so the surface and the surface decide 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:13.060
 enlarge from 90 cousin to 205 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.750
 Half the wind slipperiness and off to the 5 for that always 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.560
 stronger 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.270
 To increase the downforce on the rear axle, you can also use the whole Jak 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.270
 Press the button as it worked outside all the time 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.349
 in terms of comfort as the Mercedes e 63 my life a proper sedan then 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:34.989
 good space 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.309
 front and back 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:37.809
 rather, are 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:41.409
 and also a student balanced suspension front stripe Minden 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.379
 Air suspension adaptive damper 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.719
 only where the car the new season will be so much on it 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.949
 with relatively thinner which obviously did not make even short bumps good 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.949
 none much better than hoped 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:03.270
 the logo of the Panamera s Sport was that's what you should have 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.750
 The seats offer plenty of lateral support are nicely upholstered and this car 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.820
 offers well-being music with the biggest first sports car flying what you look at 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.820
 we can ask 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:25.790
 Photo Matz comprehensive story 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.840
 the Mercedes win this competition 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.289
 Although it worked but still clearly went Porsche 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.909
 1130 secure but the somewhat balanced car was at his 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:40.009
 Limousines from sets or even on the larger range of assistance systems he 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.399
 drives easily very comfortable has a lot of power to ensure the statements 

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:48.090
 or picks up the Porsche, the expressive car is the first Audi a2 Geis 

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:51.889
 another car rtr has drive and its tuning back to Martin in 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.289
 Marginal areas a bit easier to master special Seekirchen me 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.159
 If he wants to handle the Porsche Mittermeier then drove very clear in the 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.610
 advantage
