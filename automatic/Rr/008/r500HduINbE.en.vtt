conditions<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.910> think<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:28.019> really

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
conditions I think it's really

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.359 
conditions I think it's really
impressive<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.800> think<00:00:28.949> we've<00:00:29.039> spent<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.340> last

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
impressive I think we've spent the last

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.769 
impressive I think we've spent the last
two-and-a-half<00:00:29.760> years<00:00:30.150> developing<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
two-and-a-half years developing a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.209 
two-and-a-half years developing a
demonstrator<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.769> able<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.070> that

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
demonstrator and to be able to get that

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.000 
demonstrator and to be able to get that
out<00:00:32.430> onto<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.149> public<00:00:33.300> highway<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.739> show

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
out onto the public highway and show

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.740 
out onto the public highway and show
it'll<00:00:35.190> actually<00:00:35.340> work<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.059> really<00:00:36.450> really

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
it'll actually work it is really really

it'll actually work it is really really
impressive<00:00:37.050> I'm<00:00:37.500> very<00:00:37.680> pleased<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
impressive I'm very pleased and the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.440 
impressive I'm very pleased and the
advantages<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.809> Road<00:00:39.989> train<00:00:40.020> are<00:00:40.530> many

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
advantages of a Road train are many

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.790 
advantages of a Road train are many
convenient<00:00:42.450> since<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.079> can<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.350> something<00:00:43.680> else

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
convenient since I can do something else

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.119 
convenient since I can do something else
that<00:00:44.070> than<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.579> actual<00:00:44.879> driving<00:00:45.680> safe<00:00:46.680> since

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that than the actual driving safe since

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
that than the actual driving safe since
the<00:00:47.219> system<00:00:47.610> will<00:00:47.820> take<00:00:48.000> care<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> driving

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the system will take care of the driving

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.229 
the system will take care of the driving
it<00:00:49.020> will<00:00:49.230> eliminate<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.160> human<00:00:50.489> errors<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
it will eliminate the human errors and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.740 
it will eliminate the human errors and
then<00:00:51.960> fuel-efficient<00:00:52.829> since<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.969> use<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> minor

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
then fuel-efficient since we use a minor

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.959 
then fuel-efficient since we use a minor
gas<00:00:55.140> size<00:00:55.469> between<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.129> vehicles<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.789> will

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
gas size between the vehicles we will

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.880 
gas size between the vehicles we will
reduce<00:00:57.360> air<00:00:57.660> drag<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.199> thereby<00:00:58.590> fuel

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
reduce air drag and thereby fuel

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.270 
reduce air drag and thereby fuel
consumption<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:01.020> aim<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.680> test<00:01:01.980> just

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
consumption the aim of this test just

consumption the aim of this test just
outside<00:01:02.670> Barcelona<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:04.019> acquire<00:01:04.379> more

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
controlled by somebody else I think it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.779 
controlled by somebody else I think it
gets<00:01:55.049> easier<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:55.890> time<00:01:56.130> progresses<00:01:56.520> and

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
gets easier as time progresses and

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.160 
gets easier as time progresses and
people<00:01:57.090> become<00:01:57.390> more<00:01:57.569> familiar<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.049> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
technology and they accept it more I

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.200 
technology and they accept it more I
think<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.369> generations<00:02:02.369> progressed<00:02:03.000> they

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
think as generations progressed they

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.630 
think as generations progressed they
become<00:02:03.539> more<00:02:03.719> familiar<00:02:04.080> with<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.409> more

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
become more familiar with it and more

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.020 
become more familiar with it and more
accepting<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.729> it
