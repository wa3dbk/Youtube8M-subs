00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.389
 finally we had the opportunity 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.860
 make a new borderlands game one 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.179
 to try los angeles 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.889
 the boss of the responsible 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.900
 developer studios gearbox randy 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.180
 pitchford refers to battle bonn as 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.010
 a hero shooter what he meant exactly 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.640
 we have the suggestion date 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.640
 found out 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.620
 even if the developers are with battle born 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.660
 a completely new brand and so too 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.220
 create a completely new world of games 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.720
 The game is not one of hand 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.940
 a similarity with the 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.980
 borderlands series especially in the of 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.899
 We played a co- op campaign in the US 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.850
 try the last galactic star 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.269
 from an eerie threat to 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.220
 rescue 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.079
 that's how series production already looks like 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.909
 to be noticed that also battle born 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.699
 on a brightly colored cel shading optics 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.559
 sets and also has the ego perspective 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.939
 the new project with basket grenade 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.010
 meant in contrast to borderlands 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:06.250
 stand in the coming hero shoot the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.420
 so-called battle points in the center 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.100
 in total, the 25 will be the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.960
 completely different playable characters 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.700
 to give in the game 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.930
 here we play with nico the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.280
 battle born with the distinctive 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.259
 fly agaric is the healer of 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.330
 Five- headed hero troop with one 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.009
 Strahl, he can heal his mates 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.430
 but also with German throw the opponent 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.430
 damage 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.800
 All battle points are next to hers 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.140
 weapons but also special skills 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.240
 so can the clown soldier oscar maike 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.090
 camouflage yourself for example and look around 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.530
 to counter possible 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.030
 with his assault rifle is also a 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.010
 dangerous fighter on middle 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.900
 distance and can also with his 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.470
 grenade launcher equal to several enemies 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.470
 turn off once 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.890
 the story in the coop campaign becomes 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.870
 Similar to in borderlands in funny 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.920
 told dialogues 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.320
 There are also some 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.000
 elaborate inter-sequences give the 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.590
 But the biggest difference is that we are ourselves 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.420
 in the battle do not farm in an open 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.760
 move game world but gradually 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.330
 do missions and so new heroes 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.330
 unlock 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.380
 apropos heroes here we play straight 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.180
 with the robot gentleman marquis he 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.799
 belongs to the sharp-shooter class and has 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.959
 according to task the enemies 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.630
 good distance before turning off 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.010
 his mates on the collar go out 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.930
 especially on the weaker team members 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.730
 you should pay attention because the ki pretty much 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.019
 smart acts and likes to 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.019
 the healer de troupe goes off 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.629
 another big difference too 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.280
 Borderlands is that your city ​​is massive 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.560
 invited a lot together 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.420
 experience gets within one 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.260
 mission which in our case is around 15 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.590
 was minutes long 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.730
 you rise well and like ten levels 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.110
 when the level comes up that comes 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.940
 helix system for use 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.280
 You can always choose from two different ones 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.019
 choose a talent and so on 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.849
 yours holds bigger magazines for the 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.190
 weapons or higher damage values 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:31.720
 spend the upgrades expire however 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.430
 after completing a level the fourth 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.590
 we played the class were the 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.030
 Fighters can use these battle points 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.459
 with their swords and axes was like that 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.140
 should cause a lot of damage 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.260
 But absolutely a salutary to her near 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.260
 to have 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.370
 if it gets scarce then 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.260
 her also called sweetheart in the 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.150
 Collect mission and spend 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.520
 with them you can for example this 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.290
 powers with a shield or 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.040
 at certain points on the map for 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.180
 build rainstorms 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.800
 The developers told us that the 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.660
 charts also outside the mission one 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.980
 Purpose will have what exactly 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.970
 Unfortunately, they meant us 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.920
 Do not tell 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.200
 you 're pretty likely sony 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.130
 Permanently level characters or new ones 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.130
 Costumes freedom 

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:34.349
 battle born has one right here 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:36.149
 leave a good impression 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.159
 although the campaign without an open 

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:39.389
 world of games and also to the ten years 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.219
 the weapons of the borderlands 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.469
 you feel relieved thanks to the 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:46.619
 pop- colored comic graphics as a fan of coop 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:48.659
 grenade same home also that helix 

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.799
 system has us very well because you 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.389
 ascend with the many levels 

00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:53.059
 within a mission tactics 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.959
 can adapt to his team 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.789
 as it is in the end with the 

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:58.529
 long term motivation without any load and 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.329
 permanent level ascents looks like 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:02.189
 we can based on the at play termins 

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:04.139
 Of course, say bad there tell me 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:06.569
 we'd rather let ourselves be surprised 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.299
 as well as the three multiplayer modes 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.279
 which we could not try yet 

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:13.259
 until the release in the late year you are allowed 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:16.999
 So still some news 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.999
 look forward to things battle born
