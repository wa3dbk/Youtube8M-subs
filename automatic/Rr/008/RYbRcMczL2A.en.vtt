teaching yourself just being careful and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:44.350 
teaching yourself just being careful and
it<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:38.010> take<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.480> two<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.510> three<00:00:39.840> days

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.740 

you<00:00:44.780> ready<00:00:44.990> to<00:00:45.110> start<00:00:46.270> turning<00:00:47.270> on<00:00:47.480> the

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
you ready to start turning on the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.360 
you ready to start turning on the
different<00:00:48.140> components<00:00:48.650> and<00:00:48.740> pairing<00:00:49.130> it<00:00:49.220> you

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
different components and pairing it you

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.180 
different components and pairing it you
pair<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:50.450> aircraft<00:00:51.140> with<00:00:51.830> the<00:00:51.950> ground

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
pair the aircraft with the ground

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.820 
pair the aircraft with the ground
control<00:00:52.580> station<00:00:53.120> just<00:00:54.110> about<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.470> same<00:00:54.650> way

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
control station just about the same way

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.310 
control station just about the same way
you<00:00:54.890> pair<00:00:55.340> your<00:00:55.370> cell<00:00:55.850> phone<00:00:56.200> with<00:00:57.200> the

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
you pair your cell phone with the

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.229 
you pair your cell phone with the
Bluetooth<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:59.710> so<00:01:00.710> if<00:01:00.920> it<00:01:01.040> loses<00:01:01.220> my<00:01:01.790> if<00:01:02.120> I

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
Bluetooth and so if it loses my if I

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.210 
Bluetooth and so if it loses my if I
lose<00:01:02.420> my<00:01:02.570> ability<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:03.020> command<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:03.800> aircraft

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
lose my ability to command the aircraft

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.050 
lose my ability to command the aircraft
it<00:01:04.850> would<00:01:05.000> automatically<00:01:05.710> ascend<00:01:06.710> to<00:01:07.550> 300

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
it would automatically ascend to 300

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.060 
it would automatically ascend to 300
feet<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.570> then<00:01:08.780> it<00:01:08.900> will<00:01:09.050> return<00:01:09.410> back<00:01:09.770> to

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
feet and then it will return back to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:30.840 
feet and then it will return back to
this<00:01:10.160> specific<00:01:10.700> location

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.790 

so<00:01:31.450> first<00:01:31.780> we're<00:01:31.990> gonna<00:01:32.050> go<00:01:32.320> over<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.560> take<00:01:32.770> a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
so first we're gonna go over and take a

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.550 
so first we're gonna go over and take a
look<00:01:32.920> at<00:01:33.190> those<00:01:33.990> truck<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.930> just<00:01:38.290> do<00:01:38.440> an

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
look at those truck and just do an

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.770 
look at those truck and just do an
inspection<00:01:38.860> over<00:01:39.340> there<00:01:39.610> go<00:01:40.540> ahead<00:01:40.660> and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
inspection over there go ahead and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.190 
inspection over there go ahead and
descend<00:01:41.380> around<00:01:41.860> those<00:01:42.100> trucks<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
descend around those trucks the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.320 
descend around those trucks the
information<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:44.950> on<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.400> GPS<00:01:45.880> could<00:01:46.119> be

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
information that on the GPS could be

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.750 
information that on the GPS could be
distributed<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.410> pinpoint<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.070> location<00:01:48.100> for

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
distributed to pinpoint the location for

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.990 
distributed to pinpoint the location for
rescuers<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.570> sure<00:01:49.780> can<00:01:50.050> you<00:01:50.590> you<00:01:51.520> can<00:01:51.700> see

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
rescuers and sure can you you can see

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.330 
rescuers and sure can you you can see
that<00:01:52.360> this<00:01:53.290> geo-reference<00:01:53.890> that's<00:01:54.100> here<00:01:54.280> at

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
that this geo-reference that's here at

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.850 
that this geo-reference that's here at
the<00:01:54.430> bottom<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:55.690> area<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.110> actually<00:01:56.470> where

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
the bottom the area is actually where

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
the bottom the area is actually where
the<00:01:57.340> vehicle<00:01:57.790> is<00:01:58.000> located<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:59.310> you<00:02:00.310> can

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
the vehicle is located and you can

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.779 
the vehicle is located and you can
actually<00:02:01.630> stream<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:02.860> from<00:02:03.280> this<00:02:03.460> device

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
actually stream that from this device

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.430 
actually stream that from this device
wireless<00:02:04.360> if<00:02:04.509> you<00:02:04.630> attach<00:02:04.869> a<00:02:04.990> wireless<00:02:05.289> device

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
wireless if you attach a wireless device

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.359 
wireless if you attach a wireless device
so<00:02:06.430> that<00:02:07.140> rescuers<00:02:08.140> other<00:02:08.470> command<00:02:09.039> centers

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
so that rescuers other command centers

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:30.369 
so that rescuers other command centers
can<00:02:09.550> monitor<00:02:10.030> this<00:02:10.350> real-time

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.449 

psycho<00:02:31.379> through<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.680> cameras<00:02:32.099> as<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.340> can

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
psycho through the cameras as you can

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.770 
psycho through the cameras as you can
see<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.780> that's<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.140> good<00:02:34.800> camera<00:02:35.099> right<00:02:35.250> there

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.150 

and<00:02:39.320> then<00:02:39.440> there's<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.680> forty<00:02:39.920> five-degree

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
and then there's a forty five-degree

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.710 
and then there's a forty five-degree
camera<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:40.670> then<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.910> sub-element<00:02:41.180> camera<00:02:41.630> of

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
camera and then a sub-element camera of

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.850 
camera and then a sub-element camera of
the<00:02:41.780> construction<00:02:42.200> site<00:02:44.470> over<00:02:45.470> here<00:02:45.620> we<00:02:45.710> have

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
the construction site over here we have

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.310 
the construction site over here we have
the<00:02:46.070> battery<00:02:46.610> life<00:02:46.870> here<00:02:47.870> we<00:02:47.990> have<00:02:48.140> the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
the battery life here we have the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.320 
the battery life here we have the
instrumentation<00:02:48.830> telling<00:02:49.280> us<00:02:49.370> 171<00:02:49.790> meters

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
instrumentation telling us 171 meters

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.710 
instrumentation telling us 171 meters
away<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:51.820> 137<00:02:52.820> feet<00:02:52.970> in<00:02:53.090> altitude<00:02:53.210> and

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
away it is 137 feet in altitude and

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.050 
away it is 137 feet in altitude and
those<00:02:54.650> little<00:02:54.890> lines<00:02:55.250> if<00:02:55.550> you<00:02:55.580> can<00:02:55.760> tell<00:02:55.940> them

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
those little lines if you can tell them

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.610 
those little lines if you can tell them
apart<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.630> tells<00:02:56.840> us<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.050> orientation<00:02:57.560> of

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
apart that tells us the orientation of

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.209 
apart that tells us the orientation of
