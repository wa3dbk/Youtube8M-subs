00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.900
dude sold me a walking stick

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.500
and then he said "aright lets race..."

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.700
I said "You fucker...

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.500
...I would like to turn this in for a running stick..now."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I road the toy train here...it's 1/54th actual size

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.100
The AmTrak takes a hour to get here.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.300
It took me 54 hours...

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That joke's in it's..."beginning stages"

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.000
Which means...about to be thrown the fuck out!

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.500
I'm a motivational speaker

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
On some days...

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.000
Other days I'm like "Fuckin GIVE UP"

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We'll do these jokes man...these jokes...

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Fuck...

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.000
Karate belts are loose...you never notice that.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.500
I got a black...

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.000
I got a belt on that holds up my pants.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.000
And my pants have belt loops that hold up my belt.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.000
What the fuck is really goin on down there?!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Who is the REAL hero?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.700
I had a cab driver drive me here backwards.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.300
The fucker owed me thirtyseven Fiftahh. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.600
I...I saw a commercial that said: "Forget everything you know about slip covers!"

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.700
So I did...

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.500
...and it was a load off my mind.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And then the commercial tried to sell slip covers...

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.000
...but I didn't know what the fuck they were!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I got cold sores...I put carmex on 'em...

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.000
...carmex is supposed to heal cold sores.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.000
I don't know if it does...but it will make them shiny and more noticable.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You would think, at the Wonder Bread factory they're starting to get used to it.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.000
They're not as in wonder as they used to be.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.000
They're like: "Ahhh Right...we get it...

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.000
...Every morning we put dough into the oven and the shit comes out...

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.000
...and we cut it and put it in a wrapper.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.000
...WONDERFUL."

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.000
What you got to say man?

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.000
[ding] [ding] [ding]

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.000
you're not very...very conversational are you?

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.000
I gonna shovel the dumb jokes off the stage...

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.000
...that I have told...I'm gonna need something bigger.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.000
This is a good crowd I can tell...you know why?

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.000
Cuz there more than 18 of you.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.500
You know what a bad crowd is?

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.000
One dude here...and then another dude four miles away.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
[HA HA HA] That's fuckin funny you missed out on a good one.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Awwwmmm I called the hotel operator...but then I didn't want to talk to her so I said...

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
"Sorry wrong number"

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.500
But you know what her number was?

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.000
ZERO

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.000
What number does she think I'm tryin to dial when Zero's the wrong number?

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.000
"Well I was trying to call EIGHT....

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.000
...But fuckit I went too low...

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
...I know someone who's number is EIGHT...I DO lady.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.000
Don't even challenge me on that.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.600
They live in a very small town.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800
I called the hotel operator she said

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.200
"How can I direct your call?"

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.800
Well you could say "ACTION" 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.800
and I will begin to dial

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.500
Then when I say "GOODBYE"

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.000
you can yell "CUT"

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.000
and if you want you can wear a beret and knickers

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.500
I got a door deal here...I'm working for 50 percent of the door and then...

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.000
...tomorrow I'm working for 50 percent of the door..

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.000
and then on Monday I'm gonna have a door.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
See I was in some town lastnight...they were laughing at everyting.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.000
That's right...nawww you guys are a good crowd there's alot of clowns...alright.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Don't worry 'bout it bitch.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.000
I got a lamp in my hotel room it has a three way light bulb in it.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.000
If you don't know a lightbulb's threeway it fucks with your head.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
You go to turn it off and it KEEPS GITTIN BRIGHTER!!

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and "God damnit lightbulb that's the exact opposite of what I wanted you to do!"

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.800
And then you turn it again, it gets brighter once more!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
"I will fuckin break you...

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.500
...Smartass lightbulb...

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.000
...Thomas Eddison would be rolling over in his grave...

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
...You're a son of a bitch you know that?"

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I almost got my teeth whitened but I said "fuck that I'll just get a tan instead".

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So I had to go to the tanning booth...

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.000
Which is like a phone booth except you cannot contact anybody

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Unless you're stuck then you go "HELP"

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I love cottage cheese...that's why I want to try other dwelling cheeses too.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.000
I mean I wanna try "split level enty cheese"

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.500
Or maybe studio apartment cheese

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Or if I'm feeling adventurous...mobile home cheese.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.800
Dr. scholl makes foot products

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.800
And he's a doctor which means he went to school for a long time

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
But it dosen't take alot to figure out that stepping on a cushion will be more comfortable

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.000
That's one easy diagnosis

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Cuz I'd have bought that shit from a Mr. scholl

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Maybe even a Senior Scholl

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I think a rotisserie is like a really morbid ferris wheel for chickens

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.000
It's a fuck up piece of machinery

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.000
We will take the chicken...impale it...and then rotate it.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.000
And I'll be damned if I'm not hungry!

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.000
Cuz spinning chicken carcassas make my mouth water

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.200
I like the dizzy chickens!

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.000
Kittens play with yarn...they bat it around.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.500
But what they're relly saying is

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.500
"I can't knit...get this away from me!"

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
"You make the sweater motherfucker!"

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.200
That's a foul mouthed kitten.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.200
I like sandwiches...but I hate sandwiches at New York Deli's 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.000
too much fuckin meat on the sandwich

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.000
it's like a cow with a cracker on either side

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.900
"What would you like sir?"

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.700
"a pastrami sandwich"

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.500
"anything else?"

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.000
yeah...a loaf of bread and some orher people

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.700
what kind of bread?

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.000
rye bread...no bananna bread...do you have that?

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800
What kind of cheese?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.800
Cottage!

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Get the fuck out!

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.000
I'm not making a bananna bread, pastrami, cottage cheese sandwich.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.000
that would just really ruin my reputation
