00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.360 
one quick thing before I end this video
um<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:12.030> new<00:03:12.629> iMovie<00:03:12.989> just<00:03:13.319> came<00:03:13.500> out<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.069> think

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
um a new iMovie just came out so I think

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.160 
um a new iMovie just came out so I think
I<00:03:14.670> might<00:03:14.909> be<00:03:14.940> doing<00:03:15.180> tutorials<00:03:15.510> over<00:03:15.900> that

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
I might be doing tutorials over that

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.370 
I might be doing tutorials over that
instead<00:03:16.530> I'm<00:03:16.799> not<00:03:17.310> sure<00:03:17.639> I<00:03:18.359> think<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.959> is<00:03:19.169> it

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
instead I'm not sure I think that is it

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.740 
instead I'm not sure I think that is it
so<00:03:19.620> again<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.160> gave<00:03:20.370> any<00:03:20.609> questions<00:03:21.269> I<00:03:21.569> did
