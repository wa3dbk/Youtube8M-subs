00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.130
 food from McDonald's that is well them 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.470
 A sandwich is a large object, etc.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.710

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:29.010
 first video I did a review of a hamburger well 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.410
 probably the easiest burger in 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.649
 mcdonalds nothing special here 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:41.910
 and how would I do now in review and 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:43.530
 one more warning if 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.480
 will you buy that miss magnus always 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.770
 see with you napkins because without 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.430
 they don't matter so let's start the review 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:56.160
 hamburger this is such a small burger 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.090
 with pray it fits in your hands very much 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:05.850
 normally it costs about 30 rubles bought 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:09.750
 I mean, I bought it on December 7, 2013 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.570
 years and now we will look at 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.830
 first look at the very same 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.119
 short but not a box on just this 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.400
 a piece of paper as they say which she 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.240
 wrapped i mean life on business 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.950
 hamburger we understand it here 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.650
 drawn icon mcdonalds and near 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.700
 here you can see the region is not visible now 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.810
 near to you but still in the circle it 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.150
 as if the trademark is excellent as 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.280
 This is usually the motto of each 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.259
 the burger has one cas9 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.259
 so there is so it can be called and 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.000
 written painted such a beautiful stick 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.000
 and described as one hundred percent that I love 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.750
 hamburger appeared visibility if i 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.840
 memory serves 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.550
 cardstoke she appeared magnus it was 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.700
 committed this is a long story in general 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:15.040
 Now I take it to you so the market 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.350
 look napkins and here we will 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.690
 all watch 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.930
 crawl him not open here with us 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.780
 2009 was written McDonald and drawn 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.459
 icon that you need to remove everything in the trash 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.989
 container 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.860
 Further it is written here well, I can see 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.739
 a little close 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.260
 means 8 energy values 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.870
 energy value of 13 percent 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:47.560
 body calories sixty five calories and 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:49.390
 as if so to say here at 2255 a 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.600
 here are two thousand so it's not clear how 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.660
 that means protein 17 percent 12 grams 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.650
 fats 13 percent 9 grams carbohydrates 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.519
 mean a 10 percent 30 grams and salt to 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.200
 6 percent it has become three-tenths grams 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.239
 but it was all for adults 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.010
 people now we will look for children 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.690
 from 4 to 7 years 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:17.549
 it means for them it goes like 1600 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.590
 kilocalories but a little different here 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:24.730
 wrote a calorie of 16 percent d 75 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.920
 kilocalorie proteins 22 percent fat 15 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.650
 percent carbohydrates mount on too 15 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.110
 percent and salt 43 percent much 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.170
 more than in adults Well 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.650
 open and appear before us 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:42.070
 hamburger that's how he's like 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.060
 small and such a book soft 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:49.209
 it seems without sesame but from to soft 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.239
 I do not know well, just hang us up appetizing 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.160
 Of course this is not the most delicious tasty 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.740
 thing and 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.250
 her about the very product or burger capris not 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.710
 I can 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.640
 but only they, but there are people who 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.150
 eating one hamburger 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.130
 not fed up and by the way I also belong to 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.830
 so i cant eat one 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.240
 gambling eat that is if i'm bad 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.960
 as hungry as a wolf 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:21.150
 then we must start from above means 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:26.220
 here we see such a little loaf 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.110
 roasted on a roll we see leaks in 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.780
 day I don't know what it is but it seems 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.260
 cheese but from the idea here the cheese should not 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:38.340
 be it a hamburger but don't know here 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.230
 it doesn't know either onions or something else well in 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.940
 In general, we will set aside the side here. 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.090
 see 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:51.110
 athlete beef on her 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:54.180
 on it we see again flow and ketchup 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.440
 Again, there is not clear that it's cheese or both 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.300
 I do not know 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:04.470
 onions and pickled this whole cucumber 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:08.430
 in ketchup see here also as summer and 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.990
 under what is nothing, too, goes 5 bows 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.480
 so beautifully roasted 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:17.930
 so now i must try 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.259
 headquarters hamburger 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.830
 give it a grade that is from school from 1 to 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.870
 ten 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.470
 well now let's try 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.470
 hamburger 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.020
 but 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:49.550
 tasty hamburger is not the end of course 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:54.060
 but he is delicious 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:57.150
 Further assessment I will give him that is, if the heat 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.720
 not places beat mage and stuff of course 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:06.930
 score then two or three but at 10 points 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:09.330
 the scale I will give them a grade of 9 for 30 rubles 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:14.840
 burger that's so neat 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:18.660
 beautiful and tasty, that's probably all 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:23.300
 means subscribe to the channel put 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.300
 likes and good luck for now
