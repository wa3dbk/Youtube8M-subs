hi this is Johnny pine staying to show
you<00:00:02.129> how<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.370> make<00:00:02.490> trampolines<00:00:03.149> in<00:00:03.360> game

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
you how to make trampolines in game

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.990 
you how to make trampolines in game
maker<00:00:03.810> I've<00:00:04.680> already<00:00:05.040> got<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.460> sprites<00:00:05.819> all

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
maker I've already got the sprites all

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.360 
maker I've already got the sprites all
done<00:00:06.210> so<00:00:06.680> now<00:00:07.680> we're<00:00:07.830> just<00:00:07.859> going<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.099> work<00:00:08.250> on

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
done so now we're just going to work on

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.129 
done so now we're just going to work on
the<00:00:08.429> objects<00:00:08.910> let's<00:00:09.330> create<00:00:09.599> an<00:00:09.719> object<00:00:09.840> of

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
the objects let's create an object of

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.680 
the objects let's create an object of
the<00:00:10.349> trampoline<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.040> already<00:00:11.790> got<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.179> done

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.090 

there's<00:00:15.690> nothing<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.170> one<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:16.980> don't

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
there's nothing in that one so you don't

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.769 
there's nothing in that one so you don't
have<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.279> worry<00:00:17.430> about<00:00:17.550> any<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:17.970> put<00:00:18.660> in

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
have to worry about any of that put in

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.680 
have to worry about any of that put in
the<00:00:18.869> player<00:00:19.199> event<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.070> are<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.369> one

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.670 

lines<00:00:23.990> with<00:00:24.620> the<00:00:24.710> trampoline<00:00:25.690> then<00:00:26.690> we're

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
lines with the trampoline then we're

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.080 
lines with the trampoline then we're
going<00:00:27.770> to<00:00:27.830> want<00:00:28.010> to<00:00:28.100> test<00:00:28.400> if<00:00:28.580> one<00:00:28.880> of<00:00:29.000> the

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
going to want to test if one of the

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.520 
going to want to test if one of the
expressions<00:00:29.630> is<00:00:29.780> true<00:00:29.960> because<00:00:30.140> we<00:00:30.320> want<00:00:30.500> to

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
expressions is true because we want to

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.730 
expressions is true because we want to
make<00:00:30.590> it<00:00:30.710> go<00:00:30.980> on<00:00:31.100> the<00:00:31.190> top<00:00:31.400> of<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:31.610> Traveling

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:32.740 
make it go on the top of the Traveling

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.690 
make it go on the top of the Traveling
so<00:00:33.740> if

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
so if

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.250 
so if
expression<00:00:35.150> is<00:00:35.210> true<00:00:36.010> this<00:00:37.270> visuals<00:00:38.270> vertical

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
expression is true this visuals vertical

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.150 
expression is true this visuals vertical
speed<00:00:39.440> oh<00:00:39.860> I<00:00:40.430> don't<00:00:40.940> know<00:00:41.030> I<00:00:41.060> just<00:00:42.100> and<00:00:43.270> then

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
speed oh I don't know I just and then

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.280 
speed oh I don't know I just and then
we'll<00:00:46.160> have<00:00:46.910> a<00:00:46.970> move<00:00:47.330> thing

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
we'll have a move thing

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.020 
we'll have a move thing
to<00:00:50.290> move<00:00:50.500> fixed<00:00:50.860> up<00:00:51.010> words<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.700> then<00:00:51.850> however

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
to move fixed up words and then however

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.990 
to move fixed up words and then however
you<00:00:52.390> want<00:00:52.600> it<00:00:52.660> to<00:00:52.810> be<00:00:52.990> plus<00:00:53.470> I'll<00:00:54.430> just<00:00:54.850> like

Jessie this is the plot
tutorial<00:01:25.160> where<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:25.340> got<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:25.640> code

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.980 

gay<00:01:29.009> make<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.430> tutorials<00:01:29.939> instead<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.359> finding

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
gay make it tutorials instead of finding

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.599 
gay make it tutorials instead of finding
them<00:01:31.140> online<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:31.710> finding<00:01:32.039> them<00:01:32.130> online<00:01:32.399> you

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
them online but finding them online you

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.010 
them online but finding them online you
have<00:01:32.700> voicing<00:01:33.149> and<00:01:33.359> you<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.810> know<00:01:33.899> what

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
have voicing and you can know what

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:46.429 
have voicing and you can know what
you're<00:01:34.140> doing<00:01:37.189> see<00:01:39.020> that's<00:01:40.020> pretty<00:01:40.200> good<00:01:45.439> now

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
you're doing see that's pretty good now

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.100 
you're doing see that's pretty good now
I'm<00:01:46.530> going<00:01:46.679> to<00:01:46.740> get<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.189> little<00:01:47.460> bit<00:01:47.670> more

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
I'm going to get it a little bit more

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.800 
I'm going to get it a little bit more
challenging<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:51.000> creative<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.600> we're

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
challenging in the creative and we're

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.899 
challenging in the creative and we're
going<00:01:51.959> to<00:01:51.990> want<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> set<00:01:52.709> the<00:01:52.860> sprite<00:01:53.159> image<00:01:54.049> to

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
going to want to set the sprite image to

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.219 
going to want to set the sprite image to
trampoline<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> speed<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.780> zero<00:01:57.810> so

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
trampoline but have the speed is zero so

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.389 
trampoline but have the speed is zero so
it<00:01:58.439> doesn't<00:01:58.679> go<00:01:58.770> through<00:01:58.799> an<00:01:59.069> animation

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
it doesn't go through an animation

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.819 
it doesn't go through an animation
because<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.539> animation<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.679> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
because I have the animation of one the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.419 
because I have the animation of one the
player<00:02:02.009> hits<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.459> it'll<00:02:02.700> bounce<00:02:02.849> and<00:02:04.429> then

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
player hits it it'll bounce and then

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.669 
player hits it it'll bounce and then
we're<00:02:05.849> going<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.030> want<00:02:06.239> crap<00:02:07.110> I'm<00:02:07.319> screw<00:02:07.530> this

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
we're going to want crap I'm screw this

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:14.600 
we're going to want crap I'm screw this
up<00:02:10.579> when<00:02:11.579> when<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.209> animation<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.870> over<00:02:13.610> we

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
up when when the animation is over we

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.360 
up when when the animation is over we
want<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.970> change<00:02:15.150> back

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
want to change back

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.849 
want to change back
you

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:27.910 

but<00:02:25.659> no<00:02:26.659> flavor<00:02:26.930> but<00:02:27.140> when<00:02:27.319> he<00:02:27.409> collides<00:02:27.769> with

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
but no flavor but when he collides with

but no flavor but when he collides with
it

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.790 

I<00:02:31.180> don't<00:02:31.930> know<00:02:32.019> if<00:02:32.110> we<00:02:32.230> need<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.410> do<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.650> in<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
I don't know if we need to do it in the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.309 
I don't know if we need to do it in the
trampoline<00:02:33.220> event<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.790> other<00:02:33.849> one<00:02:34.090> but<00:02:34.480> you

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
trampoline event the other one but you

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.559 
trampoline event the other one but you
want<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.680> other<00:02:35.709> object<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.060> Trampas<00:02:37.420> of

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
want the other object for the Trampas of

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.150 
want the other object for the Trampas of
the<00:02:37.629> trampoline<00:02:38.050> will<00:02:38.260> change<00:02:38.500> will<00:02:38.890> not

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
the trampoline will change will not

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:47.820 
the trampoline will change will not
animate<00:02:42.330> let's<00:02:43.330> say

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.260 

you
