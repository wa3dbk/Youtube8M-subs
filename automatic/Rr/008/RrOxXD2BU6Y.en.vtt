official cosmos for year we were rumored

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.210 
official cosmos for year we were rumored
to<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.939> were<00:00:21.510> supposed<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.990> get<00:00:22.170> one<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.769> first

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
to I were supposed to get one at first

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.859 
to I were supposed to get one at first
in<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.109> first<00:00:25.109> classics<00:00:25.769> series<00:00:26.630> but<00:00:27.630> that

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
in the first classics series but that

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.290 
in the first classics series but that
was<00:00:28.170> cancelled<00:00:29.070> after<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.670> little<00:00:29.849> bit<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
was cancelled after a little bit and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.209 
was cancelled after a little bit and
then<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> next<00:00:31.260> time<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.800> was<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.160> were

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
then the next time it was we were

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.540 
then the next time it was we were
supposed<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> get<00:00:32.759> one<00:00:32.969> was<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.450> titanium<00:00:34.550> and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
supposed to get one was in titanium and

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.610 
supposed to get one was in titanium and
we<00:00:35.940> actually<00:00:36.120> saw<00:00:36.420> prototypes<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.410> one

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
we actually saw prototypes of that one

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
we actually saw prototypes of that one
at<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.950> show<00:00:38.430> i<00:00:38.460> think<00:00:38.610> i<00:00:38.940> forget<00:00:39.210> what<00:00:39.329> shell

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
at a show i think i forget what shell

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.319 
at a show i think i forget what shell
but<00:00:39.809> along<00:00:40.290> with<00:00:40.320> RC<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.190> shock<00:00:41.460> wave<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
but along with RC in shock wave and the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.950 
but along with RC in shock wave and the
cosmos<00:00:42.809> from<00:00:43.260> titanium<00:00:43.980> look<00:00:44.219> pretty<00:00:44.489> cool

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
cosmos from titanium look pretty cool

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.770 
cosmos from titanium look pretty cool
with<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.140> i<00:00:46.350> was<00:00:46.530> ultimately<00:00:46.950> cancelled<00:00:47.780> so

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
with it i was ultimately cancelled so

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.170 
with it i was ultimately cancelled so
now<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.860> i<00:00:49.890> guess<00:00:50.129> they<00:00:50.309> were<00:00:50.370> determined<00:00:51.149> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
now that i guess they were determined to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.970 
now that i guess they were determined to
get<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> cosmos<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.559> ended<00:00:52.920> up

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
get it as a cosmos so they ended up

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.090 
get it as a cosmos so they ended up
giving<00:00:53.730> us<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> universe<00:00:54.719> alania<00:00:55.170> legends

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
giving us in the universe alania legends

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.900 
giving us in the universe alania legends
class<00:00:56.960> cosmos<00:00:57.960> instead<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.559> larger<00:00:59.039> deluxe

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
class cosmos instead of a larger deluxe

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.319 
class cosmos instead of a larger deluxe
or<00:01:00.239> titanium<00:01:00.809> size<00:01:01.199> figure<00:01:01.789> which<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> per

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
or titanium size figure which is a per

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.130 
or titanium size figure which is a per
this<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.690> appropriate<00:01:04.260> because<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:05.519> original

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
this is appropriate because the original

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.800 
this is appropriate because the original
cosmos<00:01:07.140> was<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> mini<00:01:08.340> bot<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.170> this<00:01:10.170> uh<00:01:11.810> looks

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
cosmos was a mini bot and this uh looks

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.570 
cosmos was a mini bot and this uh looks
pretty<00:01:13.080> much<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> same<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.070> which<00:01:14.310> one

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
pretty much the same as is which one

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.910 
pretty much the same as is which one
that<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.780> however<00:01:16.140> know<00:01:16.530> what<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that I do not however know what the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.359 
that I do not however know what the
first<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:17.880> had<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.560> sloppy<00:01:19.560> paint<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
first one had this a sloppy paint on it

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.740 
first one had this a sloppy paint on it
I<00:01:21.470> mean<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.590> does<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.400> paint<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:24.119> guessing

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
I mean this does that paint I'm guessing

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.020 
I mean this does that paint I'm guessing
is<00:01:24.869> supposed<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> alien<00:01:26.400> language<00:01:26.850> or

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
is supposed to be a alien language or

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.569 
is supposed to be a alien language or
something<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:28.290> make<00:01:28.320> them<00:01:28.590> look<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.009> UFO

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
something to make them look like a UFO

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.969 
something to make them look like a UFO
but<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.409> kind<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> looks<00:01:31.920> like

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
but it really just kind of looks like

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.670 
but it really just kind of looks like
someone<00:01:32.369> took<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.299> silver<00:01:34.020> marker<00:01:34.439> and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
someone took like a a silver marker and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
someone took like a a silver marker and
just<00:01:35.640> drew<00:01:36.210> some<00:01:36.479> gibberish<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:38.369> really

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
just drew some gibberish on it it really

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.530 
just drew some gibberish on it it really
doesn't<00:01:39.360> look<00:01:39.390> all<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.840> cool<00:01:40.320> at<00:01:40.439> all<00:01:40.590> I

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
doesn't look all that cool at all I

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.880 
doesn't look all that cool at all I
think<00:01:42.540> would<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:42.840> looked<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.500> lot<00:01:43.619> better

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
think would have looked a lot better

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.149 
think would have looked a lot better
they<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.689> you<00:01:45.689> know<00:01:45.720> paint<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.200> tighter<00:01:46.680> like

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
they just you know paint a tighter like

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.069 
they just you know paint a tighter like
this<00:01:47.340> entire<00:01:47.670> ring<00:01:47.909> here<00:01:48.149> silver<00:01:48.630> or<00:01:48.810> just

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
this entire ring here silver or just

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.249 
this entire ring here silver or just
left<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.770> green<00:01:50.210> that's<00:01:51.210> time<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> strike<00:01:52.049> it

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
left it green that's time to strike it

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.209 
left it green that's time to strike it
looks<00:01:52.470> very<00:01:52.979> cheap<00:01:54.560> other<00:01:55.560> than<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.950> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
looks very cheap other than that the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.600 
looks very cheap other than that the
rest<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.579> its<00:01:56.759> pretty<00:01:57.060> clean<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:58.009> always<00:01:59.009> liked

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
rest of its pretty clean I always liked

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.539 
rest of its pretty clean I always liked
the<00:01:59.640> idea<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.210> Cosmos<00:02:00.750> because<00:02:01.079> poor<00:02:02.070> idea<00:02:02.250> of

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
the idea of Cosmos because poor idea of

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.389 
the idea of Cosmos because poor idea of
a<00:02:02.899> transformer<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.619> odd<00:02:04.770> especially<00:02:05.009> on

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
a transformer the odd especially on

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.059 
a transformer the odd especially on

react<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.730> usually<00:02:27.660> very<00:02:27.870> scared<00:02:28.260> or<00:02:29.270> you'll

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
react and usually very scared or you'll

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.450 
react and usually very scared or you'll
draw<00:02:30.570> your<00:02:30.870> attention<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.560> either<00:02:32.190> way

it's<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.730> really<00:02:33.150> good<00:02:33.450> disguise<00:02:34.280> but

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
it's not really good disguise but

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.120 
it's not really good disguise but
whatever<00:02:36.240> it's<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.930> pretty<00:02:37.770> fun<00:02:38.010> looking<00:02:40.130> the

articulation than the original one does

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.170 
articulation than the original one does
because<00:03:51.300> i<00:03:51.330> like<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.500> warpath<00:03:53.040> one<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.700> front

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
because i like the warpath one the front

of the vehicle just kind of fold it down

to four mark a you know you know leg or
I<00:04:01.830> had<00:04:02.040> absolutely<00:04:02.250> no<00:04:02.580> articulation<00:04:03.410> but<00:04:04.410> for

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
I had absolutely no articulation but for

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.710 
I had absolutely no articulation but for
the<00:04:04.680> most<00:04:04.890> part<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.280> does<00:04:05.550> look<00:04:06.470> just<00:04:07.470> like<00:04:10.100> is

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
the most part it does look just like is

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.479 
the most part it does look just like is
g1<00:04:12.720> counterpart<00:04:13.320> except<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:14.160> time<00:04:14.370> he

g1 counterpart except this time he

g1 counterpart except this time he
really<00:04:14.730> doesn't<00:04:15.090> have<00:04:15.320> fingers<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:17.190> original

really doesn't have fingers the original
one<00:04:17.730> had<00:04:17.940> like<00:04:17.970> three<00:04:18.540> tubes<00:04:18.810> on<00:04:19.109> each<00:04:19.260> side<00:04:19.530> to

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
one had like three tubes on each side to

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.480 
one had like three tubes on each side to
kind<00:04:20.250> of<00:04:20.280> resemble<00:04:20.700> fingers<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:23.280> head<00:04:23.460> does

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
kind of resemble fingers the head does

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.590 
kind of resemble fingers the head does
look

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
look

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.460 
look
surprise<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.380> like<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:26.600> first<00:04:27.600> one<00:04:27.720> but<00:04:28.200> they

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
surprise I like the first one but they

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.200 
surprise I like the first one but they
add<00:04:28.770> some<00:04:29.490> eyes<00:04:29.670> than<00:04:30.390> there<00:04:30.660> this<00:04:30.900> time<00:04:32.210> but

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
add some eyes than there this time but

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.670 
add some eyes than there this time but
it<00:04:33.450> is<00:04:33.600> really<00:04:34.170> cool<00:04:35.570> he's<00:04:36.570> probably<00:04:36.930> my<00:04:37.200> least

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
it is really cool he's probably my least

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.010 
it is really cool he's probably my least
favorite<00:04:38.370> or<00:04:38.820> maybe<00:04:39.120> not<00:04:39.240> because<00:04:39.750> I<00:04:39.840> don't

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
favorite or maybe not because I don't

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.600 
favorite or maybe not because I don't
have<00:04:40.080> Rodimus<00:04:40.590> yet<00:04:40.830> I'm<00:04:41.070> probably<00:04:41.220> not<00:04:41.430> going

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
have Rodimus yet I'm probably not going

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.100 
have Rodimus yet I'm probably not going
to<00:04:41.670> get<00:04:41.820> him<00:04:41.910> cuz<00:04:42.120> I<00:04:42.210> don't<00:04:42.540> like<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.840> look<00:04:42.990> at

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
to get him cuz I don't like the look at

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.900 
to get him cuz I don't like the look at
that<00:04:43.230> one<00:04:44.510> but<00:04:45.920> he's<00:04:46.920> probably<00:04:47.130> one<00:04:47.640> of<00:04:47.670> the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
that one but he's probably one of the

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.720 
that one but he's probably one of the
weaker<00:04:48.420> figures<00:04:49.200> from<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.470> new<00:04:49.730> 25th

weaker figures from the new 25th

anniversary legend line but that doesn't

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.260 
anniversary legend line but that doesn't
make<00:04:53.220> him<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.460> bad<00:04:53.490> figure<00:04:54.230> anyway<00:04:55.230> he<00:04:55.410> just

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
make him a bad figure anyway he just

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.970 
make him a bad figure anyway he just
just<00:04:57.270> did<00:04:57.540> this<00:04:57.750> paint<00:04:58.170> here<00:04:58.440> just<00:04:58.680> really

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
just did this paint here just really

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.150 
just did this paint here just really
distracts<00:04:59.700> I<00:04:59.960> think<00:05:00.960> from<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.710> figure<00:05:01.950> just

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
distracts I think from the figure just

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.660 

some<00:05:09.560> elbow<00:05:10.560> articulation<00:05:11.250> probably<00:05:11.580> would

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
some elbow articulation probably would

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.090 
some elbow articulation probably would
have<00:05:11.730> been<00:05:11.880> good<00:05:12.030> too<00:05:12.270> but<00:05:13.200> way<00:05:13.500> it's<00:05:13.950> a

have been good too but way it's a
legends<00:05:14.430> figure<00:05:14.670> we<00:05:14.850> can't<00:05:15.090> really<00:05:15.210> expect

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
legends figure we can't really expect

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.930 
legends figure we can't really expect
too<00:05:16.860> much<00:05:17.010> from<00:05:17.070> it<00:05:17.480> but<00:05:18.480> still<00:05:19.700> it's<00:05:20.700> the

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
too much from it but still it's the

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.680 
too much from it but still it's the
first<00:05:21.480> cosmos<00:05:22.260> figure<00:05:22.590> that<00:05:22.800> we've<00:05:22.950> had<00:05:23.130> in<00:05:23.690> 25

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
first cosmos figure that we've had in 25

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.490 
first cosmos figure that we've had in 25
years<00:05:25.010> so<00:05:26.010> I<00:05:26.750> definitely<00:05:27.750> recommend<00:05:28.050> them

years so I definitely recommend them

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.270 
years so I definitely recommend them
just<00:05:28.710> for<00:05:28.920> the<00:05:29.870> nostalgia<00:05:30.870> of<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.140> value<00:05:32.040> of

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280
