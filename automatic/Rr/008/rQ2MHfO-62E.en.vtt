00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.960
 [Music] 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.960
 what is the memory that you keep from 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.280
 service but how did you know him 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.290
 frozen known in his room when I 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.089
 wanted to start doing contests there 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.010
 invited me to come and give me 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.750
 advice 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.390
 despite his notoriety it was someone from 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.680
 very simple very very accessible 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.050
 always ready to help and have 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.359
 lavished his knowledge it was 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.900
 someone very nice very very 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.540
 generous 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.969
 that's why he unfortunately 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.579
 sadly ends with some 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.350
 minimum income while brewed 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.840
 still a lot of money through 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.730
 of his career he was always ready to 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.579
 to render a service to pay the benefits 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.950
 of each other and he spent 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.360
 more than he won for me it was 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.520
 more a friend it was a big spain 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.620
 [Music] 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.000
 it is a friend who has demonstrated his 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.440
 qualities that follow our department 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.750
 all over the world so it's a 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.500
 man we all appreciated because we 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.990
 had inverted 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.170
 I was lucky to win one or 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.930
 twice it's a very laid-back man 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.330
 calm and who when talking about sport 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.280
 with him you put in trust and 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.700
 explain a little bit about his career 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.479
 I think he had qualities 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.759
 weimar 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.600
 I would say high level and 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.600
 simplicity too

 Hi 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.710
 [Music] 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:57.009
 [Music] 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:04.669
 his story has nurtured our stories and 

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:06.829
 for me who was a teenager when 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.899
 I saw for the first time at the 

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:12.679
 television serge when I saw it 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:14.839
 also in game exhibitions I'm 

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:15.729
 am identified to him because he was 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:18.469
 in success 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:21.229
 he was strong then physically he 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:23.119
 was strong but by his victories he 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.099
 was these successes he was strong too 

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:26.899
 for us and us who needed 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.269
 identify us with characters 

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:32.659
 positive to strong characters and well 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:35.779
 serge nubret was among the two three 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:38.689
 first Caribbean who made me want 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:40.849
 that they let me believe he was 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:42.709
 possible to succeed and it was not 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.419
 a decoy since we all got together 

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:46.399
 beaten and we all tried to do 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.409
 our hole in this in this country and in 

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:50.269
 this life is really but few people 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.719
 can imagine when one is 

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:56.839
 antilles in France in the 70s 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:58.009
 and when we are struggling with models 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:59.239
 to two models of people who we 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.219
 look like who have the same story as 

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:03.229
 we how much when we look 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:04.699
 elsewhere to find a model and 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.289
 when there is one like that 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:09.110
 present to you who is strong and who 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:12.699
 respect and well we build my 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.699
 month serge allowed me to build myself
