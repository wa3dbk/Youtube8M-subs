00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.540
 wen that comes with everything inside 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.390
 from my heart since I did not choose 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.880
 make a journalistic program very 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.420
 less a program east police cu 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.800
 but even in a program like 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.890
 It's a party 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.270
 reality has been pushing themes 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.610
 terrible as the one we are 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.520
 living today 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.820
 Unfortunately we could not today. 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.010
 for there a beautiful program that was already 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.909
 ready because one of our dancers 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:56.890
 more cheerful 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:58.989
 the one dearest to the children was 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.729
 brutally murdered with one shot 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.449
 by the back 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:07.299
 How are we going to do a program? 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.890
 as cheerful as we were going to live 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.799
 together with you 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.979
 This pain and what are we going to do? 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:18.790
 to stop everything and become aware of the 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.940
 The size of the barbaria we managed to 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.750
 is here and I think we 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.870
 have managed to stop our pain or 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.910
 Then and with her, to go and take 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:37.300
 awareness for something to change 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.760
 for what happened with dg and also 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.720
 for tragedies like this not 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.810
 continue to occur with thousands of 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.390
 young people living on the outskirts of all 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.450
 the cities of Brazil because the greater 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.830
 violence is impotence. 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.990
 It seems that what you have to do is so 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.360
 big is so much you have to do that 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.490
 you can not do anything this impotence 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.409
 a violence against the people we have 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.120
 have a good way to break this 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.990
 feeling of powerlessness 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.950
 his nickname was g 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.730
 his name was douglas rafael da silva 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.730
 pear tree
