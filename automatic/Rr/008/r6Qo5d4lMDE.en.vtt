00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.859
 people i am a lot of ash comes to one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.859
 another episode of secrets 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.860
 Tourias today is about a whole 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.269
 special item namely the dwarfs 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.130
 key we see here in one 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.940
 inventory and i want you today 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.220
 show what this old one does 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.449
 that's pretty special in the year 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.890
 this item will drop randomly into the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.519
 scooper fright lips 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.920
 This area is directly below the norm 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.800
 Capital get brack about this directly 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.989
 area south of it and everywhere in here 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.190
 this area can dwarf this area 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.510
 key accidentally hit by opponents 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.570
 i think so what is there in total 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.340
 Just play two times that one 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.160
 can become random item 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.789
 and then you can do something then 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.949
 open something 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.930
 an example is as I said here the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.710
 are the shovel stretches level him 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.930
 made a total of 2 im stellen where 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.520
 you shovel this shovel this 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.780
 can use dwarf keys around it 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.309
 I also have two pieces here 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.000
 inventory I have already collected here 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.189
 the drop trade is yes I say so 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.350
 lala 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.500
 i have this the complete area 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.000
 here to 100 percent so from 0% to 100 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.020
 percent, I believe 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.630
 a total of four keys found so 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.049
 the drop raid is not too high though 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.250
 also not totally low so it is 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.759
 possible in any case the things too 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.860
 Find 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.530
 Unfortunately, there are also series bound here 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.540
 That's why I'm doing this today 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.130
 video again with my clearly there me 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.049
 namely two more keys on the bank 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.100
 had and both of them character 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.799
 souls are bound 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.840
 Well, the first place where we this 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.270
 It is possible to use branches with keys 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.270
 pretty far in here at this plant 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.729
 southwest of the map in chapel castle 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.630
 that there is a small shovel city 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.520
 it is also a 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.049
 a place called 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.130
 black powder the grave 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.039
 You get that place of interest as soon as possible 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.490
 Just go to the door of the grave 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.289
 going 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.759
 However, you can still grab the grave 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.080
 open and you need it as I said 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.830
 this dwarf key 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.390
 we have him in the inventory we run 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.120
 now just the whole way one man 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.250
 Run over here as fast as possible 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.069
 in there and then go to this one 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.470
 grab here what will that be the door then 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.849
 and with this dwarf key though 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.500
 you can get there then we can 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.480
 even open the grave 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.390
 It then usually starts then 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.230
 any event with a veteran 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.230
 Opponent on the 11th 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.890
 when I break down too fast 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.660
 do not make it here 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.910
 then usually starts an event here 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.700
 for example, a veteran destroyed 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.010
 aldrin and always one here at the end 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.570
 box open and get even one more 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.480
 small reward for having this 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.700
 found grave and opened and 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.790
 Now I'll give you that fast 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.130
 second degree show so there we are again 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.870
 the second grave is not far away 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.420
 from the first grave and something 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.890
 northeast here in the village of heaven summit 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.640
 the waymark nearby is gray 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.230
 Street 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.300
 Incidentally, I do not have any 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.360
 Wegmarke said best here stole 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.540
 just then broke south here 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.790
 go along and then come here 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.940
 as I said now here gray street 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.720
 Here is also directly the entrance to 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.940
 in this area get in 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.260
 and then we already find that here 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.430
 grave that is here now in my case 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.340
 already open that means here was 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.470
 apparently some player right in front 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.770
 I already have the opponent here 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:53.210
 I'm breaking my life too 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.310
 faster and then you can with here 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.780
 the same with the same trick too 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.000
 again with a dwarf key here 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.760
 open this door then come here one 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.410
 veteran kobold I think that's one 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.690
 shadow leprechaun or an ice leprechaun or 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.340
 something like that even smaller coupon can 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.620
 out and then we come here too 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.130
 again to a chest 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.990
 however, there is a small one here 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.519
 Bug only as a small note sometimes 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.510
 sometimes they stand here like they already did with me 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.519
 the doors open 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.550
 And yet you can not get in here 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.080
 that is because then this door 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.450
 here again has reset and again 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.340
 approached but somehow visible 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.570
 not received that is the stands 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.890
 then still open and you can here 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.870
 also purely look but you can go in 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.240
 still not because the door counts as 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.440
 but one came here anyway 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.060
 the dwarf key in the 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.580
 Inventory you can still do this 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.140
 then opening this door again was sports 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.710
 the veteran opponent does not come in one man 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.690
 but still and canoeing and then 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.220
 all people can get in there and themselves 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.570
 it's a pity that I'll give you that now 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.160
 can not show here because the door is straight 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.630
 already open but we have to 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.280
 the first door seen what that looks like 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.650
 and how that works are definitely 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.390
 These two are where you are then 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.890
 actually times this dwarf key 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.630
 otherwise you can not use it 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.400
 Notice how to get these second keys 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.770
 especially as they also in the whole 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.419
 just drop randomly around it 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.040
 maybe some of you knew that 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.479
 not yet that actually not so 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.490
 Great mystery is what you find 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.229
 relatively quickly out yourself if you 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.729
 Simply the area to 100 percent off 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.290
 but it does not matter 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.220
 I definitely say goodbye 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.020
 these words 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.020
 and we see the day again people
