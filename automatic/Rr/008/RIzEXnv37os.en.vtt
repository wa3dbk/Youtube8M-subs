1 damage the accuracy goes up by to the
fire<00:01:35.590> it<00:01:35.740> goes<00:01:35.920> down<00:01:36.070> by<00:01:36.310> one<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:36.820> the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
fire it goes down by one and the

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.969 
fire it goes down by one and the
handling<00:01:37.570> goes<00:01:37.810> down<00:01:38.079> by<00:01:38.290> two<00:01:38.350> but<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.829> main

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
handling goes down by two but the main

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.289 
handling goes down by two but the main
thing<00:01:39.009> that<00:01:39.189> I<00:01:39.340> look<00:01:39.549> out<00:01:39.670> this<00:01:39.820> weapon<00:01:40.180> is<00:01:40.240> the

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
thing that I look out this weapon is the

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.660 
thing that I look out this weapon is the
damage<00:01:40.689> and<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.079> accuracy<00:01:41.500> because<00:01:42.070> this<00:01:42.520> is

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
damage and the accuracy because this is

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.580 
damage and the accuracy because this is
a<00:01:42.700> semi-automatic<00:01:43.450> weapon<00:01:44.049> and<00:01:44.229> even<00:01:44.500> though

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
a semi-automatic weapon and even though

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.800 
a semi-automatic weapon and even though
the<00:01:44.710> fire<00:01:44.979> it<00:01:45.159> is<00:01:45.250> going<00:01:45.549> down<00:01:45.850> by<00:01:46.180> one<00:01:46.540> it

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
the fire it is going down by one it

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.020 
the fire it is going down by one it
makes<00:01:47.290> up<00:01:47.470> for<00:01:47.649> its<00:01:47.799> damage<00:01:48.219> and<00:01:48.399> accuracy<00:01:48.969> and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
makes up for its damage and accuracy and

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.819 
makes up for its damage and accuracy and
I<00:01:49.149> have<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.450> second<00:01:49.780> elite<00:01:50.020> variation<00:01:50.680> of

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
I have the second elite variation of

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.370 
I have the second elite variation of
this<00:01:51.130> weapon<00:01:51.399> which<00:01:52.240> is<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.570> eager<00:01:52.990> line<00:01:53.170> I've

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
this weapon which is the eager line I've

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.139 
this weapon which is the eager line I've
got<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.680> say<00:01:53.799> it<00:01:54.009> doesn't<00:01:54.310> know<00:01:54.729> where<00:01:54.969> near

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
got to say it doesn't know where near

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.420 
got to say it doesn't know where near
compete<00:01:55.509> towards<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.500> Eclipse<00:01:56.829> even<00:01:57.189> though

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
compete towards the Eclipse even though

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.580 
compete towards the Eclipse even though
are<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:58.030> eagle<00:01:58.299> eye<00:01:58.390> has<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.600> faster<00:01:59.140> fire<00:01:59.439> rate

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
are the eagle eye has a faster fire rate

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.230 
are the eagle eye has a faster fire rate
I<00:01:59.740> feel<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.070> it<00:02:00.189> doesn't<00:02:00.520> kill<00:02:00.729> people<00:02:00.759> as

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
I feel that it doesn't kill people as

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.719 
I feel that it doesn't kill people as
easy<00:02:01.840> as<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.649> Eclipse<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.430> be<00:02:03.520> honest

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
easy as the Eclipse and to be honest

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.609 
easy as the Eclipse and to be honest
this<00:02:03.789> weapon<00:02:04.119> is<00:02:04.210> not<00:02:04.509> the<00:02:04.659> best<00:02:04.899> but<00:02:05.170> as<00:02:05.500> soon

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
this weapon is not the best but as soon

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.109 
this weapon is not the best but as soon
as<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:05.829> use<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.130> Eclipse<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.670> find<00:02:06.909> it<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.090> very

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
as you use the Eclipse I find it a very

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.270 
as you use the Eclipse I find it a very
fun<00:02:07.659> weapon<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.259> use<00:02:08.289> moving<00:02:08.860> over<00:02:09.070> to<00:02:09.190> the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
fun weapon to use moving over to the

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.859 
fun weapon to use moving over to the
next<00:02:09.369> assault<00:02:09.700> rifle<00:02:10.060> in<00:02:10.270> our<00:02:10.420> list<00:02:10.690> we're
