00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.550
 friends from between networks 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.469
 between networks my dear Alexander Palace 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.320
 we are between networks and now yes just what 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.150
 you have on your back a network that 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.400
 you know and I do not know very well how you do 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.470
 that are funny yes yes as well 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.750
 what we are in between networks in what 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.430
 which is the one in achieving more more important 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.470
 most sacred for a correct match 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.840
 well it's actually from the line towards 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.600
 not when you go inside to pick up 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.189
 the ball there yes there is already sealed l then 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.570
 It is no longer so sacred and leaving 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.090
 thanks for being here between times a 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.000
 I share quickly, good, what 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.570
 that has us right in this place 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.170
 is the presentation of these gloves 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.030
 quickly how important is the 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.900
 glove for the goalkeeper touched you for having 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.940
 50 if ever 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.520
 good to the best in the beginning when 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.770
 a good one 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.420
 there are basic things and sometimes no no 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.490
 they have money to buy the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.320
 gloves and suddenly you have to 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.100
 play like that bald but not 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.570
 fortunately, almost all my part of my 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.570
 race from basic forces and 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.750
 lower divisions and professional I've 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.680
 had I had gloves but good 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.620
 Now the difference is that 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.960
 fortunately, they already sponsor me and 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.479
 well now we are celebrating an event 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.520
 with reus and my new sponsor and good 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.560
 We are very happy with the quality 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.780
 of the glove we know that it is practically 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.570
 the most important tool for 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.610
 archers is a complement of you and you 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.920
 It helps a lot to prevent 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.590
 balls go when the goal 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.570
 now you have the fortune as you said that 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.149
 they give you the gloves you do not have to go to 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.470
 buy gloves ok but one thing 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.979
 a usual question maybe be a 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.570
 goalkeeper and I missed my gloves 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.490
 after using them so long nativity 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.580
 they smell like any sportswear 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.250
 not how often 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:02.420
 they wash some gloves I do not know if they wash 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:05.750
 it would be more of the question that you have to 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.360
 take care that it is a material that costs us 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.210
 work to be able to acquire and good is 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.480
 they really require some care 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.250
 You can wear a glove for a week 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.920
 and afterwards I think it's convenient 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.700
 be able to wash it because because if the sweat 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.770
 and everyone sometimes sometimes smells first 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.550
 part of this interview with the pikolin 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.520
 palaces keeper I already say they have 31 32 a 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.190
 our big vote favor because I was 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.950
 bernal that lasted 60 and in the goal of 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.160
 pumas yes and had a good year not talked 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.150
 a lot this is the season out there 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.060
 2005 was said and I think that this 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.880
 season will have to retire bernal and 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.950
 it gave another very good season I champion 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.709
 with cougars then I was securing each 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.260
 time more truth was taking hold in their 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.570
 last years not in its early years not 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.790
 in the last years already after the 30 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.270
 it was when when it was cataloged 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.220
 good 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.870
 I remember a few years was the subject of many 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.080
 sergio Bernal reviews because he had 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.940
 very childish mistakes then did not give 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.290
 space for the portals to debut 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.450
 that came behind him between them 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.330
 Alejandro Pallas and see how many and 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.070
 so many years but very close as 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.340
 nobody close to the national team 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.020
 sergio bernal because they live in front of 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.320
 front where trains the selection of 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:32.720
 Sergio Bernal opposite seriously 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.190
 always very close near but but 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.830
 he was never there 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.200
 notice that although it looks like a question 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.760
 silly but real or like washing the 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.680
 gloves or when you have both already 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.960
 they sponsor and for me they do not sponsor me 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:53.990
 well I say I have 13 sports case 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:55.610
 everything but yes the same gloves 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.830
 be willy ski 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.770
 yes yes it is used with two goalposts once 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.220
 if it is equal in good 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.470
 [Music] 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.140
 then we are talking about this we are going to 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.720
 see the second part here where the 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.380
 question of social networks although 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:18.549
 this part that tends mostly 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.549
 because it is said that forward 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.810
 that social networks use so much 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.190
 obviously we follow the club we continue to 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.199
 many players you have also 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.220
 twitter account because you both use 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:33.740
 so then look at the truth I do not 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.449
 I use both the account because this one 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.820
 sometimes you do not get me in trouble then 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.669
 problems from where the AlavÃ©s of 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.220
 I better say really when I speak it is 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.810
 for the fans of cougars for that 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.690
 great decision that has always supported me 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.910
 then it is for to thank you but 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.400
 I think he's commenting on many things 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.590
 I'm not that fan of but but always the 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.300
 trend in internet issue in 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.080
 generally use much internet you 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.840
 whole you see the criticism that is made 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.870
 who make the means to the club to you 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.500
 his spirit has received a time that I 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.630
 I gave you a tube 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.240
 [Music] 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:17.150
 because if we want to fight knife one 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.580
 as a professional you have to be 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.160
 mentally strong to receive everything 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.690
 kind of criticism and believe me I hear 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.370
 more the criticisms than the praise does not 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.610
 like to listen to allergies because 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.500
 times I breathe so always if you 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.630
 criticize in bonn in good plan is always 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.610
 good to receive good because the mistakes 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.890
 especially the criticisms that are not 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.840
 praise is where one more learns no no 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.300
 notice that more than you I confess 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.100
 that if I saw you with a tube in hotels not 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.100
 I'm going to deny it because I'm with you but 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:49.070
 more than you make your bernal age for 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.800
 I was always a mediocre match 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.170
 ha ha ha good wave and good person 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.969
 now I have everything in its place nobody 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.059
 is talking about the person 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:01.039
 I believe that every goalkeeper has his 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:02.899
 style every party has its moment and 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.149
 that a goalkeeper has his numbers and I 

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:06.079
 I think that sergio bernal, at least in 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:09.529
 pumas 

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:10.699
 It is a great reference and it is practically 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:13.269
 He is the one with the best numbers 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:15.919
 of all the history my dear pikolin 

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:19.129
 then serious social networks there 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.629
 they are more or less given the networks 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.909
 social so if you want to look for the 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:25.159
 person but do not have your account 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:27.939
 We can give it to twitter 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:30.019
 team there is no epic 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:33.169
 then when I really do 

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:35.659
 Thank you and congratulations on for your time 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:38.059
 you remain in the ownership I repeat it went away 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:40.069
 mario carrillo then all everything is 

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:42.110
 arranged that it continue like this and that cougars for 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:44.599
 cause of you of the great hobby that 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.149
 has to lift and continue to follow 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:49.369
 up to where you can hopefully yes yes 

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:51.529
 yes thank you very much and it is that we are in 

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:53.479
 network working one hundred percent to the hundred 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:54.600
 percent to be in a good 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:58.940
 work 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.940
 from the three to the actions thanks 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.720
 [Music] 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.710
 very good alejandro wave for the 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:10.159
 association the one that is not doing it 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:12.710
 nothing bad is not doing it too 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:14.330
 He was the one who gave them a 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.870
 epoch to pikolin one 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:21.500
 it seems to me that capitalism is given to us 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:23.560
 in the center but they have errors and they do not 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:29.050
 several mistakes there is the future 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:31.030
 but the goal and not the 1 and the performance 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.720
 in cougars 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.720
 very well 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.280
 like the alebrijes porter normal man 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.380
 and normal normal normal 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.600
 it does not dazzle me suddenly it stinks of more 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.220
 but it's very very good besides it's 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.900
 nice is nice because of the outside 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.900
 the photo is a picture that we are going to see 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.580
 just a survey because what 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.440
 Do you think otherwise? 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.090
 that what matters is what the 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.100
 people we did a survey of course 

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.530
 that says palaces alexander is a good 

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.139
 goalkeeper so easy and simple the 

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:04.139
 Question 

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:07.110
 and most people say no 

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:10.949
 but there is a 20 in case there is a 20% long 

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:12.689
 and family palace there are all these 

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:15.360
 surveys you can find them 

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:17.370
 on facebook I encourage there are all these 

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.479
 surveys that we still have a couple 

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.479
 more in this program
