00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.300
 yes 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.840
 if not 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.840
 here 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.830
 the truth 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.890
 Now we go to jobs and welcome to 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.470
 a new video with two news two 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.960
 pretty interesting news about 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.829
 all by themselves quite interesting the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.940
 first comes from assassin's creed 3 as 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.920
 and comment on the previous video 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.079
 enrolled will not have rm I started so 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.309
 It will be totally free to install 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.720
 and playing with an original key without 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.059
 limits without any kind of limitation of 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.379
 accounts to activate the miners but not 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.050
 is this what I want to comment on what 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.989
 I want to comment is the armor the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.080
 armor mohawk of assassins creed 3 a 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.409
 armor here good to be able we can see 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.360
 a concept arts on the screen you see are 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.629
 a design of how it could be in the 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.720
 armor is not a kind of let's say 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.970
 I sketch a sketch of an idea of how it 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.070
 is going to make the armor and well 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.290
 probably look very similar 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.890
 similar ones mature to a very 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.210
 striking that it can be color in some 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.679
 they make crystals and I was already telling you 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.109
 a memory that was so attentive and 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.210
 pretty and beautiful and one appeared 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:30.390
 species 10 clear with the peak since 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.249
 and on his head but still 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.840
 quite hot that is a pass of 

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:34.969
 armor 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.520
 and take everything as if to live and carry a 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:40.009
 bow of transfer in the back to which 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.130
 does it mean yes they can be used 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.259
 weapons at a distance like archery bows 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.409
 to the sandy and kris 3 may not be 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.729
 reveal it so turn image or it can be 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.049
 just be a fist of the 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.939
 One's guards serve for nothing more than 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.179
 to decorate because I 've never seen no 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.909
 feel and a bow the power to use arcs 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.219
 and those that I have seen 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.479
 and is that basically 6 christer is a 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.929
 game totally different from the 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.799
 earlier so it's based more on the 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:12.799
 war in the USA so that America does not 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:16.240
 sustain that war in 1600 if I do not 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:19.030
 I'm wrong I think so but good 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.130
 and we've seen in gameplay it's day 63 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.660
 home cause that good in uncle by 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.490
 example goes you just an uncle that good with 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.950
 a shotgun from the old one and he steals it 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.590
 and welcomes him and uses him against him shoots him 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.060
 and things like that and all that's why I say something of 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.580
 different because before it was limited 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.050
 using weapons bearing the 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.500
 character though then in those writings 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.570
 then you could buy armor weapons 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.430
 time for people to buy them but 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.950
 improve them adding attributes and things of 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.650
 those in the review for example but without 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.900
 But they are and cris 3 the power to steal 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.400
 weapons out there and use it no longer 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.920
 only melee weapons and 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.500
 none of each type but also to 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.810
 distance type shotguns shotguns 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.940
 the old and bow and crossbow and bone more 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.980
 an authentic past then few 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.080
 balls for leagues fans included 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.300
 super super super fan the let's go 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.130
 flip with this armor obviously this one 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.560
 it will not be with which he will start characters 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.660
 but this telephone but the barrier 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.520
 passed a pass an ethics based 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.860
 armor up until I like it and 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.360
 Look, I'm not a very, very fan rates 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.430
 incredible like I like enough is 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.780
 incredible fact I was doing guided 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.880
 more good here and stop uploading 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.880
 because I do not get tired a little 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:39.670
 but I 'm going to finish I do not know when but 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:43.180
