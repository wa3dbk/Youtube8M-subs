00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.040
 remove youtube people I am free trade 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.709
 I bring you a theory for minecraft of 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.350
 version 0 point 12.1 and good that 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.330
 ask theory I have come bringing you 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.980
 the theory of dragon leander guys that 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.460
 we will ask ourselves when will it come out 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.710
 because of course the winner is already in plan 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.330
 point in plan that will come out that no more 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.789
 or less to weather information by 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.520
 the heads and two other skeletons that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.770
 they put themselves in the leader then I think 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.930
 how clear you will have to leave before what 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.590
 has been the dragon before the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.830
 weather is not known but little 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.660
 little since they are increasing little things 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.850
 that they leave knowing that they are going to put 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.590
 the in the dragon will put it not 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.810
 know if they are going to put it in the steel point 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.550
 12.1 I think that I do not think they are going to 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.960
 put in front of what has been the widder 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.300
 guys because that's the thing about 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.370
 skeletons and so on then you have left 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.470
 little to put the we there because of course 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.480
 that they have to put it fixed then 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.460
 turn when they finish putting the winter 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.659
 they will put what is being the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.180
 dragon leander they are going to go 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.850
 speciation I'm more like to put it 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.030
 because I do not think they do half and half 2 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.360
 half wilder 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.270
 of the dragon in plan 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.880
 that they have to finish first the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.160
 weather to make it perfect in the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.350
 versions come out perfect put the we of 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.780
 invoke it and then then in the next 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.540
 versions and invoke what is being 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.420
 the dragon the in perfect and others I 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.370
 I think my opinion you should know the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.560
 setback that would have imposed to sell dragon 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.840
 before and then the weather but of course 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.790
 put the leader and then the leader there 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.640
 winner skeletons and so on 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.220
 it depends as we see it guys 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.560
 then tell you that I do not think it comes out 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.670
 the steel point 12.1 because I think it's going to 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.190
 leave the weather but for the version 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.400
 1.0 I think they're going to put it 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.930
 the leander dragon for that version and 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.280
 Nothing to tell me in the comments 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.790
 that you liked this theory what 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.610
 you think of this theory yes 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.229
 it's true or not in plan that they're going to put 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.570
 before security that he in the dragon and 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.970
 other guys and if you would like that 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.680
 I did more theories and also if I 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.450
 I wish there was the dragon leander 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.280
 in minecraft pin guys then then 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.100
