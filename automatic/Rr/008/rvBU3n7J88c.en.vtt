your<00:03:20.390> body<00:03:20.540> guessing<00:03:20.750> you're<00:03:21.650> naturally

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
your body guessing you're naturally

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.830 
your body guessing you're naturally
playing<00:03:22.550> with<00:03:22.700> your<00:03:22.850> hormonal<00:03:23.209> levels<00:03:23.570> in<00:03:23.750> a

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
playing with your hormonal levels in a

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.260 
playing with your hormonal levels in a
good<00:03:23.959> way<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.380> that<00:03:24.890> keeps<00:03:25.160> your<00:03:25.370> body<00:03:25.550> in<00:03:25.850> a

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
good way and that keeps your body in a

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.760 
good way and that keeps your body in a
fat-burning<00:03:26.780> state<00:03:27.080> for<00:03:27.320> instance<00:03:27.410> when<00:03:27.709> you

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
fat-burning state for instance when you

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.370 
fat-burning state for instance when you
eat<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:27.950> lot<00:03:28.100> of<00:03:28.720> hormone<00:03:29.720> on<00:03:29.900> this<00:03:30.050> left<00:03:30.260> hand

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
eat a lot of hormone on this left hand

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.680 
eat a lot of hormone on this left hand
when<00:03:31.100> you<00:03:31.280> eat<00:03:31.489> a<00:03:31.520> lot<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.000> food<00:03:32.360> when<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:32.600> have

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
when you eat a lot of food when you have

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.150 
when you eat a lot of food when you have
a<00:03:32.750> higher<00:03:32.989> floor<00:03:33.320> day<00:03:33.590> especially<00:03:33.800> higher

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
a higher floor day especially higher

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.910 
a higher floor day especially higher
amounts<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.520> carbohydrates<00:03:34.959> leptin<00:03:35.959> is<00:03:36.200> a

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
amounts of carbohydrates leptin is a

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.820 
amounts of carbohydrates leptin is a
hormone<00:03:36.950> that<00:03:37.640> basically<00:03:38.120> is<00:03:38.810> secreted<00:03:39.470> by<00:03:39.500> of

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
hormone that basically is secreted by of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.320 
hormone that basically is secreted by of
the<00:03:39.920> fat<00:03:40.130> cells<00:03:40.340> in<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.610> body<00:03:40.730> also<00:03:41.090> let<00:03:41.209> your

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
the fat cells in the body also let your

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
the fat cells in the body also let your
body<00:03:41.510> know<00:03:41.630> what<00:03:41.750> it's<00:03:41.870> full

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
body know what it's full

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.170 
body know what it's full
when<00:03:42.770> you<00:03:42.890> eat<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.010> lot<00:03:43.130> of<00:03:43.190> food<00:03:43.520> higher<00:03:43.940> you

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
when you eat a lot of food higher you

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.670 
when you eat a lot of food higher you
have<00:03:44.239> higher<00:03:44.510> leptin<00:03:44.959> levels<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.410> what<00:03:45.530> that

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
have higher leptin levels and what that

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.430 
have higher leptin levels and what that
means<00:03:45.830> is<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.070> your<00:03:46.280> body<00:03:46.550> is<00:03:46.700> now<00:03:46.880> in<00:03:47.030> a

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
means is that your body is now in a

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.620 
means is that your body is now in a
fat-burning<00:03:48.070> States<00:03:48.460> so<00:03:49.120> for<00:03:49.300> instance<00:03:49.540> if

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
fat-burning States so for instance if

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.840 
fat-burning States so for instance if
you'd<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.810> heavy<00:03:50.110> cheat<00:03:50.470> date<00:03:50.710> for<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.610> next

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
you'd a heavy cheat date for the next

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.080 
you'd a heavy cheat date for the next
stage<00:03:52.030> go<00:03:52.360> into<00:03:52.660> a<00:03:52.690> fasting<00:03:53.500> day<00:03:53.680> or<00:03:54.160> even<00:03:54.610> very

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
stage go into a fasting day or even very

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.180 
stage go into a fasting day or even very
very<00:03:55.330> very<00:03:55.480> little<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.620> reason<00:03:57.010> for<00:03:57.130> that

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
very very little and the reason for that

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.380 
very very little and the reason for that
is<00:03:57.370> because<00:03:57.400> your<00:03:57.670> body<00:03:57.880> because<00:03:58.210> of<00:03:58.240> his

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
is because your body because of his

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.670 
is because your body because of his
higher<00:03:58.600> leptin<00:03:58.990> levels<00:03:59.260> now<00:03:59.410> is<00:03:59.530> actually

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
higher leptin levels now is actually

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.820 
higher leptin levels now is actually
being<00:04:00.040> primed<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:01.030> burn<00:04:01.240> more<00:04:01.420> fat<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:02.020> then

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
being primed to burn more fat and then

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.140 
being primed to burn more fat and then
after<00:04:03.070> that<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.280> can<00:04:03.340> go<00:04:03.460> back<00:04:03.610> into<00:04:03.820> a<00:04:03.940> kind

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
after that you can go back into a kind

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.850 
after that you can go back into a kind
of<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.240> normal<00:04:04.570> caloric<00:04:04.930> intake<00:04:05.200> day<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:05.680> kind

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
of a normal caloric intake day and kind

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.260 
of a normal caloric intake day and kind
of<00:04:05.920> you<00:04:06.040> know<00:04:06.130> go<00:04:06.280> back<00:04:06.430> for<00:04:06.640> that<00:04:06.760> cycle<00:04:07.120> so

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
of you know go back for that cycle so

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.670 
of you know go back for that cycle so
there's<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.900> couple<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.230> things<00:04:08.350> you<00:04:08.470> can<00:04:08.500> do

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
there's a couple of things you can do

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.290 
there's a couple of things you can do
just<00:04:08.830> kind<00:04:08.920> of<00:04:09.040> changing<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:09.610> caloric<00:04:09.970> intake

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
just kind of changing the caloric intake

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.760 
just kind of changing the caloric intake
throughout<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.690> day<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.140> not<00:04:11.530> doing<00:04:11.710> the

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
throughout the day and not doing the

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.290 
throughout the day and not doing the
same<00:04:11.950> thing<00:04:12.190> all<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.370> time<00:04:12.460> can<00:04:12.910> make<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.090> big

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
same thing all the time can make a big

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.800 
same thing all the time can make a big
difference

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
difference

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.770 
difference

digits in body fat is very very

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.450 
digits in body fat is very very
dependent<00:04:22.930> of<00:04:23.200> body<00:04:23.350> type<00:04:23.530> as<00:04:23.680> well<00:04:23.830> it's

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
dependent of body type as well it's

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.670 
dependent of body type as well it's
going<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.670> be<00:04:24.730> tougher<00:04:25.120> because<00:04:25.840> if<00:04:26.470> you're

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
going to be tougher because if you're
