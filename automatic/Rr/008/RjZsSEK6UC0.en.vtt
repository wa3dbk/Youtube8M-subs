00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:09.400
 hello in this video as is the title them 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:13.959
 I'm going to teach how to make an ice cream 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.930
 of water I hope you like it a lot and 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:20.220
 good let's start 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:23.040
 I want to congratulate him first of all 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.789
 something to support so that it is not included 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.720
 the floor the table where you 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.720
 last 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.450
 What I'll do is ice cream 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.290
 orange 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.400
 well then what they need obvious 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.400
 an orange 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.820
 good one like that 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.890
 there is 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.240
 we are going to need 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.280
 a toy 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.280
 a row as you say 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.110
 and a spoonful 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.939
 it is very simple to do this very simple 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.939
 it's good to start 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:35.470
 and will not commit 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:37.550
 and we go to some places I already have with 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.560
 ice 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.560
 and others I have without ice 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.820
 good 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.430
 well I'm going to grab the orange I know the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.680
 departure if it has been easier for you to 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.370
 have to start with a knife 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.370
 good 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:06.990
 and what we are going to do is this 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:10.670
 by hand or with something they are going to do this 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.670
 they are going to squeeze the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.830
 was going to let the juice go to see who was going to 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.090
 drop the juice 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.670
 do not 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.850
 Oh, and I'm falling until it feels 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.700
 more or less 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:30.010
 If you believe a seed in ways not 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.010
 It is finished off with the spoon 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.060
 with your finger when you want us 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.349
 I fell like 3 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.349
 but it does not matter 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.340
 it is very simple to do this very simple 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.100
 good when we do not have strength not yet 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.600
 it comes out more 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:00.610
 what you have to do is crush 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.610
 with the spoon has to be 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.150
 a little bit 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.610
 and making it 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.380
 and squeezing 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.370
 until 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.790
 not have more juice 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.340
 Well I think that's good you have 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.640
 more or less you have to make the 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.970
 same of the same amount that puts that 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:39.230
 water for the ice well now yes you 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:44.000
 we take out the energies I have as I 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.329
 they left like four or three something like that already 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.329
 we take out 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:59.250
 here I have the magic 3 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.250
 and then take out a good rubbish that 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.310
 A) Yes 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.610
 and they assigned us many with whom you 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.610
 want 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.900
 she 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:20.799
 but that you want with 123 in which 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:24.630
 I'm going to do it with 1 only good 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.630
 I'm going to put a little bit better 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:34.539
 to plastic with all fingers after 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.539
 of washing hands equally 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.039
 is 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.039
 so much juice goes out 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.050
 then I'm sure it's going to come out if it's 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.349
 what do they do with orange 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:56.249
 also add a few things of oranges 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.249
 how are you 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.270
 then what you have to do as 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.270
 orange the one of cÃ¡ceres 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.320
 to ask 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.300
 I love 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.080
 almost all the game came for another little thing 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.080
 good and dead 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.940
 well I suppose you are 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.960
 but I'm going to lend a little more asylum 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:29.760
 return 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:33.240
 there it is coming out a little 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.980
 well something like that until they see that there is no 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.260
 plus 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.580
 you have to be no more useful than that part 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.580

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.070
