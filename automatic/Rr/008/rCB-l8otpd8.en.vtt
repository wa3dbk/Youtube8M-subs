 Thank you. 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:42.190
 Yes I will give you an explanation of the Internet 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:45.310
 When the computer to connect to each other any way whatsoever that we have 2 or more 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:50.230
 It's called imprisonment all the time. 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:55.960
 So we have a computer connected. We say we are a network. 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:59.379
 The term "internet" refers to the various computers in the world 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:05.920
 Whatever method you used to 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:11.800
 It's the Internet that connects computers all over the world . 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:16.170
 Ie in other words inde International one would you tell the network so 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.950
 Internet word itself four international tours covering the entire world 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.009
 On the network 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:26.040
 You can combine those two words 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:33.210
 Hers is such a word as the Internet causing 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:38.220
 Oh, the Internet is also referred to as the World Wide Web in words addressed another word 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.680
 So it is the Internet that eventually connects computers around the world. 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.720
 I can talk. 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:53.430
 There are computers on both sides of the Internet 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:57.570
 There is a computer that plays a role of providing information that is less information. 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:02.550
 There is a computer on the side which mainly receives and uses 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.450
 What we call the computer on the information side is the server 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.990
 Call 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:13.920
 This is what I call a server or a web server. 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:20.790
 I have so many servers on the side of providing this information. 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:23.010
 And the form in which these servers provide information is called the homepage 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.819
 It is about providing 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.900
 So that's the type of removal that would be the homepage. 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:35.180
 We call it homepage or web page. 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:40.370
 I also understand the website like this. 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.720
 Oh, and the computer of the book which uses the less information and uses it is a client 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.940
 I'm telling you. 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:51.320
 We mainly use our personal computer to give us clients 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:55.660
 When there is access to the Internet, see the website on the Internet 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:03:00.350
 Our computers at the time of our homepage 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.800
 We are a client and our computer and web server provide its homepage 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.800
 I will. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:14.310
 And this oo yacho server side homepage 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:18.990
 The address is usually www.adk.kr 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:25.460
 That's what you can do with your homepage address or website address 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:28.100
 Or a web page address . So, the whole world has a lot of 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:34.770
 2 In the Main document 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:39.510
 Itjyo got out the web page is not the same thing all wrong Yeah, so 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:43.340
 Oh , I have a unique, independent coat. 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.340
 There is no overlap. 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:52.890
 So when our clients want to see a homepage, 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:59.760
 We can address the homepage immediately. 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:05.909
 When we open the Internet from our client pc and hit its homepage address 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:09.150
 It will automatically go to the web server corresponding to that address, 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:14.120
 I read the home page on the web server 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:17.130
 Word has it come to the homepage on the client pc screen to be hit 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.310
 That's what you show. 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.810
 Originally, the Internet, I gotta do 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.639
 Yes, then when our client pc is on the internet 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:32.000
 Not connecting 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.000
 Uh-huh. That's the kind of internet connection service.
