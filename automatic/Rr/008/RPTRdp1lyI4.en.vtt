00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.560
 now I take this knife and start 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.230
 between the skin and the flesh and this poor 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.629
 fish will be skinless observe this 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.790

 flesh of the skin this is what I call 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.390
 a knife 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.940

 some years ago in our 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.470
 commercial we used to cut this that is 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.480
 aluminum but it's like slicing butter 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.250

 cut but this is what we call 

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:24.589
 security ball centers the knife 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.779

 like a potato observe the blade the 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.449
 It cuts right but right in the middle they see it 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.400
 I put them back together and when 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:45.499

 work for you imagine how fast 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:11.960
 to fill it and if they were fishermen 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:14.509
