but you could see some other aspects of

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.440 
but you could see some other aspects of
it<00:02:35.130> they're<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.340> little<00:02:35.459> bit<00:02:35.640> different<00:02:35.670> and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
it they're a little bit different and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.610 
it they're a little bit different and
we're<00:02:36.570> gonna<00:02:36.690> go<00:02:36.840> into<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:37.380> for<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.560> most

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
we're gonna go into it but for the most

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.860 
we're gonna go into it but for the most
part<00:02:37.800> it's<00:02:38.400> not<00:02:38.550> really<00:02:38.790> obtrusive<00:02:39.420> no

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
part it's not really obtrusive no

part it's not really obtrusive no
enhanced<00:02:40.350> feature<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:40.890> why<00:02:41.010> not<00:02:41.190> it's<00:02:41.400> pretty

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
enhanced feature so why not it's pretty

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.460
