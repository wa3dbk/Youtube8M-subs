00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.010 
those dark spots and those dark marks I
remember<00:05:14.770> I<00:05:14.800> was<00:05:15.430> watching<00:05:15.700> TV<00:05:16.419> one<00:05:16.720> day<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:16.960> I

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
remember I was watching TV one day and I

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.810 
remember I was watching TV one day and I
saw<00:05:17.229> an<00:05:17.380> Rx<00:05:17.650> for<00:05:17.710> brown<00:05:17.919> skin<00:05:17.950> commercial<00:05:18.610> and

saw an Rx for brown skin commercial and

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.430 
saw an Rx for brown skin commercial and
I<00:05:18.850> was<00:05:19.030> like<00:05:19.240> I<00:05:19.450> kind<00:05:19.720> of<00:05:19.810> want<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.020> try<00:05:20.169> that

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.219 
I was like I kind of want to try that
and<00:05:20.650> looks<00:05:20.800> like<00:05:20.979> maybe<00:05:21.640> it<00:05:21.910> catered<00:05:22.510> more<00:05:22.840> to

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
and looks like maybe it catered more to

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.990 
and looks like maybe it catered more to
dark-skinned<00:05:23.919> women<00:05:24.130> so<00:05:24.550> maybe<00:05:24.700> it<00:05:24.880> would

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
dark-skinned women so maybe it would
