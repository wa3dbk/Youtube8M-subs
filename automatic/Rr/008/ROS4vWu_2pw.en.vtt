00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
initial lay between two trees where I

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.910 
initial lay between two trees where I
had<00:03:22.220> no<00:03:22.250> branches<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.180> attach<00:03:23.540> this<00:03:23.930> mosquito

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920

net<00:03:25.130> shock<00:03:25.430> cord<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.240> felt<00:03:26.540> like<00:03:26.810> the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
net shock cord to I felt like the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.220 
net shock cord to I felt like the
mosquito<00:03:28.970> netting<00:03:29.240> was<00:03:29.480> actually<00:03:29.930> hanging

too<00:03:30.620> far<00:03:30.920> into<00:03:31.160> my<00:03:31.280> face<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.780> came<00:03:32.930> up<00:03:33.380> with<00:03:33.560> a

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
too far into my face so I came up with a

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.680 
too far into my face so I came up with a
little<00:03:33.950> modification<00:03:34.790> just<00:03:34.820> to<00:03:35.239> grab<00:03:35.480> the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
little modification just to grab the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.199 
little modification just to grab the
extra<00:03:36.200> mosquito<00:03:36.680> netting<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.220> use<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:37.910> small

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
extra mosquito netting and use a small

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.940 
extra mosquito netting and use a small
clamp<00:03:38.989> to<00:03:39.260> keep<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.650> off<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:40.100> my<00:03:40.280> face

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.660 

I<00:03:44.690> thought<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.870> lay<00:03:46.080> was<00:03:46.349> comfortable<00:03:46.980> the

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
I thought the lay was comfortable the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.210 
I thought the lay was comfortable the
hammock<00:03:48.000> was<00:03:48.150> quite<00:03:48.510> wide<00:03:48.810> actually<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.769> the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
quality there of the mosquito zipper was

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.220 
quality there of the mosquito zipper was
fine<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.310> didn't<00:03:53.940> have<00:03:54.060> any<00:03:54.209> snags<00:03:54.690> or<00:03:54.989> anything

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
fine I didn't have any snags or anything

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
net not being on my face gave me the

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.369 
net not being on my face gave me the
feeling<00:04:10.620> of<00:04:10.860> being<00:04:11.489> in<00:04:11.900> kind<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:13.140> an
