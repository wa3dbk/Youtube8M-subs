00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.200 
I do recommend going to the salon and

having this done and go to a reputable

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.210 
having this done and go to a reputable
salon<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.049> does<00:01:10.260> corrective<00:01:10.799> color<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.189> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
salon that does corrective color on a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.890 
salon that does corrective color on a
regular<00:01:11.580> basis<00:01:11.970> because<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> fairly

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
regular basis because this is a fairly

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.620 
regular basis because this is a fairly
corrective<00:01:13.409> process<00:01:13.590> now<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.030> lesser<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> two

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
corrective process now the lesser of two

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.100 
corrective process now the lesser of two
evils<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:17.130> from<00:01:17.689> light<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
evils is going to be going from light to

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.100 
evils is going to be going from light to
dark<00:01:19.490> because<00:01:20.490> light<00:01:21.360> hair<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.960> lot

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
dark because light hair it's a lot

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350 
dark because light hair it's a lot
easier<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.590> deposit<00:01:23.009> color<00:01:23.220> whereas<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.150> you

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
easier to deposit color whereas if you
