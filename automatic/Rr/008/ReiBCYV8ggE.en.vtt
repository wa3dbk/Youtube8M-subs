YouTube video for free just to give a
little<00:00:08.490> bit<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.760> advice<00:00:09.120> I'm<00:00:09.389> playing<00:00:09.630> the

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
little bit of advice I'm playing the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.320 
little bit of advice I'm playing the
standard<00:00:10.110> optimally<00:00:10.759> which<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:12.000> you're<00:00:12.240> a

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
standard optimally which is you're a

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.419 
standard optimally which is you're a
budding<00:00:12.570> dancer<00:00:13.110> improviser<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.009> ensure<00:00:14.280> your

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
budding dancer improviser to ensure your

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.680 
budding dancer improviser to ensure your
come<00:00:14.580> across<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:14.940> standard<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.480> there's<00:00:15.630> a

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
come across this standard so there's a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
come across this standard so there's a
little<00:00:15.780> bit<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.020> thoughts<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.500> some<00:00:16.619> advice

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
little bit of thoughts and some advice

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.429 
little bit of thoughts and some advice
that<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.220> can<00:00:17.340> try<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.609> improve<00:00:18.000> your<00:00:18.090> playing

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
that you can try to improve your playing

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.620 
that you can try to improve your playing
so<00:00:19.439> if<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.859> take<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.039> look<00:00:20.130> at<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:21.000> car<00:00:21.150> changes

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
so if we take a look at the car changes

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.689 
so if we take a look at the car changes
for<00:00:21.900> autumn<00:00:22.289> leaves<00:00:22.470> let's<00:00:23.130> go<00:00:23.250> through<00:00:23.519> them

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
for autumn leaves let's go through them

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.660 
for autumn leaves let's go through them
so<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.029> first<00:00:24.240> one<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.449> C<00:00:24.750> minus<00:00:25.050> 7<00:00:25.529> which<00:00:26.430> I've

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
so the first one is C minus 7 which I've

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.689 
so the first one is C minus 7 which I've
changed<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.240> nine<00:00:27.599> put<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> d'<00:00:28.289> there<00:00:28.699> keep

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
changed to a nine put the d' there keep

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.100 
changed to a nine put the d' there keep
that<00:00:29.820> there<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.689> go<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.170> f30<00:00:32.120> and<00:00:33.120> then

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
that there and go for the f30 and then

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.799 
that there and go for the f30 and then
we've<00:00:34.230> got<00:00:34.260> big<00:00:34.800> 197<00:00:35.960> then<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.200> fun<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:38.450> minor<00:00:39.450> 7

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
we've got big 197 then be fun a minor 7

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.010 
we've got big 197 then be fun a minor 7
flat<00:00:39.840> 5<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.649> put<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> Dean<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.940> he<00:00:42.809> flat<00:00:43.110> G<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.680> d

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
flat 5 I put a Dean there he flat G it d

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.560 
flat 5 I put a Dean there he flat G it d
for<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> d7<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.010> make<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> flat<00:00:50.570> 907

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
for the d7 you can make it a flat 907

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.290 
for the d7 you can make it a flat 907
with<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> shaft<00:00:52.079> five<00:00:52.670> and<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.760> sharp<00:00:54.030> 9

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
with the shaft five and a sharp 9

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.680 
with the shaft five and a sharp 9
altered<00:00:54.899> guard<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:56.550> matter<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.570> we'll

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
altered guard and then matter so we'll

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.880 
altered guard and then matter so we'll
just<00:00:57.840> work<00:00:57.960> around<00:00:57.989> those<00:00:58.289> zoning<00:00:58.469> changes

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
just work around those zoning changes

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.410 
just work around those zoning changes
obviously<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.460> change<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> needle<00:01:00.090> descend

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
obviously the change the needle descend

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.090 
obviously the change the needle descend
is<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> little<00:01:01.020> extra<00:01:01.590> change<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
is just a little extra change on the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.910 
is just a little extra change on the
last<00:01:02.280> line<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.270> we've<00:01:04.170> got<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> B<00:01:04.559> flat<00:01:04.710> major

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
last line so we've got the B flat major

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.770 
last line so we've got the B flat major
scale<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.270> first<00:01:06.479> thing<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.689> need

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
scale there and the first thing you need

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.090 
scale there and the first thing you need
to<00:01:06.840> do<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.170> help<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.439> getting<00:01:07.650> provide<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
to do for help we getting provide and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100 
to do for help we getting provide and
he's<00:01:08.189> play<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.549> B<00:01:08.670> flat<00:01:08.820> major<00:01:09.030> scale<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.689> time

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
he's play the B flat major scale in time

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:26.649 
he's play the B flat major scale in time
all<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.159> those<00:01:11.250> cartoon

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.999 

ok<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.719> that's<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.140> cropped<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.649> and<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:28.920> you

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
ok so that's in cropped it's and if you

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:47.660 
ok so that's in cropped it's and if you
get<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> little<00:01:29.399> bit<00:01:29.490> better<00:01:29.640> try<00:01:30.060> four<00:01:30.329> evers

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.280 

I<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:52.360> did<00:01:52.479> a<00:01:52.540> little<00:01:52.659> bit<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.810> triplets<00:01:53.170> at

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
I just did a little bit of triplets at

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.899 
I just did a little bit of triplets at
the<00:01:53.439> end<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:53.950> basically<00:01:54.430> starting<00:01:54.790> with

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
the end so basically starting with

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.990 
the end so basically starting with
crotchets<00:01:56.039> cuerdas<00:01:57.039> and<00:01:57.280> then<00:01:57.789> maybe

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
crotchets cuerdas and then maybe

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.760 
crotchets cuerdas and then maybe
triplets<00:01:58.479> as<00:01:58.630> well<00:01:58.810> if<00:01:59.079> you<00:01:59.170> feel<00:01:59.350> you<00:01:59.470> can<00:01:59.590> get

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
triplets as well if you feel you can get

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.350 
triplets as well if you feel you can get
into<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.070> but<00:02:00.310> as<00:02:00.399> I<00:02:00.430> said<00:02:00.640> Louie<00:02:00.850> Armstrong

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
into that but as I said Louie Armstrong

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.710 
into that but as I said Louie Armstrong
pretty<00:02:02.049> much<00:02:02.289> only<00:02:02.590> used<00:02:03.539> crotchets<00:02:04.539> and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
pretty much only used crotchets and

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.210 
pretty much only used crotchets and
Quivers<00:02:05.049> and<00:02:05.080> this<00:02:05.289> place<00:02:05.530> is<00:02:05.649> playing<00:02:05.950> swing

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
Quivers and this place is playing swing

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.950 
Quivers and this place is playing swing
beautiful<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.700> isn't<00:02:06.909> it<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:07.179> just<00:02:07.390> think

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
beautiful it isn't it so just think

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.190 
beautiful it isn't it so just think
about<00:02:08.099> working<00:02:09.099> through<00:02:09.399> practice<00:02:09.819> first

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:22.800 

then<00:02:14.200> quitters<00:02:21.390> triplets<00:02:22.390> are<00:02:22.480> trickier

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
then quitters triplets are trickier

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.720 
then quitters triplets are trickier
there<00:02:23.049> but<00:02:23.230> they<00:02:23.319> give<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.590> good<00:02:23.799> feel<00:02:24.010> so

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
there but they give you a good feel so

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.100 
there but they give you a good feel so
after<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.120> well<00:02:25.450> let's<00:02:25.600> talk<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.780> little<00:02:25.870> bit

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
after that well let's talk a little bit

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.780 
after that well let's talk a little bit
about<00:02:26.260> some<00:02:26.440> Keith<00:02:26.680> Jarrett<00:02:26.920> ideas<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:27.610> within

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
about some Keith Jarrett ideas so within

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.820 
about some Keith Jarrett ideas so within
the<00:02:28.120> word<00:02:28.569> diatonic<00:02:29.049> though<00:02:29.290> using<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.709> B

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
the word diatonic though using the B

the word diatonic though using the B
flat<00:02:29.980> major<00:02:30.160> scale<00:02:30.400> just<00:02:31.299> try<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.630> move<00:02:31.750> ideas

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
flat major scale just try and move ideas
