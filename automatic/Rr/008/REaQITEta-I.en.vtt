all melted there's no more lumps of the
chocolate<00:02:30.410> chips<00:02:30.800> or<00:02:30.920> anything<00:02:30.950> like<00:02:31.220> that

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
chocolate chips or anything like that

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.059 
chocolate chips or anything like that
and<00:02:31.790> then<00:02:32.410> something<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.560> forgot<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.890> mention

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
and then something I forgot to mention

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.420 
and then something I forgot to mention
before<00:02:34.970> even<00:02:35.360> starting<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.780> melt<00:02:36.020> put<00:02:36.890> some

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
before even starting to melt put some

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.600 
before even starting to melt put some
parchment<00:02:37.760> paper<00:02:38.209> on<00:02:38.540> your<00:02:38.600> pan<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.560> it'll<00:02:40.459> be

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
parchment paper on your pan and it'll be

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.430 
parchment paper on your pan and it'll be
a<00:02:40.640> little<00:02:40.940> bit<00:02:41.090> difficult<00:02:41.330> for<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.930> stick

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
a little bit difficult for it to stick

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.830 
a little bit difficult for it to stick
so<00:02:42.860> we<00:02:43.160> kind<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:43.640> grease<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.240> pan<00:02:44.450> lightly

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
so we kind of grease the pan lightly

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.590 
so we kind of grease the pan lightly
with<00:02:45.319> olive<00:02:45.590> oil<00:02:45.950> just<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.790> little<00:02:47.090> bit<00:02:47.330> just<00:02:47.480> to

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
with olive oil just a little bit just to

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.070 
with olive oil just a little bit just to
kind<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:47.959> have<00:02:48.110> something<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.530> stick<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:50.080> I

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
kind of have something to stick to and I

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.150 
kind of have something to stick to and I
suggest<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:51.980> putting<00:02:52.280> something<00:02:52.550> over<00:02:52.850> it

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
suggest like putting something over it

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.980 
suggest like putting something over it
