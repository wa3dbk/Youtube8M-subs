image gallery so we're gonna do that by

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.810 
image gallery so we're gonna do that by

clicking on the image gallery tab and a

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.160 
clicking on the image gallery tab and a
couple<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.179> things<00:00:12.300> about<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.719> image<00:00:12.960> gallery

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
couple of things about the image gallery

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.270 
couple of things about the image gallery
what<00:00:13.469> we're<00:00:13.590> going<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.769> do<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:13.980> we're<00:00:14.099> going<00:00:14.219> to

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.039 
what we're going to do is we're going to
take<00:00:14.400> basically<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.179> folder<00:00:15.660> full<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.839> images

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
take basically a folder full of images

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.130 
take basically a folder full of images
zip<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.160> up<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.400> then<00:00:17.910> upload<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.510> now<00:00:18.539> keep<00:00:18.990> in

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
zip it up and then upload it now keep in

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.859 
zip it up and then upload it now keep in
mind<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.160> max<00:00:20.369> upload<00:00:20.850> size<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.510> 2

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
mind that the max upload size is 2

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.420 
mind that the max upload size is 2
megabytes<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.740> probably<00:00:23.160> need<00:00:23.400> to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
megabytes so you probably need to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.870 
megabytes so you probably need to
prepare<00:00:23.910> your<00:00:24.119> photos<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:25.050> head<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.410> time<00:00:25.880> so

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
prepare your photos a head of time so

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.450 
prepare your photos a head of time so
I'm<00:00:27.269> gonna<00:00:27.420> switch<00:00:28.080> over<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
I'm gonna switch over here to the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.049 
I'm gonna switch over here to the
Windows<00:00:29.760> Explorer<00:00:30.269> real<00:00:30.539> quick<00:00:31.520> and<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.910> have

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
Windows Explorer real quick and I have

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.729 
Windows Explorer real quick and I have
this<00:00:33.210> folder<00:00:33.510> with<00:00:33.840> these<00:00:34.140> beautiful

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
this folder with these beautiful

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.479 
this folder with these beautiful
pictures<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.309> ice<00:00:35.640> sculptures<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:38.340> have

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
pictures of ice sculptures and they have

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.310 
pictures of ice sculptures and they have
been<00:00:38.670> resized<00:00:39.120> already<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.960> these<00:00:40.110> are

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
been resized already so these are

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.990 
been resized already so these are
somewhere<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> neighborhood<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.550> about

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
somewhere in the neighborhood of about

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.650 
somewhere in the neighborhood of about
500<00:00:42.690> pixels<00:00:43.079> wide<00:00:43.760> about<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> 500<00:00:45.210> pixel<00:00:45.480> wide

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
500 pixels wide about a 500 pixel wide

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.529 
500 pixels wide about a 500 pixel wide
max<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> 500<00:00:46.739> pixel<00:00:47.010> tall<00:00:47.340> max<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.030> probably

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
max or a 500 pixel tall max and probably

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.959 
max or a 500 pixel tall max and probably
somewhere<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> neighborhood<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.530> about

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
somewhere in the neighborhood of about

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.639 
somewhere in the neighborhood of about
375<00:00:50.969> pixels<00:00:51.600> somewhere<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:51.930> around<00:00:52.469> there

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
375 pixels somewhere that around there

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.189 
375 pixels somewhere that around there
gives<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.640> good<00:00:53.789> size<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.390> slideshow<00:00:54.899> plus

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
gives a good size for a slideshow plus

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.660 
gives a good size for a slideshow plus
it<00:00:55.320> makes<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> images<00:00:55.949> small<00:00:56.280> enough<00:00:56.520> they

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it makes the images small enough they

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.130 
it makes the images small enough they
don't<00:00:56.789> take<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> long<00:00:57.300> time<00:00:57.510> when<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:57.840> load

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
don't take a long time when they load

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.319 
don't take a long time when they load
and<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:59.039> helps<00:00:59.309> everything<00:00:59.550> work<00:00:59.879> out<00:01:00.059> well

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
and it helps everything work out well

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.009 
and it helps everything work out well
all<00:01:01.109> right<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.410> what<00:01:01.620> I'm<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.070> is
