riding a freezing horse the other day my

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.360 
riding a freezing horse the other day my
saddle<00:00:44.410> had<00:00:44.530> to<00:00:44.590> sit<00:00:44.740> further<00:00:44.950> back<00:00:45.100> because

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
saddle had to sit further back because

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.890 
saddle had to sit further back because
the<00:00:45.579> Friesian<00:00:45.910> neck<00:00:46.090> comes<00:00:46.329> off<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.630> withers

the Friesian neck comes off the withers
a<00:00:46.930> little<00:00:47.170> further<00:00:47.320> back<00:00:47.590> a<00:00:47.650> little<00:00:47.920> higher<00:00:48.100> so

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
a little further back a little higher so

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.490 
a little further back a little higher so
there's<00:00:48.550> some<00:00:48.700> differences<00:00:49.120> there<00:00:49.180> but<00:00:50.110> for

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
there's some differences there but for

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.720 
there's some differences there but for
the<00:00:50.590> most<00:00:50.710> part<00:00:50.829> we're<00:00:51.130> going<00:00:51.250> to<00:00:51.340> go<00:00:51.460> over<00:00:51.610> how

wither is right here this is high point

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.959 
wither is right here this is high point
of<00:01:08.409> his<00:01:08.530> wither<00:01:08.770> so<00:01:09.460> when<00:01:09.549> I<00:01:09.579> put<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:09.939> pad<00:01:10.149> on<00:01:10.420> I

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
want to put that front of that pad right

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.530 
want to put that front of that pad right
over<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.579> top<00:01:15.790> of<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.000> high<00:01:16.119> point<00:01:16.360> of<00:01:16.450> the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
over the top of the high point of the

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.180 
over the top of the high point of the
wither<00:01:16.690> that's<00:01:17.049> where<00:01:17.320> you<00:01:17.440> start<00:01:17.740> everything

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
wither that's where you start everything

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.219 
wither that's where you start everything
from<00:01:18.400> there's<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.240> line<00:01:19.510> that<00:01:19.540> runs<00:01:19.900> from<00:01:20.080> the

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
from there's a line that runs from the

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.690 
from there's a line that runs from the
high<00:01:20.380> point<00:01:20.680> of<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.830> wither<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.340> horses

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
high point of the wither to the horses

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.610 
high point of the wither to the horses
the<00:01:22.270> back<00:01:22.420> of<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.659> horse<00:01:22.840> is<00:01:22.960> four<00:01:23.170> leg<00:01:23.350> here

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
the back of the horse is four leg here

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.490 
the back of the horse is four leg here
so<00:01:24.250> we<00:01:24.370> want<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.670> have<00:01:24.820> that<00:01:25.270> line<00:01:25.540> pretty<00:01:26.409> much

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
so we want to have that line pretty much

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.980 
so we want to have that line pretty much
even<00:01:26.920> with<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.100> front<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.400> my<00:01:27.520> pack<00:01:27.729> now<00:01:28.090> when

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
even with the front of my pack now when

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.350 
even with the front of my pack now when
the<00:01:29.080> saddle<00:01:29.320> goes<00:01:29.650> on<00:01:29.890> it's<00:01:30.820> going<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.119> sit<00:01:31.330> a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
the saddle goes on it's going to sit a

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.760 
the saddle goes on it's going to sit a
little<00:01:31.659> bit<00:01:31.810> far<00:01:32.020> back<00:01:32.290> of<00:01:32.500> there<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
little bit far back of there and the

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.149 
little bit far back of there and the
reason<00:01:36.100> for<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:36.310> is<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:38.799> want<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.010> little

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
reason for that is is you want a little

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.980 
reason for that is is you want a little
bit<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.310> pad<00:01:39.520> exposed<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.360> way<00:01:40.510> your<00:01:40.690> saddles

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
bit of pad exposed that way your saddles

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.780 
bit of pad exposed that way your saddles
not<00:01:41.110> rubbing<00:01:41.380> on<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.530> shoulder<00:01:41.860> but<00:01:42.130> pretty

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
armpit there now there's differences too

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.790

if you use a balanced right saddle some
saddles<00:02:28.160> they<00:02:28.310> have<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.610> sense<00:02:28.850> sit<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> little

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
saddles they have the sense sit a little

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.990 
saddles they have the sense sit a little
bit<00:02:29.300> further<00:02:29.600> back<00:02:30.100> but<00:02:31.100> every<00:02:31.460> horse<00:02:31.730> is

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
bit further back but every horse is

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.110 
bit further back but every horse is
built<00:02:32.740> with<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.860> place<00:02:34.100> for<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.370> saddle<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.850> fit

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
built with the place for a saddle to fit

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.790 
built with the place for a saddle to fit
in<00:02:35.360> no<00:02:35.720> matter<00:02:35.900> where<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.350> said<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.650> that

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
in no matter where you said it that

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.350 
in no matter where you said it that
style<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.310> going<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.490> try<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:37.850> work<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.210> that

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
style is going to try and work to that

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.390 
style is going to try and work to that
point<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:39.500> things<00:02:39.800> will<00:02:39.920> move<00:02:40.100> around<00:02:40.220> a

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
point so things will move around a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.710 
point so things will move around a
little<00:02:40.490> bit<00:02:40.670> but<00:02:40.850> if<00:02:40.940> you<00:02:41.030> don't<00:02:41.209> set<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.480> right

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
little bit but if you don't set it right

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.420 
little bit but if you don't set it right
to<00:02:41.930> begin<00:02:42.050> with<00:02:42.410> when<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.800> happens<00:02:43.250> it's

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
to begin with when that happens it's

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.860 
to begin with when that happens it's
going<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.640> make<00:02:43.850> discomfort<00:02:44.420> in<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.540> horses

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
going to make discomfort in the horses

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.840 
going to make discomfort in the horses
back<00:02:45.050> or<00:02:45.500> on<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.680> girth<00:02:46.040> or<00:02:46.340> on<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.580> cinch

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
back or on the girth or on the cinch

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.760 
back or on the girth or on the cinch
area<00:02:47.150> because<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.230> saddle<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:48.590> going<00:02:48.709> to

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
area because that saddle is going to

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.900 
area because that saddle is going to
move<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:48.980> little<00:02:49.070> bit<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.400> it's<00:02:49.520> important<00:02:49.850> to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
move a little bit so it's important to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.930 
move a little bit so it's important to
get<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.240> right<00:02:50.420> place<00:02:50.690> every<00:02:51.050> time<00:02:51.940> so

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
get it in the right place every time so

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.990 
get it in the right place every time so
when<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.150> put<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.540> saddle<00:02:53.750> on<00:02:54.459> I'm<00:02:55.459> two<00:02:55.760> inches
