00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.800
 go provino 4 section against gopro 04 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.140
 silver we see some of the various 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.140
 technical characteristics the cost is the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.900
 itself is 429 euros as regards 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.450
 the European market the size as 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.820
 you can see is much much lower 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.280
 that of the cupolino opera 4 session per 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.680
 regarding the use on the heel la 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.690
 group roero 4 silver needs the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.789
 additional support so it will still be 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.829
 larger than a note 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.890
 negative instead is the fact that the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.089
 cover 4 section can be 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.699
 therefore waterproof up to 10 meters 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.949
 tripod underwater some support 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.539
 for me he has the copro hero 4 can 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.149
 reach a depth of 40 meters 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.530
 with additional support it can remains 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.569
 even at 60 meters 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.339
 as regards the resolution of 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:04.890
 video we have a big advantage for 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:08.909
 regarding the silver hero since 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.860
 we can record up to 2.7 ko 4k 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.570
 while for the hero 4 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.240
 session we have a maximum resolution 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.979
 of 1440 pixels 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.020
 as for the photos one step 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.390
 ahead still true 4 silver since 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.620
 we can do beyond 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.570
 night photos 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.150
 we also have the highest resolution of 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.980
 12 understood it at 8 megapixels 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.260
 of lap 46 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.190
 to note also that in the book iv c of the 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.320
 thun center 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.870
 also regarding the photos while 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.910
 I was 4 session the proton and only for 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.610
 regarding video drums 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.710
 removable on the plane 4 silver instead 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.190
 battery not removable as far as 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.690
 it's about the hero 4 session of course 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.120
 with removable battery we can 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.370
 to have 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.260
 several and then also lasted the whole 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.180
 day the use of the self that 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.230
 we can change that battery in 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.230
 any situation 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.730
 another important feature 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.380
 screen behind in regards to true 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.649
 4 schiller we have a screen present 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.090
 silent we can also see the playback 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.620
 so we can immediately see ours 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.350
 video the photos we have just 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.900
 snapped while regarding the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.860
 hero 4 session we will have to get home to 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.810
 tender to turn on the computer 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.710
 connecting was not but seeing 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.750
 finally ours 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.390
 let us then draw conclusions 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.700
 as for me i think that lake 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.310
 but hero 4 session is very much 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.560
 good especially for those in need of 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.260
 direct use continuous use 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.030
 always with the same resolution then 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.730
 especially those who practice extreme sports 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.620
 ask who should keep her though 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.780
 always in the same position vary the 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.310
 positions but therefore a sport where not 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.740
 you have the chance to see it 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.540
 screen or video just made and me 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.890
 really like the fact of the impermeability 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.520
 up to 10 meters 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.120
 since many times I need 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.440
 quick use both inside the water and 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.150
 out of the water 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.490
 so with an aero 4 silver I should 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.740
 change housing several times 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.950
 therefore also with a waste of time 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.350
 example if we are at sea we need 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.500
 both of good sound on the outside and 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.410
 inside the water in the case of 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.540
 four sessions will be will be very much 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.240
 better since I don't have to change the 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.360
 custody every entry out of the water 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.960
 but it will be reactive and useful for use 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.970
 direct 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.430
 these were some of the differences between the 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.970
 four section hellyer or four silver 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.650
 I hope I have clarified you later 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.820
