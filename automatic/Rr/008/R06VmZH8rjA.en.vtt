00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
Game Show and then the vga and bgx so we

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.160 
Game Show and then the vga and bgx so we
got<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> few<00:01:35.400> shows<00:01:35.670> left<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.689> let's<00:01:36.960> look<00:01:37.049> at

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
got a few shows left but let's look at

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.630 
got a few shows left but let's look at
the<00:01:37.259> information<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:37.920> behind<00:01:38.220> each<00:01:38.460> of

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the information we have behind each of

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.090 
the information we have behind each of
those<00:01:38.729> shows<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.990> quakecon<00:01:40.860> which

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
those shows so we have quakecon which

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.120 
those shows so we have quakecon which
seems<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.490> mainly<00:01:41.759> focused<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.390> doom<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
seems to be mainly focused on doom and

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.280 
seems to be mainly focused on doom and
ESO<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:45.060> lot<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.540> games<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.780> Bethesda<00:01:45.960> is

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
ESO and a lot of games that Bethesda is

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.859 
ESO and a lot of games that Bethesda is
publishing<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:46.950> developing<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.119> we<00:01:48.509> got<00:01:48.630> that

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
publishing not developing so we got that

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.569 
publishing not developing so we got that
in<00:01:48.899> doom<00:01:49.200> seems<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.680> taking<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> cake<00:01:50.460> on

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
in doom seems to be taking the cake on

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.130 
in doom seems to be taking the cake on
that<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.180> because<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.600> fact<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.930> it's

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
that one just because the fact that it's

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.660 
that one just because the fact that it's
going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> big<00:01:52.680> reveal<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.579> I

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
going to be a big reveal for it and I

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.649 
going to be a big reveal for it and I
don't<00:01:53.820> think<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.060> they're<00:01:54.270> going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> have

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
don't think that they're going to have

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.600 
don't think that they're going to have
the<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.290> fight<00:01:55.500> over<00:01:55.710> each<00:01:55.979> other<00:01:56.159> there<00:01:56.369> while

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the to fight over each other there while

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.679 
the to fight over each other there while
that<00:01:56.759> would<00:01:56.850> be<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> pleasant<00:01:57.210> surprise<00:01:57.479> for

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
that would be a pleasant surprise for

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.600 
that would be a pleasant surprise for
both<00:01:57.990> fan<00:01:58.259> bases<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.890> don't<00:01:59.310> see<00:01:59.399> them<00:01:59.579> doing

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
both fan bases I don't see them doing

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.219 
both fan bases I don't see them doing
that<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.479> there's<00:02:00.659> still<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> chance<00:02:00.899> at

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that so there's still a chance at

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.870 
that so there's still a chance at
quakecon<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.950> seems<00:02:02.189> mainly<00:02:02.520> focused

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
quakecon but it seems mainly focused

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.670 
quakecon but it seems mainly focused
toward<00:02:03.030> still<00:02:03.270> now<00:02:03.810> paint<00:02:04.110> saying<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.530> these

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
toward still now paint saying that these

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.789 
toward still now paint saying that these
are<00:02:04.920> game<00:02:05.310> these<00:02:05.640> are<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.420> games

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
are game these are going to be the games

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
that are going to be at Gamescom now

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.080 
that are going to be at Gamescom now
what's<00:02:09.989> odd<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.470> doom<00:02:11.190> isn't<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.849> this

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
what's odd is that doom isn't on this

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.650 
what's odd is that doom isn't on this
list

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
list

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.750 
list
he<00:02:12.750> mentions<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.860> little<00:02:14.100> bit<00:02:14.280> empty

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
he mentions so it's a little bit empty

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.060 
he mentions so it's a little bit empty
here<00:02:15.090> seeing<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.780> evil<00:02:16.200> within<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.710> ESO

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
are going to be there but still we're

going to take his word for it I can't
leave<00:02:19.890> anything<00:02:20.040> out<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.030> almost<00:02:21.150> rule

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
leave anything out so we can almost rule

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.420 
leave anything out so we can almost rule
out<00:02:21.600> fallout<00:02:21.870> there<00:02:22.200> then<00:02:22.680> we<00:02:22.800> have<00:02:22.890> pax<00:02:23.160> prime

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
out fallout there then we have pax prime

it's become more and more evident as the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.060 
it's become more and more evident as the
hype<00:03:09.300> is<00:03:09.510> building<00:03:09.900> up<00:03:10.050> once<00:03:10.320> again<00:03:10.470> for<00:03:10.620> fall

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
hype is building up once again for fall

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.270

for<00:03:11.490> even<00:03:11.880> more<00:03:12.060> than<00:03:12.180> before<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.590> um<00:03:13.890> it

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
for even more than before is that um it

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.160 
for even more than before is that um it
doesn't<00:03:14.580> need<00:03:14.910> an<00:03:15.030> event<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.600> announced

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
but if you're looking at it from an

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.790 
but if you're looking at it from an
event<00:03:18.209> perspective<00:03:18.990> it<00:03:19.140> almost<00:03:19.470> seems<00:03:19.740> like

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
event perspective it almost seems like

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.800 
event perspective it almost seems like

VGX so it's a bunch of maybes but it's
really<00:03:39.120> narrowed<00:03:39.540> our<00:03:39.660> shirt<00:03:39.900> search<00:03:40.200> down
