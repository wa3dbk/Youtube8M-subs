00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:04.799
 to the disappointment of the brand new who will be the new toy of 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.000
 Nintendo without victory 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.719
 citizens an example to the stress team 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.969
 and they would like to hear about the new functions of the 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.969
 device 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.460
 the parents are playing a game I don't know if we have them 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.839
 intention 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.819
 You are just saying that I come here my first 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:32.670
 and so the intention is to finish that entire course 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.330
 but it is quite difficult 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.460
 and they did so by breaking a couple when checking into it 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.310
 mess up with the detectives in the first and second 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.870
 go up the entire field 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.890
 joop things he all 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.100
 yes I only see my top match in addition to a few 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.160
 awkward at this but it is nice i can understand that 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.490
 it is quite difficult 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.410
 which 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.200
 so the most fun were the interaction with the wet control itself 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.090
 and the image of course 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.100
 wait till now 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.100
 wait an apple person from 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.810
 okay there is also someone from nintendo and i think he is our heart 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.850
 he can explain what the new functions of the wheel are 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.030
 those are all the master 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.890
 functions that really splash out 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.400
 at the check 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.670
 jada pinkett that he is crazy about malaria 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.620
 let him have a new mandate and they will have to 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.440
 he could have had the whole way of experiencing new things there and there 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.600
 are an awful lot of different applications and yes, it would mostly suit you 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.330
 developers do say yes to make very creative use of it 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.590
 the attacker with our bread a playful bommel bayern someone 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.660
 my eyes careers on what that all players in the team have many players with 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.560
 ghost town he took anything and everything other players 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.250
 don't see it yet but he does 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.190
 Those are of course fun gadgets that animals can come true with 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.630
 the with the developers 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.090
 He is one of the things that makes one act really fun with us 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.459
 example 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.629
 contain super Mario bros deal with open ends where you ad the cells 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.639
 church was used by taxi 10 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.719
 but to place blocks full of blocks to play with or even help 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:23.979
 also this one 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:28.319
 and that can unfortunately lead to situations, yes, I like creating a new one 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.259
 concept we are still testing a little bit about rotterdam because i can see 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.259
 you but also so long process but with the away shirt 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.829
 much nicer delay 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.410
 it is very different with her 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.799
 well exactly 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.820
 meta caqueta really see very well what he is actually all possible 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.789
 what there are twelve different India attractions in the game that 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:52.219
 all make use of the 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.729
 control options 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.579
 the car as much as possible on the wheel I am curious how 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.539
 how it will turn out in practice 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.519
 they dare busy 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.529
 well i still have a small one 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:09.509
 ask the languages â€‹â€‹what do you think what how the who catch that belong to you 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.369
 the very old the people 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.989
 yes and yes when I look at today we already have a lot of fun and 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.359
 received positive responses 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.790
 and of course we have very nice lines with really everyone with titles 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:25.630
 and think of a zombie you how my that time closely 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.109
 but you also lie for a while 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.309
 and tax during two in the competition and then panetta that innovation to come for 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.309
 the future well think there is something for everyone 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:38.029
 the zaan 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:42.289
 I think we have it that he is everyone what the Christian Union is 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:45.469
 yes i am also very enthusiastic about the deal 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:49.379
 well for az if you just go to try it now is of course quite another 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.479
 create a new concept on the game 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.589
 we are now beside 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.700
 because there were now that people are often injured 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.319
 extra all night 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.499
 On top of that, it counts although it makes it easier to get more 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.109
 the catwalk on that is a place where often placed second 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:14.570
 I'll let us know by e-mail 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.180
 by the fires I knew after the acquisition 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.180
 the attacks are japan could have imagined than expected 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:22.370
 last year
