00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 and hello to all his friends today 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.750
 a new video about a game 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.609
 independent of ps4 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.930
 I present you future idiom I do not know 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.000
 absolutely not what it may be 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.230
 that this video will be naked so 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.059
 the goal is to get into this 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.309
 kind of hole to do like the ubs 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.770
 in the black star and destroy the nucleus 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.630
 from the inside like these perfect 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.029
 again russia level 1 or summer rather 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.109
 hot we can say we got the energy 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.470
 go go 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:31.050
 what are we going to get there yes here 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.620
 the core was why he told me that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.600
 I lost there friends I start again at a 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.340
 No, but it will soon be ok again 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.170
 energy we take a little momentum 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.559
 to better adjust the keystroke 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:50.039
 vim and that's it core revealed it's just 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.750
 he uses is there and we work on it 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.510
 Scrap this agreement destroys core 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.690
 destroyed and on and on will start the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.420
 shooting the supap to the wat or the way where the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.699
 ham is actually the difficulty starts to 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.409
 to get to the v10 is that it will be necessary 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.260
 to hit real targets it will have to 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.330
 to make speak the precision the speed 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.240
 beautiful ok ok we start a little bit 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.290
 understand the stuff the magnificent pope 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.280
 we have no time we have 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.890
 now we do not have the time we have 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.229
 not the ideal time no the asnl judged 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.780
 To hesitate too much I find hesitated in Mexico 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.549
 to the superb we had revealed he is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.930
 right here and we have it right and have the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.430
 default or there we are what they do and 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.020
 what they do is what we do not take 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.390
 risk we prefer the play safe is 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.880
 magnificent magnificent law destroys us 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.140
 once again 620 4000 points and we 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.840
 is hot I think it is unstoppable 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.620
 currently waite 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.970
 yeah but it becomes a body 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.040
 it's not the same game at all 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.890
 start actually there I believe friends that 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.710
 I will have to abandon you because our 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.420
 vessel within two hours scrapes me 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.200
 not go out in a few moments 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:01.350
 gold do not have these missiles to the con but 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.350
 no wait I really have to start again 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.130
 what is this good game then for this 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.830
 video I'm still going to try to go 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.680
 at level 10 this is something that I 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.570
 you have to watch his two horses 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.460
 and you, the purists, but there he 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.800
 marries the magnificent magnificent dodge 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.180
 hayal nucleus that revealed and half turn one 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.100
 do not have the times we do not have the time 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.440
 does not have the time and and that's core 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.730
 destroyed once again the song I 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.710
 have just played old games with a 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.240
 only backup of everything is super 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.260
 parboiled again start the whole story 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.760
 that is 15 hours of play 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.140
 in fact but we must not make a return 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.520
 because otherwise that's what happens to you 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.970
 make a comeback but suddenly I do not know 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.790
 how to do it but there are still some 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.040
 missiles 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.040
 what are these jules level 9 these parties 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.730
 had stopped carbon foutage of mouth 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.730
 there are seven thousand club 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.810
 but then there but I do not know 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.130
 how it is possible to win and the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.410
 this is the level 10 that will be 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.790
 reveal before your eyes level 10 is 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.860
 what the property says at least in the box 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.060
 the scales you know very much you know 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.880
 like me we're going to die but it's 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.230
 what's that but please stop 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.420
 what is it that this friend is 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.150
 it is this ongoing 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.620
 oh there there but what a nightmare it is 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.660
 a real nightmare what's going on 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:29.600
 today I do not want to die 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.950
 no no but no it's forty 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.620
 minutes that I play this game but it's 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.970
 not possible your future idiom what to say 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.820
 of play at the base we were gone for 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.450
 to have fun and then it's gone in the future 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.340
 idiom this requirement we thought that 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.380
 the one to be funny and in fact it's he 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.390
 turns out that it's downright nil it's 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.230
 to say that if you do not have 7000 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.930
 hours in front of you you will not be able 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.040
 never finish this game without redoing 5 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.640
 billion times level 1 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.640
 this is simply 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:09.760
 go fight we fight to drown them or 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:14.200
 lyon and the nucleus no no we have described this 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.580
 described me in Algeria we act we managed 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.220
 it remains more than the word yu nan but 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.470
 unattainable in addition to this core the blade 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.540
 and little aces did this game but it's 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.680
 big sick 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.919
 look at the slowness of the trick you can even 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.690
 not move is but I swear to you 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.120
 if we can not kill the kernel 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.940
 there I think I stop the videos all 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.110
 simply 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.690
 as long as it's super god we can not get 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.810
 move in there no I 'm going 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.810
 die 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.979
 stop stop i use su in more is 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.210
 but I can not do more of this game, but 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.860
 wait this time we will not click any 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.280
 but both still live for a 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.600
 core of discontent that apples on 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.840
 can not him but we can not go to 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:09.770
 middle we can not have we honored all 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:12.440
 this chance i 'm going to do one last 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.380
 try one last try or not but 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.949
 after that if we miss it we got the 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.720
 five in a row it was superb 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.520
 superb we made a stroke of genius one 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:29.539
 and the what do we do to 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:32.810
 moment there frankly we're hot there 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:37.120
 we are really hot you do not close 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:40.900
 redo even to whores 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.000
 I signed the guy who invented that but 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:49.840
 in time but I shoot it 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:52.810
 do not even pose and one is completely 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.110
 lost in addition where are we to 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.110
 narrow 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:14.090
 Both have or fucking my joystick 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.050
 so already we will start by closing 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.669
 this app crappy then what we 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:25.379
 will do is we go in settings 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:27.539
 hockey and suppress it and die but 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:31.529
 go to hell please morals and do not 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:33.330
 never come back i hate you i hate you 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:36.020
 no but it's not possible to make a 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.490
 game as bad it's impossible 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.289
 it was the worst game ever played 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.029
 and thank you all for watching this 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.139
 video about this game no one if you pay neither 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:45.689
 never play it for your good 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:49.039
 michou and never thank you everything has separated 

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:49.039
