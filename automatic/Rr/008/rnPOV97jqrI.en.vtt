in the game doesn't even hint at how to
kill<00:03:32.540> them<00:03:32.720> um<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:34.430> other<00:03:34.459> thing<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:35.209> is<00:03:35.510> that

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
kill them um the other thing is is that

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.750 
kill them um the other thing is is that
sometimes<00:03:36.770> you'll<00:03:36.980> be<00:03:37.100> left<00:03:37.280> wandering

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
sometimes you'll be left wandering

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.880 
sometimes you'll be left wandering
through<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:37.970> level<00:03:38.330> without<00:03:39.140> knowing<00:03:39.709> where

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
through a level without knowing where

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.010 
through a level without knowing where
you're<00:03:40.010> going<00:03:40.400> or<00:03:40.580> what<00:03:40.670> you're<00:03:41.000> doing<00:03:41.120> so<00:03:41.989> you

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
you're going or what you're doing so you

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.360 
you're going or what you're doing so you
won't<00:03:42.440> be<00:03:42.530> able<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.739> find<00:03:42.830> a<00:03:42.950> way<00:03:43.070> out<00:03:43.100> of<00:03:43.220> the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
won't be able to find a way out of the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.760 
won't be able to find a way out of the
level<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:44.080> you'll<00:03:45.080> be<00:03:45.230> left<00:03:45.410> sort<00:03:45.680> of

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
level and you'll be left sort of

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.830 
level and you'll be left sort of
scrambling<00:03:46.160> around<00:03:46.340> looking<00:03:47.000> for<00:03:47.030> everything

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
scrambling around looking for everything

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.440 
scrambling around looking for everything
and<00:03:47.959> nothing<00:03:48.950> will<00:03:49.040> be<00:03:49.130> there<00:03:49.310> it's<00:03:50.239> kind<00:03:50.420> of

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
and nothing will be there it's kind of

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.990 
and nothing will be there it's kind of
frustrating<00:03:50.600> but<00:03:51.340> 8<00:03:52.340> out<00:03:52.520> of<00:03:52.550> 10<00:03:52.760> it's

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
frustrating but 8 out of 10 it's

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.610 
frustrating but 8 out of 10 it's
definitely<00:03:53.630> worth<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.870> playthrough<00:03:54.260> i'm<00:03:54.470> not

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
definitely worth a playthrough i'm not

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.900 
definitely worth a playthrough i'm not
sure<00:03:54.830> if<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:54.980> was<00:03:55.070> worth<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.280> fifty<00:03:55.640> dollars

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
sure if it was worth the fifty dollars

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.780 
sure if it was worth the fifty dollars
we<00:03:56.030> paid<00:03:56.239> for<00:03:56.510> it<00:03:56.540> but<00:03:57.440> it<00:03:57.860> was<00:03:58.220> definitely<00:03:58.459> an

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
we paid for it but it was definitely an

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.300 
we paid for it but it was definitely an
enjoyable<00:03:59.239> game<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:00.500> far<00:04:00.709> replay<00:04:01.130> value

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
enjoyable game and so far replay value

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.780 
enjoyable game and so far replay value
is<00:04:02.620> it<00:04:03.620> depends<00:04:03.920> on<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.070> kind<00:04:04.220> of<00:04:04.340> person<00:04:04.700> you

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
is it depends on the kind of person you

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.550 
is it depends on the kind of person you
are<00:04:04.940> if<00:04:04.970> you're<00:04:05.270> a<00:04:05.300> math<00:04:05.720> dot<00:04:05.959> c<00:04:06.200> and<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:06.410> need

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
are if you're a math dot c and you need

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.530 
are if you're a math dot c and you need
to<00:04:06.650> collect<00:04:06.800> everything<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.700> you<00:04:08.300> want<00:04:08.450> your

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
to collect everything and you want your

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.790 
to collect everything and you want your
percentage<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.080> be<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.200> hundred<00:04:09.350> percent<00:04:09.500> you

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
percentage to be a hundred percent you

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.500 
percentage to be a hundred percent you
need<00:04:09.950> every<00:04:10.250> memory<00:04:10.430> in<00:04:10.640> every<00:04:10.880> item<00:04:11.030> in<00:04:11.239> every

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.900 
need every memory in every item in every
everything<00:04:12.070> then<00:04:13.070> chances<00:04:13.459> are<00:04:13.580> you'll

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
everything then chances are you'll

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.130 
everything then chances are you'll
probably<00:04:14.090> have<00:04:14.269> some<00:04:14.510> fun<00:04:14.630> playing<00:04:14.930> through

probably have some fun playing through

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.349 
probably have some fun playing through
it<00:04:15.230> again<00:04:15.320> but<00:04:15.709> if<00:04:16.010> you<00:04:16.280> aren't<00:04:16.640> like<00:04:16.970> me<00:04:17.239> and

replay value not much changes your

replay value not much changes your
second<00:04:28.790> go<00:04:28.880> through<00:04:29.180> which<00:04:29.810> kind<00:04:30.050> of<00:04:30.110> sucks

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
second go through which kind of sucks

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.189 
second go through which kind of sucks
but<00:04:31.090> it's<00:04:32.090> still<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.360> good<00:04:32.540> game<00:04:32.750> I<00:04:32.960> would

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
but it's still a good game I would

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.770 
but it's still a good game I would
honestly<00:04:33.380> buy<00:04:34.039> it<00:04:34.100> used<00:04:34.490> from<00:04:34.970> someplace<00:04:35.240> or

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
honestly buy it used from someplace or

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.810 
honestly buy it used from someplace or
wait<00:04:36.530> till<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.770> price<00:04:36.979> lowers<00:04:37.430> from<00:04:37.699> the

wait till the price lowers from the
almost<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.330> think<00:04:38.600> it's<00:04:38.720> 55<00:04:38.810> something<00:04:39.500> so<00:04:39.620> it's

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
almost I think it's 55 something so it's

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.830 
almost I think it's 55 something so it's
almost<00:04:39.830> sixty<00:04:40.220> dollars<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.789> wait<00:04:41.449> to<00:04:41.539> the<00:04:41.630> price

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
almost sixty dollars I wait to the price

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.270 
almost sixty dollars I wait to the price
lowers<00:04:42.139> of<00:04:42.289> it<00:04:42.380> because<00:04:42.620> I'm<00:04:42.740> not<00:04:42.889> sure<00:04:43.130> it's

lowers of it because I'm not sure it's
