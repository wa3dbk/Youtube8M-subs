00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 if this can cost military work 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.450
 should cost him so he should 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.519
 costarle look if we stick to the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.190
 football performance I think what 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.559
 that came was congratulation for your cup 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.240
 gold gained half a belly and with 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.210
 Many 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.340
 asegunes with the obvious arbitral help 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.990
 in the match against panama I want me 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.180
 explain what happened to your team in a 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.529
 year because if it would be a minor performance 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.300
 I think that responsibility of course 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.789
 also from the players that happened with 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.279
 Herrera with sail with Oribe because not 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.989
 You recover with Layun what happened to your 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.970
 team if you give us an accurate diagnosis 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.940
 well we can understand that game low 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.010
 we can decide that you are still the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.540
 October party , very important for the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.519
 he wins that he gives them the confederations 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.980
 start the World Cup tie and 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.809
 let's see what is your performance you 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.940
 process is not is not respect a process 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.530
 nothing else because if it's where it's going 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.210
 directed that process 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.180
 I think that was what came now 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.619
 it's your only miguel herrera interrupting you 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.960
 your process because we like 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:03.690
 We can not allow the federation 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.700
 Mexican soccer hold as a technical 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.619
 your main team to someone who 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.350
 if it goes to the court but for 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.479
 I am really elemental and with everything and 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.119
 that I think herrera with its ups and downs 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.640
 as a coach of the national team he has 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.710
 good work on the court 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.770
 but in this case there has to be for 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.990
 supposed hard hand and common sense that is 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.659
 you as a manager if not me not so 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.290
 no way accept a situation of 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.450
 these pieces there have been cases of 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.430
 technicians I wanted nothing more and generated 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.950
 these more than you owe 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.710
 remember one ricardo the volpe with fries 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.930
 when he led people angels where 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.800
 hold on to blows the technician with game 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.110
 and another from roberto saporiti with con ivo 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:59.100
 Basay but you do not talk about technicians of the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:00.810
 select something that happened to the code 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.690
 of ethics so that later we talk about it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.130
 his goal and louis the code of ethics is very 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.479
 of course today we were investigating that 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.000
 says the Mexican football federation and in 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.250
 Article 12 says the members of 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.709
 the operation my channel soccer affiliates and 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.690
 third parties involved are obliged to 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.030
 speak with respect towards the media 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.940
 of communication always providing 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.170
 clear and truthful information in attachment to 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.840
 rules 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.200
 I saw people who think about this, Luis 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.330
 Roberto did not want to comment previously 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.400
 that also involves managers and 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.470
 clear managers who are in plan 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.819
 general because there has also been 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.260
 managers and pressures that have come down to 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.420
 hit the referee they remember or they 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.890
 declare what I wanted to refer to in 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.110
 Regarding the subject, notice that you have to 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.880
 difficult is to have the glory in hand 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.880
 as I was commenting yesterday and roberto 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.260
 it accentuated it to have the glory andrés 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.300
 saved to shoot the penalty and 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.030
 soft so that the pot or fat and 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.850
 yes Andres was not sure to do that 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.610
 Miguel from the bench who already said 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.769
 publicly I do not need to see a 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.530
 repetition because I know it was not a penalty 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.840
 I'm a coach and he called Andrew 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.280
 saved that decided to make the decision 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.069
 to protect cannabis and I 'll call 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.350
 André that are going to make us do 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.860
 new you have outside you are going to deliver it 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.290
 or are you going to put it you think Miguel 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.970
 then there may have been andres 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.430
 saved as captain the decision of 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.780
 go solo and glory but also 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.480
 share the glory with miguel herrera 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.450
 so that he wins me I would have said 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.430
 I think you should deliver even though I 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.870
 throw up even if we do not reach the final you 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.060
 and I 'm going to glory for that 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.430
 fair play edition look how hard 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.950
 is to have the glory one day and a day 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.459
 next you can know hell then 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.459
 in the ship
