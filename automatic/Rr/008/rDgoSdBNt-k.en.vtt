00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.599 

in<00:01:16.729> order<00:01:16.969> to<00:01:16.999> do<00:01:17.719> this<00:01:17.960> secret<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:19.189> need<00:01:19.399> a

in order to do this secret you need a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:25.539 
in order to do this secret you need a
tool<00:01:19.909> which<00:01:20.869> is<00:01:20.899> a<00:01:21.319> video<00:01:21.859> camera<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:24.549> don't

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
camera because most of the mobile phones

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.270 
camera because most of the mobile phones
in<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.039> world's<00:01:31.459> can<00:01:31.700> shoot<00:01:31.909> video<00:01:33.280> probably

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
in the world's can shoot video probably

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.080 
in the world's can shoot video probably
you<00:01:35.090> might<00:01:35.299> have<00:01:35.799> additional<00:01:36.799> cameras<00:01:37.729> that

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
you might have additional cameras that

you might have additional cameras that
can<00:01:38.390> record<00:01:39.099> video<00:01:40.099> clips<00:01:40.520> or<00:01:40.819> it<00:01:41.060> can<00:01:41.179> use<00:01:41.329> the

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
can record video clips or it can use the

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.520 
can record video clips or it can use the
webcam<00:01:42.849> so<00:01:43.849> I<00:01:44.209> think<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:44.840> can<00:01:44.959> figure<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.319> out

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
webcam so I think you can figure it out

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.699 
webcam so I think you can figure it out
how<00:01:45.709> to<00:01:45.770> get<00:01:45.979> a<00:01:46.039> video<00:01:46.219> camera<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:47.409> it's<00:01:48.409> very

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
how to get a video camera and it's very

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:53.080 
how to get a video camera and it's very
simple<00:01:49.039> let<00:01:49.969> me<00:01:50.119> give<00:01:50.270> an<00:01:50.390> example<00:01:51.969> here<00:01:52.969> is

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
simple let me give an example here is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.539 
simple let me give an example here is

you've got the seer number so technique
is<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:28.340> have<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.810> use<00:02:30.800> your<00:02:30.830> video<00:02:31.370> cameras<00:02:31.940> to

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
is you have to use your video cameras to

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.160 
is you have to use your video cameras to
record<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:34.450> malfunction<00:02:35.450> conditions<00:02:36.050> are

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
record that malfunction conditions are

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.510 
record that malfunction conditions are
that<00:02:36.340> effectiveness<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.090> problem<00:02:39.520> okay

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
that effectiveness of that problem okay

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.820 
that effectiveness of that problem okay
so<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.210> have<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.510> use<00:02:41.810> your<00:02:41.840> video<00:02:42.320> camera<00:02:42.560> to

zero number ok this your number and
you're<00:03:06.290> going<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.500> put<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.739> pretty<00:03:06.980> close<00:03:07.160> to

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
you're going to put it pretty close to

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.070 
you're going to put it pretty close to
the<00:03:07.489> camera<00:03:07.880> that's<00:03:08.750> why<00:03:09.020> i<00:03:09.050> sear<00:03:09.380> number<00:03:09.770> here

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
the camera that's why i sear number here

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.070 
the camera that's why i sear number here
okay<00:03:12.940> probably<00:03:13.940> it's<00:03:14.060> not<00:03:14.209> so<00:03:14.360> clear<00:03:14.570> about<00:03:14.900> if

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
okay probably it's not so clear about if

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.080 
okay probably it's not so clear about if
you<00:03:15.170> use<00:03:15.350> your<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:16.190> know<00:03:16.310> iphone<00:03:16.790> camera

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
you use your you know iphone camera

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.330 
you use your you know iphone camera
because<00:03:17.420> my<00:03:17.930> camera's<00:03:18.440> only<00:03:18.709> 1.3<00:03:19.190> megapixel

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
because my camera's only 1.3 megapixel

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.330 
because my camera's only 1.3 megapixel
so<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.090> probably<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.890> may<00:03:24.010> need<00:03:24.069> a<00:03:24.190> better

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
so you probably you may need a better

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.490 
so you probably you may need a better
cameras<00:03:24.940> probably<00:03:25.239> bet<00:03:25.629> the<00:03:25.810> cameras<00:03:26.230> on<00:03:26.379> your
