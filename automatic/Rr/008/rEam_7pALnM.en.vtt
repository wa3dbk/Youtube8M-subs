00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.610
 line I hope you are very good here 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.470
 where I live would be a little bit like 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:10.280
 cloudy like he wants to rain like that 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.220
 yes I do not and it is and how I'm dressed 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.990
 in today I have a maxi 3am that 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.929
 I love I love it because it's the 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.150
 Maxis are comfortable they are spacious nothing you 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.390
 annoying nothing squeezes you nothing to see 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.429
 This dress has a beautiful ornament on 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.800
 the front and all this part 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.899
 here under the bust is an elastic that 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.269
 logically orna blum very beautiful and then 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:35.090
 all the fabric falls from here down 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:37.219
 very nice the long I think that I 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.690
 it's perfect because not your way if not 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.219
 you are stepping on the dress you do not have left 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.039
 short who walks this kind of dresses 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.250
 because they are comfortable dressing rooms are 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.620
 as relaxed and that's why I love them 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.600
 very much the length as I was 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.399
 commenting on a normal length that leaves you 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.870
 see the dahlias now if you go down for a 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.760
 place a little more dressing and want 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.589
 use machetes logically in shoes 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.809
 It must be a little bit smarter for 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.070
 so that you also look more elegant 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.230
 in this case studying with some 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.460
 flat sandals but I love me 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.490
 they love now that they watch the video 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.119
 and the earrings are some earrings this 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.790
 of little black stones, very simple 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.000
 Daisy Chain with my cristito and ring 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.490
 pyramid 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.220
 ok guys I hope you like the video 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.500
 this maxi tutorial I'm 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.000
 making these videos so that 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.550
 people who have for example if so 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.250
 little bit of weight or this that is not 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.200
 stagnate in bringing a single fashion to all 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.150
 the fashion that you want to wear 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.490
 known people who are involved nothing 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.500
 more wear trousers trousers not 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.570
 They want to wear a skirt, not because they do not know 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.360
 they see that they do not want to wear shorts 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.100
 no no who said that we can use everything 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.990
 what we want because we are the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.060
 that we do the dress tests something if 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.490
 you feel comfortable is for you if 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.280
 some reason you do not feel comfortable not 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.800
 use it, do not use it because that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.180
 discomfort as I tell them is transmitted 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.280
 when you are not doing something that 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.170
 It's not comfortable that you're not comfortable if you 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.970
 transmits I hope you like it very much 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.759
 the video girls already know crimes up 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.110
 and I leave you with the maxxi 3 video that 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.450
 is what I am using today 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.000
 that I am very well and see you before 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.430
 to leave I want to send a kiss to me 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.080
 brother dear jimmy if you're watching me 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.970
 giving a kiss I love you too 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.890
 very much last week 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.130
 unfortunately I had to be 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.260
 visiting in new jersey 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.660

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.100
 gather and spend better moments but I 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.350

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.340

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.340

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.810
