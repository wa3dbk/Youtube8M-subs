00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
washable so you can take these off and
actually<00:01:52.380> throw<00:01:52.590> them<00:01:52.770> into<00:01:52.890> your<00:01:53.549> washing

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
actually throw them into your washing

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.760 
actually throw them into your washing
machine<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.149> wash<00:01:54.659> them<00:01:54.990> which<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.619> pretty

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
machine and wash them which is pretty

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.380 
machine and wash them which is pretty
cool<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.340> second<00:01:56.640> thing<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> sound

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
cool the second thing is the sound

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.690 
cool the second thing is the sound
quality<00:01:57.869> was<00:01:58.049> actually<00:01:58.680> very<00:01:58.860> good<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.280> thought

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
quality was actually very good I thought

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.280 
quality was actually very good I thought
especially<00:01:59.880> for<00:02:00.450> something<00:02:00.600> anyway<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:00.990> have

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
especially for something anyway you have

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.289 
especially for something anyway you have
its<00:02:01.590> water-resistant<00:02:02.579> splash<00:02:02.820> resistant

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
its water-resistant splash resistant

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.300 
its water-resistant splash resistant
that<00:02:03.420> you're<00:02:03.540> gonna<00:02:03.630> get<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.020> lower<00:02:04.950> sound

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
that you're gonna get a lower sound

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.920 
that you're gonna get a lower sound
quality<00:02:05.820> from<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.119> headphones<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.719> think

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
quality from the headphones but I think

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.809 
quality from the headphones but I think
they<00:02:07.200> did<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> really<00:02:07.649> good<00:02:07.920> job<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.310> actually

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
they did a really good job in actually

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.059 
they did a really good job in actually
giving<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.660> good<00:02:10.050> solid<00:02:10.229> sound<00:02:10.530> was<00:02:10.739> now<00:02:10.890> of

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
giving you good solid sound was now of

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.790 
giving you good solid sound was now of
