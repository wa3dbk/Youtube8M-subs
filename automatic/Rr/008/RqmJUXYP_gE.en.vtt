00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:10.640
 good as I said in my prediction the 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:14.930
 fight in the borm against frames 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:18.380
 everything was as you saw 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.460
 he already stood there and gave him a 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.460
 diving deputation 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:29.770
 the American why and why are you 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.990
 stopped front 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.990
 in what people do not want to understand 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.200
 Marco has tremendous boxing to be able to 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.140
 come out from the outside the sides handle 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.320
 the distances 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:49.660
 and make life miserable 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:54.120
 the dragon did not stop frontally began 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.810
 to the body and to master it milan 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.720
 easily 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.260
 is what is divine is local is what 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.260
 I was commenting on the fight 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.650
 vanes martirosyan against erislandy lara 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:13.040
 that they go is I wanted the wing to separate 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.020
 as of frame he was stopped aerial around 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.000
 if you can not win a fight the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.280
 fight has to find the solution and the 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.770
 final to those who regretted the hand in 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.640
 bonn continued his career of sea a rock 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:30.120
 not boxing marketing to beat 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.260
 they board but the strategy 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.710
 fails and then nobody gets frontal to 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.250
 exchange blows 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.190
 the other day he got over it very easy very 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.390
 easy 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:51.140

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.210
 hour and a half do you have someone if 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.650
 dancer 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.640
 professional and then I'm 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.640

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:09.640

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.920
 music 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.750
 at a global level that is very good and 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.989

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.550
 I have worked with these people directly 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.500
 but good years passed 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.840
 and I had not had that opportunity and 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.840
 now it's better to lopez 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.980

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.390
 they have very customers called equal to 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.040
 same 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.040
 It's convenient to go back to zero 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:52.120

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.700

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.489
 like to see a fight between 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.200
 the john boehner against a yuriorkis 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.420
 gamboa for example 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.349
 totally different 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.750
 get the love totally different or 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.550
 the yang zhi goes up a little bit more because 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.440
 tends to gain weight with the island and 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.040
 nothing and then there you are going to see 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.310
 really the style of Cuban school 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.270
 and all these things another other thing 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.270

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.919

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.919
 another that also was not a creator that 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:42.490

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:44.680
