00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.090
 they are basic motorcycles for very survival 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.620
 Easy to install 7 in the pit if not 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.230

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.050
 I leave you my forza tutorial video 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.440
 I work the description and I also 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.719
 I'll leave the link so they can go through 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.420
 mail fire and download the pack of mods 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.839
 basic for superior 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.120
 clicking on this link will open this 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.370
 page where you are going here where 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.120
 says double double 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.299
 and they download it in the downloaded thing they leave it 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.120
 on desktops they give the windows key 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.070
 + r 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.300
 which will open this strange where 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.030
 you who will write % app data by 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.150
 I'm going to accept 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.200
 and they go to the pointed minecraft and then 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.440
 they 're going to masters and they're in this folder 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.970
 you open in rare that I will leave you in 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.780
 this tutorial 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.770
 all these files arrived 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.690
 and he spends them in Prague 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.540
 knowing the past you will have him 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.670
 in the installed modes only the 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.880
 summarize back and enjoy them 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.160
 they will all be working to see the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.050
 characters in the cne and you only 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.940
 they have to press the letter r but 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.160
 first they have to put the course on top 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.190
 for example I put the cursor over 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.890
 my folder wounds and squeeze of and ready 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.430
 you will see the ripple of the part of life 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.630
 it sounds weird but 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:10.229
 to change them they ordered us is super 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.230
 easy to use and all the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.710
 ready survival serves as much as for 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.420
 play alone as to play with a being the 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.350
 dam and tends that aitor serves to 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.080
 prepared pvp and if there is a server that 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.850
 he has survival and they are going to investigate 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.310
 in the minimum race to mark the 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.790
 places and not get lost so easy 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.330
 as it was before in the micro very well 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.790
 but you liked this video 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.790

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.070
