you do is you just push them into the
soil<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> tip<00:00:46.710> sticking<00:00:47.219> out<00:00:47.340> like

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.930 
so like I say about six inches apart
couldn't<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.410> easier<00:00:53.600> alright<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.820> then<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
couldn't be easier alright so then it

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.810 
couldn't be easier alright so then it
just<00:00:57.090> fly<00:00:57.329> along<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.719> row<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.140> that

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
just fly along your row like that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
chucking them in oh my soil is a bit dry

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.429 
chucking them in oh my soil is a bit dry
acts<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> blimp<00:01:02.250> hasn't<00:01:02.520> ran<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.120> yonks

sticking out

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.110 
sticking out
sometimes<00:01:32.770> but<00:01:33.190> birds<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:33.700> things<00:01:33.910> are<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.090> bit

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
sometimes but birds of things are a bit

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.850 
sometimes but birds of things are a bit
curious<00:01:34.450> I<00:01:34.780> think<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:35.020> worms<00:01:35.410> and<00:01:35.680> they<00:01:35.740> do

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
curious I think that worms and they do

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.340 
curious I think that worms and they do
sometimes<00:01:36.370> pull<00:01:36.880> them<00:01:37.030> out<00:01:37.120> so<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:38.050> just<00:01:38.200> have

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
sometimes pull them out so you just have

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.420 
sometimes pull them out so you just have
to<00:01:38.440> replace<00:01:38.590> them<00:01:40.590> really<00:01:41.590> it's<00:01:41.830> as<00:01:41.980> simple<00:01:42.130> as

to replace them really it's as simple as

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.160 
to replace them really it's as simple as
that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
that

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.850 
that
couldn't<00:01:44.170> be<00:01:44.260> easier<00:01:45.660> absolutely<00:01:46.860> easiest

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
couldn't be easier absolutely easiest
