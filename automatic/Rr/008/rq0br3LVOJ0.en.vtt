00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
the first step on designing robots was

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.609 
the first step on designing robots was
we<00:01:28.009> did<00:01:28.159> like<00:01:28.399> 40<00:01:28.909> 50<00:01:29.149> silhouettes<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:30.170> all<00:01:30.439> the

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
we did like 40 50 silhouettes of all the

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.520 
we did like 40 50 silhouettes of all the
robots<00:01:31.149> and<00:01:32.149> we<00:01:32.210> just<00:01:32.720> looked<00:01:32.899> at<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.170> cyllage

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
robots and we just looked at the cyllage

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.080 
robots and we just looked at the cyllage
and<00:01:33.710> I<00:01:33.799> said<00:01:34.009> this<00:01:34.189> one's<00:01:34.430> good<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:34.700> one's

good this one's good and then we would

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.499 
good this one's good and then we would
grab<00:01:37.280> that<00:01:37.310> silhouette<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.210> start

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
grab that silhouette and start

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.749

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
flat surfaces are made of a lot of

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.830 
flat surfaces are made of a lot of
plating<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.959> in<00:02:54.440> between<00:02:54.709> those<00:02:55.459> things<00:02:56.060> you

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
plating and in between those things you

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
plating and in between those things you
see<00:02:57.080> this<00:02:57.380> intricate<00:02:58.010> machine<00:02:58.670> moving

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
see this intricate machine moving

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.890 
see this intricate machine moving
Pistons<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.069> levers<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.000> gears<00:03:02.060> that<00:03:02.750> are

creating<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.620> mechanical<00:03:04.580> movement<00:03:05.140> we

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
creating the mechanical movement we

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.490 
creating the mechanical movement we
reveal<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.950> level<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.880> design<00:03:08.269> only<00:03:08.630> in

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
reveal that level of design only in

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.390 
reveal that level of design only in
certain<00:03:09.950> areas<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:11.750> gives<00:03:12.049> a<00:03:12.290> frequency<00:03:13.220> to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
certain areas that gives a frequency to

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.160 
certain areas that gives a frequency to
a<00:03:13.430> robot<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.360> haven't<00:03:14.750> seen<00:03:14.989> in

we really wanted to design this make us
to<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.840> robots<00:03:25.740> that<00:03:25.860> would<00:03:26.010> make<00:03:26.250> us<00:03:26.490> excited

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
to be robots that would make us excited

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.200 
to be robots that would make us excited
