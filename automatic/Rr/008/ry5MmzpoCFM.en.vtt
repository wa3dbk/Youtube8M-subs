00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
and what I've recently got for it one of

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.550 
and what I've recently got for it one of
my<00:00:22.619> buddies<00:00:22.800> gave<00:00:23.189> me<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.850> body<00:00:24.119> actually<00:00:24.560> he

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
my buddies gave me this body actually he

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.040 
my buddies gave me this body actually he
had<00:00:25.650> painted<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.160> up<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:27.210> body<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.750> paint

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
had painted it up the body the paint

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.689 
had painted it up the body the paint
didn't<00:00:28.349> really<00:00:28.590> stick<00:00:28.830> as<00:00:29.010> well<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.609> can

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
didn't really stick as well as you can

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.460 
didn't really stick as well as you can
see<00:00:29.760> there<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.330> just<00:00:30.510> kind<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.779> was

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
see there and it just kind of was

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.440 
see there and it just kind of was
globbed<00:00:31.740> around<00:00:32.070> there<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.790> think<00:00:33.120> he<00:00:33.300> just

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
globbed around there so I think he just

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.090 
globbed around there so I think he just
kind<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.719> slapped<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.860> didn't

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
kind of slapped it on there and didn't

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.540 
kind of slapped it on there and didn't
really<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> care<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.210> paint<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.989> too<00:00:37.140> well

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
really have a care to paint it too well

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.729 
really have a care to paint it too well
just<00:00:38.550> kind<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> did<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> rough<00:00:39.239> job<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:40.290> I

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
just kind of did a rough job on it but I

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.190 
just kind of did a rough job on it but I
mean<00:00:41.670> he<00:00:41.940> does<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> lot<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.420> other<00:00:42.629> stuff<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
mean he does a lot of other stuff and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.930 
mean he does a lot of other stuff and
he's<00:00:43.649> painted<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.070> body<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.340> lot<00:00:44.520> better<00:00:44.670> than

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
he's painted a body a lot better than

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.110 
he's painted a body a lot better than
this<00:00:45.059> before<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:46.680> guess<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:47.820> was<00:00:47.969> just

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
this before so I guess this one was just

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.180 
this before so I guess this one was just
a<00:00:48.329> running<00:00:48.899> or<00:00:49.020> whatever<00:00:49.260> wasn't<00:00:50.010> clean

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
a running or whatever wasn't clean

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.240 
a running or whatever wasn't clean
properly<00:00:50.520> i'm<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:51.059> sure<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.270> anyway<00:00:52.230> yeah<00:00:53.129> as

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
properly i'm not sure but anyway yeah as

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.290 
properly i'm not sure but anyway yeah as
you<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.489> see<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.030> kind<00:00:54.270> of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
you can see there it's just kind of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.970 
you can see there it's just kind of
bubbling<00:00:54.510> around<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.110> stuff<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.500> doesn't

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
bubbling around and stuff it doesn't

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010 
bubbling around and stuff it doesn't
look<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> greatest<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:56.750> what<00:00:57.750> i'm<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:57.960> to

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
soon as these heat sink fins start to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.260 
soon as these heat sink fins start to
heat<00:02:23.290> up<00:02:23.319> at<00:02:23.620> all<00:02:23.790> dislocate<00:02:24.790> all<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.060> rubber
