I liked these also because they had this

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.629

to<00:01:05.780> use<00:01:06.640> these<00:01:07.640> are<00:01:07.850> my<00:01:07.970> choices<00:01:09.340> okay<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:11.030> to

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
to use these are my choices okay so to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.200 
to use these are my choices okay so to
begin<00:01:11.390> with<00:01:11.660> these<00:01:12.650> two<00:01:13.130> Reed's<00:01:13.430> were<00:01:13.910> stuck

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
begin with these two Reed's were stuck

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.110 
begin with these two Reed's were stuck
together<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:15.310> as<00:01:16.310> you<00:01:16.460> can<00:01:16.610> tell<00:01:16.850> they're

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
together and as you can tell they're

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.510 
together and as you can tell they're
much<00:01:17.330> thinner<00:01:17.870> than<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.320> other<00:01:18.350> two<00:01:18.830> so

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
much thinner than the other two so

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.240 
much thinner than the other two so
you're<00:01:19.610> gonna<00:01:19.760> want<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:20.270> small<00:01:20.860> thin<00:01:21.860> wreath

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
you're gonna want a small thin wreath

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.930 
you're gonna want a small thin wreath
and<00:01:23.830> since<00:01:24.830> these<00:01:24.980> were<00:01:25.160> stuck<00:01:25.400> together<00:01:25.550> I've

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
and since these were stuck together I've

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.020 
and since these were stuck together I've
had<00:01:26.090> to<00:01:26.330> but<00:01:26.780> if<00:01:27.410> they're<00:01:27.620> not<00:01:27.800> if<00:01:28.160> if<00:01:28.610> you

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
had to but if they're not if if you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.180 
had to but if they're not if if you
can't<00:01:29.270> buy<00:01:29.480> them<00:01:29.810> stuck<00:01:30.350> together

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
can't buy them stuck together

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.300 
can't buy them stuck together
they're<00:01:31.370> cut<00:01:31.490> in<00:01:31.520> mind<00:01:31.820> separately<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:33.310> then

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
they're cut in mind separately and then

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.680 
they're cut in mind separately and then
what<00:01:34.550> I<00:01:34.580> did<00:01:34.730> is<00:01:35.330> I<00:01:36.140> took<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:37.040> wreath<00:01:37.760> and<00:01:38.150> as

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
what I did is I took the wreath and as

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.570 
what I did is I took the wreath and as
you<00:01:38.900> can<00:01:39.080> see<00:01:39.410> now<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:39.980> might<00:01:40.220> want<00:01:40.400> to<00:01:40.430> wear

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
you can see now you might want to wear

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.840 
you can see now you might want to wear
gloves<00:01:40.790> for<00:01:41.000> this<00:01:42.310> because<00:01:43.310> I'm<00:01:43.430> going<00:01:43.670> to

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
gloves for this because I'm going to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.910 
gloves for this because I'm going to
squeeze<00:01:44.300> this<00:01:45.430> at<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.580> top<00:01:46.910> and<00:01:47.680> down<00:01:48.680> at<00:01:48.830> the

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
squeeze this at the top and down at the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.080 
squeeze this at the top and down at the
bottom<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.430> as<00:01:49.970> you<00:01:50.180> can<00:01:50.330> hear<00:01:51.520> it's<00:01:52.520> going<00:01:52.850> to

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
bottom and as you can hear it's going to

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.740 
bottom and as you can hear it's going to
crack<00:01:55.570> but<00:01:56.570> what<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:56.900> does<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:59.090> makes<00:01:59.420> it

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
crack but what that does is it makes it

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.430 
crack but what that does is it makes it
into<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.470> shape<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.010> bunny<00:02:01.220> here<00:02:02.440> just

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
into the shape of the bunny here just

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.619 
into the shape of the bunny here just
like<00:02:03.620> that<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:05.180> now<00:02:05.210> you<00:02:05.780> have<00:02:06.080> two<00:02:06.560> funny<00:02:06.800> ears

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:07.629 
like that so now you have two funny ears

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:10.839 
like that so now you have two funny ears
if<00:02:08.629> they<00:02:08.869> still<00:02:09.229> need<00:02:09.409> to<00:02:09.440> be<00:02:09.649> squeezed<00:02:10.489> in<00:02:10.729> a

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
if they still need to be squeezed in a

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.910 
if they still need to be squeezed in a
little<00:02:11.090> bit<00:02:11.180> tighter<00:02:11.420> I'm<00:02:11.959> going<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.409> wrap

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
little bit tighter I'm going to wrap

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.750 
little bit tighter I'm going to wrap
them<00:02:13.190> with<00:02:13.250> wire<00:02:13.700> right<00:02:14.060> here<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.660> will
