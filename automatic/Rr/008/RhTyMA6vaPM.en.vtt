00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.620
 let's see a work on how to solve 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.690
 problems in mention can be done even at home 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.669
 this client that was made or a job of 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:12.129
 decor 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.929
 level and so you are not localized and it occurred to you 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.400
 pass the equator before that area 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.900
 what happened 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.509
 the whole part of the peak was stained 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.619
 and now the problem is for us 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.220
 match 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.579
 all this color 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.990
 so what we did 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.630
 die we knew we had to make this color to the tips 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.280
 that this mixed 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.580
 up the cusp and that also we of eggs per hundred 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.940
 is to turn off that call iso 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.730
 with an ash color there is human power 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.100
 see the difference 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.040
 and what we did was work only the part of the peak with 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.750
 separating papers 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.830
 and we prepare in the dark color we apply 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.360
 a 5 8 colate 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.450
 we add three centimeters of short red and three centimeters of chestnut 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.280
 Dark 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.640
 we did not reprimand him but we only worked 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.260
 the color one hundred in one step 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.730
 and in the percent wicks 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.440
 that were very close to marisa 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.030
 we apply a 7 13 of alfaparf that concealed it can turn off 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.430
 percent at sea and bonus will arise that are ash the wick there can 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.330
 give the work is finished 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.070
 changed the difference and I was all loves and that fired me the preparation 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.130
 of the dark color 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.960
 unified with the rest of the color 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.960
 it was like that they can see the final work 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.890
 as it was before 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.470
 and the after work 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.870
 in a job that was very sexy or 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.570
 to perform but it is important to always have 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.479
 the know-how in colorimetry thank you very much
