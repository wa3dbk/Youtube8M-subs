00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
made it today because it just cleared

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.190 
made it today because it just cleared
customs<00:00:08.700> around<00:00:09.330> ten<00:00:09.660> o'clock<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:10.139> morning

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
customs around ten o'clock this morning

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.530 
customs around ten o'clock this morning
and<00:00:10.650> didn't<00:00:11.610> make<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.150> sorting

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
and didn't make it to the sorting

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.360 
and didn't make it to the sorting
facility<00:00:12.990> until<00:00:13.230> like<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.860> early<00:00:14.099> twelve

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370

o'clock
so<00:00:15.210> I'm<00:00:15.330> actually<00:00:15.570> surprised<00:00:16.170> they<00:00:16.410> decided

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
so I'm actually surprised they decided

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.300 
so I'm actually surprised they decided
to<00:00:17.310> deliver<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:18.380> this<00:00:19.380> one<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.770> from<00:00:19.949> amiami

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
to deliver this this one is from amiami

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.070 
to deliver this this one is from amiami
and<00:00:21.350> it<00:00:22.350> initially<00:00:22.859> started<00:00:22.890> with<00:00:23.689> me<00:00:24.689> trying

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
and it initially started with me trying

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.769 
and it initially started with me trying
to<00:00:25.199> buy<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> one<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.920> 100<00:00:26.310> scale<00:00:26.449> wild<00:00:27.449> burger

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
to buy a one to 100 scale wild burger

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.470 
to buy a one to 100 scale wild burger
and<00:00:28.160> because<00:00:29.160> shipping<00:00:29.369> was<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:29.970> freakin

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
and because shipping was so freakin

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.780 
and because shipping was so freakin
expensive<00:00:31.219> since<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.340> was<00:00:32.430> more<00:00:32.610> expensive

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
expensive since it was more expensive

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.479 
expensive since it was more expensive
than<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.149> figure<00:00:33.420> itself<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.989> decided<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.160> take

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
than the figure itself I decided to take

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.540 
than the figure itself I decided to take
a<00:00:35.760> couple<00:00:36.329> more<00:00:36.600> items<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:38.160> ended<00:00:38.460> up

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
spending like $200 on all this including

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.229 
spending like $200 on all this including
shipping<00:00:43.190> that's<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> US<00:00:44.730> dollar<00:00:44.940> so

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239

bought<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.949> with<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> code<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
bought this with the code it's like a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.929 
bought this with the code it's like a
lion<00:01:03.539> edger<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:06.080> guess<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.200> could<00:01:07.409> use<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.760> we<00:01:08.760> call

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
lion edger I guess I could use a we call

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.810 
lion edger I guess I could use a we call
it<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.210> hobby<00:01:09.540> knife<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.369> angled

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
it a hobby knife but this one is angled

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.030 
it a hobby knife but this one is angled
so<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.240> supposed<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.750> better<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.920> was

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
so it's supposed to be better and it was

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.810 
so it's supposed to be better and it was
only<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.390> 588<00:01:16.380> yen<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.820> looks

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
only like it's like 588 yen so looks

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.140 
only like it's like 588 yen so looks
pretty<00:01:21.060> cool<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.270> far<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:23.310> finally<00:01:23.880> decided

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
pretty cool so far and I finally decided

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.830 
pretty cool so far and I finally decided
to<00:01:24.509> buy<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.080> nipper<00:01:25.700> this<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> premium

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
to buy a nipper this one is a premium

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.710 
to buy a nipper this one is a premium
thin<00:01:28.080> blade<00:01:28.409> never<00:01:28.970> there<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> Tamiya<00:01:30.450> one

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
thin blade never there was a Tamiya one

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.690 
thin blade never there was a Tamiya one
but<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.200> was<00:01:32.119> yes<00:01:33.119> let's<00:01:33.840> see<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:35.280> thin<00:01:35.490> blade

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
but it was yes let's see the thin blade

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.410 
but it was yes let's see the thin blade
one<00:01:36.000> was<00:01:37.280> more<00:01:38.280> expensive<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
one was more expensive and then the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.870 
one was more expensive and then the
regular<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:39.869> was<00:01:40.110> out<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.409> stock<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.950> think<00:01:40.979> so

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
regular one was out of stock I think so

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.469 
regular one was out of stock I think so
I<00:01:41.909> got<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.329> one<00:01:42.390> instead<00:01:43.970> because<00:01:44.970> thinner

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
I got this one instead because thinner

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.289 
I got this one instead because thinner
the<00:01:45.689> blade<00:01:45.979> better<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.939> was<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.180> my

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the blade better it is it was in my

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.710 
the blade better it is it was in my
opinion

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.780

Ingram from pat labora I thought was

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.390 
Ingram from pat labora I thought was
pretty<00:02:58.220> cute<00:02:58.430> but<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:59.120> was<00:02:59.480> expecting<00:02:59.690> it<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.049> be

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
pretty cute but I was expecting it to be

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.090 
pretty cute but I was expecting it to be
unpainted<00:03:01.540> but<00:03:02.540> instead<00:03:02.930> it's<00:03:03.320> partially

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
unpainted but instead it's partially

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.750

already<00:03:08.440> pre-printed<00:03:09.489> so<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:10.640> means<00:03:10.880> I

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
already pre-printed so that means I

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.320 
already pre-printed so that means I
can't<00:03:11.299> really<00:03:11.540> paint<00:03:11.780> over<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.320> oh<00:03:13.090> yeah<00:03:14.090> I
