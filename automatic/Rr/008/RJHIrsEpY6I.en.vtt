doesn't<00:02:38.800> seem<00:02:38.920> worth<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.220> all<00:02:39.370> right<00:02:39.490> at<00:02:39.580> least

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
doesn't seem worth it all right at least

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.540 
doesn't seem worth it all right at least
I<00:02:39.850> can<00:02:39.910> play<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.390> other<00:02:40.480> envision<00:02:40.900> answer<00:02:41.170> and

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
I can play the other envision answer and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:57.520 
I can play the other envision answer and
still<00:02:42.550> hold<00:02:42.700> open<00:02:42.880> steel<00:02:43.180> sabotage

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.470 

and<00:02:57.680> into<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.459> course<00:02:58.670> should<00:02:58.880> be<00:02:58.910> totally

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
and into the course should be totally

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:09.750 
and into the course should be totally
sick<00:02:59.840> against<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:00.230> guy

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.820 

all<00:03:10.330> right<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.689> he's<00:03:10.810> not<00:03:10.989> hitting<00:03:11.200> land<00:03:11.470> so

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
all right and he's not hitting land so

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.619 
all right and he's not hitting land so
that's<00:03:12.129> pretty<00:03:12.849> much<00:03:12.939> the<00:03:13.090> best<00:03:13.299> thing<00:03:13.540> that

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
that's pretty much the best thing that

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:24.940 
that's pretty much the best thing that
can<00:03:13.689> happen

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.559 

here<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:25.970> can<00:03:26.920> either<00:03:28.060> narok<00:03:29.060> replica<00:03:29.450> or

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
here I can either narok replica or

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.089 
here I can either narok replica or
oculus<00:03:30.050> i<00:03:30.170> do<00:03:30.230> want<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.500> hold<00:03:30.650> up<00:03:30.739> in<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:30.920> steel

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
oculus i do want to hold up in the steel

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:39.000 
oculus i do want to hold up in the steel
sabotage

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.880 

um<00:03:41.260> they're<00:03:42.260> both<00:03:42.439> getting<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.739> same<00:03:42.860> amount

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
um they're both getting the same amount

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.979 
um they're both getting the same amount
of<00:03:43.069> damage<00:03:43.340> through<00:03:46.450> whatever<00:03:47.450> I'll<00:03:47.720> just<00:03:47.750> go

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
of damage through whatever I'll just go

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:59.960 
of damage through whatever I'll just go
into<00:03:48.140> our<00:03:48.230> replica

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.550 

looks<00:04:00.630> like<00:04:00.750> he's<00:04:00.870> still<00:04:00.990> not<00:04:01.140> drawing<00:04:01.350> Elaine

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
looks like he's still not drawing Elaine

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.190 
looks like he's still not drawing Elaine
I<00:04:01.710> could<00:04:02.040> steal<00:04:02.670> sabotage<00:04:03.180> this<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.600> keep<00:04:04.050> him

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
I could steal sabotage this and keep him

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.270 
I could steal sabotage this and keep him
from<00:04:04.290> drawing<00:04:04.530> into<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.740> land<00:04:07.070> plus<00:04:08.070> then<00:04:08.220> he

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
from drawing into a land plus then he

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.410 
from drawing into a land plus then he
doesn't<00:04:08.490> get<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.640> attack<00:04:08.880> of<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.060> glint<00:04:09.270> hawk

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
doesn't get to attack of this glint hawk

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.680 
doesn't get to attack of this glint hawk
Idol<00:04:11.060> but<00:04:12.060> i<00:04:12.120> think<00:04:12.300> i'm<00:04:12.360> going<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.510> let<00:04:12.570> him

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
Idol but i think i'm going to let him

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.680 
Idol but i think i'm going to let him
take<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.940> we're<00:04:14.940> just<00:04:15.090> putting<00:04:15.210> them<00:04:15.390> on<00:04:15.480> such

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
take it we're just putting them on such

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.720 
take it we're just putting them on such
a<00:04:15.720> now<00:04:16.500> that's<00:04:16.920> prob<00:04:17.100> about<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.370> wrong<00:04:17.489> call

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
a now that's prob about the wrong call

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.530 
a now that's prob about the wrong call
it's<00:04:18.150> probably<00:04:18.359> not<00:04:18.480> the<00:04:18.510> right<00:04:18.600> call<00:04:20.540> letting

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
it's probably not the right call letting

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.760 
it's probably not the right call letting
them<00:04:21.630> draw<00:04:21.750> on<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.900> land<00:04:22.079> is<00:04:22.200> pretty<00:04:22.560> much<00:04:22.710> the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
them draw on the land is pretty much the

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.290 
them draw on the land is pretty much the
worst<00:04:23.040> thing<00:04:23.280> we<00:04:23.370> can<00:04:23.490> do<00:04:23.640> alright<00:04:24.090> that

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
worst thing we can do alright that

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.370 
worst thing we can do alright that
probably<00:04:24.510> should<00:04:24.630> have<00:04:24.690> been<00:04:24.810> steel<00:04:24.960> sabotage

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
probably should have been steel sabotage

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.560 
probably should have been steel sabotage
but<00:04:25.710> i<00:04:25.940> just<00:04:26.940> know<00:04:27.060> there's<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:27.270> many<00:04:27.360> more

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
but i just know there's so many more

he's dead next turn if he can't put any
blockers<00:05:09.020> out<00:05:09.199> i'll<00:05:10.039> just<00:05:10.280> steal<00:05:10.430> sabotage

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
blockers out i'll just steal sabotage

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.920 
blockers out i'll just steal sabotage
any<00:05:11.180> blockers<00:05:13.090> he<00:05:14.090> could<00:05:14.330> hold<00:05:14.449> back<00:05:14.780> the

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
glint hawk idol this turn but then i can

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.719 
glint hawk idol this turn but then i can
just<00:05:16.970> bounce<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.630> glint<00:05:17.810> hawk<00:05:17.930> idol<00:05:18.259> and<00:05:18.729> that

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
just bounce the glint hawk idol and that

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.969 
just bounce the glint hawk idol and that
should<00:05:19.880> be<00:05:19.910> it<00:05:20.320> and<00:05:21.320> if<00:05:21.380> he<00:05:21.470> didn't<00:05:21.620> rip<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:21.800> land

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
should be it and if he didn't rip a land

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.120 
should be it and if he didn't rip a land
here<00:05:22.160> he's<00:05:22.250> probably<00:05:22.490> just<00:05:22.669> going<00:05:22.820> to<00:05:22.910> concede

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.300 

yep<00:05:28.130> okay<00:05:29.440> every<00:05:30.440> deck<00:05:30.590> looks<00:05:30.800> good<00:05:31.009> against

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
yep okay every deck looks good against

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.379 
yep okay every deck looks good against
one<00:05:31.430> that's<00:05:31.610> mad<00:05:31.729> a<00:05:31.789> screwed<00:05:32.060> and<00:05:32.210> we<00:05:32.270> weren't

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
one that's mad a screwed and we weren't

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.900 
one that's mad a screwed and we weren't
drawing<00:05:32.660> land<00:05:32.840> for<00:05:33.020> a<00:05:33.050> while<00:05:33.199> but<00:05:33.620> I<00:05:33.889> like<00:05:34.729> our

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
drawing land for a while but I like our

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.290 
drawing land for a while but I like our
I<00:05:34.940> like<00:05:35.330> our<00:05:35.479> cards<00:05:35.750> here<00:05:36.699> so<00:05:37.699> against

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
I like our cards here so against

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.439 
I like our cards here so against
artifacts<00:05:38.750> we<00:05:38.990> talked<00:05:39.229> about<00:05:39.410> the<00:05:39.710> Holt<00:05:39.919> order

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.460 

maybe<00:05:44.449> the<00:05:44.630> metallic<00:05:45.020> mastery<00:05:47.139> could<00:05:48.139> be<00:05:48.320> good

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
maybe the metallic mastery could be good

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.570 
maybe the metallic mastery could be good
I<00:05:48.740> don't<00:05:49.070> know<00:05:49.130> if<00:05:49.190> there's<00:05:49.310> anything<00:05:49.430> that's
