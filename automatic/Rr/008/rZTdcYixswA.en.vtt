00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
off with the shin guards themselves this

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
is the first major redesign we've seen

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.400 
is the first major redesign we've seen
to<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> Mercurial<00:00:45.210> light<00:00:45.390> line<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.170> last

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
to the Mercurial light line in the last

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.680 
to the Mercurial light line in the last
couple<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.860> years<00:00:47.219> visually<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> shin<00:00:48.390> guards

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
couple of years visually the shin guards

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.060 
couple of years visually the shin guards
are<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> little<00:00:49.020> bit<00:00:49.200> different<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.710> terms<00:00:49.739> of

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
are a little bit different in terms of

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.889 
are a little bit different in terms of
the<00:00:50.190> graphics<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.719> that

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the graphics on here you can see that

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.990 
the graphics on here you can see that
this<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.260> volte<00:00:52.920> yellow<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.430> hyper<00:00:53.670> punch

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
this one is volte yellow and hyper punch

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.490 
this one is volte yellow and hyper punch
so<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.539> volt<00:00:54.840> bordering<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
so you have that volt bordering the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.380 
so you have that volt bordering the
outside<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> shin<00:00:56.399> guard<00:00:56.640> then<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.210> kind

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
outside of the shin guard then it kind

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
outside of the shin guard then it kind
of<00:00:57.449> fades<00:00:57.719> towards<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> middle<00:00:58.559> your<00:00:58.949> hyper

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
right at the top and then you can see

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.870 
right at the top and then you can see
that<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.769> middle<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> shin<00:01:05.430> guard<00:01:05.670> is

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that the middle of the shin guard is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.850 
that the middle of the shin guard is
actually<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> translucent<00:01:07.080> plastic<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.770> you

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
actually a translucent plastic so you

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.679 
actually a translucent plastic so you
can<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.130> some<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> internals<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.150> they're

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
can see some of the internals if they're

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.240 
can see some of the internals if they're
really<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.470> looks<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> has<00:01:10.920> nothing<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
really just for looks it has nothing to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.130 
really just for looks it has nothing to
do<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.640> structural<00:01:12.030> integrity<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.900> just

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
do with the structural integrity or just

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.840 
do with the structural integrity or just
protective<00:01:13.590> elements<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> guard<00:01:14.490> itself

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
protective elements of the guard itself

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.030 
protective elements of the guard itself
if<00:01:15.030> they're<00:01:15.540> simply<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.049> look<00:01:16.200> cool<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
if they're simply to look cool and I

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.710 
if they're simply to look cool and I
think<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.430> Nike<00:01:17.820> has<00:01:18.000> accomplished<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
think that Nike has accomplished that

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.539 
think that Nike has accomplished that
with<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.439> new<00:01:19.619> design<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.400> good

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
with this new design it's a really good

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.060 
with this new design it's a really good

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
lateral side at the top just to provide

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.280 
lateral side at the top just to provide
that<00:01:35.850> little<00:01:36.060> bit<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.270> extra<00:01:36.689> coverage<00:01:36.840> and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
that little bit of extra coverage and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.899 
that little bit of extra coverage and
for<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.710> most<00:01:37.860> part<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.400> really<00:01:38.729> good

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
for the most part this is a really good

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.999 
for the most part this is a really good
shape<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.900> suitable<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.590> pretty<00:01:40.799> much

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
shape that is suitable for pretty much

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.050 
shape that is suitable for pretty much
99%<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.689> shin<00:01:43.140> shapes<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.890> sizes<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.430> this

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
99% of shin shapes and sizes so this

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
99% of shin shapes and sizes so this
fits<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.509> lot<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.780> people<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.380> well<00:01:46.530> part<00:01:46.890> of

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
fits a lot of people really well part of

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.499 
fits a lot of people really well part of
the<00:01:47.009> reason<00:01:47.280> why<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.700> don't<00:01:48.060> think<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> shape

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
the reason why I don't think the shape

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.300 
the reason why I don't think the shape
has<00:01:48.720> changed<00:01:49.079> much<00:01:49.229> even<00:01:49.890> though<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> design

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
has changed much even though the design

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.030 
has changed much even though the design
has<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:51.060> least<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.420> little<00:01:51.540> bit<00:01:51.720> as<00:01:52.170> far<00:01:52.560> as<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
has at least a little bit as far as the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.770 
has at least a little bit as far as the
shell<00:01:53.220> itself<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.700> concerned<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.329> plastic

shell itself is concerned it's a plastic

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660 
shell itself is concerned it's a plastic
shell<00:01:54.960> got<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.560> decent<00:01:55.740> thickness<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
shell got a decent thickness to it and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.340

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
as far as plastic shell shin guards are

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.260 
as far as plastic shell shin guards are
concerned<00:01:58.680> these<00:01:59.159> are<00:01:59.369> pretty<00:01:59.579> much<00:01:59.759> as<00:01:59.969> stiff

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
concerned these are pretty much as stiff

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.300 
concerned these are pretty much as stiff
and<00:02:00.420> rigid<00:02:00.509> as<00:02:00.930> they<00:02:01.140> come<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.979> terms<00:02:02.159> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and rigid as they come so in terms of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.649 
and rigid as they come so in terms of
protection<00:02:02.820> you're<00:02:02.939> going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> get<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> decent

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
amount from the shin guard did you get

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.940 
amount from the shin guard did you get
hit<00:02:05.640> directly<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.509> guard<00:02:06.719> itself<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
hit directly on the guard itself and

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.559 
hit directly on the guard itself and
again<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.700> feels<00:02:08.910> nice<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.390> solid

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
again it just feels nice and solid

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.630 
again it just feels nice and solid
especially<00:02:10.170> considering<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:10.739> $25<00:02:11.430> price

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.910 
keen is concerned there's no liner at
all<00:02:15.659> it's<00:02:15.870> pretty<00:02:16.019> much<00:02:16.200> straight<00:02:16.500> up<00:02:16.530> foam

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
all it's pretty much straight up foam

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.789 
all it's pretty much straight up foam
and<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:18.090> very<00:02:18.510> similar<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.080> what<00:02:19.230> we<00:02:19.379> got<00:02:19.409> on

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
and it's very similar to what we got on

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.320 
and it's very similar to what we got on
the<00:02:19.950> previous<00:02:20.340> model<00:02:20.549> but<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.209> major

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
the previous model but the major

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.030 
the previous model but the major
difference<00:02:21.480> here<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.140> actually<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.709> cutouts

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
difference here is actually the cutouts

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.039 
difference here is actually the cutouts
in<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.250> foam<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:24.030> foam<00:02:24.209> itself<00:02:24.540> isn't<00:02:24.750> quite

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
in the foam the foam itself isn't quite

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.570 
in the foam the foam itself isn't quite
as<00:02:25.170> dense<00:02:25.349> it's<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.650> little<00:02:25.830> bit<00:02:25.920> softer<00:02:26.400> this

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
as dense it's a little bit softer this

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.280 
as dense it's a little bit softer this
time<00:02:26.819> around<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.360> does<00:02:27.750> make<00:02:27.870> for<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.140> very

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
time around and does make for a very

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.990 
time around and does make for a very
comfortable<00:02:28.530> feel<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.340> because<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.819> its

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
comfortable feel and because of its

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.460 
comfortable feel and because of its
slight<00:02:30.239> softness<00:02:30.750> should<00:02:31.079> you<00:02:31.170> take<00:02:31.319> an

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
slight softness should you take an

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.410 
slight softness should you take an
impact<00:02:31.829> directly<00:02:32.069> position<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:33.180> going<00:02:33.360> to

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
impact directly position it's going to

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.479 
impact directly position it's going to
help<00:02:33.629> to<00:02:33.840> absorb<00:02:33.989> some<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.739> impact<00:02:35.159> make

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
help to absorb some of that impact make

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.130 
help to absorb some of that impact make
it<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.700> little<00:02:35.819> bit<00:02:35.970> more<00:02:36.150> protective<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
it a little bit more protective and

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.330 
it a little bit more protective and
what's<00:02:37.290> also<00:02:37.470> great<00:02:37.650> about<00:02:37.739> this<00:02:38.010> lack<00:02:38.310> of

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
what's also great about this lack of

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.220 
what's also great about this lack of
liner<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.420> going<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.569> maintain<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:40.019> nice

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
liner is it's going to maintain a nice

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.110 
liner is it's going to maintain a nice
lightweight<00:02:40.709> feel<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.280> shin<00:02:41.459> guard<00:02:41.700> they

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
lightweight feel to the shin guard they

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.899 
lightweight feel to the shin guard they
only<00:02:42.269> weigh<00:02:42.510> in<00:02:42.690> at<00:02:42.900> 2.3<00:02:43.680> ounces<00:02:43.709> it's<00:02:44.670> not

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
only weigh in at 2.3 ounces it's not

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.460 
only weigh in at 2.3 ounces it's not
going<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.150> absorb<00:02:45.269> any<00:02:45.629> water<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.200> for<00:02:46.349> that

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
going to absorb any water so for that

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.900 
going to absorb any water so for that
reason<00:02:46.530> they're<00:02:46.950> going<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.160> dry<00:02:47.370> very<00:02:47.400> quickly

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
reason they're going to dry very quickly

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.849 
reason they're going to dry very quickly
as<00:02:48.239> well<00:02:48.780> as<00:02:48.959> maintain<00:02:49.470> their<00:02:49.650> lightweight

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
as well as maintain their lightweight

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.039 
as well as maintain their lightweight
feel<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:51.239> then<00:02:51.390> these<00:02:51.540> little<00:02:51.720> kind<00:02:51.959> of

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
feel and then these little kind of

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.599 
feel and then these little kind of
cutouts<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:52.590> between<00:02:52.890> these<00:02:53.040> little<00:02:53.310> squares

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
cutouts in between these little squares

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.369 
cutouts in between these little squares
they're<00:02:54.150> going<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.329> let<00:02:54.480> water<00:02:54.690> wick<00:02:55.049> away<00:02:55.319> so

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
they're going to let water wick away so

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.990 
they're going to let water wick away so
water<00:02:55.769> is<00:02:55.890> not<00:02:56.040> going<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.250> sit<00:02:56.430> on<00:02:56.459> your<00:02:56.700> shins

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
water is not going to sit on your shins

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.729 
water is not going to sit on your shins
or<00:02:57.180> anything<00:02:57.359> like<00:02:57.599> that<00:02:57.629> so<00:02:57.989> again<00:02:58.049> really

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
or anything like that so again really

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.680 
or anything like that so again really
like<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.099> new<00:02:59.280> design<00:02:59.609> it<00:02:59.970> definitely<00:03:00.510> looks

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
like this new design it definitely looks

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.660 
like this new design it definitely looks
good<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.290> does<00:03:01.470> add<00:03:01.650> some<00:03:02.010> thickness<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.549> the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
good it does add some thickness to the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.190 
good it does add some thickness to the
shin<00:03:02.849> guard<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.239> while<00:03:03.420> they<00:03:03.540> are<00:03:03.659> very<00:03:03.930> light

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
shin guard so while they are very light

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.140 
shin guard so while they are very light
they<00:03:04.650> aren't<00:03:04.980> particularly<00:03:05.400> thin<00:03:05.879> which<00:03:06.060> you

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
they aren't particularly thin which you

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.490 
they aren't particularly thin which you
guys<00:03:06.299> will<00:03:06.510> see<00:03:06.659> a<00:03:06.690> little<00:03:06.870> bit<00:03:07.019> later<00:03:07.230> in<00:03:07.409> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
guys will see a little bit later in the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.890 
guys will see a little bit later in the
video<00:03:07.590> but<00:03:08.250> in<00:03:08.370> terms<00:03:08.579> of<00:03:08.760> comfort<00:03:09.209> providing

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
video but in terms of comfort providing

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.300 
video but in terms of comfort providing
nice<00:03:10.079> protection<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.709> just<00:03:10.859> fitting<00:03:11.129> really

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
nice protection and just fitting really

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.460 
nice protection and just fitting really
well<00:03:11.609> this<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.329> definitely<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.780> great<00:03:12.989> design

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
well this is definitely a great design

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.080 
well this is definitely a great design
it's<00:03:13.950> also<00:03:14.159> going<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.489> be<00:03:14.609> very<00:03:14.640> durable

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
it's also going to be very durable

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.670 
it's also going to be very durable
because<00:03:15.420> there<00:03:15.690> really<00:03:15.810> aren't<00:03:16.079> many<00:03:16.170> parts

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
because there really aren't many parts

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.080 
because there really aren't many parts
the<00:03:16.769> shin<00:03:17.069> guard<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.519> none<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.030> these

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
the shin guard and none of these

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.400 
the shin guard and none of these
materials<00:03:18.690> are<00:03:18.840> really<00:03:18.989> going<00:03:19.109> to<00:03:19.169> break<00:03:19.349> down

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
materials are really going to break down

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.159 
materials are really going to break down
particularly<00:03:20.400> quickly<00:03:21.000> either<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:21.720> again<00:03:21.959> as

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
particularly quickly either so again as

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.349 
particularly quickly either so again as
far<00:03:22.590> as<00:03:22.709> longevity<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:23.310> concerned<00:03:23.700> I'm<00:03:24.060> really

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
far as longevity is concerned I'm really

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.849 
far as longevity is concerned I'm really
happy<00:03:24.660> with<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:24.900> new<00:03:25.079> mercurial<00:03:25.680> light

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
happy with this new mercurial light

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.670 
happy with this new mercurial light
design<00:03:26.250> as<00:03:26.630> far<00:03:27.630> as<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.840> sleeves<00:03:28.109> go<00:03:28.380> they

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
design as far as the sleeves go they

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.860 
design as far as the sleeves go they
have<00:03:28.889> not<00:03:29.160> changed<00:03:29.730> with<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.120> new<00:03:30.150> redesigned

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
have not changed with the new redesigned

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.449 
have not changed with the new redesigned
mercurial<00:03:31.470> light<00:03:31.650> shin<00:03:31.919> guard<00:03:32.160> they're<00:03:32.340> the

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
mercurial light shin guard they're the

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.550 
mercurial light shin guard they're the
same<00:03:32.639> ones<00:03:32.849> you<00:03:33.030> got<00:03:33.180> before<00:03:33.389> and<00:03:33.989> honestly

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
same ones you got before and honestly

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.080 
same ones you got before and honestly
they're<00:03:34.709> not<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:35.099> greatest<00:03:35.129> as<00:03:35.609> far<00:03:35.819> as<00:03:35.910> shin

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
they're not the greatest as far as shin

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.330 
they're not the greatest as far as shin
guard<00:03:36.329> sleeves<00:03:36.660> go<00:03:36.900> it's<00:03:37.440> made<00:03:37.739> from<00:03:38.129> an

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
guard sleeves go it's made from an

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.699 
guard sleeves go it's made from an
elasticated<00:03:38.940> thin<00:03:39.389> mesh<00:03:39.690> material<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.590> it's

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
elasticated thin mesh material so it's

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.050 
elasticated thin mesh material so it's
got<00:03:40.859> some<00:03:40.889> stretch<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.700> but<00:03:41.879> it<00:03:41.970> definitely

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
got some stretch to it but it definitely

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.990 
got some stretch to it but it definitely
isn't<00:03:42.599> as<00:03:42.750> elasticated<00:03:43.500> as<00:03:43.799> more<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.519> solid

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
isn't as elasticated as more of a solid

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.089 
isn't as elasticated as more of a solid
elastic<00:03:45.540> type<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.840> material<00:03:46.290> would<00:03:46.440> be<00:03:46.500> you

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
elastic type of material would be you

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.559 
elastic type of material would be you
can<00:03:47.220> see<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.430> have<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.609> stitch<00:03:47.910> going<00:03:48.180> down<00:03:48.389> the

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
can see you have a stitch going down the

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.089 
can see you have a stitch going down the
back<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.019> again<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.379> does<00:03:49.530> restrict<00:03:49.980> the

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
back so again that does restrict the

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.339 
back so again that does restrict the
kind<00:03:50.639> of<00:03:50.730> elastic<00:03:51.030> qualities<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:52.139> sleeve

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
kind of elastic qualities of the sleeve

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.170 
kind of elastic qualities of the sleeve
itself<00:03:52.680> then<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.220> have<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:53.549> very<00:03:53.819> thick

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
itself then you have this very thick

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.689 
itself then you have this very thick
kind<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.720> band<00:03:55.379> at<00:03:55.590> both<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.919> top<00:03:56.129> and<00:03:56.370> bottom

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
kind of band at both the top and bottom

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:57.800 
kind of band at both the top and bottom
that<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:57.060> me<00:03:57.180> feels<00:03:57.449> a<00:03:57.569> little<00:03:57.629> bit

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
that to me feels a little bit

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.720 
that to me feels a little bit
uncomfortable<00:03:58.139> again<00:03:58.799> it<00:03:59.010> has<00:03:59.190> very<00:03:59.489> minimal

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
uncomfortable again it has very minimal

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.819 
uncomfortable again it has very minimal
stretch<00:04:00.299> just<00:04:00.810> like<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.139> rest<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.560> sleeve

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
stretch just like the rest of the sleeve

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.009 
stretch just like the rest of the sleeve
so<00:04:01.859> it's<00:04:02.430> good<00:04:02.849> for<00:04:02.879> the<00:04:03.359> simple<00:04:03.660> fact<00:04:03.900> that

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
so it's good for the simple fact that

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.140 
so it's good for the simple fact that
it's<00:04:04.260> going<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.620> maintain<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.609> nice<00:04:05.849> kind<00:04:06.030> of

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
it's going to maintain a nice kind of

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.939 
it's going to maintain a nice kind of
compressed<00:04:06.629> fit<00:04:06.870> against<00:04:07.260> your<00:04:07.379> leg<00:04:07.560> once<00:04:07.829> you

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
compressed fit against your leg once you

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:09.740 
compressed fit against your leg once you
actually<00:04:08.310> get<00:04:08.459> them<00:04:08.609> on<00:04:08.790> but<00:04:09.329> they<00:04:09.419> can<00:04:09.599> be<00:04:09.720> a

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
actually get them on but they can be a

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.119 
actually get them on but they can be a
little<00:04:09.900> bit<00:04:10.079> difficult<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.560> get<00:04:10.709> off<00:04:10.919> and

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
little bit difficult to get off and

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.280 
little bit difficult to get off and
because<00:04:11.639> they<00:04:11.760> aren't<00:04:12.030> as<00:04:12.120> elasticated<00:04:12.959> as

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
because they aren't as elasticated as

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.500 
because they aren't as elasticated as
most<00:04:13.799> shin<00:04:14.069> guard<00:04:14.280> sleeves<00:04:14.609> would<00:04:14.849> be<00:04:15.030> they

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
most shin guard sleeves would be they

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.029 
most shin guard sleeves would be they
tend<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.870> break<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.349> little<00:04:16.590> bit<00:04:16.680> more<00:04:16.859> quickly

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
tend to break a little bit more quickly

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.860 
tend to break a little bit more quickly
and<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.519> think<00:04:17.699> perhaps<00:04:18.030> most<00:04:18.329> people<00:04:18.690> would

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
and I think perhaps most people would

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.140 
and I think perhaps most people would
expect<00:04:19.049> also<00:04:19.919> because<00:04:20.400> they<00:04:20.489> are<00:04:20.639> very<00:04:20.880> very

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
expect also because they are very very

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.180 
expect also because they are very very
thin<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:21.989> these<00:04:22.140> are<00:04:22.349> sleeves<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.860> will<00:04:23.010> do

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
thin so these are sleeves that will do

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.620 
thin so these are sleeves that will do
the<00:04:23.310> job<00:04:23.340> for<00:04:23.550> at<00:04:23.880> least<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.180> couple<00:04:24.330> of<00:04:24.570> months

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
the job for at least a couple of months

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.720 
the job for at least a couple of months
but<00:04:25.289> after<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:25.710> first<00:04:26.010> couple<00:04:26.219> of<00:04:26.430> months

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
but after that first couple of months

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.400 
but after that first couple of months
expect<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.240> have<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:27.540> replace<00:04:27.840> them<00:04:28.080> or<00:04:28.260> just

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
expect to have to replace them or just

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.050 
expect to have to replace them or just
go<00:04:28.530> without<00:04:28.800> using<00:04:28.980> sleeves<00:04:29.460> altogether

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
go without using sleeves altogether

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.520 
go without using sleeves altogether
because<00:04:30.600> like<00:04:30.810> I<00:04:30.900> said<00:04:30.990> they<00:04:31.140> aren't<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.410> most

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
because like I said they aren't the most

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.170 
because like I said they aren't the most
durable<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.100> honestly<00:04:32.610> not<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.940> best

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
durable and honestly not the best

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.610 
durable and honestly not the best
sleeves<00:04:33.450> on<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.720> market<00:04:34.080> but<00:04:34.260> it's<00:04:34.380> kind<00:04:34.560> of

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
sleeves on the market but it's kind of

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.310 
sleeves on the market but it's kind of
hard<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:35.040> complain<00:04:35.430> about<00:04:36.390> them<00:04:36.840> considering

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
hard to complain about them considering

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.500 
hard to complain about them considering
the<00:04:37.410> shin<00:04:37.560> guards<00:04:37.860> are<00:04:38.010> only<00:04:38.220> 25<00:04:38.880> dollars<00:04:39.120> so

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
the shin guards are only 25 dollars so

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.510 
the shin guards are only 25 dollars so
again<00:04:39.540> not<00:04:40.320> my<00:04:40.530> personal<00:04:40.950> favorite<00:04:41.250> sleeves

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
again not my personal favorite sleeves

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.810 
again not my personal favorite sleeves
but<00:04:41.940> they<00:04:42.090> definitely<00:04:42.210> do<00:04:42.660> get<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.990> job<00:04:43.020> done

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
but they definitely do get the job done

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
but they definitely do get the job done
alright<00:04:44.820> so<00:04:45.000> here's<00:04:45.210> a<00:04:45.300> look<00:04:45.420> at<00:04:45.570> how<00:04:45.780> the

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
alright so here's a look at how the

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.810 
alright so here's a look at how the
Mercurial<00:04:46.500> lights<00:04:46.710> fit<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.340> can<00:04:47.430> see<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:47.610> have

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
Mercurial lights fit you can see I have

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.880 
Mercurial lights fit you can see I have
one<00:04:47.850> covered<00:04:48.480> up<00:04:48.600> by<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.780> regular<00:04:49.200> soccer<00:04:49.500> sock

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
one covered up by a regular soccer sock

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.800 
one covered up by a regular soccer sock
the<00:04:50.160> other<00:04:50.280> one<00:04:50.490> is<00:04:50.610> left<00:04:50.790> completely<00:04:51.360> exposed

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
the other one is left completely exposed

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.290 
the other one is left completely exposed
so<00:04:52.320> again<00:04:52.500> it's<00:04:52.650> a<00:04:52.740> sleeve<00:04:53.040> with<00:04:53.310> no<00:04:53.550> internal

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
so again it's a sleeve with no internal

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.180 
so again it's a sleeve with no internal
pockets<00:04:54.750> or<00:04:54.870> anything<00:04:54.930> like<00:04:55.260> that<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.950> shin

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
pockets or anything like that the shin

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.710 
pockets or anything like that the shin
guard<00:04:56.370> is<00:04:56.460> actually<00:04:56.760> going<00:04:56.910> to<00:04:57.090> sit<00:04:57.240> directly

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
guard is actually going to sit directly

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.390 
guard is actually going to sit directly
against<00:04:58.020> your<00:04:58.110> skin<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.620> then<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.100> sleeve<00:04:59.340> is

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
against your skin and then the sleeve is

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.040 
against your skin and then the sleeve is
going<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.610> lock<00:04:59.790> it<00:04:59.970> in<00:05:00.060> place<00:05:00.090> which<00:05:00.780> it<00:05:00.900> does

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
going to lock it in place which it does

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.140 
going to lock it in place which it does
seem<00:05:01.290> to<00:05:01.320> do<00:05:01.590> pretty<00:05:01.620> well<00:05:02.190> at<00:05:02.670> least<00:05:02.940> from

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
seem to do pretty well at least from

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.270 
seem to do pretty well at least from
brand<00:05:03.480> new<00:05:03.720> again<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.680> durability<00:05:05.040> of<00:05:05.220> the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
brand new again the durability of the

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.280 
brand new again the durability of the
sleeve<00:05:05.550> is<00:05:05.760> in<00:05:05.970> question<00:05:06.210> as<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:07.140> hasn't

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
sleeve is in question as it hasn't

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.600 
sleeve is in question as it hasn't
really<00:05:07.530> changed<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:08.070> I've<00:05:08.160> had<00:05:08.310> some

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
really changed and I've had some

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.550 
really changed and I've had some
not-so-great<00:05:09.450> experiences<00:05:10.080> with<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.410> but

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
not-so-great experiences with it but

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.170 
not-so-great experiences with it but
again<00:05:10.650> from<00:05:11.010> brand<00:05:11.250> new<00:05:11.430> it<00:05:11.610> definitely<00:05:12.000> does

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
again from brand new it definitely does

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.030 
again from brand new it definitely does
get<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.540> job<00:05:12.780> done<00:05:12.990> and<00:05:13.260> you<00:05:13.710> really<00:05:13.920> won't

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
get the job done and you really won't

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.000 
get the job done and you really won't
need<00:05:14.280> tape<00:05:14.580> at<00:05:14.820> first<00:05:15.390> as<00:05:15.630> far<00:05:16.260> as<00:05:16.500> covering<00:05:16.950> up

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
need tape at first as far as covering up

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.560 
need tape at first as far as covering up
with<00:05:17.190> socks<00:05:17.370> are<00:05:17.610> concerned<00:05:17.970> if<00:05:18.270> you<00:05:18.360> have<00:05:18.480> a

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
with socks are concerned if you have a

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.970 
with socks are concerned if you have a
tighter<00:05:18.750> pair<00:05:18.990> of<00:05:19.080> socks<00:05:19.320> it's<00:05:19.560> also<00:05:19.710> going<00:05:19.920> to

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
tighter pair of socks it's also going to

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.260 
tighter pair of socks it's also going to
help<00:05:20.100> to<00:05:20.190> keep<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.550> shin<00:05:20.730> guards<00:05:21.000> up<00:05:21.120> and

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
help to keep the shin guards up and

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.970 
help to keep the shin guards up and
again<00:05:21.480> for<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.080> most<00:05:22.290> part<00:05:22.530> I<00:05:22.620> don't<00:05:22.680> think

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
again for the most part I don't think

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.160 
again for the most part I don't think
that<00:05:23.130> tape<00:05:23.370> is<00:05:23.610> required<00:05:23.820> as<00:05:24.540> far<00:05:24.750> as<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:24.960> fit

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
that tape is required as far as the fit

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.930 
that tape is required as far as the fit
of<00:05:25.200> the<00:05:25.380> shin<00:05:25.560> guard<00:05:25.770> is<00:05:25.920> concerned<00:05:26.310> they<00:05:26.820> are

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
of the shin guard is concerned they are

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.430 
of the shin guard is concerned they are
designed<00:05:27.240> to<00:05:27.300> sit<00:05:27.570> a<00:05:27.600> little<00:05:27.780> bit<00:05:27.990> higher<00:05:28.170> up

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
designed to sit a little bit higher up

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.350 
designed to sit a little bit higher up
and<00:05:28.650> it<00:05:28.710> is<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:28.950> smaller<00:05:29.340> style<00:05:29.760> of<00:05:29.910> shin<00:05:30.150> guard

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
and it is a smaller style of shin guard

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.700 
and it is a smaller style of shin guard
so<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.630> amount<00:05:30.840> of<00:05:30.900> coverage<00:05:31.230> you're<00:05:31.410> getting

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
so the amount of coverage you're getting

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.830 
so the amount of coverage you're getting
is<00:05:31.830> not<00:05:32.310> a<00:05:32.340> ton<00:05:32.670> it's<00:05:32.880> not<00:05:33.060> particularly

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
is not a ton it's not particularly

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.110 
is not a ton it's not particularly
significant<00:05:34.590> but<00:05:35.310> again<00:05:35.520> that's<00:05:35.730> kind<00:05:35.910> of<00:05:36.000> the

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
significant but again that's kind of the

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.520 
significant but again that's kind of the
style<00:05:36.390> of<00:05:36.540> shin<00:05:36.780> guard<00:05:37.020> that<00:05:37.200> you're<00:05:37.320> buying

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
style of shin guard that you're buying

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.710 
style of shin guard that you're buying
into<00:05:37.800> with<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.700> mercurial<00:05:39.270> legs<00:05:39.450> and<00:05:39.630> again

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
into with the mercurial legs and again

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.540 
into with the mercurial legs and again
it's<00:05:40.170> going<00:05:40.290> to<00:05:40.350> be<00:05:40.440> adequate<00:05:40.800> protection<00:05:41.520> for

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
it's going to be adequate protection for

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.030 
it's going to be adequate protection for
most<00:05:42.180> people<00:05:42.540> no<00:05:43.020> coverage<00:05:43.440> at<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.710> ankle

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
most people no coverage at the ankle

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.950 
most people no coverage at the ankle
obviously<00:05:44.610> and<00:05:44.880> as<00:05:45.120> far<00:05:45.270> as<00:05:45.330> the<00:05:45.480> thickness<00:05:45.690> of

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
obviously and as far as the thickness of

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.810 
obviously and as far as the thickness of
the<00:05:46.050> shin<00:05:46.230> guard<00:05:46.440> is<00:05:46.560> concerned<00:05:46.920> again<00:05:47.520> it<00:05:47.700> is

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
the shin guard is concerned again it is

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.220 
the shin guard is concerned again it is
noticeable<00:05:48.420> that<00:05:48.540> you're<00:05:48.690> wearing<00:05:48.870> shin

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
noticeable that you're wearing shin

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.410 
noticeable that you're wearing shin
guards<00:05:49.590> they're<00:05:50.220> not<00:05:50.370> particularly<00:05:51.060> thin<00:05:51.270> or

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
guards they're not particularly thin or

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.000 
guards they're not particularly thin or
anything<00:05:51.630> like<00:05:51.870> that<00:05:51.930> but<00:05:52.620> again<00:05:52.710> they're<00:05:52.980> not

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
anything like that but again they're not

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.500 
anything like that but again they're not
going<00:05:53.250> to<00:05:53.310> get<00:05:53.460> in<00:05:53.550> the<00:05:53.640> way<00:05:53.790> and<00:05:54.120> because

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
going to get in the way and because

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.450 
going to get in the way and because
they're<00:05:54.690> lightweight<00:05:54.930> design<00:05:55.530> again<00:05:56.280> they're

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
they're lightweight design again they're
