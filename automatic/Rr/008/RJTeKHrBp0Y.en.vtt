the<00:01:47.520> aileron<00:01:47.849> servos<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.229> see<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.409> I

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the aileron servos you can see that I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.499 
the aileron servos you can see that I
have<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:50.009> protector<00:01:50.429> over<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.939> protect

previous offer my prayers even the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.480 
previous offer my prayers even the
mig-15<00:02:54.960> that<00:02:55.380> was<00:02:55.530> available<00:02:55.770> before<00:02:56.220> this

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
mig-15 that was available before this

one this would be a really good stepping
stone<00:02:58.020> I<00:02:58.530> imagine<00:02:59.460> it'll<00:02:59.580> be<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.700> little<00:02:59.820> bit

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
stone I imagine it'll be a little bit

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.840 
stone I imagine it'll be a little bit
faster<00:03:00.450> because<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.990> aerodynamics<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.130> so

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
faster because the aerodynamics of it so

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.990 
faster because the aerodynamics of it so
definitely<00:03:03.270> somebody<00:03:03.480> keep<00:03:03.750> an<00:03:03.870> eye<00:03:04.020> out<00:03:04.050> for

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
definitely somebody keep an eye out for

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.920 
definitely somebody keep an eye out for
