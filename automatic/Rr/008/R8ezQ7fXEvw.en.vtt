00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.390
 art 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.210
 and so 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.199
 I'm interested 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.750
 in the practical aspects of things since for all tastes 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.570
 which required 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.570
 I'm discovered not shoot at the escalade school 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.309
 it diminishes from the face to mans 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.680
 we were made precisely and relevant 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.579
 tan lantin 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.710
 it's a beautiful discovery 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.240
 in a market there are a lot of help and paintings is easy 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.410
 to provide you all 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.060
 taken at 1% specialty shops for artists so that's true 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.970
 than all the major Dutch brands 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.750
 English or French recognizes this because they are such contracts 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.220
 at the post 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.240
 twelve stores after this large area of ​​land 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.580
 do not shoot do not shoot 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.590
 especially it is a very very happy initiative of 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.720
 serena is a very traditional brand 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.210
 campus welcomes each month 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.579
 so we have all the explanations 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.630
 the idea occurred to painting making is to give 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.560
 a lot of little tips finally to the people who come to you and after one 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.780
 see him today 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.170
 yes quite a lesser penalty already the manufacturing has really 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.140
 shown at the height that expects amateurs 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.440
 % how is made and how are their colors made and present 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.590
 to advise to rediscuss the mission at stake 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.160
 the interactive couple 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.370
 we take what can give us and we try to bring them something 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.259
 I was very good too it's to see in a day like today 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.879
 There is already the exchange between a painter who gives himself because their 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.889
 ship a little council did not leave stylist he dragged out the season and 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.959
 that's what I wanted to bring back this exchange between the artists and 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.829
 returned color maker 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.130
 the artisan marveaux 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.259
 voluntarily limit high level 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:30.539
 at the end of the proposed color palette 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.699
 yes we have limited ourselves to voluntarily so currently at the trouble this 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.749
 color we will announce great maximum in my opinion 30 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.419
 but behind there is really the possibility for the painter of 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:45.039
 test the colors to try to mix and see that we make it the 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.619
 palette is already very extensive once we can start doing the 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:48.499
 better choices 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:52.279
 the other highways are therefore in principle we proposed blue 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:56.169
 your questions so much about the choice of little pigments on mixtures are 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.479
 obviously welcome 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.769
 a little honest complete besides information
