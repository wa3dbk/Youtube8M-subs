started back in 2005-2006 when microsoft
released<00:00:17.850> XNA<00:00:18.330> which<00:00:19.020> was<00:00:19.260> their<00:00:19.650> their<00:00:20.279> push

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
released XNA which was their their push

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.060 
released XNA which was their their push
for<00:00:20.930> using<00:00:21.930> managed<00:00:22.199> languages<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:22.859> doing

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
for using managed languages for doing

for using managed languages for doing
game<00:00:23.279> development<00:00:23.779> that's<00:00:24.779> managed

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
game development that's managed

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.320

all the dotnet sort of languages so

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.690 
all the dotnet sort of languages so
that's<00:00:30.269> where<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.570> started<00:00:30.990> um<00:00:31.340> sometime<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
that's where it started um sometime a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.540 
that's where it started um sometime a
little<00:00:33.030> later<00:00:33.210> later<00:00:33.800> some<00:00:34.800> guys<00:00:34.950> thought<00:00:35.399> you

had the idea of like hey I really like

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.110 
had the idea of like hey I really like
this<00:00:37.200> language<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.770> platform<00:00:38.010> I'd<00:00:38.940> like

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
this language in this platform I'd like

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.819 
this language in this platform I'd like
to<00:00:39.239> try<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.870> other<00:00:40.530> platforms

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
to try to do this on other platforms

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.440 
to try to do this on other platforms
other<00:00:41.250> than<00:00:41.430> Microsoft<00:00:41.820> platforms<00:00:42.270> and

other than Microsoft platforms and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.670 
other than Microsoft platforms and
that's<00:00:43.320> how<00:00:43.440> mono<00:00:43.680> game<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.040> started<00:00:45.170> ok<00:00:46.170> were

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
that's how mono game was started ok were

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.770 
that's how mono game was started ok were
you<00:00:46.800> involved<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.280> back<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.789> note

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you involved with it back then a note

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.229 
you involved with it back then a note
Dominic<00:00:49.440> was<00:00:49.590> though<00:00:49.770> ok<00:00:50.640> cool<00:00:50.850> I'll<00:00:51.030> talk<00:00:51.180> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
Dominic was though ok cool I'll talk to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.970 
Dominic was though ok cool I'll talk to
him<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.690> beginnings<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.500> so

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
him about the beginnings of that but so

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.299 
him about the beginnings of that but so
so<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.660> describe<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.140> me<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.440> know<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.070> see

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
so so describe to me what you know I see

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.459 
so so describe to me what you know I see
XNA<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.000> I'm<00:00:57.090> not<00:00:57.210> quite<00:00:57.420> sure<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
XNA but I'm not quite sure what that

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.279 
XNA but I'm not quite sure what that
means<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.809> about<00:01:00.989> managed

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
means that is that it's about managed

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.950 
means that is that it's about managed
languages<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.039> whether<00:01:02.969> were<00:01:03.359> there<00:01:03.510> similar

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
languages but whether were there similar

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899 
languages but whether were there similar
frameworks<00:01:04.470> before<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.549> help<00:01:05.760> people

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
frameworks before that that help people

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.210 
frameworks before that that help people
develop<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> cross<00:01:07.170> between<00:01:07.200> windows<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
develop like a cross between windows and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.170 
develop like a cross between windows and
and<00:01:08.520> I'm<00:01:09.060> say<00:01:09.270> Xbox<00:01:09.689> mm<00:01:10.680> uh<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:11.700> really<00:01:11.939> i<00:01:12.119> mean

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
and I'm say Xbox mm uh not really i mean

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.050 
and I'm say Xbox mm uh not really i mean
not<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:13.010> when<00:01:14.010> XNA<00:01:14.460> started<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> was

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
not like this when XNA started it was

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.460 
not like this when XNA started it was
one<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.930> first<00:01:16.140> kind<00:01:16.320> of

manage languages for game development

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.270 
manage languages for game development
there<00:01:19.530> were<00:01:19.650> some<00:01:19.860> other<00:01:19.920> things<00:01:20.220> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
there were some other things that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.950 
there were some other things that
Microsoft<00:01:20.729> did<00:01:20.850> early<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.270> they<00:01:21.600> had<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
Microsoft did early on they had and

Microsoft did early on they had and
managed<00:01:22.290> directx<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.119> sometime<00:01:24.540> really

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
managed directx you know sometime really

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.050 
managed directx you know sometime really
early<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.979> kind<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.340> fizzled<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.790> and

early but that kind of fizzled out and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.730 
early but that kind of fizzled out and
this<00:01:27.119> was<00:01:27.270> kind<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.900> push<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.680> you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
this was kind of I can you push and you

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.460 
this was kind of I can you push and you
push<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.540> originally<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.750> big<00:01:30.900> draw<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.289 
push that originally the big draw to it
was<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.430> could<00:01:32.579> not<00:01:32.700> only<00:01:32.939> develop

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
was that you could not only develop

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.149 
was that you could not only develop
games<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.869> worked<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> pc<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
games that worked on the pc but you

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.310 
games that worked on the pc but you
could<00:01:35.280> also<00:01:35.400> deploy<00:01:35.820> games<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.329> your<00:01:36.450> xbox<00:01:36.840> 360

to<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.119> console<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> big

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
to that console so that was the big

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.139 
to that console so that was the big
attraction<00:01:52.770> at<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.340> time<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> lot<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.939> people

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
attraction at the time a lot of people

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.399 
attraction at the time a lot of people
jumped<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.479> because<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.049> being<00:01:55.229> able<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
jumped in because of that being able to

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.109 
jumped in because of that being able to
see<00:01:55.590> their<00:01:55.799> games<00:01:56.009> running<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> 360<00:01:57.030> on

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
see their games running on a 360 on

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.420 
see their games running on a 360 on
their<00:01:57.329> TV<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> living<00:01:58.110> room<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.890> that's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
their TV in the living room so that's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.789 
their TV in the living room so that's
really<00:01:59.700> where<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.030> began<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
really where it began but it is just a

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.800 
really where it began but it is just a
framework<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.549> an<00:02:02.670> engine<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.329> it

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
framework it's not an engine it's it

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.020 
framework it's not an engine it's it
gives<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:05.219> coders<00:02:05.610> more

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
gives you it's really for coders more

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.340 
gives you it's really for coders more
than<00:02:06.240> designers<00:02:06.689> even<00:02:06.960> though<00:02:07.049> I've<00:02:07.140> talked

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
than designers even though I've talked

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.540 
than designers even though I've talked
to<00:02:07.439> designers<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:07.950> used<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.399> and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
to designers that have used it and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.400 
to designers that have used it and
claimed<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.569> don't<00:02:09.720> know<00:02:09.780> how<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.929> code<00:02:10.140> that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
claimed they don't know how to code that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.010 
claimed they don't know how to code that
somehow<00:02:10.649> produce<00:02:11.039> some<00:02:11.280> awesome<00:02:11.520> games

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
somehow produce some awesome games

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.110
