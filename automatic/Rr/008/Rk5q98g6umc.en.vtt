00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
starting to notice a repeating pattern

starting to notice a repeating pattern
to<00:00:20.760> Charlotte<00:00:21.570> these<00:00:21.869> past<00:00:22.109> couple<00:00:22.350> episodes

to Charlotte these past couple episodes

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.349 
to Charlotte these past couple episodes
I<00:00:23.010> don't<00:00:23.189> think<00:00:23.400> I'm<00:00:23.460> really<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> only<00:00:23.939> one<00:00:24.240> to

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
I don't think I'm really the only one to

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.689 
I don't think I'm really the only one to
notice<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.900> because<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:26.099> second<00:00:26.460> episode

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
notice this because the second episode

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.120 
notice this because the second episode
was<00:00:27.269> kind<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.630> where<00:00:27.869> our<00:00:28.260> characters<00:00:29.010> were

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
was kind of where our characters were

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.910 
was kind of where our characters were
hunting<00:00:29.400> down<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.970> ability<00:00:30.720> user<00:00:30.960> third

hunting down a ability user third

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.889 
hunting down a ability user third
episode<00:00:32.130> was<00:00:32.790> pretty<00:00:33.000> much<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.390> exact<00:00:33.719> same

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
episode was pretty much the exact same

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.590 
episode was pretty much the exact same
thing<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.670> episode<00:00:36.300> it

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
was kind of the exact same thing once

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.459 
was kind of the exact same thing once
again<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:39.030> finding<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.570> person<00:00:39.930> also<00:00:40.110> used

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
again but finding a person also used

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.590 
again but finding a person also used
abilities<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> reasons<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.210> helping

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
abilities but for the reasons of helping

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.590 
abilities but for the reasons of helping
out<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> friend<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.040> noticed<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.820> repeated

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
out a friend and so I noticed a repeated

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.660 
out a friend and so I noticed a repeated
pattern<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:47.070> these<00:00:47.129> past<00:00:47.430> couple

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
pattern going on for these past couple

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.160 
pattern going on for these past couple
episodes<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.870> do<00:00:48.930> hope<00:00:49.410> very<00:00:49.680> soon<00:00:49.860> that

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
episodes and I do hope very soon that

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.660 
episodes and I do hope very soon that
Charlotte<00:00:52.170> takes<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.680> little<00:00:53.070> bit<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
Charlotte takes a little bit of a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.490 
Charlotte takes a little bit of a
different<00:00:53.699> path<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:54.899> its<00:00:55.079> upcoming

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
different path with its upcoming

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.430 
different path with its upcoming
episodes<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.570> far<00:00:57.809> from<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.260> we've

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
episodes because so far from what we've

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.380 
episodes because so far from what we've
gotten<00:00:58.800> from<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.219> series<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.940> episode

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
gotten from this series is just episode

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.849 
gotten from this series is just episode
to<00:01:00.510> introduce<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.109> character<00:01:01.469> give<00:01:01.620> us<00:01:01.739> some

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
to introduce a character give us some

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
to introduce a character give us some
characterization<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.149> continue<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
characterization and we continue on to

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.750 
characterization and we continue on to
the<00:01:04.229> next<00:01:04.470> episode<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.129> does<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> exact

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the next episode that does the exact

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.090 
the next episode that does the exact
same<00:01:05.850> thing<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.810> I'm<00:01:06.990> really<00:01:07.260> hoping<00:01:07.650> that

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
same thing so I'm really hoping that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.160 
same thing so I'm really hoping that
this<00:01:08.430> series<00:01:08.640> tries<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.540> something<00:01:09.570> very

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
this series tries to do something very

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
this series tries to do something very
different<00:01:10.380> next<00:01:10.830> week<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.280> its<00:01:11.430> episode

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
different next week for its episode

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.240 
different next week for its episode
because<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.600> know<00:01:12.810> some<00:01:13.320> anime<00:01:13.710> watchers<00:01:14.130> are

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
because I know some anime watchers are

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.010 
because I know some anime watchers are
probably<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.790> an<00:01:14.909> issue<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
probably going to have an issue with the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.450 
probably going to have an issue with the
way<00:01:16.049> these<00:01:16.290> episodes<00:01:16.560> are<00:01:16.830> being<00:01:17.009> executed

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
way these episodes are being executed

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.310 
way these episodes are being executed
because<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.090> starts<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.479> feel<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> exact

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
because it starts to feel like the exact

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.370 
because it starts to feel like the exact
same<00:01:19.560> thing<00:01:19.799> over<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.250> over<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.700> over<00:01:20.880> again

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
same thing over and over and over again

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.850 
same thing over and over and over again
so<00:01:22.380> besides<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:23.240> this<00:01:24.240> episode<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.140> want<00:01:25.799> to

that or before that was dark and so this
episode<00:03:31.030> felt<00:03:31.270> like<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.390> nice<00:03:31.660> good<00:03:31.930> change<00:03:32.320> of

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
episode felt like a nice good change of

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.190 
episode felt like a nice good change of
I<00:03:33.190> guess<00:03:33.700> atmosphere<00:03:34.360> compared<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.840> previous

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
I guess atmosphere compared to previous

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.840 
I guess atmosphere compared to previous
episodes<00:03:35.620> because<00:03:35.860> this<00:03:36.190> was<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.460> little<00:03:36.760> bit

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
episodes because this was a little bit

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.180 
episodes because this was a little bit
more<00:03:37.000> cheery<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.780> not<00:03:38.200> as<00:03:38.410> bad<00:03:38.830> where<00:03:39.070> the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
more cheery and not as bad where the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.580 
more cheery and not as bad where the
stakes<00:03:39.460> for<00:03:39.580> really<00:03:40.030> high<00:03:40.210> in<00:03:40.570> this<00:03:41.110> episode

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
stakes for really high in this episode

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.550 
stakes for really high in this episode
so<00:03:42.010> episode<00:03:42.940> very<00:03:43.540> different<00:03:44.080> from<00:03:44.170> some<00:03:44.530> of

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
so episode very different from some of

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.860 
so episode very different from some of
the<00:03:44.800> themes<00:03:45.010> from<00:03:45.340> previous<00:03:45.760> episodes<00:03:46.210> but<00:03:46.720> it

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
the themes from previous episodes but it

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.900 
the themes from previous episodes but it
still<00:03:47.140> feels<00:03:47.470> like<00:03:47.710> the<00:03:48.160> exact<00:03:48.460> same<00:03:48.670> thing

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
still feels like the exact same thing

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.300 
still feels like the exact same thing
we've<00:03:49.120> gotten<00:03:49.390> from<00:03:49.510> previous<00:03:50.290> episodes<00:03:50.830> so

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
we've gotten from previous episodes so

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.830 
we've gotten from previous episodes so
I'm<00:03:51.580> starting<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:51.970> get<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.150> little<00:03:52.270> bit<00:03:52.510> worried

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
I'm starting to get a little bit worried

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.510 
I'm starting to get a little bit worried
I<00:03:52.960> mean<00:03:53.110> I'm<00:03:53.230> not<00:03:53.440> really<00:03:53.770> worried<00:03:54.280> worried

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
I mean I'm not really worried worried

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.030 
I mean I'm not really worried worried
completely<00:03:55.210> but<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.690> just<00:03:56.050> do<00:03:56.290> hope<00:03:56.620> that<00:03:56.890> this

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
completely but I just do hope that this

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.590 
completely but I just do hope that this
series<00:03:57.250> does<00:03:57.550> something<00:03:57.940> very<00:03:58.120> different<00:03:58.300> for

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
series does something very different for

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.020 
series does something very different for
its<00:03:58.750> second<00:03:59.110> half<00:03:59.350> and<00:03:59.590> tries<00:03:59.800> to<00:03:59.910> get<00:04:00.910> away

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
its second half and tries to get away

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.760 
its second half and tries to get away
from<00:04:01.300> what<00:04:01.780> it's<00:04:01.900> been<00:04:02.020> doing<00:04:02.080> I<00:04:02.440> mean<00:04:02.470> right

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
from what it's been doing I mean right

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.410 
from what it's been doing I mean right
now<00:04:02.830> I<00:04:02.980> think<00:04:03.130> it's<00:04:03.370> just<00:04:03.490> setting<00:04:03.910> up<00:04:04.000> all<00:04:04.240> the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
now I think it's just setting up all the

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.690 
now I think it's just setting up all the
key<00:04:04.600> cast<00:04:04.900> members<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.470> characters<00:04:05.920> for<00:04:06.460> it

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
key cast members and characters for it

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.460 
key cast members and characters for it
could<00:04:06.850> carry<00:04:07.000> on<00:04:07.300> into<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:07.750> real<00:04:07.900> beef<00:04:08.170> of<00:04:08.380> the

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
could carry on into the real beef of the

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.890 
could carry on into the real beef of the
story<00:04:08.770> but<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.459> do<00:04:09.610> hope<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.150> tries<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.630> get<00:04:10.750> out

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
story but I do hope it tries to get out

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.330 
story but I do hope it tries to get out
of<00:04:10.959> this<00:04:11.170> little<00:04:11.440> format<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:11.980> it's<00:04:12.070> getting

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
of this little format and it's getting

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.090 
of this little format and it's getting
into<00:04:12.760> later<00:04:13.450> on<00:04:13.660> down<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:13.959> road<00:04:14.110> because<00:04:14.620> this

week's episode because it felt like the

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.830 
week's episode because it felt like the
exact<00:04:27.460> same<00:04:27.610> thing<00:04:27.790> we<00:04:27.910> got<00:04:28.060> from<00:04:28.210> episode<00:04:28.630> two

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
exact same thing we got from episode two

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.720 
exact same thing we got from episode two
but<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.740> know<00:04:29.860> with<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.100> different<00:04:30.490> type<00:04:30.699> of

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
style and so with this episode it's the

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.590 
style and so with this episode it's the
exact<00:04:33.400> same<00:04:33.460> thing<00:04:33.790> for<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.120> past<00:04:34.360> three

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600
