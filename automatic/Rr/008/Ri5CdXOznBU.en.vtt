00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
to GTA 5 when you have his voice back

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.150 
to GTA 5 when you have his voice back
because<00:06:06.050> three<00:06:06.200> hours<00:06:06.320> I<00:06:06.440> prefer<00:06:06.740> his<00:06:06.919> voice

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
because three hours I prefer his voice

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.940 
because three hours I prefer his voice
then<00:06:07.430> the<00:06:08.090> default<00:06:08.570> voice<00:06:08.750> that<00:06:08.990> you<00:06:09.080> have<00:06:09.260> on

then the default voice that you have on

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.620 
then the default voice that you have on
the<00:06:10.250> regional<00:06:10.610> headset<00:06:10.940> so<00:06:11.120> I<00:06:11.150> think<00:06:11.390> it's<00:06:11.600> a

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
the regional headset so I think it's a

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.270 
the regional headset so I think it's a
pretty<00:06:11.810> cool<00:06:11.870> feature<00:06:12.110> that<00:06:12.950> they've<00:06:13.100> added

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
exclusive to this headset and so overall

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.230 
exclusive to this headset and so overall
