00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
like to talk forever I'd run out of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.769 
like to talk forever I'd run out of
things<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.880> talk<00:00:20.970> about<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.359> we're<00:00:21.539> gonna<00:00:21.630> do

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
things to talk about so we're gonna do

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.980 
things to talk about so we're gonna do
the<00:00:21.869> next<00:00:22.109> izombie<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:23.240> suppose<00:00:24.240> if<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.420> ran<00:00:24.600> out

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the next izombie I suppose if I ran out

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.660 
the next izombie I suppose if I ran out
of<00:00:25.080> things<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.470> say<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.650> could<00:00:25.949> just<00:00:26.099> screams

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
of things to say I could just screams

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.439 
of things to say I could just screams
but<00:00:27.090> now<00:00:27.590> constantly<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.090> continually<00:00:30.090> but

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
but now constantly and continually but

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.690 
but now constantly and continually but
even<00:00:31.230> then<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:31.800> my<00:00:32.219> voice<00:00:32.460> would

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.120 
even then I think my voice would
probably<00:00:33.180> wear<00:00:33.390> out<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.930> especially<00:00:34.739> if<00:00:35.010> I

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
probably wear out and especially if I

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.380 
probably wear out and especially if I
was<00:00:35.280> yelling<00:00:35.550> spit<00:00:35.880> out<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.329> did
