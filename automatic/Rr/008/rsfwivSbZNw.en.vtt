00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.940
 I'm a career iker in the 100th and 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.510
 good 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.460
 I like the mountain I love the mountain 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.650
 Temperament by character I like 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.820
 run and good 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:30.220
 I could unite the two facets running and 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:32.770
 the mountain and in recent years and I'm not 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.250
 I am not very fast compared to others 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.950
 runners I'm not that fast 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.010
 So, well my my land, I think 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.640
 my specialty is the ultras is for 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.100
 that and good because I enjoy I enjoy 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.540
 just like in the short races and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.270
 good in those I'm above 60 to 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.480
 70 km from there forward I think that a 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.200
 from 100 km is where good 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.830
 It shows a little difference the 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.180
 first kilometers the most is the 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.030
 Most people are fine 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.970
 cool and good is going well but then to 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.130
 from but from 80 100 km it is 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.250
 when you really notice who is 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.160
 long-distance runner and who does not 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.940
 it's not as much as you train at the end it's 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.950
 accumulate kilometers is to accumulate and all 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.220
 the days you can not run 100 kilometers 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.170
 much less, not all the ends of 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.869
 week you can do 100 kilometers but 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.340
 is to accumulate to go accumulating kilometers 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.149
 between the quality at the end means 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.460
 rhythm the rhythm of the city â€‹â€‹do 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.710
 fast bets 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.960
 fast try to make fast descents 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.049
 extreme drops 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.710
 is to tune is to speed up the 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:59.090
 final the speed is really the one 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.810
 also be the capacity for 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.090
 ability to oxygenate your body 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.440
 musculature if your body is 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.860
 used to running at a medium pace 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.349
 for a while you can not demand it in a 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.870
 race that runs a little bit more is 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.790
 really speed is the one that gives you 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.260
 the difference and then something else 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.819
 really important is that these 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.860
 recent years the evolution in 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.130
 racing is tremendous and every time 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.569
 run more head run a lot more 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.569
 quick of what was running before 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.220
 then now apart from running well in 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.319
 the hill you have to run fast you have 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.850
 to be more of an athlete than what 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.530
 it was before it seems a bit absurd 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:48.020
 not quite absurd that 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.970
 that is that competition that exists between 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.850
 the races 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.480
 to see who is the longest who is 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.730
 the hardest who is the most I do not know that I 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.340
 it's a bit absurd that 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.530
 competition also understands that each 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:10.640
 you look for your space look for your 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.020
 let's say have a space between 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.520
 all races between the rest of 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.040
 races there are more and more races and 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.020
 each race each organizer wants 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.880
 your career has succeed and be 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.670
 recognized then it is being used 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.010
 in many cases the distance as 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.750
 I claim for the runners some 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.209
 will fall some will disappear because 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.630
 they really are ugly or do not make sense 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.240
 a race stuff for you to have 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.459
 100 miles you put 20 kilometers of 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.250
 asphalt 20 kilometers on a track 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.620
 disgusting that nobody really likes 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.630
 of being that career will not be successful that 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.180
 career will disappear with time never 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.850
 will come to stand out and of those there there 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.090
 some today there are more than there are more than 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.770
 what should 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.800
 people will be selecting the races 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.160
 that really like or really interest 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.770
 in the distance that will not matter to you 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.910
 I do not know where the logical limit is 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.450
 There will be many times 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:13.099
 I have asked the question of where is 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:20.780
 the human dimension of a career 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:24.120
 because it's also a little bit I do not know 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:28.840
 absurd I do not know but a race for 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.960
 example of 100 kilometers in which 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:37.050
 good you go out at 10 at night and the 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.550
 first he has arrived at 10 o'clock in the morning 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.040
 has done the whole race almost all the 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.840
 night race that has enjoyed 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.479
 that career that I have traveled has seen 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.160
 what has brought that career to me? 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.380
 I imagine that the organizers when 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.360
 they organize a race when they signal 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.120
 a race are not signaling of 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.510
 night they will be signaling by day and 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.460
 when they promote a career the photos 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.770
 almost never are at night normally of 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.450
 photos the photos are day photos when 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:10.900
 they teach you a site an area that is 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.210
 pretty, they show you a picture of the day you 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.310
 what you are looking for is to see that area and you have just 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.169
 past 12 at night it is dark 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.669
 and you have not seen anything what I always say 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:23.919
 I am I was born I was born in a village I was born 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.960
 in the bush and in the end my first 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.260
 steps were in the bush and I saw first 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.080
 my first races were in the bush 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.340
 I started to really run in the bush 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.490
 and for me to run in the bush 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:42.040
 natural of the world is where really in 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.040
 my body but better is wrapped
