00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.340
 Alexey Nikolaevich Soviet politicians 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.230
 loved the words ambiguously and we are forced 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.759
 to resort to him now because 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.500
 really for your students everything 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.410
 It turned out very ambiguous on this 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.039
 the european championship we speak now i 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.010
 failures and not plushenko and success elizy 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.470
 bronze medal for her debut 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.359
 european championship adult yes how are you 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.460
 yourself experienced it as a trailer like you 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.130
 do the fact is that I am already training 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.829
 1969 and I want to say that you know 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.320
 not all not all failures must be considered 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.890
 what an unsuccessful experience too 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.190
 so the puppy's nestoris showed us 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.469
 it is impossible 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.110
 simultaneously compete and rivals 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.860
 from the ill back stage of plushenko and we 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.420
 did this 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.300
 he is two 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.089
 they as for whether but there really I can see 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.809
 would like to draw one detail which 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.810
 slipping away 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.840
 changes 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.510
 of attention from the attention of journalists and 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.560
 because in my memory this is the most 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.190
 complex software 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.950
 which ever ever ever 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.740
 was performed by a Russian figure skater I 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.170
 I remember the virus pen and but I also think 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.250
 that there I did not have a cascade but also on 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.910
 axel triple sheepskin coat 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.360
 so I am especially proud that she is 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.840
 set its own kind of record and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.030
 this is typical for me as a coach 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.770
 I was a mass of athletes and gourmets 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.570
 Judah Plushenko and and artur gachinsky here 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.580
 now liza tuktamysheva they 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.790
 set records they open 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.460
 the road to that unknown 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.130
 What is the meaning of sports ? 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.070
 your nearest plans the nearest plans 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.970
 us very simple prepare further for 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.890
 what 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.260
 I understand that Eugene did not go to London and 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.260
 liza is going to perform there yes of course
