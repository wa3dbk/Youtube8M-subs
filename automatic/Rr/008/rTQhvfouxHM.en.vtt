00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.049
 many times when we talk about the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.390
 one cryptozoology comes to mind 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.480
 of the most famous critics the monster 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.980
 of the lake ness and we remember 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.919
 instantaneously to a plesiosaurus this 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.439
 dinosaur that was believed extinct 65 ago 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.599
 millions of years but it will be possible that 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.060
 the dinosaurs have become extinct in 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.589
 its totality at present and since 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.689
 many years ago they reported 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.939
 sightings of beings very similar to 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.669
 the dinosaurs besides that paintings 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.859
 rock sculptures and other objects of 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.710
 ancient civilizations seem to show 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.690
 dinosaurs those dinosaurs that are 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.720
 supposed to be extinct millions of years ago 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.520
 years it's almost absurd to think that you're 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.860
 creatures have not survived until 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.960
 our time they have been able to adapt and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.810
 Surviving is a theory that should not be 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.550
 leave aside let's look at a sample of 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.570
 those tests that seem to give you a 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.570
 reality to this theory 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.379
 is a cryptic that is part of the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.510
 Pygmy folklore is described as a 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.180
 Cryptic reptile is seen in the Congo 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.880
 he was associated with a dinosaur of the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.130
 Stegosaurus family in particular 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.950
 a saurus center a gigantic reptile 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.170
 with fins on the back only exist 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.820
 some alleged sightings of this 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.820
 be in the villages of bubi the and flew 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.170
 the donkey jor in the 1950s 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.150
 Australian farmers have reported 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.190
 of a large creature leaving footprints 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.500
 bipedal he was eating his cattle 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.540
 in addition the aboriginal accounts 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.490
 previously suggest that it is an animal 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.430
 reptile that ate kangaroos and others 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.170
 large animals is described as a 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.420
 giant lizard according to the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.640
 Aboriginal mythology based on the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.650
 observation is 25 feet long and 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.900
 He has small hands and claw 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.300
 walk on two bipedal legs

 house and king is house and kings is a 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.960
 so-called African cryptic pseudo animal 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.360
 which is claimed to be a dinosaur 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.320
 carnivore that survived until our 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.560
 days 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.480
 in 1932 joe johnson a owner of a 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.580
 Swedish plantation was traveling with a 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.250
 servant in the house valley and in the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.680
 congo told that they found a 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.990
 rhinoceros and while trying 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.640
 pass it without being perceived say that 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.500
 they would have been surprised by a 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.990
 supposedly great creature that came out of the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.330
 weeds and attacked the herbivore according to 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.610
 story the servant fled while 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.620
 Johnson fainted and then upon awakening 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.200
 he saw that the mysterious creature was 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.720
 eating the rhino was reddish from 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.150
 color with black stripes said then 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.880
 It had a long nose with numerous 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.770
 teeth the explorer said he thought that 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.380
 the creature that supposedly would have 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.450
 seen about 13 meters long there would be 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.820
 been a tyrannosaur but also 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.709
 He claimed that the legs were thick 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.050
 he remembered a lion adapted to the 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.880
 speed this supposed fact was 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.970
 reported by the Rhodesian newspaper 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.740
 herald also in 1932 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.840
 strangely this has been the only 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.160
 report for this supposed creature of 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.160
 large and carnivorous 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.950
 the mold they read see the mold they read 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.870
 come see is perhaps one of the most critical 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.480
 famous and researched as well as 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.220
 lake monster ness the name of mold 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.049
 who read bembé translated from the language 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.079
 native means the one that stops the flow 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.510
 of the rivers describe it with a neck 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.730
 long a small head similar to 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.950
 that of a snake or lizard which 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.470
 It was decorated with something similar to a 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.870
 crest a long and flexible tail a 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.470
 soft reddish- brown skin and 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.639
 powerful legs with claws on the fingers 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.739
 practically all the witnesses that 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.450
 they say they have taken a good look at the 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.980
 animal agree that mold 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.989
 who read babies is very similar in 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.989
 appearance to the extinct apatosaurus 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.760
 the monster of the lake ness month and how 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.280
 he knows the monster affectionately 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.380
 history picks it up from the 6th century of 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.390
 a legendary creature that is said to 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.370
 lives in the lake ness the witnesses 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.650
 eyepieces relate that the monster has 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.350
 a dark red color smooth skin and that 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.240
 Measures between 8 and 9 meters in length with 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.130
 these descriptions some scientists 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.680
 they think it may be a 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.040
 plesiosaurus a kind of dinosaur 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.040
 Marine 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.800
 the clear water monster a morning of 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.050
 February 1948 a couple dating 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.090
 I was walking the clearwater beaches in 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.759
 florida were surprised by a 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.680
 monster that emerged between the waves more 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.050
 Later some traces were discovered with 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.780
 three fingers on the beach an episode 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.720
 similar happened a few days later on 6 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.150
 from March to about 25 kilometers north 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.430
 then on March 20 there was another 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.009
 sighting this time south on the island 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.810
 of dan again on April 3 is 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.419
 found a row of prints 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.180
 long about 300 meters on indian rocks 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.520
 10 kilometers from clearwater something 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.400
 similar happened in philips amoc tampa 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.430
 bay in all those cases did not know the 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.990
 name of the alleged witnesses on 25 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.449
 July two flight instructors 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.949
 while they were flying about 60 meters above 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.199
 the gulf of mexico saw a great 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:13.080
 creature swimming near the island cove 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.300
 des and calculated that it measured about 5 meters 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.370
 long with a very hairy body a 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.740
 heavy blunt head and legs towards 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:24.409
 back like a crocodile but much more 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.409
 heavy the tail was long and forceful 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.140
 but there are not only sightings of 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.240
 these creatures but many paintings 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.050
 objects and stones that represent 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.190
 dinosaurs 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.710
 next let's see some of them 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.200
 The figures of Acámbaro in Mexico 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.620
 a collection of more than 32,000 pieces in 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.690
 acámbaro mexico that seem to represent 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.030
 dinosaurs extinct animals and peoples 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.340
 of distant cultures of Mexico according to the 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.920
 Carbon 14 tests date from a thousand 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.960
 up to 4000 before Christ - a great 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.030
 number of figures represent with 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.540
 great amazing precision a great 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.730
 variety of dinosaurs ica stones 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.860
 in a place of Peru in a desert of 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.140
 ica department a Peruvian doctor 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.970
 discovered some colored oval stones 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.790
 dark with engravings of technologies 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.410
 advanced and dinosaurs are appreciated 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.900
 evidence of engravings in which 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.940
 figures of dinosaurs appear 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.830
 coexisting with humans which is almost 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.800
 impossible 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:28.190
 the dinosaur paintings between 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.720
 October and November 1924 the doctor 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.630
 charles filmed as curator of the museum

 national of the us member of the 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.830
 archaeological expedition financed by 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.200
 the millionaire Edward Lawrence where 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.930
 explored the north of arizona where it is 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.120
 the canyon of the beans supay investigating 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.070
 a hard-to-access stone wall 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.990
 found what was painted on the rock 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.420
 knows as a saurian amount a 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.460
 North American dinosaur the 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.410
 paint was covered by varnish 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.840
 of the desert that gave it a tonality 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.110
 dark contributed by millions of years of 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.110
 exposition 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.440
 is this proof that there is still or was 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.020
 living dinosaurs up to our 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.150
 time with certainty can not be said 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.130
 but you have to ask yourself was the 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.199
 human being on earth long before 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.990
 what we believed or the dinosaurs did not 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:17.120
 completely extinguished a question 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.919
 It will be hard to answer but it will continue 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.310
 feeding our imagination by 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:21.310
 long time
