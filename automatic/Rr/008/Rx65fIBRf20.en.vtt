00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.410 
superfine but I would say kind of a
medium<00:02:15.630> chop<00:02:16.490> you<00:02:17.490> know<00:02:17.580> if<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.820> keep<00:02:18.090> your

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
medium chop you know if you keep your

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.960 
medium chop you know if you keep your
nuts<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.710> use<00:02:19.950> for<00:02:20.280> cooking<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:20.790> baking

nuts that you use for cooking and baking

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.530 
nuts that you use for cooking and baking
in<00:02:21.300> your<00:02:21.420> freezer<00:02:21.780> they<00:02:22.500> last<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.250> lot<00:02:23.430> longer

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
in your freezer they last a lot longer

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
in your freezer they last a lot longer
sometimes<00:02:24.540> if<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.930> leave<00:02:25.140> them<00:02:25.320> in<00:02:25.440> your

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
sometimes if you leave them in your

sometimes if you leave them in your
pantry<00:02:26.100> they<00:02:26.280> can<00:02:26.490> go<00:02:26.610> rancid<00:02:27.210> on<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:28.320> I

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
pantry they can go rancid on you so I

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.260 
pantry they can go rancid on you so I
that's<00:02:28.920> why<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.160> keep<00:02:29.370> everything<00:02:29.580> like<00:02:30.060> this

that's why I keep everything like this

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.180 
that's why I keep everything like this
in<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> freezer<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.500> just<00:02:31.710> go<00:02:31.860> ahead<00:02:31.950> and

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190

have the vanilla at the end is that if

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.060 
have the vanilla at the end is that if
it's<00:03:54.120> cooking<00:03:54.720> still<00:03:55.110> you'll<00:03:55.350> lose<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.650> lot<00:03:55.860> of

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
it's cooking still you'll lose a lot of

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
the potency of the flavor so we don't

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.500 
the potency of the flavor so we don't
want<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.470> do<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.830> now<00:03:59.700> once<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.300> get

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
scrape all of that out into the pan now

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.570 
scrape all of that out into the pan now
you'll<00:04:12.540> notice<00:04:12.990> this<00:04:13.170> is<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.620> really<00:04:14.190> really

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
thick batter so it's not going to move

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.120 
thick batter so it's not going to move
itself<00:04:18.000> in<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.510> pan<00:04:18.780> so<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:19.470> have<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.919> take

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
itself in the pan so you have to take

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.090 
itself in the pan so you have to take
your<00:04:20.310> spatula<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:21.180> push<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.960> out<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.290> all<00:04:22.440> four

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.740 
corners
and<00:04:24.080> all<00:04:24.440> four<00:04:24.919> edges<00:04:25.160> you<00:04:25.849> want<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.389> be<00:04:26.539> as

and all four edges you want it to be as

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:34.360 
and all four edges you want it to be as
level<00:04:27.229> as<00:04:27.560> you<00:04:27.740> can<00:04:27.979> possibly<00:04:28.520> get<00:04:28.849> it<00:04:33.370> then

you can go ahead and lift these on to
the<00:05:29.060> cutting<00:05:29.389> board<00:05:29.419> see<00:05:29.840> how<00:05:30.020> easy<00:05:30.349> it<00:05:30.650> is<00:05:30.770> to

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
the cutting board see how easy it is to

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.129 
the cutting board see how easy it is to
move<00:05:31.250> these<00:05:31.520> when<00:05:31.820> you<00:05:31.940> have<00:05:32.150> that<00:05:32.330> sleeve<00:05:32.840> and

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
move these when you have that sleeve and

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.020 
move these when you have that sleeve and
the<00:05:33.680> first<00:05:33.919> thing<00:05:34.159> people<00:05:34.310> want<00:05:34.639> to<00:05:34.789> do<00:05:34.880> is

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
the first thing people want to do is

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.330 
the first thing people want to do is
start<00:05:35.300> cutting<00:05:35.840> you<00:05:36.229> know<00:05:36.349> on<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:36.710> sides<00:05:37.009> but

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
start cutting you know on the sides but

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.580 
start cutting you know on the sides but
I<00:05:37.370> always<00:05:37.759> start<00:05:38.300> right<00:05:38.599> in<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:38.960> middle<00:05:39.349> and

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
I always start right in the middle and

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.730 
I always start right in the middle and
go<00:05:40.130> ahead<00:05:40.460> and<00:05:40.639> I<00:05:40.699> take<00:05:40.969> a<00:05:41.000> big<00:05:41.509> one<00:05:42.289> of<00:05:42.380> my<00:05:42.469> big

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
go ahead and I take a big one of my big

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.909 
go ahead and I take a big one of my big
knives<00:05:43.009> cut<00:05:43.639> through<00:05:44.030> the<00:05:44.240> center<00:05:44.630> and<00:05:44.750> then<00:05:45.590> I

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
knives cut through the center and then I

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.850 
knives cut through the center and then I
can<00:05:46.280> cut<00:05:46.550> each<00:05:46.849> half<00:05:47.300> in<00:05:47.780> half<00:05:48.259> and<00:05:48.560> that<00:05:48.680> way

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
can cut each half in half and that way

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
can cut each half in half and that way
you<00:05:48.919> get<00:05:49.250> some<00:05:49.310> fairly<00:05:50.680> uniform<00:05:51.680> size<00:05:52.070> pieces

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
you get some fairly uniform size pieces

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.149 
you get some fairly uniform size pieces
now<00:05:53.750> you<00:05:53.810> could<00:05:54.139> cut<00:05:54.380> these<00:05:54.560> into<00:05:54.830> many

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159 
now you could cut these into many

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:57.159 
now you could cut these into many
different<00:05:55.610> shapes<00:05:55.880> you<00:05:56.060> could<00:05:56.330> do<00:05:56.479> diamonds

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
different shapes you could do diamonds

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.350 
different shapes you could do diamonds
or<00:05:57.319> you<00:05:57.860> know<00:05:57.979> whatever<00:05:58.190> you<00:05:58.460> like<00:05:58.699> but<00:05:59.030> I'm
