00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.470 

the<00:00:01.370> third<00:00:02.370> thing<00:00:02.639> I<00:00:02.760> wanted<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.090> criticize

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
the third thing I wanted to criticize

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.000 
the third thing I wanted to criticize
you<00:00:03.720> on<00:00:03.899> was<00:00:04.319> this<00:00:04.680> idea<00:00:05.779> that<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:07.440> animals

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
you on was this idea that that animals

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.820 
you on was this idea that that animals
are<00:00:08.429> no<00:00:08.820> way<00:00:09.030> superior<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.840> human<00:00:10.110> beings<00:00:10.500> and

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
are no way superior to human beings and

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.850 
are no way superior to human beings and
this<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.130> something<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:12.590> that<00:00:13.590> you've

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
this is something that that you've

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.129 
this is something that that you've
contact<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.299> kind<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.780> clashed

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
contact you and I have kind of clashed

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.460 
contact you and I have kind of clashed
on<00:00:16.379> before<00:00:20.449> basically<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.720> say<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.320> because

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
on before basically you say that because

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.580 
on before basically you say that because
we<00:00:23.070> are<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> most<00:00:23.519> intelligent<00:00:24.000> species<00:00:24.590> we

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
we are the most intelligent species we

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.689 
we are the most intelligent species we
automatically<00:00:27.500> attribute<00:00:28.500> intelligence<00:00:29.189> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
automatically attribute intelligence to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.560 
automatically attribute intelligence to
be<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.269> greatest<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.349> traits<00:00:32.030> then<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.300> say

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
be the greatest of traits then we say

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.720 
be the greatest of traits then we say
that<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.989> are<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> most<00:00:34.559> weirdest<00:00:35.370> we're

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
that we are the most weirdest we're

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.790 
that we are the most weirdest we're
superior<00:00:36.210> because<00:00:36.540> intelligence<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
superior because intelligence is the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.200 
superior because intelligence is the
most<00:00:38.480> extraordinary<00:00:40.340> trait<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.640> species

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
most extraordinary trait that a species

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:52.720 
most extraordinary trait that a species
could<00:00:42.510> possibly<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.789> well<00:00:45.800> you<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:46.980> uh<00:00:47.629> I

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.119 

think<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:55.370> it's<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:58.129> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
think that it's kind of you know the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.520 
think that it's kind of you know the
very<00:00:59.430> fact<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.570> conscious<00:01:01.109> of

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
very fact that we are conscious of

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.709 
very fact that we are conscious of
ourselves<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.430> very<00:01:02.670> fact<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.539> be

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
ourselves the very fact that we can be

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.469 
ourselves the very fact that we can be
introspective<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:05.460> very<00:01:05.670> fact<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.270> have

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
introspective the very fact that we have

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.289 
introspective the very fact that we have
imagination<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.890> calculate<00:01:08.299> that

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
imagination that we can calculate that

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.940 
imagination that we can calculate that
we<00:01:10.070> assign<00:01:11.070> value<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.850> things<00:01:12.470> makes<00:01:13.470> us<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
we assign value to things makes us the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.630 
we assign value to things makes us the
most<00:01:14.100> valuable<00:01:14.580> because<00:01:16.340> we're<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> only

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
most valuable because we're the only

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.840 
most valuable because we're the only
barometer<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.360> value<00:01:19.009> value<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> totally

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
barometer of value value is a totally

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.140 
barometer of value value is a totally
human<00:01:21.240> concept<00:01:23.270> things<00:01:24.270> don't<00:01:24.689> really<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:26.150> a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
human concept things don't really have a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.200 
human concept things don't really have a
value<00:01:27.659> without<00:01:28.170> human<00:01:28.710> beings<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.310> mean<00:01:29.490> no<00:01:30.180> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
value without human beings I mean no I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.999 
value without human beings I mean no I
mean<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.750> know<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.900> said<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.680> asked<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
mean you know you said you asked a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
mean you know you said you asked a
turtle<00:01:32.340> why<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.210> was<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> BET<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:34.200> was<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
turtle why it was the BET what was the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.600 
turtle why it was the BET what was the
best<00:01:34.619> they<00:01:34.829> would<00:01:34.979> say<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.340> was<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.520> best

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
best they would say it was the best

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.899 
best they would say it was the best
because<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.150> had<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> shell<00:01:37.280> but<00:01:38.280> really<00:01:38.880> a

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
because it had a shell but really a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.030 
because it had a shell but really a
turtle<00:01:39.299> doesn't<00:01:39.329> give<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> fuck<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.439> turtle

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
turtle doesn't give a fuck a turtle

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.850 
turtle doesn't give a fuck a turtle
doesn't<00:01:41.070> know<00:01:41.490> what<00:01:41.729> best<00:01:42.060> means<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:43.320> has<00:01:43.560> no

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
doesn't know what best means it has no

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.490 
doesn't know what best means it has no
concept<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.880> its<00:01:45.030> little<00:01:45.270> turtle<00:01:45.750> brain<00:01:46.049> for

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
concept in its little turtle brain for

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.770 
concept in its little turtle brain for
best<00:01:47.299> only<00:01:48.299> only<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:49.200> really<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.799> that

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
best only only we really have that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.590 
best only only we really have that
mechanism<00:01:51.829> where<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:53.009> try<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> assign<00:01:54.090> certain

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
mechanism where we try to assign certain

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.410 
mechanism where we try to assign certain
values<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.439> things<00:01:55.649> may<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.579> other<00:01:56.820> species<00:01:57.119> do

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
values to things may be other species do

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.389 
values to things may be other species do
in<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.570> primitive<00:01:57.750> way<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> dog<00:01:58.680> might<00:01:59.130> have

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
in a primitive way like a dog might have

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.020 
in a primitive way like a dog might have
a<00:01:59.430> food<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.390> prefers<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.310> monkey<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
a food that it prefers or a monkey you

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.569 
a food that it prefers or a monkey you
know<00:02:03.180> might<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.079> big<00:02:04.290> rock<00:02:04.590> as<00:02:04.979> opposed

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
know might like the big rock as opposed

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.190 
know might like the big rock as opposed
to<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> little<00:02:06.240> rock<00:02:06.420> or<00:02:06.780> something<00:02:06.930> like

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
to the little rock or something like

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.520 
to the little rock or something like
that<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:09.390> we're<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.720> only<00:02:09.840> people<00:02:09.989> who<00:02:10.410> have

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that but we're the only people who have

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.620 
that but we're the only people who have
that<00:02:11.069> broad<00:02:11.489> definition

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
that broad definition

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.230 
that broad definition
of<00:02:12.720> value<00:02:13.290> like<00:02:13.650> we're<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.920> only<00:02:14.010> things<00:02:14.880> that

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
of value like we're the only things that

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.870 
of value like we're the only things that
can<00:02:15.270> look<00:02:16.260> at<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.560> painting<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.340> say<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.820> is

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
can look at a painting and say this is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.900 
can look at a painting and say this is
art<00:02:18.590> rather<00:02:19.590> than<00:02:19.770> just<00:02:20.160> saying<00:02:20.370> ooh<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.850> is

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
art rather than just saying ooh this is

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.970 
art rather than just saying ooh this is
pretty<00:02:21.120> colors<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:24.300> if<00:02:24.750> we<00:02:25.110> are<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.830> only

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
pretty colors so if we are the only

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.010 
pretty colors so if we are the only
barometer<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:28.160> value<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.700> we<00:02:29.880> know<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.090> there

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
barometer a value that we know of there

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.050 
barometer a value that we know of there
may<00:02:31.200> be<00:02:31.230> other<00:02:31.500> species<00:02:31.860> elsewhere<00:02:32.670> in<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
may be other species elsewhere in the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.040 
may be other species elsewhere in the
galaxy<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.750> or<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.050> universe<00:02:34.440> that

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
galaxy and or the universe that
