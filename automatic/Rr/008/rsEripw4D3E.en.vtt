00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
works let's rewrite history the way that

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.270 
works let's rewrite history the way that
it<00:01:00.719> never<00:01:01.050> happens<00:01:01.620> pretend<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.250> never

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
it never happens pretend it never

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.670 
it never happens pretend it never
happened<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.270> make<00:01:04.260> them<00:01:04.500> more

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
happened and just make them more

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.890 
happened and just make them more
playable<00:01:05.070> now<00:01:05.700> some<00:01:06.030> people<00:01:06.150> might<00:01:06.299> say<00:01:06.689> that

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
playable now some people might say that

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.030 
playable now some people might say that
it's<00:01:07.110> actually<00:01:07.290> hoping<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.920> they're

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
it's actually hoping that they're

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.920 
it's actually hoping that they're
revisiting<00:01:08.700> some<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:09.030> these<00:01:09.090> old<00:01:09.299> cars<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
revisiting some of these old cars to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.330 
revisiting some of these old cars to
make<00:01:10.110> them<00:01:10.260> more<00:01:10.409> playable<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> integrate

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
make them more playable and integrate

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.210 
make them more playable and integrate
them<00:01:11.490> into<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.790> game<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.600> disagree<00:01:13.220> why

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
them into the game but I disagree why

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.670 
them into the game but I disagree why
not<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:15.030> as<00:01:15.330> they<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.869> been<00:01:15.900> doing<00:01:16.380> with

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
not just as they have been doing with

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.910 
not just as they have been doing with
the<00:01:17.009> elemental<00:01:17.759> Lords<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.720> make<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.320> new

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the elemental Lords just make up new

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.770 
the elemental Lords just make up new
cards<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:20.700> balanced<00:01:21.210> because

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
cards that are more balanced because

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.080 
cards that are more balanced because
these<00:01:22.409> cards<00:01:22.920> no<00:01:23.040> matter<00:01:23.220> which<00:01:23.580> way<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.820> look

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
these cards no matter which way you look

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.510 
these cards no matter which way you look
at<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.509> still<00:01:24.869> broken<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.979> only<00:01:26.189> way

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
at it are still broken and the only way

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.670 
at it are still broken and the only way
that<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> make<00:01:27.240> them<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:27.750> broken<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.409> by

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
that you make them not broken is by

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.469 
that you make them not broken is by
completely<00:01:29.100> watering<00:01:29.729> them<00:01:29.880> down<00:01:30.119> that's

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
completely watering them down that's

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.819 
completely watering them down that's
what<00:01:30.600> they've<00:01:30.720> been<00:01:30.810> doing<00:01:30.869> with<00:01:31.170> new<00:01:31.409> cards

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
what they've been doing with new cards

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.620 
what they've been doing with new cards
that<00:01:31.979> come<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.210> i<00:01:33.329> said<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
that come out like as i said the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.340 
that come out like as i said the
elemental<00:01:34.079> lords<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.479> why<00:01:36.479> are<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:37.170> now

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
elemental lords so why are they now

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.399 
elemental lords so why are they now
doing<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.340> they<00:01:38.549> running<00:01:38.759> out<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.000> ideas

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
doing this are they running out of ideas

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.749 
doing this are they running out of ideas
cards<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.560> chaos<00:01:40.829> Emperor<00:01:41.009> dragon<00:01:41.189> even

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
cards like chaos Emperor dragon even

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.700 
cards like chaos Emperor dragon even
with<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> errata<00:01:42.479> should<00:01:43.110> never<00:01:43.320> come<00:01:43.560> back

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
with the errata should never come back

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.160 
with the errata should never come back
it's<00:01:44.070> an<00:01:44.189> incredibly<00:01:44.970> unhealthy<00:01:45.479> cards<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
it's an incredibly unhealthy cards and a

it's an incredibly unhealthy cards and a
very<00:01:46.350> unfair<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.040> at<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.850> thing<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.570> I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
very unfair one at that one thing that I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.280 
very unfair one at that one thing that I
was<00:01:48.840> thinking<00:01:49.229> about<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:50.420> these<00:01:51.420> cards<00:01:52.079> that

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
was thinking about is these cards that

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.420 
was thinking about is these cards that
have<00:01:52.380> been<00:01:52.530> erratic<00:01:52.799> they<00:01:53.640> are<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.540> different

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
have been erratic they are so different

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.719 
have been erratic they are so different
from<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.640> original<00:01:56.670> ones<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.630> context<00:01:58.439> that

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
from the original ones the context that

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.849 
they aren't testing these things it
feels<00:03:40.970> like<00:03:41.180> R&amp;D<00:03:42.019> have<00:03:42.260> just<00:03:42.500> completely

feels like R&amp;D have just completely
vanished<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:44.019> while<00:03:45.019> it<00:03:45.260> might<00:03:45.440> be

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
vanished and while it might be

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.830 
vanished and while it might be
controversial<00:03:46.459> for<00:03:46.850> me<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.090> say<00:03:47.269> that<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.630> can

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
controversial for me to say that I can

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.780 
controversial for me to say that I can
only<00:03:47.989> just<00:03:48.290> express<00:03:48.680> my<00:03:48.950> worry<00:03:49.190> in<00:03:49.340> my<00:03:49.459> opinion

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
only just express my worry in my opinion

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.910 
only just express my worry in my opinion
the<00:03:50.060> fact<00:03:50.750> that<00:03:50.870> they<00:03:51.079> are<00:03:51.260> doing<00:03:51.470> this<00:03:51.739> and

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
the fact that they are doing this and

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.129 
the fact that they are doing this and
that's<00:03:52.069> what<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.310> looks<00:03:52.489> like<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.730> us<00:03:53.030> it'd<00:03:53.810> be

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
that's what it looks like to us it'd be

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.170 
that's what it looks like to us it'd be
very<00:03:54.170> interesting<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:55.069> see<00:03:55.250> why<00:03:55.579> they<00:03:56.030> are

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
very interesting to see why they are

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.150 
very interesting to see why they are
actually<00:03:56.329> doing<00:03:56.870> this<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:57.590> know<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:58.010> then

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
actually doing this and I know that then

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.069 
actually doing this and I know that then
probably<00:03:58.639> not<00:03:59.030> going<00:03:59.299> to<00:03:59.389> actually<00:03:59.780> say<00:04:00.049> that

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
probably not going to actually say that

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.110 
probably not going to actually say that
because<00:04:00.889> at<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.280> end<00:04:01.310> of<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.579> day<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.970> might

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
because at the end of the day it might

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.960 
because at the end of the day it might
not<00:04:02.239> even<00:04:02.299> hit<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.810> TCG<00:04:03.530> for<00:04:03.709> a<00:04:03.739> while<00:04:03.950> but<00:04:04.670> I

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
the errata has done nothing to it but

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.700 
the errata has done nothing to it but
what<00:05:32.460> happens<00:05:32.940> if<00:05:33.240> cosine<00:05:34.229> for<00:05:34.410> dragons

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
what happens if cosine for dragons

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.620 
what happens if cosine for dragons
brought<00:05:34.919> back<00:05:35.160> Kaname<00:05:35.729> realize<00:05:36.120> yeah<00:05:36.450> this

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
brought back Kaname realize yeah this

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.839 
brought back Kaname realize yeah this
card<00:05:36.900> still<00:05:37.200> really<00:05:37.560> ridiculous<00:05:38.220> they<00:05:38.760> have

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
card still really ridiculous they have

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.020 
card still really ridiculous they have
two<00:05:39.060> choices<00:05:39.300> they<00:05:40.080> ban<00:05:40.380> it<00:05:40.639> banning<00:05:41.639> it<00:05:41.760> then

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
two choices they ban it banning it then

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.089 
two choices they ban it banning it then
makes<00:05:42.270> the<00:05:42.450> errata<00:05:42.660> completely<00:05:43.650> and<00:05:43.860> utterly

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
makes the errata completely and utterly

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.240 
makes the errata completely and utterly
pointless<00:05:44.700> and<00:05:45.090> a<00:05:45.180> waste<00:05:45.210> of<00:05:45.599> everyone's<00:05:45.990> time

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
pointless and a waste of everyone's time

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.600 
pointless and a waste of everyone's time
to<00:05:47.250> their<00:05:47.910> ratter<00:05:48.210> it<00:05:48.510> again<00:05:48.930> just<00:05:49.740> means<00:05:50.400> that

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
to their ratter it again just means that

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.969 
to their ratter it again just means that
they<00:05:51.120> clearly<00:05:51.330> haven't<00:05:52.020> looked<00:05:52.289> into<00:05:52.560> how<00:05:52.919> the

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
they clearly haven't looked into how the

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.379 
they clearly haven't looked into how the
card<00:05:53.280> will<00:05:53.430> integrate<00:05:53.669> into<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.210> current

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
card will integrate into the current

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.529 
card will integrate into the current
meta<00:05:54.720> it<00:05:55.349> seems<00:05:56.160> sloppy<00:05:56.760> if<00:05:57.210> I'm<00:05:57.389> completely

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
meta it seems sloppy if I'm completely

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.490 
meta it seems sloppy if I'm completely
honest<00:05:58.169> and<00:05:58.789> it<00:05:59.789> really<00:06:00.180> does<00:06:00.630> just<00:06:01.080> make<00:06:01.349> me

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
honest and it really does just make me

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.250 
honest and it really does just make me
think<00:06:01.740> why<00:06:02.389> what<00:06:03.389> is<00:06:03.599> the<00:06:03.750> reasoning<00:06:04.199> behind

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
think why what is the reasoning behind

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.339 
think why what is the reasoning behind
this<00:06:04.770> why<00:06:05.610> are<00:06:05.940> they<00:06:06.060> doing<00:06:06.510> it<00:06:06.720> so<00:06:06.960> I<00:06:06.990> want<00:06:07.289> to

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
this why are they doing it so I want to

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:08.480 
this why are they doing it so I want to
