okay<00:00:01.469> in<00:00:02.149> in<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.270> previous<00:00:03.720> videos<00:00:04.140> I'm<00:00:04.410> sure

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
okay in in the previous videos I'm sure

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.460 
okay in in the previous videos I'm sure
I've<00:00:04.830> shown<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.250> how<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.430> take<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:06.470> perfect

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
I've shown you how to take a perfect

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.709 
I've shown you how to take a perfect
square<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.040> eventually<00:00:08.639> discover<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
square and eventually discover the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.499 
square and eventually discover the
twelve<00:00:09.990> points<00:00:10.440> like<00:00:11.340> such<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:12.330> we

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
twelve points like such that we

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.749 
twelve points like such that we
eventually<00:00:12.809> allow<00:00:13.380> for<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.920> create<00:00:14.639> a

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
eventually allow for you to create a

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.200 
eventually allow for you to create a
circle<00:00:15.240> out<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.690> now<00:00:16.609> what<00:00:17.609> if<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:18.060> have<00:00:18.090> a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
circle out of that now what if we have a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.880 
circle out of that now what if we have a
situation<00:00:18.510> where<00:00:19.080> we're<00:00:19.289> starting<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:19.859> a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
situation where we're starting with a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.980 
situation where we're starting with a
rectangular<00:00:20.400> shape<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.539> rectangular

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
rectangular shape with a rectangular

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.390 
rectangular shape with a rectangular
shape<00:00:22.289> obviously<00:00:22.769> you're<00:00:22.920> not<00:00:23.070> going<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.310> have

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
shape obviously you're not going to have

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.380 
shape obviously you're not going to have
a<00:00:23.430> perfect<00:00:23.820> circle

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
a perfect circle

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.599 
a perfect circle
but<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.930> what<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.260> have<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.890> an<00:00:26.070> elliptical

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
but you what you have is an elliptical

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.189 
but you what you have is an elliptical
shape<00:00:26.670> where<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.240> can<00:00:27.449> just<00:00:27.630> simply<00:00:27.750> say<00:00:27.930> it's

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
shape where you can just simply say it's

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.310 
shape where you can just simply say it's
an<00:00:28.260> oval<00:00:28.590> now<00:00:29.189> what<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:30.000> get<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.050> is

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
an oval now what we get you it is is

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.900 
an oval now what we get you it is is
that<00:00:31.500> there's<00:00:31.949> actually<00:00:32.340> another<00:00:32.489> method<00:00:32.880> for

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
that there's actually another method for

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.970 
that there's actually another method for
us<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.300> define<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.200> point<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.620> we'll<00:00:34.800> need

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
us to define the point that we'll need

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.470 
us to define the point that we'll need
to<00:00:35.750> connect<00:00:36.750> them<00:00:37.260> into<00:00:38.160> an<00:00:38.940> elliptical<00:00:39.239> shape

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
to connect them into an elliptical shape

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.950 
to connect them into an elliptical shape
now<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:41.700> first<00:00:41.910> thing<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.210> do<00:00:42.300> once<00:00:42.510> again<00:00:42.750> is

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
now the first thing to do once again is

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260 
now the first thing to do once again is
to<00:00:43.020> once<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.890> your<00:00:44.520> rectangular<00:00:45.059> shape

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
to once you have your rectangular shape

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.130 
to once you have your rectangular shape
cross<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.379> diagonals<00:00:47.600> you<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
cross the diagonals you have a

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.700 
cross the diagonals you have a
mathematical<00:00:49.680> Center<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:53.780> two<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:55.469> that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
mathematical Center is two from that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.860 
mathematical Center is two from that
point<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.879> middle<00:00:57.090> send<00:00:57.780> out<00:00:57.960> two<00:00:58.739> lines

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
point in the middle send out two lines

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.219 
point in the middle send out two lines
one<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.350> parallel<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.989> these<00:01:03.989> two

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
one that will be parallel to these two

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.600 
one that will be parallel to these two
sides<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.100> then<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> other<00:01:05.430> one

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
sides are here and then the other one

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.039 
sides are here and then the other one
will<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.790> parallel<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.570> top<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.930> bottom

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
will be parallel to the top and bottom

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.510 
will be parallel to the top and bottom
now<00:01:07.770> once<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.409> well<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.920> what

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
now once we have that well this is what

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.670 
now once we have that well this is what
we<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:12.030> call<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.299> -<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.780> short<00:01:13.049> axis<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
we can call this - the short axis and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.280 
we can call this - the short axis and
then<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> long<00:01:14.400> axis<00:01:14.909> now<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.659> look<00:01:15.840> back<00:01:16.020> in

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
then a long axis now if you look back in

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.580 
then a long axis now if you look back in
a<00:01:16.439> circle<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:19.790> circle<00:01:20.810> doesn't<00:01:21.810> really<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
a circle a circle doesn't really have a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.649 
a circle a circle doesn't really have a
long<00:01:22.890> or<00:01:23.280> short<00:01:23.310> axis<00:01:24.090> because<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:24.600> are

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
long or short axis because they are

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.970 
long or short axis because they are
exactly<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.320> same<00:01:25.530> so

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
exactly the same so

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.370 
exactly the same so
so<00:01:28.980> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.220> say<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:30.120> this<00:01:30.780> line<00:01:31.050> right<00:01:31.200> here

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
so you can say that this line right here

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.890 
so you can say that this line right here
is<00:01:31.590> equal<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.520> line<00:01:32.730> right<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:32.940> but<00:01:33.630> in

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
is equal to this line right here but in

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.200 
is equal to this line right here but in
a<00:01:35.570> in<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.660> situation<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.410> in<00:01:38.160> case<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.610> an

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
a in a situation of in case of an

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.420 
a in a situation of in case of an
elliptical<00:01:39.750> shape<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.800> short<00:01:41.220> axis

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
elliptical shape you have a short axis

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.030 
elliptical shape you have a short axis
and<00:01:41.910> long<00:01:42.120> axis<00:01:42.600> now<00:01:43.080> what<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.440> do<00:01:43.590> next<00:01:43.770> is

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
and long axis now what we do next is

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.790 
and long axis now what we do next is
actually<00:01:44.990> quite<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.710> need<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:48.440> what<00:01:49.440> we<00:01:49.590> need

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
actually quite we need is what we need

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.190 
actually quite we need is what we need
next<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.910> next<00:01:51.030> step<00:01:51.300> is<00:01:51.540> if<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.140> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
next the next step is if you have a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.520 
next the next step is if you have a
strip<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.890> paper<00:01:53.360> just<00:01:54.360> any<00:01:54.600> strip<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.410> paper

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
strip of paper just any strip of paper

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.770 
strip of paper just any strip of paper
we<00:01:55.770> do<00:01:55.920> now<00:01:56.430> already<00:01:56.760> have<00:01:57.060> done<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> markings

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
we do now already have done the markings

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.900 
we do now already have done the markings
over<00:01:57.869> here<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.350> I'm<00:01:58.440> just<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.880> tell<00:01:59.880> you

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
over here so I'm just going to tell you

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.180 
over here so I'm just going to tell you
what<00:02:00.570> they<00:02:00.690> are<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:01.290> once<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.830> a<00:02:01.890> strip

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
what they are so once you have a strip

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.859 
what they are so once you have a strip
of<00:02:02.310> paper<00:02:02.460> what<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.880> need<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:03.450> first<00:02:03.690> is

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
of paper what you need to do it first is

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.380 
of paper what you need to do it first is
line<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.680> short<00:02:04.920> axis<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:05.970> at<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
line up with the short axis now at the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.979 
line up with the short axis now at the
very<00:02:07.340> top<00:02:08.340> right<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.910> usually<00:02:09.479> would

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
very top right here I usually would

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.220 
very top right here I usually would
indicate<00:02:10.320> that<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:12.150> starting<00:02:12.570> point<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.050> I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
indicate that as the starting point so I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.690 
indicate that as the starting point so I
can<00:02:13.440> say<00:02:13.770> start<00:02:14.250> right<00:02:15.239> here<00:02:15.470> now<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:17.370> being

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
can say start right here now this being

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.850 
can say start right here now this being
the<00:02:17.880> short<00:02:18.150> axis<00:02:18.440> halfway<00:02:19.440> through<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.739> a

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
the short axis halfway through it a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.100 
the short axis halfway through it a
halfway<00:02:20.280> point<00:02:20.520> of<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.180> short<00:02:21.420> axis<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:21.900> right

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
halfway point of the short axis is right

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.470 
halfway point of the short axis is right
in<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.350> middle<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.770> from<00:02:23.459> here<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.790> here<00:02:24.030> I

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
in the middle so from here to here I

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.070 
in the middle so from here to here I
make<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> mark<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.120> this<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.150> will<00:02:27.450> indicate<00:02:27.810> it

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
make a mark and this I will indicate it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.040 
make a mark and this I will indicate it
as<00:02:28.260> half<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.220> short<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:30.300> half<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.840> the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
as half of the short so half of the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.259 
as half of the short so half of the
short<00:02:31.410> axis<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.489> I'm<00:02:32.610> going<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.850> let's<00:02:33.060> say

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
short axis so I'm going to let's say

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.380 
short axis so I'm going to let's say
replace<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.140> with<00:02:34.440> short<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.880> say<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.180> 1/2

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
replace it with short I can say it's 1/2

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.720 
replace it with short I can say it's 1/2
so<00:02:37.080> from<00:02:37.260> here<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.500> here<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:38.160> 1/2<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.700> length

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
so from here to here is 1/2 the length

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.650 
so from here to here is 1/2 the length
of<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> short<00:02:39.360> axis<00:02:39.540> now<00:02:40.290> switch<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:42.480> that

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
of the short axis now switch it so that

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.900 
of the short axis now switch it so that
the<00:02:42.750> starting<00:02:43.140> point<00:02:43.200> now<00:02:43.680> on<00:02:43.950> your<00:02:44.519> strip<00:02:44.730> of

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
the starting point now on your strip of

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.870 
the starting point now on your strip of
paper<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.390> lining<00:02:45.930> up<00:02:46.019> with<00:02:46.260> one<00:02:47.070> end<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.760> the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
paper is lining up with one end of the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.900 
paper is lining up with one end of the
long<00:02:48.150> axis<00:02:48.510> now<00:02:49.350> once<00:02:49.920> again<00:02:50.040> halfway<00:02:50.640> point

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
long axis now once again halfway point

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
long axis now once again halfway point
which<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.209> right<00:02:51.360> in<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.480> middle<00:02:51.510> right<00:02:51.750> here

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
which is right in the middle right here

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.250 
which is right in the middle right here
you<00:02:52.650> will<00:02:52.830> place<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.100> mark<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:54.209> this<00:02:54.360> time<00:02:54.660> you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
you will place a mark and this time you

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.730 
you will place a mark and this time you
can<00:02:55.290> call<00:02:55.739> this<00:02:55.890> one<00:02:56.180> long

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
can call this one long

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.430 
can call this one long
half<00:02:59.190> which<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.150> right<00:03:00.720> here<00:03:00.750> representing

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
half which is right here representing

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.310 
half which is right here representing
half<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.610> length<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.270> of<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.810> long<00:03:03.990> axis

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
half the length of the of the long axis

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.470 
half the length of the of the long axis
so<00:03:04.980> now<00:03:05.160> on<00:03:05.430> your<00:03:05.580> strip<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.910> paper<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.450> should

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
so now on your strip of paper you should

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.050 
so now on your strip of paper you should
have<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.810> starting<00:03:07.290> point<00:03:07.610> half<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.910> short

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
have a starting point half of the short

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.290 
have a starting point half of the short
axis<00:03:09.500> ends<00:03:10.500> here<00:03:10.650> at<00:03:10.710> this<00:03:10.860> point<00:03:11.130> half<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
axis ends here at this point half of the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.170 
axis ends here at this point half of the
long<00:03:12.480> axis<00:03:13.100> ends<00:03:14.100> at<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.310> point<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:14.880> have

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
long axis ends at this point so you have

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.200 
long axis ends at this point so you have
a<00:03:15.210> starting<00:03:15.630> point<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:16.110> short<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.250> short<00:03:17.850> mark

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
a starting point a short a short mark

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.580 
a starting point a short a short mark
and<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.600> long<00:03:18.840> mark<00:03:19.230> now<00:03:19.740> what<00:03:20.490> eugenics<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.590> at

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
and a long mark now what eugenics is at

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.590 
and a long mark now what eugenics is at
first<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:22.980> will<00:03:23.070> feel<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.250> little<00:03:23.400> tricky<00:03:23.790> but

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
first you will feel a little tricky but

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.550 
first you will feel a little tricky but
what<00:03:25.260> you're<00:03:25.380> trying<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.680> do<00:03:25.800> is<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:27.200> is<00:03:28.200> to

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
what you're trying to do is to is to

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.650 
what you're trying to do is to is to
make<00:03:29.300> contact<00:03:32.060> between<00:03:33.060> these<00:03:33.300> two<00:03:33.450> points

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
make contact between these two points

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.420 
make contact between these two points
that<00:03:34.080> we<00:03:34.230> have<00:03:34.320> just<00:03:34.500> make<00:03:34.740> on<00:03:34.950> this<00:03:35.070> sort<00:03:35.340> of

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
that we have just make on this sort of

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.060 
that we have just make on this sort of
paper<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.690> two<00:03:36.870> axis<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.740> we<00:03:37.920> have

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
paper and the two axis that we have

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.100 
paper and the two axis that we have
created<00:03:38.430> earlier<00:03:38.550> but<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:39.630> have<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.840> remember

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
created earlier but you have to remember

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.980 
created earlier but you have to remember
it's<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.680> opposite<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:41.610> right<00:03:42.150> here<00:03:42.450> on<00:03:42.630> the

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
it's the opposite so right here on the

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.320 
it's the opposite so right here on the
long<00:03:43.230> mark<00:03:43.560> remember<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.220> half<00:03:44.520> of<00:03:45.030> the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
long mark remember this is half of the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.150 
long mark remember this is half of the
long<00:03:45.510> axis<00:03:45.990> so<00:03:46.140> this<00:03:46.260> will<00:03:46.440> be<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.620> long<00:03:46.830> mark

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
long axis so this will be the long mark

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.360 
long axis so this will be the long mark
the<00:03:47.730> long<00:03:47.970> mark<00:03:48.360> will<00:03:48.900> now<00:03:49.080> make<00:03:49.650> in<00:03:49.860> contact

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
the long mark will now make in contact

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.530 
the long mark will now make in contact
with<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.730> short<00:03:51.060> axis<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:52.160> conversely<00:03:53.160> the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
with the short axis and conversely the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.910 
with the short axis and conversely the
short<00:03:54.540> mark<00:03:54.810> which<00:03:55.080> will<00:03:55.260> ends<00:03:55.500> here<00:03:55.740> just

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
short mark which will ends here just

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.100 
short mark which will ends here just
this<00:03:56.010> in<00:03:56.160> half<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.490> the<00:03:56.610> short<00:03:56.820> axis<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.810> ends

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
this in half of the short axis it ends

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.170 
this in half of the short axis it ends
here<00:03:58.230> so<00:03:58.500> this<00:03:58.740> mark<00:03:59.040> right<00:03:59.280> here<00:03:59.460> will<00:04:00.000> now

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
here so this mark right here will now

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.910 
here so this mark right here will now
need<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.480> make<00:04:00.780> contact<00:04:01.230> with<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.410> long<00:04:01.590> axis

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
need to make contact with the long axis

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.670 
need to make contact with the long axis
now<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.360> this<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.570> how<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:03.990> will<00:04:04.110> look<00:04:04.140> like<00:04:04.290> I

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
now so this is how it will look like I

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.650 
now so this is how it will look like I
wear<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.490> the<00:04:05.640> maintain<00:04:06.090> contact<00:04:06.540> between

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
wear to the maintain contact between

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.140 
wear to the maintain contact between
those<00:04:06.930> two<00:04:07.110> points<00:04:07.320> with<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.160> two<00:04:08.310> axis<00:04:08.670> now

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
contact between these two marks that we

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.870 
contact between these two marks that we
have<00:04:25.500> made<00:04:25.710> on<00:04:25.920> this<00:04:26.070> paper<00:04:26.280> with<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.730> to
