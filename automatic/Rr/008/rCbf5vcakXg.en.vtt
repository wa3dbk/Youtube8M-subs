00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
almost three cases in one here so i'll

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.429 
almost three cases in one here so i'll
show<00:01:25.969> you<00:01:26.060> what<00:01:26.210> i<00:01:26.270> mean<00:01:26.359> by<00:01:26.659> that<00:01:26.810> in<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:27.020> second

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
show you what i mean by that in a second

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.010 
show you what i mean by that in a second
so<00:01:27.619> what<00:01:28.130> we'll<00:01:28.280> do<00:01:28.399> is<00:01:28.429> them<00:01:28.759> will<00:01:29.659> take<00:01:29.869> this

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
so what we'll do is them will take this

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.749 
so what we'll do is them will take this
apart<00:01:30.319> and<00:01:30.590> we<00:01:30.979> just<00:01:31.189> sort<00:01:31.340> of<00:01:31.399> push<00:01:31.579> this

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
apart and we just sort of push this

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.910 
apart and we just sort of push this
middle<00:01:32.630> piece<00:01:32.749> out<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.170> this<00:01:33.229> suffer<00:01:33.770> a

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
middle piece out and this suffer a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.469 
middle piece out and this suffer a
little<00:01:34.100> bumpy<00:01:34.459> piece<00:01:34.729> that<00:01:34.880> comes<00:01:35.030> out<00:01:35.240> there

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
little bumpy piece that comes out there

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.449 
little bumpy piece that comes out there
and<00:01:35.719> now<00:01:36.319> what<00:01:36.499> I'll<00:01:36.619> do<00:01:36.770> is<00:01:36.920> I'll<00:01:37.039> just<00:01:37.249> take

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
and now what I'll do is I'll just take

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.459 
and now what I'll do is I'll just take
all<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:37.700> this<00:01:37.939> out<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:38.689> then<00:01:39.020> we<00:01:39.079> can<00:01:39.200> sort<00:01:39.350> of

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
all of this out and then we can sort of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.889 
all of this out and then we can sort of
go<00:01:39.590> through<00:01:39.619> things<00:01:40.189> one<00:01:40.399> by<00:01:40.549> one<00:01:40.789> too<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:41.240> you

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
go through things one by one too so you

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.719 
go through things one by one too so you
can<00:01:42.079> see<00:01:42.289> everything<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.039> you<00:01:43.340> get<00:01:43.520> in<00:01:43.639> the

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
can see everything and you get in the

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.480 
can see everything and you get in the
packaging<00:01:44.209> here<00:01:44.389> so<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:44.990> we'll<00:01:45.439> take<00:01:45.649> the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
packaging here so and we'll take the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.999 
packaging here so and we'll take the
bottom<00:01:47.149> piece<00:01:47.270> off<00:01:47.450> here<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:48.590> is<00:01:48.770> the

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
bottom piece off here so and this is the

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.010 
bottom piece off here so and this is the
you<00:01:49.579> know<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.880> normal<00:01:50.119> USB<00:01:50.450> charging<00:01:50.869> cable

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
you know the normal USB charging cable

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.269 
you know the normal USB charging cable
that<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.439> get<00:01:51.619> which<00:01:51.770> is<00:01:51.799> just<00:01:52.039> a<00:01:52.100> normal

00:01:52.269 --> 00:01:52.279 
that you get which is just a normal

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:54.219 
that you get which is just a normal
micro<00:01:52.670> USB<00:01:53.090> which<00:01:53.240> is<00:01:53.420> obviously<00:01:53.990> how<00:01:54.170> you

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
micro USB which is obviously how you

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.830 
micro USB which is obviously how you
charge<00:01:54.560> up<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.920> case<00:01:55.100> itself<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:56.450> I'll<00:01:56.599> still

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
charge up the case itself and I'll still

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.080 
charge up the case itself and I'll still
as<00:01:57.109> a<00:01:57.139> addition<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:57.920> get<00:01:58.069> here<00:01:58.249> is<00:01:58.279> a<00:01:58.429> a<00:01:58.789> little

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
as a addition you get here is a a little

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.089 
as a addition you get here is a a little
extension<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.709> know<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:00.889> normal

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
extension to and you know the normal

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:02.620 
extension to and you know the normal
three<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.429> half<00:02:01.549> millimeter<00:02:01.969> headphone<00:02:02.179> jack

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
three and half millimeter headphone jack

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.149 
three and half millimeter headphone jack
because<00:02:02.959> it's<00:02:03.109> so<00:02:03.259> recessed<00:02:03.679> in<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:03.950> case

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
because it's so recessed in the case

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.859 
because it's so recessed in the case
you're<00:02:04.700> not<00:02:04.729> going<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.149> get<00:02:05.299> anything<00:02:05.599> in

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
you're not going to get anything in

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.660 
you're not going to get anything in
there<00:02:06.049> really<00:02:06.289> solid<00:02:06.560> see<00:02:06.770> that's<00:02:07.219> how<00:02:07.340> you're

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
there really solid see that's how you're

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.609 
there really solid see that's how you're
able<00:02:07.819> to<00:02:08.149> just<00:02:08.630> put<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:08.899> ahead<00:02:09.319> little<00:02:09.530> bit

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
able to just put this ahead little bit

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.199 
able to just put this ahead little bit
extension<00:02:09.860> leading<00:02:10.340> off<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:10.819> you<00:02:10.910> put<00:02:11.090> your

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
extension leading off so you put your

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.910 
extension leading off so you put your
normal<00:02:11.420> headphones<00:02:11.720> in<00:02:11.870> there<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.500> like<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.650> say

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
normal headphones in there so like I say

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.740 
normal headphones in there so like I say
in<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.370> brain<00:02:13.580> yo<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.819> bit<00:02:14.060> earlier<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.540> they

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
in the brain yo a bit earlier it they

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.910 
in the brain yo a bit earlier it they
really<00:02:14.959> do<00:02:15.080> think<00:02:15.230> of<00:02:15.349> everything<00:02:15.590> in<00:02:15.830> this

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
really do think of everything in this

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.770 
really do think of everything in this
and<00:02:16.400> they<00:02:16.640> really<00:02:16.880> do<00:02:17.000> have<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.270> covered<00:02:17.480> and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
and they really do have you covered and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.540 
and they really do have you covered and
just<00:02:18.530> before<00:02:18.740> we<00:02:18.800> look<00:02:18.920> at<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.099> actual<00:02:19.220> case

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
just before we look at the actual case

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.330 
just before we look at the actual case
itself<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.120> just<00:02:20.330> have<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.690> few<00:02:21.439> bits<00:02:22.069> of<00:02:22.189> paper

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
itself you just have a few bits of paper

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.490 
itself you just have a few bits of paper
work<00:02:22.640> here<00:02:22.879> just<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.299> all<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.750> boring<00:02:24.079> sort<00:02:24.439> of

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
work here just of all the boring sort of

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.020 
work here just of all the boring sort of
information<00:02:24.709> that<00:02:25.010> probably<00:02:25.579> won't<00:02:25.819> actually

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
information that probably won't actually

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.950 
information that probably won't actually
bother<00:02:26.299> reading

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
bother reading

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.260 
bother reading
and<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:27.680> we'll<00:02:27.980> take<00:02:28.130> everything<00:02:28.700> out<00:02:28.940> here

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
and so we'll take everything out here

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.840 
and so we'll take everything out here
just<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.290> can<00:02:30.470> get<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.680> look<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.400> way

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
just so you can get a look so the way

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.910 
just so you can get a look so the way
this<00:02:32.000> case<00:02:32.270> works<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.990> have<00:02:33.260> to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
this case works is that you have to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.430 
this case works is that you have to
solve<00:02:34.220> slider<00:02:35.000> cases<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.570> go<00:02:35.720> into<00:02:36.080> the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
solve slider cases that go into the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.890 
solve slider cases that go into the
actual<00:02:36.680> battery<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.430> this<00:02:38.240> is<00:02:38.420> one<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.630> them

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
actual battery so this is one of them

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.180 
actual battery so this is one of them
this<00:02:38.990> is<00:02:39.050> obviously<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.500> red<00:02:39.710> one<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:40.010> comes

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
this is obviously the red one that comes

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.790 
this is obviously the red one that comes
with<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.520> phone<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.560> tilt

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
with the phone so this is the the tilt

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.310 
with the phone so this is the the tilt
branded<00:02:43.190> one<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.550> this<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:43.790> actually<00:02:44.240> a<00:02:44.420> case

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
branded one and this is actually a case

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.810 
branded one and this is actually a case
in<00:02:45.470> itself<00:02:45.770> so<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.010> could<00:02:46.160> just<00:02:46.280> use<00:02:46.490> this<00:02:46.640> on

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
in itself so you could just use this on

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.150 
in itself so you could just use this on
its<00:02:46.970> side<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:47.390> what<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:47.930> do<00:02:48.050> is<00:02:48.230> then<00:02:48.680> just<00:02:48.980> put

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
its side so what I do is then just put

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.280 
its side so what I do is then just put
this<00:02:49.250> on<00:02:49.430> my<00:02:49.580> phone<00:02:49.820> here<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.870> like<00:02:50.990> I<00:02:51.020> say<00:02:51.230> you

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
this on my phone here and like I say you

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.570 
this on my phone here and like I say you
don't<00:02:51.560> actually<00:02:51.680> have<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:51.950> put<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:52.490> the

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
don't actually have to put this in the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.760 
don't actually have to put this in the
battery<00:02:52.910> compartment<00:02:53.030> piece<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.050> you<00:02:54.620> can

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
battery compartment piece and you can

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.940 
battery compartment piece and you can
actually<00:02:54.920> just<00:02:55.100> use<00:02:55.280> that<00:02:55.460> on<00:02:56.180> its<00:02:56.360> own<00:02:56.480> so

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
actually just use that on its own so

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.530 
actually just use that on its own so
really<00:02:57.950> nice<00:02:58.100> case<00:02:58.400> actually<00:02:58.700> I've<00:02:59.210> see<00:02:59.390> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
really nice case actually I've see the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.060 
really nice case actually I've see the
tilt<00:02:59.780> I<00:02:59.990> think<00:03:00.230> until<00:03:00.380> logo<00:03:00.710> looks<00:03:00.860> pretty

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
tilt I think until logo looks pretty

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.980 
tilt I think until logo looks pretty
coordinate<00:03:01.490> as<00:03:01.610> well<00:03:01.760> actually<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.330> if<00:03:02.900> you

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
coordinate as well actually and if you

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.570 
coordinate as well actually and if you
haven't<00:03:03.230> seen<00:03:03.380> I've<00:03:03.560> done<00:03:03.770> some<00:03:04.070> reviews<00:03:04.550> of

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
speaker so you're not going to have any

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.770 
speaker so you're not going to have any
sort<00:03:55.460> of<00:03:55.550> intrusion<00:03:56.090> or<00:03:56.180> interruption<00:03:56.750> to

sort of intrusion or interruption to

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.420 
sort of intrusion or interruption to
that<00:03:56.960> which<00:03:57.110> is<00:03:57.140> again<00:03:57.590> really<00:03:57.890> nice<00:03:58.040> like<00:03:58.220> say

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
that which is again really nice like say

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.620 
that which is again really nice like say
they've<00:03:58.610> they<00:03:59.030> have<00:03:59.180> really<00:03:59.390> thought<00:03:59.570> of

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
they've they have really thought of

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.960 
they've they have really thought of
everything<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.980> then<00:04:01.100> you<00:04:01.220> have<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.670> really

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
everything and then you have the really

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.090 
everything and then you have the really
recessed<00:04:02.500> headphone<00:04:03.500> jack<00:04:03.770> there<00:04:03.950> that

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
recessed headphone jack there that

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.160 
recessed headphone jack there that
obviously<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.490> essentially<00:04:05.450> goes<00:04:05.660> into<00:04:05.990> as

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
obviously the essentially goes into as

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.740 
obviously the essentially goes into as
well<00:04:06.200> as<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.950> charging<00:04:07.400> port<00:04:07.610> there<00:04:07.880> as

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
well as the the charging port there as

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.690 
well as the the charging port there as
well<00:04:08.900> as<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.740> know<00:04:09.830> quite<00:04:10.040> big<00:04:10.310> cut<00:04:10.520> out

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
well as the you know quite big cut out

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.760 
well as the you know quite big cut out
for<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.300> the<00:04:11.840> actual<00:04:12.110> camera<00:04:12.380> at<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.530> top

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
for the the actual camera at the top

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.130 
for the the actual camera at the top
there<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.850> this<00:04:13.970> is<00:04:14.150> just<00:04:14.270> a<00:04:14.450> little<00:04:14.720> battery

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
there and this is just a little battery

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.840 
there and this is just a little battery
indicator<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:15.950> just<00:04:16.190> have<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.340> little<00:04:16.520> bother

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
indicator so just have a little bother

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.479 
indicator so just have a little bother
that<00:04:17.150> shows<00:04:17.330> you<00:04:17.450> how<00:04:17.480> much<00:04:17.830> battery<00:04:18.830> is<00:04:19.130> you

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
that shows you how much battery is you

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.280 
that shows you how much battery is you
have<00:04:19.609> left<00:04:19.820> so<00:04:20.000> apparently<00:04:20.600> forever<00:04:20.960> do<00:04:21.109> what

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
have left so apparently forever do what

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.710 
have left so apparently forever do what
I<00:04:21.320> do<00:04:21.530> is<00:04:21.620> show<00:04:21.770> you<00:04:21.830> how<00:04:21.950> its<00:04:22.100> work<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:22.610> I<00:04:22.850> just

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
I do is show you how its work so I just

into the the connector the bottom that

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.450 
into the the connector the bottom that
lines<00:04:29.990> up<00:04:30.170> perfectly<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:30.830> just<00:04:31.040> go<00:04:31.130> straight

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
lines up perfectly so just go straight

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.370 
lines up perfectly so just go straight
in<00:04:31.640> and<00:04:32.210> now<00:04:32.360> that's<00:04:32.660> actually<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.350> case

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
in and now that's actually the case

still has full battery so you can use it

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.300 
still has full battery so you can use it
straight<00:04:54.470> out<00:04:54.530> of<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.710> box<00:04:54.860> which<00:04:55.009> is<00:04:55.070> pretty

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
straight out of the box which is pretty

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.760 
straight out of the box which is pretty
nice<00:04:55.780> overall<00:04:56.780> it's<00:04:57.020> just<00:04:57.199> a<00:04:57.289> really<00:04:57.650> good

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
nice overall it's just a really good

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.260 
nice overall it's just a really good
battery<00:04:58.130> case<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:58.370> know<00:04:58.850> there's<00:04:59.000> a<00:04:59.030> lot<00:04:59.240> of

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
battery case I know there's a lot of

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.120 
battery case I know there's a lot of
competition<00:04:59.840> out<00:04:59.930> there<00:04:59.990> but<00:05:00.590> I<00:05:00.620> think<00:05:00.889> this

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
competition out there but I think this

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.920 
competition out there but I think this
really<00:05:01.430> is<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.639> best<00:05:01.789> one<00:05:02.120> I've<00:05:02.300> used<00:05:02.509> so<00:05:02.720> far

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
really is the best one I've used so far

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.029 
really is the best one I've used so far
I<00:05:02.990> think<00:05:03.050> there's<00:05:03.440> just<00:05:03.530> so<00:05:03.680> much<00:05:03.800> thought

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
I think there's just so much thought

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.010 
I think there's just so much thought
that's<00:05:04.280> going<00:05:04.430> into<00:05:04.580> this<00:05:04.789> and<00:05:05.030> especially<00:05:05.660> as

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
that's going into this and especially as

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.480 
that's going into this and especially as
the<00:05:06.110> fact<00:05:06.289> that<00:05:06.350> you<00:05:06.500> have<00:05:06.650> two<00:05:06.919> extra<00:05:06.949> cases

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
the fact that you have two extra cases

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.279 
the fact that you have two extra cases
that<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:08.030> can<00:05:08.180> really<00:05:08.419> use<00:05:08.630> on<00:05:08.780> their<00:05:08.900> own<00:05:09.080> I

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
that you can really use on their own I

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.430 
that you can really use on their own I
mean<00:05:10.130> you<00:05:10.250> can<00:05:10.430> just<00:05:10.460> have<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.419> the<00:05:11.870> case<00:05:12.110> on

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
mean you can just have the the case on

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.920 
mean you can just have the the case on
the<00:05:13.430> slider<00:05:13.699> part<00:05:14.000> of<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.120> case<00:05:14.300> on<00:05:14.539> the<00:05:14.720> phone

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
the slider part of the case on the phone

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.840 
the slider part of the case on the phone
and<00:05:15.110> have<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.740> batteries<00:05:16.130> in<00:05:16.280> your<00:05:16.430> bag<00:05:16.669> or

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.800 
and have the batteries in your bag or
something<00:05:16.940> like<00:05:17.150> that<00:05:17.240> and<00:05:17.479> then<00:05:17.600> you<00:05:17.690> can

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
something like that and then you can

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.420 
something like that and then you can
just<00:05:17.930> pull<00:05:18.139> the<00:05:18.229> battery<00:05:18.560> pack<00:05:18.590> peace<00:05:19.039> out<00:05:19.250> and
