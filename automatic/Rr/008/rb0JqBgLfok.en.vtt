but whatever that's up to you and then

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.160 
but whatever that's up to you and then
one<00:02:39.160> person<00:02:39.580> eats<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:40.060> thundergun<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.959> then

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
one person eats the thundergun and then

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.020 
one person eats the thundergun and then
ideally<00:02:41.770> both<00:02:42.130> look<00:02:42.400> like<00:02:42.520> peppers<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
curse devices are just helpful for when

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.380 
curse devices are just helpful for when

you're running circles over there if you

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.520 
you're running circles over there if you

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
the beginning of the video it should be

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.979 
the beginning of the video it should be
running<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:25.150> annotation<00:03:25.569> should<00:03:25.690> be<00:03:25.780> running

part<00:03:30.220> solo<00:03:30.850> strategy<00:03:31.600> for<00:03:32.350> ascension<00:03:32.709> and

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
part solo strategy for ascension and

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.120 
part solo strategy for ascension and
he's<00:03:34.269> in<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.600> area<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:35.140> I<00:03:35.200> am<00:03:35.560> in<00:03:35.739> that<00:03:35.920> video

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
he's in the area that I am in that video

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.699 
he's in the area that I am in that video
so<00:03:36.549> if<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.819> don't<00:03:37.000> know<00:03:37.230> where<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.260> is<00:03:38.440> you

so if you don't know where that is you

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.130 
so if you don't know where that is you
can<00:03:38.830> click<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.310> watch<00:03:39.340> those<00:03:40.060> videos<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.870> see

can click and watch those videos and see
where<00:03:41.320> it<00:03:41.410> is<00:03:42.810> it's<00:03:43.810> not<00:03:44.019> hard<00:03:44.380> if<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.709> click

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
where it is it's not hard if you click

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.000 
where it is it's not hard if you click
on<00:03:45.010> any<00:03:45.190> part<00:03:45.489> after<00:03:45.670> like<00:03:46.060> part<00:03:46.420> 3<00:03:46.750> you'll<00:03:47.680> see

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
on any part after like part 3 you'll see

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.250 
on any part after like part 3 you'll see
it<00:03:48.160> oh<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.930> sound<00:03:50.560> good<00:03:51.630> you'll<00:03:52.630> understand
