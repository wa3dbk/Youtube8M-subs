00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.880
 Aigner that's who again and this time it's about women you come across 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.470
 BOM shocks could actually say I have a reference samples shock 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.250
 so to speak that Werder in this situation Kogel beautiful all-electric 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.080
 Countless old criminal in the beginning 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.840
 and percent, of course, on a direct route is halfway the 9 in this 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.330
 Fall the new way 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.530
 and when he's on line within the first diamond 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.500
 the journey was misplaced 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.690
 then here would be my rathor race bow I say so I have 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.440
 always trained 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.420
 until he was reasonably well off and from this year onwards 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.950
 Bow, I can then better estimate other bow thruster so 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.180
 from grandma 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.880
 Targets at the new past about three quarters diamond down there 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.200
 so this is my goal point so here Paessler make a whiter 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.130
 Direction three quarter diamond 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.000
 then i go into the push row of course according to Bow Stosur them 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.980
 Here a bit on your toes 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.410
 and then I need the force enough unfinished the straight line too 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.190
 create 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.190
 until January 9 were over after that 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.950
 After that, percent of the bows must be Unite Festspiele, but not now 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.909
 who still have drugs in it then 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.999
 Of course, that will not work in the direction, so I have to go a bit more 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.670
 more 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.830
 not exhausting says 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.830
 so here 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.200
 the 9th as the way of course that adds to my personal bad luck 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.330
 you can not do anything to him that is innate 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.660
 but a training-technical makes it first nothing because he should 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.079
 simply that he was Renz's bow 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:13.069
 and of course both since I came here then the 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.680
 complete diamond because this diamond is seen from the ears Ahlen 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.680
 Corresponds to these three quarters of diamonds 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.159
 and then the same from the other side 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.449
 so at this 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.579
 reasonably can 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.709
 then of course you can too 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.709
 Ott similar 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.689
 Bow thrusts Merkel suppose Lehmann the Esslinger the one because of the gang 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.039
 and then here is Dr then I know I also have 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:49.039
 Moser worry about her three quarters of diamonds 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.339
 percent target and then she knows that Erwin Fall still come with the bow drum 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.339
 to touch the three more Reeses 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.989
 or the same thing the other way round 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.679
 only by lying there 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:07.669
 dictate 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.339
 it's the same again, yes 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:14.469
 Dasing snack not quite so far away I have to go 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.959
 Generate a little more arc than usual I know that 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.959
 or if the whitish submits less of course 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.459
 the cti- more here 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.299
 then of course it would be her - to go this way because of one with the 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.399
 put 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:32.939
 So no matter now here at the ball over in three quarters corresponds to the 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:33.779
 admonished 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.779
 and it's the same goat again 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.900
 Of course, not being good enough was not the same Burgenland next to it 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:48.899
 worse executed 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.610
 both on the main again this is my reference bow 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.010
 and then there is a second reference bow for half the table 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.949
 Length that was the reference point for all the strands here 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.959
 and with that I too can all these three quarters of all Norman Thier man 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.120
 lasts longer or shorter or 2 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.120
 I can also better assess the others with it 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:18.789
 look and maybe the short hair that is of course then this 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.789
 Line on 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:26.009
 but there are already close to the head 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.780
 So if I'm over half the table longer here, this curve approaches 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.410
 then keep it open diamond next to it is targeted a steeper as usual 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.110
 Of course, more has to be achieved, and even a bit too much 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:50.360
 and the practice also on both sides then you have here a run away 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.669
 and so you can bridge and assess some situation already 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.280
 and now I'm going to go a bit further to Bode Bogen, too
