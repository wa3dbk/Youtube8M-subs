00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
bit but not really another question I

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.440 
bit but not really another question I
get<00:00:40.890> asked<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> lot<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.430> how<00:00:41.579> long<00:00:42.000> people<00:00:42.300> have

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
get asked a lot is how long people have

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.180 
get asked a lot is how long people have
to<00:00:42.719> wait<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.020> take<00:00:43.200> their<00:00:43.410> nose<00:00:43.590> piercing<00:00:44.040> out

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
to wait to take their nose piercing out

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.799 
to wait to take their nose piercing out
I<00:00:44.989> waited<00:00:45.989> about<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:47.010> month<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.510> wasn't

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
I waited about a month and it wasn't

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.400 
I waited about a month and it wasn't
fully<00:00:48.960> healed<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.579> took<00:00:50.899> about<00:00:51.899> four

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
fully healed and so it took about four

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.500 
fully healed and so it took about four
times<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:52.949> long<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.579> actually<00:00:53.730> heal<00:00:54.329> up

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
times as long for it to actually heal up

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.110 
times as long for it to actually heal up
because<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> took<00:00:55.199> my<00:00:55.739> piercing<00:00:56.670> out<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.090> I

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
because I took my piercing out so I

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.029 
because I took my piercing out so I
would<00:00:57.390> really<00:00:57.600> suggest<00:00:57.809> waiting<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> full

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
would really suggest waiting the full

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.880 
would really suggest waiting the full
six<00:00:59.309> weeks<00:00:59.520> weeks<00:01:00.059> at<00:01:00.329> least<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.960> know<00:01:01.649> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
six weeks weeks at least I know you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.470 
six weeks weeks at least I know you
really<00:01:02.190> want<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> take<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.699> out<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.030> change<00:01:03.210> it

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
really want to take it out and change it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.920 
really want to take it out and change it
but<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.960> promise<00:01:05.119> it's<00:01:06.119> definitely<00:01:06.720> worth<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
but I promise it's definitely worth the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.530 
but I promise it's definitely worth the
wait<00:01:07.049> because<00:01:07.430> putting<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.610> new<00:01:08.790> ring<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.270> if

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
wait because putting a new ring in if

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.240 
wait because putting a new ring in if
you're<00:01:09.720> not<00:01:09.900> fully<00:01:10.140> healed<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.619> your<00:01:10.740> nose

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
you're not fully healed in your nose

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.469 
you're not fully healed in your nose
it<00:01:11.869> kills<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.729> getting<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.850> nose<00:01:15.060> pierced

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
it kills like getting you nose pierced

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.899 
it kills like getting you nose pierced
is<00:01:15.659> not<00:01:15.840> nearly<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.890> painful<00:01:17.130> as<00:01:17.520> trying<00:01:17.820> to

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
is not nearly as painful as trying to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.399 
is not nearly as painful as trying to
put<00:01:18.060> another<00:01:18.330> nose<00:01:18.570> ring<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.900> when<00:01:19.080> your<00:01:19.259> nose

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
put another nose ring in when your nose

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.060 
put another nose ring in when your nose
isn't<00:01:19.619> healed<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.570> wait

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
isn't healed so really just just wait

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.410

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
use the best because they go in easy and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.539 
use the best because they go in easy and
they<00:01:39.600> stay<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:40.049> pretty<00:01:40.380> well<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.310> it's

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
they stay in there pretty well so it's

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.810 
they stay in there pretty well so it's
you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.270> pretty<00:01:42.600> easy<00:01:43.220> but<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.700> know

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
you know it's pretty easy but you know

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.270 
you know it's pretty easy but you know
if<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.810> falls<00:01:46.140> out<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.649> easily<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:46.979> you

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
if that falls out really easily for you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.940 
if that falls out really easily for you
you<00:01:47.820> should<00:01:47.970> either<00:01:48.119> try<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:49.290> bigger<00:01:49.590> gage<00:01:49.920> just

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
you should either try a bigger gage just

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.160 
you should either try a bigger gage just
a<00:01:50.399> tiny<00:01:50.610> bit<00:01:50.850> one<00:01:51.119> size<00:01:51.329> up<00:01:51.570> which<00:01:51.840> might<00:01:52.020> be

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
a tiny bit one size up which might be

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.780 
a tiny bit one size up which might be
too<00:01:52.320> big<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.560> maybe<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.280> shouldn't<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:53.640> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
too big so maybe you shouldn't do that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.420 
too big so maybe you shouldn't do that
or<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.810> could<00:01:54.930> try<00:01:55.110> corkscrew<00:01:55.860> which<00:01:56.189> you

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
or you could try corkscrew which you

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.280 
or you could try corkscrew which you
don't<00:01:57.060> want<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.299> use<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.780> know<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.020> isn't

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
don't want to use if you know this isn't

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.139 
don't want to use if you know this isn't
fully<00:01:58.469> healed<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.430> hurts<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
fully healed because it hurts and it's a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.819 
fully healed because it hurts and it's a
pain<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:00.899> there's<00:02:01.110> swelling<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.649> won't

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
pain and if there's swelling it won't

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.450 
pain and if there's swelling it won't
get<00:02:01.979> through<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:03.770> it's<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.860> pain<00:02:05.070> so

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
get through and it's just it's a pain so

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.809 
get through and it's just it's a pain so
I<00:02:05.729> would<00:02:06.570> suggest<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.469> hook<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.429> problem

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
I would suggest the hook one the problem

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.369 
I would suggest the hook one the problem
with<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.750> little<00:02:09.959> ball<00:02:10.140> at<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
with the one with a little ball at the

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.290 
with the one with a little ball at the
end<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.160> ball<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.610> supposed<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> be

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
end is that that ball is supposed to be

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.450 
end is that that ball is supposed to be
bigger<00:02:12.540> than<00:02:12.599> your<00:02:12.810> actual

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
bigger than your actual

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.180 
bigger than your actual
piercing<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.240> it<00:02:14.360> stretches<00:02:14.750> your<00:02:15.530> nose<00:02:15.740> as<00:02:16.070> it

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
piercing so it stretches your nose as it

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.160 
piercing so it stretches your nose as it
goes<00:02:16.340> in<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.670> out<00:02:16.820> so<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.450> can<00:02:17.720> kind<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:17.960> hurt

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
goes in and out so that can kind of hurt

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.810 
goes in and out so that can kind of hurt
and<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.740> kind<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:18.950> irritates<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.640> nose

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
and it kind of irritates you nose

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.260 
and it kind of irritates you nose
sometimes<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.710> don't<00:02:21.980> really<00:02:22.160> like<00:02:23.060> using

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
sometimes so I don't really like using

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.220 
sometimes so I don't really like using
those<00:02:23.540> ones<00:02:24.940> another<00:02:25.940> question<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.570> get<00:02:26.780> asked

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
those ones another question I get asked

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.080 
those ones another question I get asked
is<00:02:27.350> whether<00:02:27.620> or<00:02:27.800> not<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.070> can<00:02:28.190> see<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.430> hole<00:02:28.760> and

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
is whether or not you can see a hole and

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.760 
is whether or not you can see a hole and
your<00:02:29.450> nose<00:02:29.630> once<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.020> take<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.290> piercing<00:02:30.620> out

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
your nose once you take the piercing out

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.550 
your nose once you take the piercing out
and<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.220> answer<00:02:31.490> is<00:02:31.610> yes<00:02:31.820> it's<00:02:32.240> like<00:02:32.510> your<00:02:33.350> ear
