ability factory goes down easy smooth
it's<00:02:30.180> better<00:02:30.450> than<00:02:30.630> some<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.140> ciders<00:02:31.470> I've

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
it's better than some of the ciders I've

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.710 
it's better than some of the ciders I've
tasted<00:02:31.770> recently<00:02:32.459> slightly<00:02:33.390> better<00:02:33.510> than

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
tasted recently slightly better than

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.199 
tasted recently slightly better than
average<00:02:33.870> I'm<00:02:34.200> not<00:02:34.350> going<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.530> say<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:34.770> great

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
average I'm not going to say it's great

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.640 
average I'm not going to say it's great
I'm<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.330> little<00:02:36.780> bit<00:02:36.900> let<00:02:37.110> down<00:02:37.140> honestly

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
I'm a little bit let down honestly

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.020 
I'm a little bit let down honestly
because<00:02:37.950> I've<00:02:38.130> heard<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.489> many<00:02:38.670> great<00:02:38.790> things

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
because I've heard so many great things

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.830 
because I've heard so many great things
about<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:40.620> tangy<00:02:41.040> it's<00:02:41.250> tardy<00:02:41.850> if

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
about this it's tangy it's tardy if

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.590 
about this it's tangy it's tardy if
you're<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.350> fan<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.650> hard<00:02:44.580> cider<00:02:44.820> I'd<00:02:45.270> say<00:02:45.420> give

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
you're a fan of hard cider I'd say give

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.199 
you're a fan of hard cider I'd say give
it<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.750> shot<00:02:46.020> like<00:02:46.800> for<00:02:47.070> me<00:02:47.190> I'm<00:02:47.489> not<00:02:47.910> sure<00:02:48.120> if

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
it a shot like for me I'm not sure if

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.160 
it a shot like for me I'm not sure if
I'm<00:02:48.330> gonna<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.780> again<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.110> little

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
I'm gonna have it again it's a little

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.500 
I'm gonna have it again it's a little
bit<00:02:49.320> too<00:02:49.500> sweet<00:02:49.680> for<00:02:49.830> me<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.430> like<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.270> it'll<00:02:51.420> be

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
bit too sweet for me I like it it'll be

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.600 
bit too sweet for me I like it it'll be
a<00:02:51.540> little<00:02:51.750> bit<00:02:51.840> strong<00:02:52.260> with<00:02:52.470> alcohol<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.220> think

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
a little bit strong with alcohol I think

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.710 
a little bit strong with alcohol I think
would<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:53.760> more<00:02:53.910> balanced<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.510> way

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
would be more balanced that way

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.930 
would be more balanced that way
personally<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.489> little<00:02:56.670> too<00:02:56.790> sweet

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
personally but it's a little too sweet

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.690 
personally but it's a little too sweet
for<00:02:57.090> me<00:02:57.500> I'd<00:02:58.500> say<00:02:58.709> it's<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.950> slightly<00:02:59.459> above

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
for me I'd say it's a slightly above

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.000 
for me I'd say it's a slightly above
average<00:02:59.910> better<00:03:00.870> than<00:03:01.170> some<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.530> ciders

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
average better than some of the ciders

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.550 
average better than some of the ciders
