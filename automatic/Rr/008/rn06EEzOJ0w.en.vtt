00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
Pat Brown what does it tell you the fact

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.770 
Pat Brown what does it tell you the fact
that<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.280> man<00:00:50.670> allegedly<00:00:51.030> murdered<00:00:51.629> her<00:00:51.690> at

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that this man allegedly murdered her at

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.660 
that this man allegedly murdered her at
the<00:00:51.899> same<00:00:52.079> day<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.320> he<00:00:52.530> raped<00:00:52.710> her<00:00:52.890> well<00:00:53.489> my

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the same day that he raped her well my

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.540 
the same day that he raped her well my
guess<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.000> Pat<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.750> he<00:00:55.160> accidentally<00:00:56.160> killed

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
guess is Pat that he accidentally killed

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.860 
guess is Pat that he accidentally killed
her<00:00:56.699> while<00:00:56.850> he<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.180> raping<00:00:57.329> her<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.629> know

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
her while he was raping her you know

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.420 
her while he was raping her you know
little<00:00:58.320> children<00:00:58.680> are<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:58.890> annoying<00:00:59.250> that

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
little children are just annoying that

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.860 
little children are just annoying that
way<00:00:59.609> when<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.149> rape<00:01:00.300> them<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:00.600> tend<00:01:00.840> to

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
way when you rape them they tend to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.260 
way when you rape them they tend to
object<00:01:01.379> they<00:01:01.680> tend<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.949> be<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.550> upset<00:01:02.969> about<00:01:03.000> it

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
object they tend to be be upset about it

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.179 
object they tend to be be upset about it
so<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.199> do<00:01:04.409> something<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.890> smother

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so you have to do something like smother

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.890 
so you have to do something like smother
them<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:05.610> strangle<00:01:06.330> them<00:01:06.479> because<00:01:06.510> they're

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
them or strangle them because they're

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.330 
them or strangle them because they're
just<00:01:06.930> they're<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.500> complaining<00:01:08.130> too<00:01:08.310> much

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
just they're just complaining too much

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.370 
just they're just complaining too much
and<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.119> my<00:01:09.270> guess<00:01:09.330> that's<00:01:09.720> exactly<00:01:10.140> what<00:01:10.290> he

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and so my guess that's exactly what he

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.370 
and so my guess that's exactly what he
did<00:01:10.560> oh<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:11.100> interesting<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:13.140> don't

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
did oh that's interesting so you don't

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.190 
did oh that's interesting so you don't
think<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.189> he<00:01:14.670> allegedly<00:01:15.630> performed<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
think that he allegedly performed the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.749 
think that he allegedly performed the
rape<00:01:16.380> then<00:01:16.890> took<00:01:17.100> her<00:01:17.189> somewhere<00:01:17.400> else<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
rape then took her somewhere else to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.280 
rape then took her somewhere else to
murder<00:01:17.970> then<00:01:18.420> took<00:01:18.570> us<00:01:18.720> somewhere<00:01:18.960> else<00:01:19.020> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
murder then took us somewhere else to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.380 
murder then took us somewhere else to
dump<00:01:19.530> her<00:01:19.650> body<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.159> think<00:01:20.790> he<00:01:21.030> may<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.150> taken

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
dump her body I think he may have taken

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.640 
dump her body I think he may have taken
her<00:01:21.450> somewhere<00:01:21.659> else<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.900> dump<00:01:22.140> her<00:01:22.229> body<00:01:22.439> but

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
her somewhere else to dump her body but

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.870 
her somewhere else to dump her body but
my<00:01:22.770> guess<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.040> she<00:01:23.310> didn't<00:01:23.490> come<00:01:23.580> out<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.759> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
my guess is she didn't come out of that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.270 
my guess is she didn't come out of that
little<00:01:24.140> hotel<00:01:25.140> alive<00:01:25.409> yeah<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.159> know

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
what exactly does that mean that's not

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.289 
what exactly does that mean that's not
necessarily<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> same<00:01:32.820> thing<00:01:32.880> as

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
necessarily the same thing as

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.060 
necessarily the same thing as
strangulation<00:01:33.869> correct<00:01:34.350> right<00:01:34.860> it's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
strangulation correct right it's

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.859 
strangulation correct right it's
basically<00:01:35.460> suffocating<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> child<00:01:36.600> and
