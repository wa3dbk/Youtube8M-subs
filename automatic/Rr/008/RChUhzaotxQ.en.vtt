00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
arm mounts and tie rod ends all he would

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.020 
arm mounts and tie rod ends all he would
have<00:03:08.049> to<00:03:08.200> do<00:03:08.379> is<00:03:08.830> position<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.489> tester

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
have to do is position the tester

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.600 
have to do is position the tester
horizontally<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:11.349> is<00:03:11.530> very<00:03:11.769> easy<00:03:12.099> to<00:03:12.310> feel

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
horizontally it is very easy to feel

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.940 
horizontally it is very easy to feel
whether<00:03:12.940> or<00:03:13.150> not<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:13.360> bushing<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:13.959> worn<00:03:14.230> but

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
whether or not a bushing is worn but

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.610 
whether or not a bushing is worn but
obviously<00:03:15.489> difficult<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.209> see<00:03:16.390> so<00:03:16.660> now<00:03:17.410> we'll

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
obviously difficult to see so now we'll

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.680 
obviously difficult to see so now we'll
demonstrate<00:03:17.799> an<00:03:18.430> alternative<00:03:19.090> method<00:03:19.299> which

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
demonstrate an alternative method which

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.710 
demonstrate an alternative method which
unfortunately<00:03:20.790> requires<00:03:21.790> two<00:03:22.120> people<00:03:22.150> to

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
unfortunately requires two people to

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.110 
unfortunately requires two people to
make<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:23.019> work<00:03:23.260> we'll<00:03:23.920> take<00:03:24.159> the<00:03:24.280> unusual<00:03:24.610> step

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
make it work we'll take the unusual step

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.910 
make it work we'll take the unusual step
of<00:03:25.239> lifting<00:03:25.629> the<00:03:25.659> platform<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.409> take<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.620> look

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
of lifting the platform to take a look

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.470 
of lifting the platform to take a look
at<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.129> control<00:03:27.579> arm<00:03:27.790> bushings<00:03:28.239> from

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
at the control arm bushings from

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.780 
at the control arm bushings from
underneath<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:29.019> car<00:03:29.400> Torsten<00:03:30.400> would<00:03:30.700> you

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
underneath the car Torsten would you

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:46.390 
underneath the car Torsten would you
please<00:03:31.000> proceed<00:03:31.239> it's<00:03:32.019> my<00:03:32.290> pleasure

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.690 

so<00:03:47.299> this<00:03:47.629> is<00:03:47.780> our<00:03:47.989> control<00:03:48.230> arm<00:03:48.709> bushing<00:03:49.159> when

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
so this is our control arm bushing when

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.880 
so this is our control arm bushing when
Torsten<00:03:50.180> is<00:03:50.299> moving<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.870> joint<00:03:51.140> playtester

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
Torsten is moving the joint playtester

Torsten is moving the joint playtester
horizontally<00:03:52.519> you<00:03:53.090> can<00:03:53.120> clearly<00:03:53.569> see<00:03:53.959> the

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
horizontally you can clearly see the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.559 
horizontally you can clearly see the
bars<00:03:54.379> moving<00:03:54.769> too<00:03:55.099> once<00:03:55.970> you're<00:03:56.120> under<00:03:56.239> car

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
bars moving too once you're under car

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.660 
bars moving too once you're under car
you<00:03:57.049> can<00:03:57.200> also<00:03:57.349> look<00:03:57.620> out<00:03:57.769> for<00:03:58.040> control<00:03:58.340> arm

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
you can also look out for control arm

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.699 
you can also look out for control arm
bars<00:03:58.970> which<00:03:59.239> are<00:03:59.599> already<00:03:59.780> cracked<00:04:00.379> or

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
bars which are already cracked or

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
bushings which are coming loose there

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.990 
bushings which are coming loose there
are<00:04:03.140> actually<00:04:03.470> some<00:04:03.620> minor<00:04:03.920> fishes<00:04:04.400> but

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
are actually some minor fishes but

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.530 
are actually some minor fishes but
they're<00:04:05.269> not<00:04:05.450> a<00:04:05.510> problem<00:04:05.840> at<00:04:06.049> this<00:04:06.230> stage<00:04:07.540> if

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
they're not a problem at this stage if

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.420 
they're not a problem at this stage if
they<00:04:08.780> were<00:04:08.840> allowed<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.439> spread<00:04:09.680> however<00:04:10.159> a

wobbling in the steering wheel and

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.830 
wobbling in the steering wheel and
unresponsive<00:04:13.129> steering<00:04:13.970> would<00:04:14.480> be<00:04:14.689> the

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
unresponsive steering would be the

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.090 
unresponsive steering would be the
warning<00:04:15.230> sight<00:04:17.500> alternately<00:04:18.500> what<00:04:18.859> could

warning sight alternately what could
also<00:04:19.220> happen<00:04:19.609> is<00:04:20.090> that<00:04:20.269> driving<00:04:20.780> safety<00:04:21.049> will

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
also happen is that driving safety will

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.060 
also happen is that driving safety will
no<00:04:21.590> longer<00:04:21.889> be<00:04:22.160> guaranteed<00:04:22.340> when<00:04:23.000> braking
