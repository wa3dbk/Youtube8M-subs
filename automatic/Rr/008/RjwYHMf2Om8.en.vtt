start by hand and it's okay you know if
it<00:01:13.530> starts<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.010> even<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.310> little<00:01:14.430> bit

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
it starts to get in even a little bit

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.249 
it starts to get in even a little bit
like<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.090> said<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.570> adjust<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.140> do

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
like I said we can adjust it and do

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.740 
like I said we can adjust it and do
things<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.759> that<00:01:17.759> way<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.450> kind

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
things like that that way I do is kind

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.870 
things like that that way I do is kind
of<00:01:18.810> make<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.200> really<00:01:19.470> sharp<00:01:19.830> bend<00:01:20.159> by

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
of make this a really sharp bend by

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.450 
of make this a really sharp bend by
using<00:01:21.060> my<00:01:21.270> steel<00:01:21.509> block<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.140> sandbag<00:01:22.890> mm-hmm

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
using my steel block on a sandbag mm-hmm

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
using my steel block on a sandbag mm-hmm
and<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.450> reason<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.810> put<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> sandbag<00:01:25.590> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
and the reason I put it on a sandbag is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.249 
and the reason I put it on a sandbag is
to<00:01:26.400> deaden<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.700> sound<00:01:26.759> because<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.810> loud

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
to deaden the sound because it's loud

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.499 
to deaden the sound because it's loud
enough<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.479> a

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
enough as it is and if this is on a

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.569 
enough as it is and if this is on a
table<00:01:30.990> really<00:01:31.500> loud<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:32.189> annoys<00:01:32.460> your

table really loud really annoys your

table really loud really annoys your
neighbors<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:34.200> seems<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.710> gives<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.979> a

little<00:01:35.159> more<00:01:35.430> control<00:01:35.820> also<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.450> lot<00:01:36.600> more

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
little more control also a lot more

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.390 
little more control also a lot more
control<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.500> doesn't<00:01:37.770> bounce<00:01:37.890> around<00:01:38.250> isn't

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
control it doesn't bounce around isn't

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.910 
control it doesn't bounce around isn't
nearly<00:01:38.700> as<00:01:38.850> much<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.590> want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> use<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
nearly as much and you want to use a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.200 
nearly as much and you want to use a
hammer<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.250> has<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> flat<00:01:41.729> face<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.180> a

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
hammer that has a flat face like a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.240 
hammer that has a flat face like a
chasing<00:01:42.659> hammer<00:01:42.689> mm-hmm<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.040> case

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
chasing hammer mm-hmm and in this case

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.219 
chasing hammer mm-hmm and in this case
this<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.460> called<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.909> planishing<00:01:45.270> hammer<00:01:45.299> okay

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
this is called a planishing hammer okay

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.319 
this is called a planishing hammer okay
so<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:46.680> both<00:01:46.829> work<00:01:47.040> really<00:01:47.310> quite<00:01:47.520> well<00:01:47.670> nice

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
so they both work really quite well nice

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.240 
so they both work really quite well nice
polished<00:01:48.780> surface<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
polished surface on there it's not to

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.550 
polished surface on there it's not to
Mar<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.460> metal<00:01:50.820> once<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.049> bent

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
Mar the metal once you have it bent

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980 
Mar the metal once you have it bent
really<00:01:53.189> tight<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:54.119> take<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> same<00:01:54.689> hammer

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
really tight you take the same hammer

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.080 
really tight you take the same hammer
you're<00:01:55.380> gonna<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> dome<00:01:55.890> side<00:01:56.509> and<00:01:57.509> start

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
you're gonna be a dome side and start

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.380 
you're gonna be a dome side and start
and<00:02:00.090> bring<00:02:00.300> this<00:02:00.390> out<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> little<00:02:00.720> flat<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:03.240> can

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
and bring this out a little flat you can

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:13.490 
and bring this out a little flat you can
make<00:02:03.510> it<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.750> flat<00:02:03.930> as<00:02:04.080> you<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:12.230> we'll<00:02:13.230> start

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
make it as flat as you like we'll start

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.760 
make it as flat as you like we'll start
there<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:15.360> once<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:15.660> have<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.870> next<00:02:16.680> thing

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
there and once we have that next thing

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.930 
there and once we have that next thing
what<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.010> need<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.370> kind<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.610> pull<00:02:17.820> it

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
what you need to do is kind of pull it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.640 
what you need to do is kind of pull it
apart<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.780> kind<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.020> gives<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.380> twist

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
apart that kind of gives it to twist

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.750 
apart that kind of gives it to twist
mm-hmm<00:02:20.310> unless<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.180> do<00:02:21.300> by<00:02:21.420> hand<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:23.010> try<00:02:23.700> to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
mm-hmm unless you do by hand and try to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.520 
mm-hmm unless you do by hand and try to
bend<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.209> like<00:02:24.240> right<00:02:24.630> up<00:02:24.720> here<00:02:24.930> really<00:02:25.170> even

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
bend it like right up here really even

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.570 
bend it like right up here really even
mm-hmm<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:27.650> kind<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.709> right<00:02:28.860> up<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.190> flat

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
mm-hmm and kind of right up to that flat

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.949 
mm-hmm and kind of right up to that flat
part<00:02:29.790> then<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.450> hammered

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
part then you just hammered

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.630 
part then you just hammered
yeah<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.410> tighter<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.860> get<00:02:32.010> your<00:02:32.160> fingers<00:02:32.489> up

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
yeah the tighter you get your fingers up

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.550 
yeah the tighter you get your fingers up
in<00:02:32.760> here<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.450> use<00:02:33.720> your<00:02:33.750> thumbs<00:02:34.080> as<00:02:34.200> leverage

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
in here and use your thumbs as leverage

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.590 
in here and use your thumbs as leverage
the<00:02:34.920> more<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.370> pull<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.670> apart<00:02:35.760> yeah<00:02:36.270> you

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
the more you can pull it apart yeah you

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.330 
the more you can pull it apart yeah you
can<00:02:36.750> see<00:02:36.870> how<00:02:36.959> tight<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.680> getting<00:02:38.010> and

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
can see how tight that is getting and

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.680 
can see how tight that is getting and
plus<00:02:38.580> where<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.880> hammered<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.300> here<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.540> makes

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
plus where you hammered it here it makes

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.460 
plus where you hammered it here it makes
it<00:02:39.810> stand<00:02:40.080> up

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
it stand up

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.800 
it stand up
that's<00:02:41.160> really<00:02:41.400> pretty<00:02:41.670> exactly<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.330> then<00:02:42.750> we

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
that's really pretty exactly and then we

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.510 
that's really pretty exactly and then we
can<00:02:43.050> do<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.290> take<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.709> once<00:02:44.130> we<00:02:44.220> get<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.400> this

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
can do is take this once we get to this

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.110 
can do is take this once we get to this
point<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.910> take<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.300> rawhide<00:02:45.750> or<00:02:47.120> deadblow

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
point and take a rawhide or deadblow

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.229 
point and take a rawhide or deadblow
hammer<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:50.010> kind<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.820> straighten<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.209> out

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
hammer and kind of straighten it out

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.310 
hammer and kind of straighten it out
just<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.570> little<00:02:51.600> bit<00:02:52.880> okay<00:02:53.959> now<00:02:54.959> what<00:02:55.110> we<00:02:55.170> need

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
just a little bit okay now what we need

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.740 
just a little bit okay now what we need
to<00:02:55.380> do<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.530> put<00:02:55.709> some<00:02:55.860> ends<00:02:56.130> on<00:02:56.250> here<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:57.570> that

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
to do is put some ends on here so that

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.800 
to do is put some ends on here so that
gives<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.650> little<00:02:58.709> bit<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.950> flair<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.489> a

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
gives it a little bit of flair and a

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.390 
gives it a little bit of flair and a
wider<00:03:00.810> end<00:03:01.110> mm-hmm<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:01.860> then<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.160> don't<00:03:02.310> have

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
wider end mm-hmm and then you don't have

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.120 
wider end mm-hmm and then you don't have
any<00:03:02.549> sharp<00:03:02.700> edges<00:03:02.940> -<00:03:03.390> exactly<00:03:04.320> it's<00:03:04.950> going<00:03:05.070> to

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
any sharp edges - exactly it's going to

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.320 
any sharp edges - exactly it's going to
help<00:03:05.220> take<00:03:05.430> care<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.730> we<00:03:05.910> use<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> same

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
help take care of that we use the same

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.490 
help take care of that we use the same
hammer<00:03:07.160> slightly<00:03:08.160> domed<00:03:08.340> face<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.320> try<00:03:10.320> and

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
hammer slightly domed face and try and

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.240 
hammer slightly domed face and try and
get<00:03:10.769> this<00:03:10.920> in<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.670> right<00:03:11.820> configuration<00:03:12.030> I

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
get this in the right configuration I

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.009 
get this in the right configuration I
kind<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.310> start<00:03:14.549> back<00:03:14.910> here<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.510> little<00:03:15.660> bit<00:03:15.810> not

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
kind of start back here a little bit not

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.090 
kind of start back here a little bit not
right<00:03:16.230> at<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.410> very<00:03:16.470> end

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
right at the very end

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.550 
right at the very end
why<00:03:17.850> is<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.060> because<00:03:18.989> if<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.170> start<00:03:19.470> at<00:03:19.530> the

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
why is that because if you start at the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.380 
why is that because if you start at the
very<00:03:19.769> end<00:03:20.130> it's<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.549> little<00:03:20.760> you'll<00:03:21.120> get<00:03:21.269> like

very end it's a little you'll get like

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.380 
very end it's a little you'll get like
this<00:03:21.480> kind<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.750> mushroom<00:03:22.140> egg<00:03:22.290> thing<00:03:22.590> oh<00:03:22.769> and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
yeah cuz I'm forging this is called

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.890 
yeah cuz I'm forging this is called
forging<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.550> I'm<00:03:46.270> moving<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:46.780> metal<00:03:48.900> dad

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
forging and I'm moving that metal dad

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.810 
forging and I'm moving that metal dad
okay<00:03:50.440> can<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:50.680> show<00:03:50.800> us<00:03:50.950> doing<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.460> other<00:03:51.580> end

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
okay can you show us doing the other end

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.940 
okay can you show us doing the other end
also<00:03:52.320> this<00:03:53.320> one<00:03:53.470> mm-hmm

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
also this one mm-hmm

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:03.270 
also this one mm-hmm
yeah<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:01.510> by<00:04:01.750> using<00:04:01.960> the<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.500> domed<00:04:02.740> end<00:04:03.010> it's

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
yeah and by using the the domed end it's

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.650 
yeah and by using the the domed end it's
going<00:04:03.460> to<00:04:03.550> spread<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:03.910> out<00:04:04.060> a<00:04:04.270> little<00:04:04.480> more

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
going to spread it out a little more

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:14.730 
going to spread it out a little more
evenly<00:04:12.510> alright<00:04:13.510> and<00:04:13.840> that's<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.410> technique

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
evenly alright and that's a technique

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.560 
evenly alright and that's a technique
that<00:04:14.980> people<00:04:15.010> also<00:04:15.520> use<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:15.730> blend<00:04:16.180> of<00:04:16.330> head

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
that people also use a blend of head

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.270 
that people also use a blend of head
pins<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:17.170> make<00:04:17.290> a<00:04:17.350> paddle<00:04:17.590> heads<00:04:17.890> I'm<00:04:18.070> right

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
pins to make a paddle heads I'm right

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.789 
pins to make a paddle heads I'm right
just<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:19.000> heavier<00:04:19.269> wire<00:04:19.450> more<00:04:20.080> force<00:04:20.350> right

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
just a heavier wire more force right

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.120 
just a heavier wire more force right
okay<00:04:21.300> now<00:04:22.300> what<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.080> can<00:04:23.290> do<00:04:23.470> is<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.770> can<00:04:23.890> take

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
okay now what you can do is you can take

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.790 
okay now what you can do is you can take
your<00:04:24.280> files<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.970> kind<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:26.080> there's<00:04:26.410> you<00:04:26.620> see

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
your files and kind of there's you see

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
there's a little yeah sharp it over

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.070 
there's a little yeah sharp it over

there just take a file or sandpaper kind
of<00:04:32.230> you're<00:04:32.650> just<00:04:32.680> gonna<00:04:32.890> file<00:04:33.160> it<00:04:33.190> down<00:04:33.370> just<00:04:34.030> a

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
of you're just gonna file it down just a

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.290 
of you're just gonna file it down just a
little<00:04:34.150> bit<00:04:34.360> make<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.140> nice<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.380> smooth<00:04:35.770> and

little bit make it nice and smooth and

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.480 
little bit make it nice and smooth and
what's<00:04:37.300> your<00:04:37.420> trick<00:04:37.600> so<00:04:37.870> good<00:04:38.310> yeah<00:04:39.310> really

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
what's your trick so good yeah really

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.460 
what's your trick so good yeah really
tell<00:04:39.820> on<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.300> other<00:04:40.450> end<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:41.110> difference

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
tell on the other end the difference

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.930 
tell on the other end the difference
where<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.710> see<00:04:41.920> how<00:04:42.070> reflective<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.670> isn't

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
where you see how reflective it isn't

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.490 
where you see how reflective it isn't
shiny<00:04:43.150> that's<00:04:43.600> because<00:04:43.870> our<00:04:43.990> hammer<00:04:44.260> was

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
shiny that's because our hammer was

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.260 
shiny that's because our hammer was
really<00:04:44.740> smooth<00:04:45.010> oh<00:04:45.190> okay

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
really smooth oh okay

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.670 
really smooth oh okay
you<00:04:46.630> could<00:04:46.810> get<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:46.960> totally<00:04:47.320> different<00:04:47.620> effect

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
you could get a totally different effect

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.650 
you could get a totally different effect
if<00:04:48.010> you<00:04:48.040> use<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.400> touch<00:04:48.550> your<00:04:48.760> hammers<00:04:49.090> exactly

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
if you use to touch your hammers exactly

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.020 
if you use to touch your hammers exactly
mm-hmm<00:04:50.320> so<00:04:51.070> once<00:04:51.220> we<00:04:51.370> get<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.610> that<00:04:51.730> point<00:04:51.880> we

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
mm-hmm so once we get to that point we

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.010 
mm-hmm so once we get to that point we
need<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:52.240> make<00:04:52.390> sure<00:04:52.419> you<00:04:52.540> make<00:04:52.690> it<00:04:52.720> into<00:04:52.930> a

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
need to make sure you make it into a

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.380 
need to make sure you make it into a
bracelet<00:04:53.380> okay<00:04:53.980> what<00:04:54.669> we're<00:04:54.790> gonna<00:04:54.850> do<00:04:55.090> is<00:04:55.240> use

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
bracelet okay what we're gonna do is use

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.270 
bracelet okay what we're gonna do is use
a<00:04:55.419> bracelet<00:04:55.840> mandrel<00:04:55.960> and<00:04:56.350> this<00:04:57.010> one<00:04:57.160> is

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
a bracelet mandrel and this one is

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.670 
a bracelet mandrel and this one is
particularly<00:04:57.640> is<00:04:57.970> called<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.330> stepped<00:04:58.680> because

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
particularly is called a stepped because

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.020 
particularly is called a stepped because
it<00:04:59.800> has<00:04:59.890> a<00:04:59.919> different<00:05:00.100> graduation<00:05:00.850> see

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
it has a different graduation see

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.760 
it has a different graduation see
exactly<00:05:01.390> the<00:05:01.900> idea<00:05:02.169> here<00:05:02.410> is<00:05:02.440> if<00:05:02.530> you<00:05:02.650> had<00:05:02.740> a

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
exactly the idea here is if you had a

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.670 
exactly the idea here is if you had a
white<00:05:03.010> sheet<00:05:03.310> of<00:05:03.430> metal<00:05:03.550> it<00:05:04.270> would<00:05:04.480> stay<00:05:04.720> flat

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
white sheet of metal it would stay flat

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.890 
white sheet of metal it would stay flat
oh<00:05:05.919> okay<00:05:06.640> and<00:05:06.820> they'd<00:05:07.090> make<00:05:07.300> them<00:05:07.510> where

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
oh okay and they'd make them where

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.750 
oh okay and they'd make them where
they're<00:05:07.990> tapered<00:05:08.470> like<00:05:08.620> this<00:05:08.919> which<00:05:09.460> worked

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
they're tapered like this which worked

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.760 
they're tapered like this which worked
great<00:05:09.850> yeah<00:05:10.450> but<00:05:11.080> when<00:05:11.200> you're<00:05:11.290> doing<00:05:11.410> things

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
great yeah but when you're doing things

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.130 
great yeah but when you're doing things
with<00:05:11.919> really<00:05:12.160> wide<00:05:12.370> metal<00:05:13.000> they<00:05:13.390> tend<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.690> have

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
with really wide metal they tend to have

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.510 
with really wide metal they tend to have
a<00:05:14.200> taper<00:05:14.470> in<00:05:14.680> this<00:05:14.800> so<00:05:14.919> it's<00:05:15.040> similar<00:05:15.190> to<00:05:15.370> a

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
a taper in this so it's similar to a

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.460 
a taper in this so it's similar to a
ring<00:05:15.760> mandrel<00:05:15.970> exactly<00:05:16.900> you<00:05:17.050> get<00:05:17.200> the<00:05:17.290> right

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
ring mandrel exactly you get the right

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.490 
ring mandrel exactly you get the right
size<00:05:17.710> mm-hmm<00:05:18.340> and<00:05:19.050> so<00:05:20.050> we<00:05:20.169> know<00:05:20.290> we're<00:05:20.380> gonna

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
size mm-hmm and so we know we're gonna

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.680 
size mm-hmm and so we know we're gonna
go<00:05:20.710> about<00:05:21.220> two<00:05:21.490> here<00:05:21.730> two<00:05:21.820> here<00:05:21.850> in<00:05:22.240> this<00:05:22.480> range

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
go about two here two here in this range

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.260 
go about two here two here in this range
okay<00:05:23.290> and<00:05:23.620> what<00:05:23.919> I<00:05:23.950> do<00:05:24.040> is<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.490> start<00:05:25.030> on<00:05:25.150> the

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
okay and what I do is I start on the

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.970 
okay and what I do is I start on the
ends<00:05:25.600> and<00:05:25.720> work<00:05:25.810> towards<00:05:26.169> the<00:05:26.260> middle<00:05:26.530> so<00:05:26.890> you

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
ends and work towards the middle so you

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.640 
ends and work towards the middle so you
can't<00:05:27.280> just<00:05:27.490> lay<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:27.730> on<00:05:27.850> there<00:05:28.030> you<00:05:28.650> can't

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
can't just lay it on there you can't

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.350 
can't just lay it on there you can't
actually<00:05:29.800> you<00:05:30.640> can<00:05:30.790> just<00:05:30.820> start<00:05:31.060> like<00:05:31.180> this

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
actually you can just start like this

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.470 
actually you can just start like this
all<00:05:31.630> right<00:05:32.700> but<00:05:33.700> when<00:05:33.820> you<00:05:33.880> get<00:05:33.970> to<00:05:34.030> these<00:05:34.240> ends

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
all right but when you get to these ends

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.570 
all right but when you get to these ends
right<00:05:34.630> here<00:05:34.690> it's<00:05:35.650> a<00:05:35.770> little<00:05:35.980> hard<00:05:36.160> to<00:05:36.430> do

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
right here it's a little hard to do

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.310 
right here it's a little hard to do
mm-hmm

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
mm-hmm

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.650 
mm-hmm
so<00:05:38.320> what<00:05:38.440> we<00:05:38.530> do<00:05:38.710> is<00:05:39.090> we'll<00:05:40.090> come<00:05:40.120> over<00:05:40.330> and<00:05:40.510> lay

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
so what we do is we'll come over and lay

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.760 
so what we do is we'll come over and lay
the<00:05:40.810> ends<00:05:41.050> right<00:05:41.169> here<00:05:41.370> and<00:05:42.370> just

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.550 

tap<00:05:46.770> it<00:05:46.919> on<00:05:47.840> and<00:05:48.840> even<00:05:49.050> though<00:05:49.110> this<00:05:49.229> is<00:05:49.289> tin

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
tap it on and even though this is tin

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.399 
tap it on and even though this is tin
gauge<00:05:49.740> metal<00:05:49.979> which<00:05:50.160> is<00:05:50.190> pretty<00:05:50.520> thick<00:05:51.289> when<00:05:52.289> I

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409 
gauge metal which is pretty thick when I

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.050 
gauge metal which is pretty thick when I
haven't<00:05:52.860> really<00:05:53.039> work<00:05:53.220> hard<00:05:53.460> in<00:05:53.639> the<00:05:53.789> metal

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
haven't really work hard in the metal

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.420 
haven't really work hard in the metal
much<00:05:54.470> and<00:05:55.470> so<00:05:55.590> it's<00:05:55.710> actually<00:05:55.979> pretty<00:05:56.129> easy<00:05:56.220> to

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
much and so it's actually pretty easy to

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.920 
much and so it's actually pretty easy to
move<00:05:56.639> mm-hmm

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
move mm-hmm

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.290 
move mm-hmm
the<00:05:58.620> more<00:05:58.800> of<00:05:58.919> you<00:05:58.979> hammers<00:05:59.370> though<00:05:59.610> the<00:06:00.120> more

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
the more of you hammers though the more

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.980 
the more of you hammers though the more
it's<00:06:00.449> gonna<00:06:00.509> get<00:06:00.720> work<00:06:01.409> hardened<00:06:01.770> and<00:06:02.430> stiff

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
it's gonna get work hardened and stiff

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.140 
it's gonna get work hardened and stiff
and<00:06:03.990> as<00:06:04.680> your<00:06:04.830> hammer<00:06:05.009> you<00:06:05.250> can<00:06:05.280> always<00:06:05.729> make

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
and as your hammer you can always make

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.320 
and as your hammer you can always make
corrections<00:06:06.750> with<00:06:07.199> your<00:06:07.349> fingers<00:06:08.120> at<00:06:09.120> this

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
corrections with your fingers at this

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.129 
corrections with your fingers at this
point<00:06:10.310> and<00:06:11.310> I<00:06:11.669> think<00:06:11.729> I<00:06:12.120> didn't<00:06:12.780> understand

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
point and I think I didn't understand

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.570 
point and I think I didn't understand
when<00:06:13.289> I<00:06:13.319> first<00:06:13.590> heard<00:06:13.710> about<00:06:13.860> work<00:06:14.129> hardening

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
when I first heard about work hardening

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.159 
when I first heard about work hardening
that<00:06:14.789> is<00:06:15.120> actually<00:06:15.599> happening<00:06:15.960> at<00:06:16.110> a

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
that is actually happening at a

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.879 
that is actually happening at a
molecular<00:06:16.409> level<00:06:16.710> it<00:06:17.550> is<00:06:17.729> pushing<00:06:18.120> the<00:06:18.599> metal

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
molecular level it is pushing the metal

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.439 
molecular level it is pushing the metal
molecules<00:06:19.889> closer<00:06:20.159> together<00:06:20.400> so<00:06:20.849> it's<00:06:21.030> making

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
molecules closer together so it's making

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.390 
molecules closer together so it's making
it<00:06:21.659> more<00:06:21.690> stable<00:06:22.229> as<00:06:22.560> you<00:06:22.590> work<00:06:22.889> hard<00:06:23.159> a<00:06:23.190> lot<00:06:23.370> of

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
it more stable as you work hard a lot of

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.800 
it more stable as you work hard a lot of
people<00:06:23.639> don't<00:06:23.759> realize<00:06:24.090> is<00:06:24.240> that<00:06:24.270> metal<00:06:24.509> has<00:06:24.780> a

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
people don't realize is that metal has a

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.070 
people don't realize is that metal has a
grain<00:06:25.169> structure<00:06:25.800> kind<00:06:26.310> of<00:06:26.430> like<00:06:26.520> wood<00:06:26.729> grain

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
grain structure kind of like wood grain

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.020 
grain structure kind of like wood grain
um<00:06:28.250> and<00:06:29.250> so<00:06:29.430> what<00:06:29.610> you're<00:06:29.729> doing<00:06:29.940> you're

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
um and so what you're doing you're

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.719 
um and so what you're doing you're
compressing<00:06:30.330> all<00:06:30.630> those<00:06:30.780> grains<00:06:31.080> together

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
compressing all those grains together

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:35.420 
compressing all those grains together
making<00:06:32.729> the<00:06:33.000> metal<00:06:33.150> harder<00:06:33.590> and<00:06:34.590> the<00:06:35.250> nice

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
making the metal harder and the nice

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.129 
making the metal harder and the nice
thing<00:06:35.460> about<00:06:35.699> this<00:06:36.060> kind<00:06:36.419> of<00:06:36.479> bracelet<00:06:36.930> is

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
thing about this kind of bracelet is

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:39.980 
thing about this kind of bracelet is
that<00:06:37.830> over<00:06:38.069> time<00:06:38.340> you<00:06:39.330> know<00:06:39.360> people<00:06:39.780> what<00:06:39.870> they

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
that over time you know people what they

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.600 
that over time you know people what they
do<00:06:40.050> is<00:06:40.199> they<00:06:40.380> the<00:06:40.680> open<00:06:40.979> and<00:06:41.099> close<00:06:41.250> open<00:06:41.460> close

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
do is they the open and close open close

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.820 
do is they the open and close open close
close<00:06:42.270> you<00:06:42.419> get<00:06:42.569> them<00:06:42.659> on<00:06:42.780> right<00:06:43.319> they'll<00:06:43.650> put

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
close you get them on right they'll put

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.129 
close you get them on right they'll put
them<00:06:43.949> on<00:06:44.069> and<00:06:44.430> do<00:06:45.180> that<00:06:45.330> right<00:06:45.569> mm-hmm

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 
them on and do that right mm-hmm

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.339 
them on and do that right mm-hmm
this<00:06:46.319> will<00:06:46.469> handle<00:06:46.800> that<00:06:46.949> really<00:06:47.639> okay<00:06:48.349> I'm

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:49.349 
this will handle that really okay I'm

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:50.870 
this will handle that really okay I'm
always<00:06:49.560> concerned<00:06:50.009> about<00:06:50.099> eventually

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 
always concerned about eventually

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.059 
always concerned about eventually
breaking<00:06:51.090> that<00:06:51.389> it<00:06:52.139> will<00:06:52.349> eventually<00:06:52.919> happen

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:53.069 
breaking that it will eventually happen

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.700 
breaking that it will eventually happen
but<00:06:53.819> this<00:06:54.210> last<00:06:54.599> longer<00:06:54.840> this<00:06:55.110> in<00:06:55.289> the<00:06:55.349> last<00:06:55.560> a

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
but this last longer this in the last a

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.860 
but this last longer this in the last a
long<00:06:55.860> time<00:06:55.889> and<00:06:56.819> the<00:06:57.150> rest<00:06:57.330> is<00:06:57.479> really<00:06:57.509> just

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
long time and the rest is really just

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.089 
long time and the rest is really just
kind<00:06:57.990> of<00:06:58.110> done<00:06:58.259> by<00:06:58.349> hand

00:06:59.089 --> 00:06:59.099 
kind of done by hand

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:01.370 
kind of done by hand
um<00:06:59.190> just<00:06:59.819> forming<00:07:00.180> it<00:07:00.300> somewhere<00:07:00.659> yeah<00:07:01.139> until

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
um just forming it somewhere yeah until

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.320 
um just forming it somewhere yeah until
you<00:07:01.560> get<00:07:01.710> it<00:07:01.800> just<00:07:01.889> the<00:07:02.009> way<00:07:02.159> you<00:07:02.219> like<00:07:02.400> it<00:07:02.430> and

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.469 

work<00:07:06.330> on<00:07:06.509> the<00:07:06.630> sides<00:07:06.900> here<00:07:07.349> and<00:07:08.300> you<00:07:09.300> can

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 
work on the sides here and you can

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:13.809 
work on the sides here and you can
actually<00:07:09.630> take<00:07:10.560> this<00:07:10.770> and<00:07:11.930> turn<00:07:12.930> it<00:07:12.960> over<00:07:13.169> like

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:13.819 
actually take this and turn it over like

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:17.269 
actually take this and turn it over like
that<00:07:14.819> oh<00:07:15.380> and<00:07:16.380> then<00:07:16.500> you<00:07:16.590> can<00:07:16.740> really<00:07:16.919> get<00:07:17.159> that

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:17.279 
that oh and then you can really get that

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:20.480 
that oh and then you can really get that
oval<00:07:17.639> bent<00:07:17.819> exactly<00:07:19.009> I'm<00:07:20.009> just<00:07:20.190> using<00:07:20.340> a

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490
