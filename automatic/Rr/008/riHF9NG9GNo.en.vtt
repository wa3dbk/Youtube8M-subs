00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.760 
iron and voila you now have a angle iron
that<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> fixed<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:53.670> take<00:00:53.910> another<00:00:56.329> couple<00:00:57.329> of

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
that is fixed you take another couple of

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.330 
that is fixed you take another couple of
rare<00:00:58.770> earth<00:00:58.920> magnets<00:00:59.460> place<00:00:59.760> one<00:01:00.030> there<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
rare earth magnets place one there and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.810 
rare earth magnets place one there and
there<00:01:02.870> you<00:01:03.870> take<00:01:04.110> your<00:01:04.350> digital<00:01:04.820> calipers

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
there you take your digital calipers

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.820 
there you take your digital calipers
place<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.960> there<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:09.000> take<00:01:09.180> another<00:01:10.280> magnet

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
place it there you take another magnet

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.740 
place it there you take another magnet
and<00:01:13.830> we're<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.939> place<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.390> magnet

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
and we're going to place the magnet

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.820 
and we're going to place the magnet
right<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.759> maybe<00:01:17.759> down<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> little<00:01:18.090> bit<00:01:18.830> move

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
right there maybe down a little bit move

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.950 
right there maybe down a little bit move
this<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.220> little<00:01:20.310> bit<00:01:20.460> whatever<00:01:20.850> okay<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
this up a little bit whatever okay and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.590 
this up a little bit whatever okay and
then<00:01:22.710> simply<00:01:23.159> that's<00:01:24.150> it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
then simply that's it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.740 
then simply that's it
done<00:01:25.530> now<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.460> move<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:29.329> your<00:01:30.329> cross

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
done now you can move here your cross

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.679 
done now you can move here your cross
feed<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:32.780> turn<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:35.000> caliper<00:01:36.000> zero<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
feed and turn on your caliper zero it

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.130 
feed and turn on your caliper zero it
out

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
out

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.100 
out
and<00:01:38.210> there<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.799> very<00:01:40.799> simple<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
and there you have it very simple and

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.990 
and there you have it very simple and
very<00:01:43.110> accurate<00:01:45.770> much<00:01:46.770> better<00:01:47.040> than<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
very accurate much better than the the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.929 
very accurate much better than the the
dials<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.689> here<00:01:49.049> there's<00:01:49.350> no<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.860> doesn't<00:01:50.430> have

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
dials on here there's no it doesn't have

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.520 
dials on here there's no it doesn't have
to<00:01:51.090> worry<00:01:51.299> about<00:01:52.549> run<00:01:53.549> out<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:54.619> on<00:01:55.619> your

feed as well same thing you just take
your<00:02:07.950> your<00:02:08.670> calipers<00:02:09.950> we're<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> add

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
your your calipers we're going to add

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.490 
your your calipers we're going to add
a<00:02:13.500> rare-earth<00:02:14.500> magnet<00:02:15.069> here<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.930> don't<00:02:17.110> eat<00:02:17.319> we

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
a rare-earth magnet here we don't eat we

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.229 
a rare-earth magnet here we don't eat we
don't<00:02:17.620> even<00:02:17.830> need<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.190> angle<00:02:18.700> iron<00:02:18.849> for<00:02:19.090> this

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
don't even need the angle iron for this

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.290 
don't even need the angle iron for this
one<00:02:19.450> because<00:02:19.870> there<00:02:20.470> just<00:02:20.500> happens<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.040> be<00:02:21.220> a

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
one because there just happens to be a

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.460 
one because there just happens to be a
nice<00:02:22.300> setting<00:02:22.690> right<00:02:22.870> there<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:24.640> there

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
nice setting right there that there

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.960 
nice setting right there that there
there<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.590> go<00:02:26.709> three<00:02:27.040> rare<00:02:27.250> earth<00:02:27.400> magnets

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970

there you go three rare earth magnets
place<00:02:28.840> this<00:02:29.110> there<00:02:30.330> okay<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:32.769> over<00:02:33.069> there

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
place this there okay that over there

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.880 
place this there okay that over there
and<00:02:34.230> there<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.410> have<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.739> very<00:02:36.540> simple<00:02:37.890> turn

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890

it on zero it out and we have now have

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.250 
it on zero it out and we have now have
digital<00:02:44.890> readout<00:02:45.250> on<00:02:45.959> whichever<00:02:46.959> way<00:02:47.200> you

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
digital readout on whichever way you

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.470 
digital readout on whichever way you
want<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.560> work<00:02:47.739> if<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.370> have<00:02:48.700> two<00:02:48.940> calipers

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
want to work if you have two calipers

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.640 
want to work if you have two calipers
you<00:02:49.630> can<00:02:49.750> put<00:02:49.930> them<00:02:50.019> both<00:02:50.140> on<00:02:50.200> at<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.530> same

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650
