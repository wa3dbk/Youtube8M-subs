00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.830
 do not 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.010
 hello such friends welcome to a 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.590
 new video from my channel today 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.699
 let's see everything that is a 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.790
 introduction to double notes in the 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:50.300
 harmonica play two cells at the same 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:54.350
 time that is a way of giving you the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.050
 reinforcement to the sound and that is also 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.370
 very used especially in the style of 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:05.330
 blues to create tensions create 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:11.240
 tensions using the double notes 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:16.159
 most used are the 3 and 4 aspirated and 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:20.270
 the 4 and 5 sucked 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.310
 another very used double note is 1 and 2 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.570
 aspirate 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.149
 usually also to use as 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.570
 accompaniment if for example 1 and 2 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.570
 aspirate 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.909
 could you go do 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:43.090
 a base behind a band or not 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.689
 playing a melody in been a single fate 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.689
 accompanying 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.960
 Y 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.090
 for example in the germ issue of 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.770
 sonny boy williamson that is with another 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.610
 tuning of the harmonica I'm using 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.550
 harmonica in the lyrics but for them to see 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.980
 that in the rif can also be used 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.980
 there's double note like saying 1 and 2 sucked 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.820
 comes 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.820
 my life 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.950
 good and suddenly also to do 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.430
 the famous train imitations is a 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.430
 of the many 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.040
 or 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.110
 just touching in cells 1 and 2 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.170
 sucking and blowing and at times doing 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.100
 the articulation with you are when about the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.100
 one and two at the same time 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.340
 but well then I'm going to make a video 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.980
 more explanatory about what trains are in 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.390
 the harmonica following what is the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:17.439
 then use of the double notes is something 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.670
 very used in addition to the octave notes 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:24.549
 and it's also playing individual cells 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.319
 because they generate intervals for example 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.650
 dissonant 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:34.709
 very necessary sometimes for the blues 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.709
 like for example the 3 and 4 aspirated 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.010
 and the 4 and 5 sucked 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.140
 what in English is called double tops 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.020
 or what are the double notes also 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.260
 they are really very good using 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.030
 bending before making the double note a 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.150
 fast passage bending that would be 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.610
 touched as a brief appoggiatura can be 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.870
 employ for example in cell 3 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:13.350
 make a bending halftone and then 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.850
 make the double note 3 and 4 sucked if 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.310
 we are playing with lip lock 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.280
 for example we do we are in the cell 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.830
 3 to do bendine network quickly 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.380
 we open to do the 3 and 4 aspirated 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.850
 and there we have a very good sound for the 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.820
 blues 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.910
 between 104 and doing the support in 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.480
 brief in vending in 3 before 3 and 4 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.480
 I aspired 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.060
 we can also do the same but 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.330
 moved to the cell of 4 doing 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.240
 bending as a support in the first 4 and 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.840
 then the 4 and 5 aspirated double note 4 and 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.840
 5 aspirated 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.760
 and now before with vending 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:16.620
 good and we can do 34 sucked with the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:20.099
 first vending after 4 and 5 also 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.129
 double note blown and finish in 4 and 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:25.580
 5 vacuumed with brief support in the 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.580
 vending 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.150
 and the back 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.680
 no no 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.800
 well another thing that will also be seen 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.639
 more in detail later on is the use 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.259
 also of the diaphragm tremolo 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.800
 during the execution of the note's 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:59.819
 double that also adds a sound 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.819
 deeper more expressive than what 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.410
 what they can do is practicing 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:07.680
 just in the double notes and the 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:10.300
 aspire to be like the imitation of each 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.789
 finger of a dog 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.979
 aspiring quickly using the 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:17.310
 diaphragm and they are going to generate this 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.310
 sound 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.910
 they saw how it's not the same 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:33.560
 tremulous cinema 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.560
 that with the tremulous diaphragm 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.850
 could also apply the same of the 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.289
 things last bending but in the case of 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.919
 1 and do 1 and 2 sucked that is not so 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.430
 used but it can be done 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.430
 perfectly 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:08.210
 well they saw then as with the notes 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:12.290
 Doubles can really be made 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:15.770
 pretty expressive sounds and that 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.390
 they really have a lot more application 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:22.820
 that nothing that is for example in style 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:26.540
 light and good this color and it would be all in 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:29.930
 about this little introduction of the 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:33.200
 use of double notes this more 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:36.470
 employees and I invite you to my next 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:39.830
 video where I'm going to show you how 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:44.810
 touch the whole subject of the australes in 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:46.730
 they are from the souls so do not stop 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:50.080
 subscribe to my channel and we're 

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.080
