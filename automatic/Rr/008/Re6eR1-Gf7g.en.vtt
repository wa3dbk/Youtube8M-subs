00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.049
 stretcher all the boys are the ganz ed 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.720
 here I am koji with this new video 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.919
 this of super co2 today as from 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.990
 up up on a map is a little bit 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.169
 we are a little bit bitch even if it is 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.759
 very beautiful girl caused me many 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.450
 problems in fact as you can see from the title 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:36.240
 al nuclear smr even if you can 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.550
 see I'm holding an oar in my hand 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.320
 and yes because I considered this map 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.770
 as one of the best to have for 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.330
 nuclear sweating that I have already sharpened 4 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.490
 all nuclear 23 23 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.730
 with this pump shotgun that own 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.420
 I can't get nuclear and so I have 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.520
 stopped 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.120
 if I can't do it anymore, that is, get to 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.309
 24 and die and also in this map in 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.890
 this game will happen which also gives gods 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.499
 ways i broke my balls here now 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.039
 and therefore I will call it will be called then 

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:20.579
 i will use this smr guys that really 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:21.750
 a bomb that is true that many like 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.950
 we can say the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.190
 they prefer it rather they consider it 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.070
 without the fire sector they were all 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.200
 twisted guys that because it's stronger if 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.130
 like the absence of said photos only 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.110
 which I have most of the time I find myself 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.450
 especially of this map I find myself at 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.160
 make some close encounters with 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.130
 sometimes even just face to face 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.729
 so stay and click continuously 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.320
 the button for those who re 1 mi 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.030
 it seems really inconvenient also because 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.040
 as you know if you follow me from even come on 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.770
 videos of mv I've never been 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.149
 one that uses those weapons not 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.380
 automatic so this is true 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.310
 I liked this area 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.830
 particularly but always forced to 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.450
 fire i'm trying to use in these 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.550
 days even if this depre is precisely 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.390
 very old i am trying to use in 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.840
 these days the fall dsv with viewfinder 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.120
 reflex and adjustable stock without 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.330
 sectors of fire then and I must say that 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.560
 I liked it a lot even though it's always there 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.530
 the same problem of the clashes 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.480
 close together that I just can't 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.510
 keep on clicking 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.600
 I prefer to say have hold 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.940
 and make the weapon do everything and even 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.280
 if I 'll bring a gameplay another 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.000
 nuclear made that of sv with the money sv 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.340
 always with the fire sector for a 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.110
 boy are we here with this this 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.700
 core I can tell you the house if you 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.980
 he was interested in a smr just with sector 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.660
 of fire and adjustable kick I had 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.690
 tried also with the silencer but I have to 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.550
 say that if you go for nuclear 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.810
 it is better not to have no tore too 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.760
 because anyway your companions of 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.200
 team also go for nuclear 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.180
 therefore they also call them i 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.110
 web counterattack so it wasn't there 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.290
 really need I used anti-splinters 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.560
 he does not recognize that he is inflexible either 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.000
 inflexible splinter then used 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.640
 obviously jackal without steel 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.240
 because steel if not use for 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.950
 very much and then dexterity guys I have to 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.820
 say that in this map maybe I would 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.200
 had to use to bring dexterity too 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.990
 what's called tactical mask but from the 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.060
 point as these enemies as you can 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.500
 see, however, they were not very good 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.030
 indeed to be honest 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.590
 they were scarce enough, maybe not 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.290
 they were not even at the level there were two 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.060
 type 20 level so maybe not not 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.500
 he didn't even have electric shocks but 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.060
 in fact there was no reason to use 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.170
 tactical mask here we say that this 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.240
 I had already played in this lobby 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.080
 enough though for that first tried 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.750
 the nuclear of funds is the pump and they are 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.190
 died at 23 so I said oh well there 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.239
 I try again that we go out a little, I have 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.989
 angry 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.270
 this smr and what to say the boys one 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.310
 mom who really recommend you 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.530
 use even now even after the 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.299
 it also patches this weapon 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.160
 nuclear was made after precisely that 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.710
 will assign the fool to have been weakened 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.390
 from the point of view of the fire sector 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.560
 but I continue to really aa 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.830
 advise her I have to tell you guys 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.690
 that is if in the end if a player is there 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.660
 knows how to play as terminated weapons not 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.180
 he doesn't care about the recoil there is 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.770
 they have increased nothing after two 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.710
 days you try to use 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.730
 really know how to use this weapon in 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:53.300
 so the smc n smc how many of you 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.710
 they said the first two days later 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.180
 which were help there was 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.669
 peace ok 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.380
 then never again is the smmm c 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.919
 you are using again like me 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.590
 guys because the former pm smc now if there 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:11.210
 do the hand you know also uses that one 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.620
 even if the recoil was increased then 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.720
 oh well i use it even without it 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.820
 handle I do n't know about you though if you don't have 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.410
 it remains however a very strong weapon and it is 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.449
 the same thing that for this fall 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.970
 for this because even if they have 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.070
 increased recoil when you have 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.199
 fire sector that I have to admit a 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.610
 really exaggerated recoil because I the 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.490
 first gameplay I've tried given 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.860
 that one of you my to comments in a 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.250
 last video had pointed out to me 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.599
 this is what this patch is 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.650
 was regarding these guns 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.919
 assault 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.620
 so I tried it, given that 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:48.410
 this nuclear and yes what the uterine lady 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.160
 this these two rifles were 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.979
 kissed by all view of the nightmare though 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:57.380
 what to tell me 2 2 3 games you try and 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:59.289
 however we continue to know how to use it if 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.849
 in fact you make you insignia circles of 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.830
 just improve with this weapon then 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.419
 guys or in the board there too 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.210
 the full maybe the goblin increased a 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.530
 little more the recoil I don't know 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.500
 let's say I found it more difficult 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.440
 with that and maybe yes give on the fall vi 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.729
 I would recommend a handle but then 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.740
 maybe you should remove lime 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:22.039
 adjustable because then i don't know if i am 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.990
 it is advisable to use 3 accessories on a weapon e 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:26.240
 maybe take away a because it is always more 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.949
 important here anyway guys do 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.889
 let me know if you know how to use 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:32.840
 this weapon if you find yourself well if you have 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.520
 tried to use the fire sector 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.680
 I didn't try the double core that 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.240
 then he will not come and net guys I hope to 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.310
 you enjoyed this video if so 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.050
 maybe left I like it and it's like 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.169
 we always see beautiful videos appear 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.169
 girls
