00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.920 
don't know it's my personal opinion but
yes<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.909> class<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.869> up<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.250> 25<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.700> got<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> kap-40

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.800 
yes so class it up I 25 I got the kap-40
secondary<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:23.210> recommend<00:01:24.210> running<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.450> kap-40

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
secondary I recommend running the kap-40

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.390 
secondary I recommend running the kap-40
man<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.110> really<00:01:25.290> think<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> kap-40<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.220> better

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
man I really think the kap-40 is better

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.440 
man I really think the kap-40 is better
than<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> b23r<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.780> that's<00:01:28.680> because<00:01:28.829> um<00:01:29.460> it's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
than the b23r and that's because um it's

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.969 
than the b23r and that's because um it's
more<00:01:30.570> consistent<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.590> always<00:01:31.740> known

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
more consistent like you always known

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.460 
more consistent like you always known
you<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> since<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.729> fully<00:01:32.909> auto<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:34.229> it's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
you I since it's fully auto you it's

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.620 
you I since it's fully auto you it's

swarm man just it just goes in it's just
the<00:03:14.220> best<00:03:14.370> killstreak<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.910> can<00:03:15.060> run<00:03:15.270> if<00:03:15.390> you

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
the best killstreak you can run if you
