foundation<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.549> I<00:02:11.060> do<00:02:11.480> think<00:02:12.019> it<00:02:12.140> does<00:02:12.349> cover

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.580 
foundation and I do think it does cover
really<00:02:13.340> well<00:02:13.519> but<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.810> point<00:02:15.080> where<00:02:15.349> if<00:02:15.470> I

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
really well but to the point where if I

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.309 
really well but to the point where if I
do<00:02:15.650> have<00:02:16.129> look<00:02:16.640> some<00:02:17.000> acne<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.750> will<00:02:17.959> use

additional<00:02:19.160> concealer<00:02:19.670> on<00:02:19.819> top<00:02:19.849> which<00:02:20.239> I'll

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
additional concealer on top which I'll

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.610

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
but to go with that finally got a real

on<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.049> because<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.349> is<00:02:30.470> pretty<00:02:30.709> expensive<00:02:30.860> for

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
on it because it is pretty expensive for

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.930 
on it because it is pretty expensive for
a<00:02:31.780> sponge<00:02:32.780> but<00:02:33.230> it's<00:02:33.379> so<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.400> good<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.819> it

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
a sponge but it's so so good and it

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.610 
a sponge but it's so so good and it

but this one does so I only use it on my

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.150 
but this one does so I only use it on my
blemishes<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.569> like<00:03:05.750> cover<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.200> redness<00:03:06.410> and

it<00:03:07.519> works<00:03:07.669> really<00:03:08.060> well<00:03:08.180> but<00:03:08.930> just<00:03:09.200> not<00:03:09.349> for

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
it works really well but just not for

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.629 
it works really well but just not for
under<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.799> eye<00:03:09.889> so<00:03:10.130> it's<00:03:10.250> kind<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.459> annoying

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
under the eye so it's kind of annoying
