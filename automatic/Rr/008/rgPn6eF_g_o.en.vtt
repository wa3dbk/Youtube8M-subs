00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.980 
said for me for the most part I think
the<00:00:17.099> whole<00:00:17.279> thing<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.699> misunderstood<00:00:18.570> you

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
the whole thing is misunderstood you

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.830 
the whole thing is misunderstood you
know<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.820> try<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.850> understand<00:00:21.480> where<00:00:21.689> he's

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
know I try to understand where he's

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.970 
know I try to understand where he's
coming<00:00:21.869> from<00:00:22.260> which<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> little<00:00:23.160> hard<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.520> do

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
coming from which is a little hard to do

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.320 
coming from which is a little hard to do
but<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.550> those<00:00:26.730> things<00:00:26.970> where

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
but it's just one of those things where

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.230 
but it's just one of those things where
I<00:00:27.570> guess<00:00:27.779> he<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.019> who<00:00:28.320> he<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.789> you<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:29.970> now

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
I guess he is who he is and you know now

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.519 
I guess he is who he is and you know now
he's<00:00:30.300> one<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.689> those<00:00:30.840> people<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.380> don't

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
he's one of those people that I don't

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.979 
he's one of those people that I don't
think<00:00:31.740> likes<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.910> word<00:00:33.059> know<00:00:33.360> said<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.719> him
