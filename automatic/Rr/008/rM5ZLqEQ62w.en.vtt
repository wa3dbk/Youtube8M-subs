00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
how you do plating some Minecraft and

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.980 
how you do plating some Minecraft and
you<00:01:02.820> build<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.379> nether<00:01:04.379> mod<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:05.729> sorry<00:01:06.150> another

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
you build a nether mod or sorry another

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.820 
you build a nether mod or sorry another
portal<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.010> ground<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> mean<00:01:09.830> you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
portal in the ground see what I mean you

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.910 
portal in the ground see what I mean you
build<00:01:11.040> one<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.549> there<00:01:12.229> okay<00:01:13.260> into<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> ground

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
build one in there okay into the ground

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.210 
build one in there okay into the ground
and<00:01:14.299> then<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.570> think<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.170> eight<00:01:16.380> blocks<00:01:16.650> one

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and then I think it's eight blocks one

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.140 
and then I think it's eight blocks one
two<00:01:17.729> three<00:01:18.330> four<00:01:18.780> five<00:01:19.229> six<00:01:19.830> seven<00:01:20.430> eight<00:01:20.850> nine

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
two three four five six seven eight nine

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.010 
two three four five six seven eight nine
blocks<00:01:21.810> away<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.790> then<00:01:23.790> four<00:01:24.330> across<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
blocks away and then four across and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.679 
blocks away and then four across and
then<00:01:25.320> meet<00:01:25.560> back<00:01:25.799> with<00:01:25.979> their<00:01:26.159> nether<00:01:26.689> portal

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
then meet back with their nether portal

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.620 
then meet back with their nether portal
and<00:01:28.470> then<00:01:28.740> put<00:01:28.920> two<00:01:29.579> sources<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.030> water<00:01:30.299> at<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and then put two sources of water at the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.710 
and then put two sources of water at the
top<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:32.130> crafting<00:01:32.640> bench<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.210> 4th
