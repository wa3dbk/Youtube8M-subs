especially<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.820> one<00:01:23.970> gigabyte<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.420> RAM<00:01:24.540> you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
especially with one gigabyte of RAM you

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.300 
especially with one gigabyte of RAM you
put<00:01:25.020> Windows<00:01:25.320> Vista<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.799> machine<00:01:26.159> with

put Windows Vista on this machine with
only<00:01:26.460> 1<00:01:26.640> gigabyte<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.000> RAM<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.930> would<00:01:28.110> slow

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
only 1 gigabyte of RAM it would slow

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.499 
only 1 gigabyte of RAM it would slow
down<00:01:28.500> considerably<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.909> that's<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.210> bonus

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
down considerably so that that's a bonus

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.840 
down considerably so that that's a bonus
and<00:01:30.900> also<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.259> had<00:01:31.350> gigabyte<00:01:31.850> Gigabit

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and also we had gigabyte Gigabit

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.340 
and also we had gigabyte Gigabit
Ethernet<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:33.840> nice<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.170> you're<00:01:34.259> gonna

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
Ethernet and that's nice if you're gonna

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.569 
Ethernet and that's nice if you're gonna
be<00:01:34.500> networking<00:01:34.829> these<00:01:35.040> together<00:01:35.189> you'll<00:01:35.490> be

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
be networking these together you'll be

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.630 
be networking these together you'll be
able<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.759> share<00:01:35.970> files<00:01:36.240> at<00:01:37.110> maximum<00:01:37.710> speed<00:01:37.829> so

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
able to share files at maximum speed so

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.039 
able to share files at maximum speed so
that's<00:01:38.790> nice<00:01:39.060> as<00:01:39.299> well<00:01:39.450> actually<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.960> about

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that's nice as well actually it's about

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.639 
that's nice as well actually it's about
twice<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.380> speed<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.890> USB<00:01:41.369> 2.0<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.649> Gigabit

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
twice the speed of a USB 2.0 so Gigabit

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.310 
twice the speed of a USB 2.0 so Gigabit
Ethernet<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.610> lot<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.149> speed<00:01:45.360> now<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.200> case

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
Ethernet it's a lot of speed now in case

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.780 
Ethernet it's a lot of speed now in case

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
here alright starting up at the top here

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.889 
here alright starting up at the top here
you're<00:02:02.040> gonna<00:02:02.159> notice<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.549> we<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.850> DVI<00:02:03.360> not

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
you're gonna notice that we have DVI not

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.330 
you're gonna notice that we have DVI not
VGA<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.469> make<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> note<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:04.979> that

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
VGA so make a note of that

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.510 
VGA so make a note of that
it's<00:02:06.030> DVI<00:02:06.420> only<00:02:06.869> right<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:08.009> have<00:02:08.129> s-video

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
it's DVI only right here we have s-video

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.369 
it's DVI only right here we have s-video
so<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.060> hook<00:02:09.119> up<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.450> monitor<00:02:09.840> or<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.020> TV

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
so you can hook up to a monitor or a TV

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.140 
so you can hook up to a monitor or a TV
or<00:02:10.739> even<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.069> projector<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.760> wanted<00:02:11.940> to

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
or even a projector if you wanted to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.170 
or even a projector if you wanted to
that<00:02:12.329> we<00:02:13.170> have<00:02:13.290> six<00:02:13.650> USB<00:02:14.340> 2.0<00:02:14.760> ports<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
that we have six USB 2.0 ports and

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.149 
that we have six USB 2.0 ports and
there's<00:02:15.299> the<00:02:15.450> Gigabit<00:02:15.870> Ethernet<00:02:16.159> underneath

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
there's the Gigabit Ethernet underneath

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.309 
there's the Gigabit Ethernet underneath
this<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.549> is<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> onboard<00:02:18.269> VGA<00:02:18.689> that<00:02:19.170> has

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
this that is the onboard VGA that has

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.539 
this that is the onboard VGA that has
been<00:02:19.470> disabled<00:02:20.010> because<00:02:20.129> there<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.519> a

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
been disabled because there is a

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.520 
been disabled because there is a
graphics<00:02:21.000> card<00:02:21.030> that's<00:02:21.930> been<00:02:22.079> installed<00:02:22.409> it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
graphics card that's been installed it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.470 
graphics card that's been installed it
actually<00:02:22.739> has<00:02:22.829> a<00:02:22.860> Radeon<00:02:23.310> X<00:02:23.519> 13<00:02:24.090> hundred<00:02:24.239> so

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
actually has a Radeon X 13 hundred so

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.750 
actually has a Radeon X 13 hundred so
that's<00:02:24.659> nice<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> dedicated<00:02:25.319> video<00:02:25.560> card<00:02:25.950> if

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
that's nice a dedicated video card if

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.479 
that's nice a dedicated video card if
you<00:02:26.939> do<00:02:27.209> need<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.540> VGA<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.709> can<00:02:28.980> go<00:02:29.159> into<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
you do need the VGA you can go into the

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.259 
you do need the VGA you can go into the
BIOS<00:02:29.870> disable<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:30.989> graphics<00:02:31.379> card<00:02:31.439> and<00:02:32.269> then

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
BIOS disable this graphics card and then

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.699 
BIOS disable this graphics card and then
just<00:02:33.420> remove<00:02:33.689> this<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.140> use<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.530> onboard

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
just remove this and use the onboard

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.460 
just remove this and use the onboard
video<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:36.420> either<00:02:36.629> way<00:02:36.840> if<00:02:37.049> you<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.319> VGA

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
video so either way if you have VGA

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.259 
video so either way if you have VGA
monitors<00:02:38.099> you<00:02:38.220> can<00:02:38.250> use<00:02:38.519> those<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.150> have

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
monitors you can use those but you have

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.640 
monitors you can use those but you have
to<00:02:39.359> go<00:02:39.450> into<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.659> BIOS<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.079> change<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.590> you

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
to go into the BIOS and change of you

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.679 
to go into the BIOS and change of you
things<00:02:40.859> moving<00:02:41.489> on<00:02:41.579> down<00:02:41.760> here<00:02:41.970> we<00:02:42.120> have<00:02:42.239> ps2

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
things moving on down here we have ps2

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
you're opening up ten windows at the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.789 
you're opening up ten windows at the
same<00:03:00.060> time<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.659> you<00:03:01.079> want<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.319> listen<00:03:01.439> to<00:03:01.650> your

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
same time and you want to listen to your

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.890 
same time and you want to listen to your
media<00:03:02.250> player<00:03:02.489> well<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.269> might<00:03:03.510> be<00:03:03.659> a<00:03:03.689> little

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
media player well it might be a little

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.229 
media player well it might be a little
faster<00:03:04.260> if<00:03:05.159> you<00:03:05.340> install<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.700> little<00:03:05.819> extra<00:03:06.120> RAM

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
faster if you install a little extra RAM

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.309 
faster if you install a little extra RAM
and<00:03:06.359> I'll<00:03:06.420> show<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.569> how<00:03:06.659> to<00:03:06.689> do<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.989> just

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
and I'll show you how to do that just

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.860 
and I'll show you how to do that just
take<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.590> off<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.709> base<00:03:07.889> here<00:03:08.720> comes<00:03:09.720> off

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
take it off the base here comes off

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.339 
take it off the base here comes off
easily<00:03:11.420> I'll<00:03:12.420> lay<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.569> down<00:03:12.689> and<00:03:12.959> then<00:03:13.019> remove

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
easily I'll lay it down and then remove

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.710 
easily I'll lay it down and then remove
the<00:03:13.470> top

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.070 

now<00:03:19.560> with<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.740> little<00:03:19.860> pressure<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.370> snaps<00:03:20.640> off

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
now with a little pressure it snaps off

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.320 
now with a little pressure it snaps off
move<00:03:22.080> that<00:03:22.230> aside<00:03:23.690> then<00:03:25.910> there<00:03:26.910> we<00:03:27.060> go<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
move that aside then there we go the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.600 
move that aside then there we go the
inside<00:03:27.630> all<00:03:27.840> neatly<00:03:28.380> laid<00:03:28.680> out<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.460> one

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
inside all neatly laid out and the one

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.650 
inside all neatly laid out and the one
thing<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:29.850> do<00:03:29.910> want<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.210> show<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.390> on<00:03:30.570> the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
thing I do want to show you on the

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.970 
thing I do want to show you on the
inside<00:03:30.930> we<00:03:31.080> have<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.200> hard<00:03:31.440> drive<00:03:31.530> our<00:03:31.710> optical

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
inside we have a hard drive our optical

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.570 
inside we have a hard drive our optical
drive<00:03:32.160> in<00:03:32.280> there

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
drive in there

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.130 
drive in there
there<00:03:32.910> is<00:03:33.000> an<00:03:33.120> empty<00:03:33.240> RAM<00:03:33.540> slot<00:03:33.810> right<00:03:33.990> there

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
there is an empty RAM slot right there

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.930 
there is an empty RAM slot right there
that's<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.380> white<00:03:34.590> slot<00:03:34.860> right<00:03:35.040> here<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.490> if

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
that's the white slot right here and if

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.160 
that's the white slot right here and if
you<00:03:36.030> wanted<00:03:36.270> to<00:03:36.330> install<00:03:36.630> some<00:03:36.810> additional

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
you wanted to install some additional

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.440 
you wanted to install some additional
memory<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.640> don't<00:03:38.910> have<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.180> remove

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
memory it you don't have to remove

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.850 
memory it you don't have to remove
anything<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:40.200> can<00:03:40.350> install<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.740> additional

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
anything you can install the additional

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.050 
anything you can install the additional
memory<00:03:41.190> here<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.520> we<00:03:41.580> actually<00:03:41.670> have<00:03:41.910> two

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
memory here and we actually have two

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.390 
memory here and we actually have two
additional<00:03:42.270> slots<00:03:42.690> one<00:03:42.900> there<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.400> one

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
additional slots one there and one

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.850 
additional slots one there and one
underneath<00:03:45.060> there<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:46.320> you<00:03:46.410> can<00:03:46.530> install

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
underneath there so you can install

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.100 
underneath there so you can install
another<00:03:47.820> two<00:03:47.970> gigabytes<00:03:48.330> of<00:03:48.420> RAM<00:03:48.570> if<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.930> like

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
another two gigabytes of RAM if you like

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.130 
another two gigabytes of RAM if you like
and<00:03:49.380> he<00:03:49.470> uses<00:03:49.590> gd-r<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.370> memory<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.330> that's<00:03:51.930> all

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
and he uses gd-r to memory so that's all

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.050 
and he uses gd-r to memory so that's all
you<00:03:52.290> need<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.530> know<00:03:52.620> about<00:03:52.710> the<00:03:52.920> inside<00:03:53.280> bed

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
you need to know about the inside bed

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.270 
you need to know about the inside bed
and<00:03:54.180> close<00:03:54.300> it<00:03:54.420> back<00:03:54.540> up<00:03:54.950> all<00:03:55.950> right<00:03:55.980> now<00:03:56.160> on

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
and close it back up all right now on

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.010 
and close it back up all right now on
the<00:03:56.370> front<00:03:56.580> of<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.730> unit<00:03:56.820> we<00:03:57.090> have<00:03:57.270> our<00:03:57.480> CD

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
the front of the unit we have our CD

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.900 
the front of the unit we have our CD
drive<00:03:58.290> there<00:03:58.560> beneath<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.580> we<00:03:59.730> have

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
drive there beneath that we have

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.150 
drive there beneath that we have
headphone<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.660> microphone<00:04:01.080> jack<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:02.010> if

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
headphone and microphone jack so if

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.280 
headphone and microphone jack so if
you're<00:04:02.310> using<00:04:02.490> a<00:04:02.670> headset<00:04:02.880> ideal<00:04:03.720> plug<00:04:04.110> it<00:04:04.200> up

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
you're using a headset ideal plug it up

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.470 
you're using a headset ideal plug it up
right<00:04:04.440> there<00:04:04.650> we<00:04:05.130> also<00:04:05.280> have<00:04:05.460> two<00:04:05.640> USB<00:04:06.060> 2.0

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
right there we also have two USB 2.0

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.240 
right there we also have two USB 2.0
ports<00:04:06.510> in<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:06.990> front<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.650> want<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.010> put<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.190> back

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
ports in the front I want to put it back

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.980 
ports in the front I want to put it back
on<00:04:08.400> its<00:04:08.580> dock<00:04:08.850> now<00:04:09.090> or<00:04:09.300> on<00:04:09.450> its<00:04:09.600> cradle<00:04:09.810> I

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
on its dock now or on its cradle I

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.300 
on its dock now or on its cradle I
suppose<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:10.800> it<00:04:10.890> can<00:04:11.010> stand<00:04:11.910> up<00:04:12.150> right<00:04:12.390> there

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
suppose so it can stand up right there

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.310 
suppose so it can stand up right there
there<00:04:14.310> we<00:04:14.460> go<00:04:14.660> see<00:04:15.660> how<00:04:15.750> simple<00:04:15.810> it<00:04:16.049> is<00:04:16.080> then

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
there we go see how simple it is then

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.750 
there we go see how simple it is then
you<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:16.620> screw<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.920> in<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.190> back<00:04:17.220> and

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
you just screw it in in the back and

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.110 
you just screw it in in the back and
you're<00:04:17.880> ready<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.120> go<00:04:18.209> like<00:04:18.420> I<00:04:18.540> said<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:19.500> HP<00:04:20.250> DC

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
you're ready to go like I said the HP DC

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.780 
you're ready to go like I said the HP DC
7700<00:04:22.109> is<00:04:22.530> an<00:04:22.650> excellent<00:04:23.100> way<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.340> go<00:04:23.490> for<00:04:23.700> your

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
7700 is an excellent way to go for your

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.520 
7700 is an excellent way to go for your
business<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.510> especially<00:04:25.050> since<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.440> has

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
business and especially since it has

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.590 
business and especially since it has
Windows<00:04:25.860> XP<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:26.790> showed<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.060> how<00:04:27.180> easy<00:04:27.419> it

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
Windows XP and I showed you how easy it

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.540 
Windows XP and I showed you how easy it
is<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.960> add<00:04:28.560> additional<00:04:28.710> memory<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:29.400> if<00:04:29.460> you

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
is to add additional memory so if you

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.280 
is to add additional memory so if you
wanted<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:29.850> pick<00:04:29.970> up<00:04:30.060> some<00:04:30.120> extra<00:04:30.360> RAM<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:31.169> can

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
wanted to pick up some extra RAM you can

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.020 
wanted to pick up some extra RAM you can
get<00:04:31.410> RAM<00:04:31.560> these<00:04:31.770> days<00:04:31.950> next<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.340> nothing<00:04:32.610> put

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
get RAM these days next to nothing put

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.520 
get RAM these days next to nothing put
an<00:04:33.090> extra<00:04:33.270> gigabyte<00:04:33.630> of<00:04:33.720> RAM<00:04:33.840> in<00:04:34.020> there<00:04:34.169> and

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
an extra gigabyte of RAM in there and
