time<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.909> don't<00:01:29.970> think<00:01:30.450> he<00:01:30.600> has<00:01:30.720> any<00:01:30.990> chance<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
time I don't think he has any chance to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.319 
time I don't think he has any chance to
drop<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> purple<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.759> he<00:01:32.880> drops<00:01:33.119> the

Tom's - as you can see that throws out

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.880 
Tom's - as you can see that throws out
two<00:01:35.579> projectiles<00:01:36.210> instead<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.720> four

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
two projectiles instead of four

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.130 
two projectiles instead of four
it's<00:01:38.220> pretty<00:01:38.549> good<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:39.540> as<00:01:39.689> good<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
it's pretty good not as good as the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.679 
it's pretty good not as good as the
times<00:01:40.350> four<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.280> will<00:01:41.400> work<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:42.180> also<00:01:42.360> has

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
times four but it will work it also has

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.560 
times four but it will work it also has
a<00:01:42.720> chance<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.140> regen<00:01:43.530> its<00:01:43.680> own<00:01:43.939> grenade<00:01:44.939> supply

ammo<00:01:45.990> which<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.409> pretty<00:01:46.619> cool<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.670> can

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
ammo which is pretty cool and you can

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.700 
ammo which is pretty cool and you can
see<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.479> compare<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> Tom's<00:01:49.380> for

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
