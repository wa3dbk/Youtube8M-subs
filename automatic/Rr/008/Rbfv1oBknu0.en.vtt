00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
about - it's a little over 7 feet so it

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.899 
about - it's a little over 7 feet so it
should<00:01:56.750> clear<00:01:57.020> my<00:01:57.369> tent<00:01:58.369> no<00:01:58.579> problem<00:01:59.470> so<00:02:00.909> we'll

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
should clear my tent no problem so we'll

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.639 
should clear my tent no problem so we'll
fire<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:02.210> up<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:02.540> get<00:02:02.720> all<00:02:02.840> these<00:02:02.990> oils<00:02:03.380> burn

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
fire it up and get all these oils burn

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.850

off<00:02:03.890> here<00:02:04.280> in<00:02:04.430> about<00:02:04.670> an<00:02:04.850> hour<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:05.750> how<00:02:06.470> video

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
off here in about an hour so how video

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.330 
off here in about an hour so how video
some<00:02:07.250> more<00:02:07.430> then<00:02:07.670> guys<00:02:09.070> give<00:02:10.070> another

some more then guys give another

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.220 
some more then guys give another
comparison<00:02:10.820> to<00:02:11.060> Ryan<00:02:11.360> how<00:02:11.600> old<00:02:11.810> will<00:02:11.930> fit<00:02:12.110> in

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
comparison to Ryan how old will fit in

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.949 
comparison to Ryan how old will fit in
my<00:02:12.260> sleds

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.960 

it's<00:02:16.439> only<00:02:16.620> about<00:02:16.860> two<00:02:17.250> inches<00:02:17.670> higher<00:02:17.939> than

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
it's only about two inches higher than

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.289 
it's only about two inches higher than
the<00:02:18.420> sled<00:02:18.689> so<00:02:19.110> I'll<00:02:20.099> have<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.400> good<00:02:20.670> low<00:02:20.879> center

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
the sled so I'll have a good low center
