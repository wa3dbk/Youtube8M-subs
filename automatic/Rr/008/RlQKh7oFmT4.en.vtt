00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.039
 I was working at the hospital durand 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.069
 little children who came were five to six years old 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.539
 that came with 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.269
 difficulties in school 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.240
 nor did they want to derive them school recovery moms had very 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:28.749
 distressed 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.890
 we try to make an experience 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.330
 that instead of moms waiting in the room outside 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.910
 assemble a group with the rules and work in simultaneous 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.580
 with the standards and in another room 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.010
 boys 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.400
 and that the boys 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.780
 will work with the educational psychologist 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.550
 I worked with the group of mothers 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.040
 this experience 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.390
 really very novel at that time p speaking 30 years ago 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.860
 we could implement it in a hospital with other groups 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.970
 this on the one hand 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.690
 added to that shortly after I was pregnant with him tell me if you are 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.100
 a twin pregnancy 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.420
 I thought where could I play that I could go talk to mother of twins for me 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.630
 it was a nigeria to be able to talk to someone who would have had that 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.610
 experience because 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.540
 I already had as a boy I knew how to create boy but I did not really know how 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.640
 I could be for 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.660
 get into the world 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.980
 of the melli did dd did not want cures that is born from the same commented 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.430
 there was no such possibility and that's when my profession let's say ceiling 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.870
 I graduated in education sciences I started thinking good 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.000
 know what a project 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.090
 a place my passion 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.660
 where to be able to meet with parents to accompany them in the upbringing 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.410
 tucker who fears that when dads say they have their first child 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.310
 I was in the same situation 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.000
 thinking in full 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 the twins putting together one experience and the other 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.229
 I said good to think 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:15.499
 where this situation can occur or that the popes come with the boys 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:19.279
 you had to have an excuse because you were going to summon parents parents come and 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.689
 moms let's chat south 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.879
 iria flavia I thought that through the game 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:30.870
 i in a program that had let's say cover everything that has to do in 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.700
 those first three years of life with cognitive development and development 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:36.009
 affective 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.259
 with this program that was going to be achieved 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.509
 interest parents to come with their children 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.649
 then I had a double objective on the one hand to work with the hundred percent what 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:49.169
 that to prevention 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.379
 viano sun a project that had to do with that experience that had 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.039
 had the hospital durÃ¡n with guys that really the five years had arrived 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:58.349
 with problems 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.839
 what in the first three years of life 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:02.389
 day you could not swim 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.139
 invited 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.290
 or at least resolved let's say before 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.179
 and with the parent group 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:11.679
 aiming at 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:15.989
 information enrichment space let's say at the level of 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:21.139
 links between parents to share this moment of parenting 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.700
 there was no training 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.849
 in education from 0 to 3 years 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.369
 I managed to give training because good luck I had the luck let's say stop 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.469
 an experience contrasted in any case a psychoanalyst 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.769
 in trance this activity in paris i and it's really I was lucky that you 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.779
 be weakened to participate in the table warned by an experience that is 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:53.459
 allende salazar who invited her so I stayed a month 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.110
 percent 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.760
 visiting m the mission here and that is the green house 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:03.940
 ii if so dollars in your office and sharing 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.510
 and already from the psychoanalysis or from the education how we could work with 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.599
 parents 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.899
 improve children's quality of life
