now all that a dotted note means is he a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.939 
now all that a dotted note means is he a
Don<00:01:00.239> half<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.690> value<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.289> whatever<00:01:01.739> the

Don half the value of whatever the
original<00:01:02.340> note<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> dotted<00:01:04.890> note<00:01:05.220> like

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
original note was so a dotted note like

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.780 
original note was so a dotted note like
that<00:01:05.970> half<00:01:06.210> note<00:01:06.479> there<00:01:06.740> would<00:01:07.740> mean<00:01:07.950> when<00:01:08.670> you

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
that half note there would mean when you

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.090 
that half note there would mean when you
play<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.360> half<00:01:09.900> note<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> quarter<00:01:10.979> note

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
play it a half note with a quarter note

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.760 
play it a half note with a quarter note
joined<00:01:11.430> together<00:01:11.930> it's<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> same<00:01:13.290> process

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
joined together it's the same process

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.370 
joined together it's the same process
for<00:01:13.799> rests<00:01:14.369> there's<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.180> whole<00:01:15.420> rest<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.960> half

sixteenth rest any of which can be

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.170 
sixteenth rest any of which can be
dotted<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.930> add<00:01:22.080> half<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.439> rest<00:01:22.860> value<00:01:23.250> now

dotted to add half the rest value now

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.520 
dotted to add half the rest value now
I'll<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> look<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:24.720> what<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.869> means<00:01:25.229> in

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
I'll have a look at what that means in

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.940 
I'll have a look at what that means in
sheet<00:01:25.770> music<00:01:26.509> most<00:01:27.509> sheet<00:01:27.780> music<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.350> 4/4

sheet music most sheet music is in 4/4
time<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.610> means<00:01:29.790> there's<00:01:30.119> four<00:01:30.360> beats<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
time which means there's four beats to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.090 
time which means there's four beats to
each<00:01:31.140> bar<00:01:31.439> which<00:01:32.100> goes<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.759> two<00:01:33.509> three<00:01:34.380> four

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
for half of the whole note so it goes

1 1 1 1 and so on

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.170 

now<00:02:09.030> for<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.360> names<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> notes<00:02:10.879> the<00:02:11.879> notes

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
now for the names of the notes the notes

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.929 
now for the names of the notes the notes

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
in between the lines on the staff are F

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:20.030 
in between the lines on the staff are F
a<00:02:15.349> C<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.560> E<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:18.750> notes<00:02:18.989> on<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.500> lines<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
a C and E the notes on the lines of the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.059 
a C and E the notes on the lines of the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
staff are e G B D and F so if we put

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.979 
staff are e G B D and F so if we put
these<00:02:26.189> together<00:02:26.400> we<00:02:27.150> get<00:02:27.329> from<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.689> bottom

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
these together we get from the bottom

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.960 
these together we get from the bottom
line<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.439> the<00:02:28.530> top<00:02:28.739> line<00:02:28.980> e<00:02:29.220> f<00:02:30.030> g<00:02:30.359> a<00:02:30.930> b<00:02:31.230> c<00:02:31.439> d<00:02:32.129> e<00:02:32.640> and

line to the top line e f g a b c d e and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.509 
line to the top line e f g a b c d e and
f<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:34.019> there<00:02:34.200> are<00:02:34.290> really<00:02:34.470> only<00:02:34.620> eight<00:02:35.159> notes

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
f so there are really only eight notes

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.250 
f so there are really only eight notes
to<00:02:35.730> remember<00:02:36.120> because<00:02:36.780> once<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.109> go<00:02:37.230> through

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
to remember because once you go through

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.960 
to remember because once you go through

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
from a b c d e f and then to g it

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.690 
from a b c d e f and then to g it
restarts<00:02:42.780> at<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.019> again

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.830

you may see sharps and flats which are

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.809 
you may see sharps and flats which are
like<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> little<00:02:57.860> hash<00:02:58.040> sign<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.610> something

like a little hash sign and something

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.449 
like a little hash sign and something
that<00:02:58.909> looks<00:02:58.970> like<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.209> bee<00:03:00.129> now<00:03:01.129> I<00:03:01.159> won't<00:03:01.340> be

explaining<00:03:01.879> those<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.239> video<00:03:02.420> but<00:03:03.109> you

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
explaining those in this video but you

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.509 
explaining those in this video but you
can<00:03:03.200> look<00:03:03.439> them<00:03:03.560> up<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:03.769> your<00:03:03.890> own<00:03:04.010> time<00:03:04.280> and

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
can look them up in your own time and

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.400 
can look them up in your own time and
they're<00:03:04.670> very<00:03:04.849> easy<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.269> learn

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.200 

let's<00:03:10.410> look<00:03:10.560> at<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.800> range<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.520> sea<00:03:11.730> ocarina

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
let's look at the range of a sea ocarina

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.570 
let's look at the range of a sea ocarina
with<00:03:13.200> all<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.500> holes<00:03:13.710> covered<00:03:14.010> except<00:03:14.490> the

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
with all the holes covered except the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.390 
with all the holes covered except the
sub<00:03:14.790> holes<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.660> plays<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.020> C<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.650> with<00:03:17.160> all<00:03:17.280> the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
sub holes it plays a C and with all the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:27.170 
sub holes it plays a C and with all the
holes<00:03:17.610> open<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.210> plays<00:03:18.510> an<00:03:18.660> F<00:03:25.850> let's<00:03:26.850> compare

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
holes open it plays an F let's compare

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:35.420 
holes open it plays an F let's compare
that<00:03:27.240> to<00:03:27.390> an<00:03:27.600> ocarina<00:03:28.020> in<00:03:28.320> G<00:03:34.040> did<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.160> hear<00:03:35.310> the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
that to an ocarina in G did you hear the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.250 
that to an ocarina in G did you hear the
different<00:03:35.730> sound<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.180> made<00:03:36.360> it<00:03:37.050> has<00:03:37.230> a

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
different sound that it made it has a

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.950 
different sound that it made it has a
different<00:03:37.710> range<00:03:38.420> now<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.480> can<00:03:39.600> either<00:03:39.720> have

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
different range now you can either have

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.770 
different range now you can either have
it<00:03:39.990> in<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.290> higher<00:03:40.560> G<00:03:40.890> or<00:03:41.130> lower<00:03:41.670> G<00:03:41.970> depending<00:03:42.690> on

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
it in a higher G or lower G depending on

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.150 
it in a higher G or lower G depending on
what<00:03:42.930> type<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.170> someone<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.800> what<00:03:43.920> sound

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
what type of someone is and what sound

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.550 
what type of someone is and what sound
you<00:03:44.310> like<00:03:44.460> more<00:03:44.700> certain<00:03:45.660> songs<00:03:45.960> will<00:03:46.170> require

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
you like more certain songs will require

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.620 
you like more certain songs will require
a<00:03:46.830> different<00:03:47.040> range<00:03:47.490> from<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.120> say<00:03:48.270> SC

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
a different range from the say SC

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.900 
a different range from the say SC
ocarina<00:03:49.050> or<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.290> G<00:03:49.530> ocarina<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.190> then<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:50.760> can

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
ocarina or a G ocarina and then you can

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.700 
ocarina or a G ocarina and then you can
find<00:03:51.180> an<00:03:51.270> ocarina<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:51.810> has<00:03:51.960> that<00:03:52.170> range<00:03:52.440> or

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
find an ocarina that has that range or

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.370 
find an ocarina that has that range or
you<00:03:53.280> can<00:03:53.640> transpose<00:03:54.240> it<00:03:54.480> as<00:03:54.810> we'll<00:03:55.050> be<00:03:55.140> doing

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
you can transpose it as we'll be doing

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.520 
you can transpose it as we'll be doing
in<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:55.590> video<00:03:56.840> let's<00:03:57.840> see<00:03:58.020> if<00:03:58.110> we<00:03:58.200> can<00:03:58.350> put
