 android head with human face the 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.990
 the last step towards immortality the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.360
 Android head with human aspect more 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.809
 advanced world will be presented in the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.190
 international congress the global future 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.289
 2045 that in June will bring together 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.869
 sector scientists in new york ' 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.580
 this device is an exact copy of 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.010
 the head of the Russian billionaire 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.220
 dmitri peskov founder of the project 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.619
 russia 2045 and president of the congress 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.269
 2045 boss 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.489
 the author of the avatar is the acquaintance 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.730
 anthropomorphic robot developer 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.780
 david ansón founder of hanson robotics 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.640
 during the development of the copy 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.739
 robotic of my head in the first 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.660
 stage of the avatar to david and project 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.420
 soon has advanced in the improvement of the robot 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.910
 anthropomorphic his achievements show that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.890
 science is a few steps away from 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.870
 the creation of the artificial copy more 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.030
 Realistic human body almost 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.670
 indistinguishable from the original stated 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.710
 itzkoff mitri's robotic head is 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.530
 a device that has the features 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.820
 most expressive facials ever created and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.710
 that goes way beyond the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.840
 anthropomorphic characteristics of 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.759
 Previous simulations of robotic man 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.490
 from the technological point of view and 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.200
 artistic the robotic head of mitri 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.170
 can establish eye contact 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.270
 recognize faces and keep the dialogue on 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.189
 control of the robot will fall on the own 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.439
 matri giving the avatar the 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.929
 possibility of speaking both in Russian and 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.659
 in English said the billionaire ansón 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.759
 32 year old believes that technology 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.100
 will allow you to obtain immortality in a 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.740
 holographic body your initiative 2 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.020
 thousandth 45th is described as the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.030
 next step in the evolution and more than 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.979
 20 thousand people have registered in 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.229
 facebook to follow your progress with 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.959
 global conferences planned for 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.579
 explore the necessary technology we believe 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.709
 it is possible that it is unnecessary 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.289
 eliminate aging and even the 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.399
 death and the limits are exceeded 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.039
 fundamentals of physical abilities 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.739
 and mental illnesses currently established by 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:02.129
 the restrictions of the physical body 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:03.959
 destaz itzkoff before 2.045 will be created 

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:06.149
 an artificial body that not only 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.340
 will surpass the existing body in terms 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.289
 of functionality but will reach the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.810
 perfection of form and will be no less 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.849
 attractive that the human body said 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.920
 this project is paving the way 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.430
 towards immortality holds itzkoff 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.290
 Russia 2045 is an ambitious project of 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.599
 a group of Russian researchers who 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.730
 pleads for the era of humanity the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.380
 humanity has always been attracted 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.480
 for the possibility of achieving 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.510
 immortality that according to the team of 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.510
 scientists will be reached by 2045
