00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.950
 hello how are you I'm one side 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.840
 if I'm one if in this video I'm going to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.400
 teach how to prepare morphine 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.680
 and to accompany, let's make some 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.050
 chocolate ice and now let's see 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.650
 how are the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.619
 need for our rich dessert are 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.650
 250 grams of flour 2 eggs one 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.449
 100 grams of butter 300 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:42.320
 milliliters of milk 250 grams of sugar 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:45.120
 8 strawberries 20 grams of baking powder 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.250
 a splash of vanilla and cinnamon 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.720
 taste in a container we are going to mix 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.850
 All the ingredients 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.850
 - strawberries they go all the way 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.860
 remember that the butter should be 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.560
 perfectly melted so you do not get 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.869
 there are rare lumps 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.729
 since you have everything together you put it in the 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.439
 blender to achieve consistency 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.720
 that we need, we return it to 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.700
 container and now if we incorporate the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.080
 strawberries perfectly cut to the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.420
 mixture 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.190
 try not to stir too fast to not 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.190
 undo any bit of strawberry 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.450
 we put the corridors here in a mold 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.939
 for monfils and helping us with a 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.360
 little jar or something with a tip we fill them 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.790
 to the top 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.130
 before putting them to bake we're going to 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.840
 put a little cinnamon on them 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.780
 so they have a richer flavor 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.790
 remember to learn your oven at 190 degrees 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.860
 a few minutes before it is ready 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.990
 at the time of putting it and so we are going to 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.010
 leave them for 20 or 30 minutes 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.080
 It depends on each oven 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.360
 and now let's make our ice of 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.700
 chocolate with a little milk a 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.730
 Vanilla trickle and a lot of syrup 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.730
 chocolate 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.600
 you stir it super well and we put it in 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.030
 an ice mold after that what 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.420
 We put in the freezer and hope they are 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.420
 ready 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.160
 since I have not ready ends you can 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.080
 decorate with some flowers and serve a 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.320
 glass of milk to which we add the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.150
 chocolate ice I love the 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.050
 whipped cream so if you too 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.050
 you can put a little 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.519
 I hope you liked the great 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.440
 they were really delicious if you make them 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.330
