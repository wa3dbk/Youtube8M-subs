00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.029
 I greet all lovers of the vein on the same 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:10.190
 themes today a small kitchen test 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:16.529
 This knife is called a cruiser. 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:18.539
 natural day everyone became 90 and understand 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.420
 test it specifically on camera 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:32.090
 nothing to shoot on as they say life 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:32.090
 Well, yes, itâ€™s definitely quite good 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.450
 die to anyone. 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:53.100
 not small home tinker 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:58.799
 probably have a good will 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:23.869
 check i'm this here man let's 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:32.600
 Perhaps we will begin the problems started 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:39.840
 there is no understand the legs crunched or 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:45.750
 the duck itself in general with this knife of 90 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.090
 there were some problems on the channel 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.799
 user Oleg martish can 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:02:00.539
 watch i will give a reference to the channel and 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:06.689
 his tests he tested this knife on 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:10.109
 rope and let's say it turned out not very 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:15.060
 impressive result to me very 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:16.459
 impressive is a mild result 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.980
 depressing 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:30.769
 if to be to call a spade a spade 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:36.569
 sadly you can't tell otherwise. fatty 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:40.400
 but in principle there should be no life in 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:44.330
 its dignity 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:48.380
 This is not a very good result. 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.480
 I can even say frankly bad 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.640
 then he tested it turned out 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.190
 I also live much better 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.670
 contacted the workshop 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:08.330
 death on the Hanse in the topic 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:12.450
 If he opened a dispute, he is so very 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.200
 framework of decency let's say so soon we are there 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.840
 did not find some kind of kipish raise so 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:29.100
 asked what it is 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:33.200
 Th for the garbage as a agent in my 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:40.290
 principle adequate for girly 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:43.010
 like the reason brought what their words 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:47.490
 was somehow likely 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:51.060
 decarburization layer with their words he was 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:55.790
 small but by my observation he 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.680
 more than they wrote today need 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:05.550
 peretochil 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:09.390
 patent for a few hours well, say 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:17.280
 lies like mitch jedi this is not 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:20.940
 take away here I advise you to see who 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:25.340
 interesting topic here these knives shook 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:29.400
 Odessa I recommend to watch Oleg's video 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.540
 there he is straight in the second video when he 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.880
 already made more releases of teams he 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.050
 It will show you that it's there speaks 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.050
 about this thing 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:49.990
 I can subscribe safely because 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:57.330
 really share the point of view cant 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:57.330
 country masters was a clear cant 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:04.389
 seemed to eliminate hey at first glance 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:09.120
 I know I'm looking for something that is not testing 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:13.080
 they can say oh well with oleg with his knife 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:16.630
 As a result, everything turned out fine 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:23.820
 he spent time of course nerves at 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.820
 meant this knife now we'll see 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:38.940
 so we have including after this duck 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.940
 blind this box is live as they say 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:59.250
 I have already raked the tip on this knife 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:05.039
 it will be hard the tip is very delicate 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.039
 Generally knife for cut I think 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:20.210
 for which it is impossible by the way pen 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.770
 this toxic justifies itself though 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.979
 he's such a matter of speed up pretty 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:29.889
 polished noted notch 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:42.320
 and especially not notice that slippery hand 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:49.240
 dirty we operate as he is all but now 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:49.240
 Wash, let's see what became of the carcass 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:31.490
 At first glance, everything is fine we'll see 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:34.610
 black paper seems water, too, all 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.610
 no change 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:43.500
 Well, in general, so here are the tests 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.620
 continue think we will cook for no 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.540
 you push uniki very interesting 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:51.270
 so look who is not signed 

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.990
 subscribe I think we are all the same 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.810
 let's figure it out 

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:57.440
 xy xy all thanks everyone for watching 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.440
