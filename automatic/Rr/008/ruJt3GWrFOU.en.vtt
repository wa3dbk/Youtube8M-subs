 Welcome once again to the channel 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.699

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.070
 from the creator guys and well then today 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.220

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.470
 with which I'm playing vale micros 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.480
 you are watching everyone and good guys is my 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.449
 first race the truth with a looping 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.430
 so well I hope you have been 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.019
 well the truth because be my first 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.180
 looping then well I do not have much 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.100
 experience doing the let's say so 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.829
 I do not know if it will have been really real 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.690
 good but good guys you know I do 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.760
 my careers so that you have fun 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.010
 the best possible and be good races 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.839
 so let's see what you think guys 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.820
 to me the truth is that it is a career that 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.369
 I really like how it has already been 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.860
 you are going to see right now we are going there with him 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:03.960
 in marmoset lately I'm catching myself 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.939
 a lot of lentito and is that it is a great 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.840
 car are a great car for these 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.630
 I continue racing 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.189
 ok we go out with turbo mother of mine how much 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.189
 I was not going out with turbo 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.700
 ok or come and we see well 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.720
 and we take the streetlights ahead and 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.720
 as always so as not to lose habit 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.560
 so my uncle's car is going 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.980
 voucher voucher voucher voucher 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.980
 checked 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.149
 two 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.149
 u and this has a bit of cheating 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.649
 because if you do not get it right the truth 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.360
 you have to catch pretty well the most 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.329
 possible straight line so you have to 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.240
 twist almost on the ramp because if it's not 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.310
 it's possible that you stay in there is worth a 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.310
 advice that I give you worthy guys and cool 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.280
 this race is worth it and we are going with the best 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.099
 ramp I think of all because this 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.500
 it's a jump piece of three pairs of 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.830
 noses as you are seeing guys 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.930
 hello hello no no no no no no no no 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.459
 thank goodness it has not fallen very badly because 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.920
 I was fucking the truth I was 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.760
 shitting already good guys we approach the 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.060
 looping we approach the looping 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.079
 against the shit of vouchers guys here 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.159
 is one that I'm going fuck my mother and 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.159
 thank goodness that is my career 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.250
 We despacito come here worth it 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.250
 because as you are going to see right now because 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.250
 here do not fuck that male dropped dude good 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.709
 very important guys here in the looping 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.770
 that's the only good advice the council 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.850
 that you have to follow yes or yes is that 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.770
 be lupine, guys, you have to catch it 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.760
 totally straight because if you do not go here 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.620
 ok if we do not go here you have to take it 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.810
 totally straight is a bit tricky 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.390
 sometimes it's worth touching a little and the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.850
 eggs is worth but accelerating more more 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.390
 more or less from here it's worth not what 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.090
 try to keep as straight as possible 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.100
 and as you can see if we keep up with challenges 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.620
 and we fall well of course that I who has 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.010
 gone fatal and if we want good guys by 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.360
 we do it well it's the only one let's say the 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.370
 only data that I wanted to leave you 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.959
 this race because the truth if not what 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.489
 you know so good because you can throw there 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.489
 a time until I find out 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.980
 how cool are these jumps that make me so cool 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.990
 very much these jumps and the truth is 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.410
 that lately in my careers 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.180
 I'm including a lot although good and 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.950
 you know guys I 'm not racing 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.350
 of one type I always like to put 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.300
 several ramps several things so that the 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.090
 race well be the most complete 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.520
 possible so guys to see how about you 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:10.040
 I opened that you think what we have to 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.040
 do here now to see if I get guys 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.739
 well actually had to have 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.109
 twisted a little bit more but there 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.090
 we had to fall guys good what 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.950
 it seems that end to fall directly 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.260
 there you have to fall through the gap though 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.480
 I have not fallen the truth but good if 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.300
 you want to make it cool because you can 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.330
