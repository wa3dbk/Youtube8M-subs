identity today I'm just going to very
quickly<00:00:05.250> talk<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.759> you<00:00:05.879> about<00:00:05.970> natural<00:00:06.930> minor

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
quickly talk to you about natural minor

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.000 
quickly talk to you about natural minor
scales<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.919> harmonic<00:00:08.700> minor<00:00:09.000> scales<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:10.010> I'm

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
scales and harmonic minor scales and I'm

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.290 
scales and harmonic minor scales and I'm
getting<00:00:11.280> another<00:00:11.460> question<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.059> people

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
getting another question so people

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.669 
getting another question so people
asking<00:00:12.719> me<00:00:12.750> what<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.080> difference<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.530> between

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
asking me what the difference is between

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.129 
asking me what the difference is between
the<00:00:14.070> two<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:15.179> some<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.570> my<00:00:15.719> earlier<00:00:16.049> videos

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
the two and in some of my earlier videos

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.870 
the two and in some of my earlier videos
where<00:00:16.650> I've<00:00:16.770> talked<00:00:17.010> about<00:00:17.130> minor<00:00:17.490> scales

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
where I've talked about minor scales

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.450 
where I've talked about minor scales
I've<00:00:18.090> used<00:00:18.359> harmonic<00:00:18.990> minor<00:00:19.170> scales<00:00:19.619> but<00:00:20.250> some

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
I've used harmonic minor scales but some

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.550 
I've used harmonic minor scales but some
of<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.670> are<00:00:20.789> asking<00:00:20.939> about<00:00:21.270> natural<00:00:22.080> minor

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
of you are asking about natural minor

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.730 
of you are asking about natural minor
scales<00:00:23.689> now<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:24.840> most<00:00:25.019> traditionally<00:00:25.619> in

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
scales now it's most traditionally in

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.640 
scales now it's most traditionally in
music<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.730> don't<00:00:26.849> really<00:00:27.390> use<00:00:27.630> natural<00:00:28.380> minor

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
music we don't really use natural minor

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.759 
music we don't really use natural minor
scales<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.429> much<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.080> definitely<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.470> my<00:00:31.740> I

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
scales so much and definitely in my I

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.920 
scales so much and definitely in my I
had<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> classical<00:00:32.610> upbringing<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.210> play<00:00:33.630> three

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
had a classical upbringing I play three

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.290 
had a classical upbringing I play three
instruments<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.680> never<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.730> played<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
instruments and never have I played and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.630 
instruments and never have I played and
really<00:00:36.719> played<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> natural<00:00:37.620> minor<00:00:37.890> scale<00:00:38.070> in

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
really played a natural minor scale in

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.670 
really played a natural minor scale in
any<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.510> my<00:00:39.660> exams<00:00:40.020> because<00:00:40.260> I've<00:00:40.350> grown<00:00:40.500> up

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
any of my exams because I've grown up

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.979 
any of my exams because I've grown up
doing<00:00:40.950> exams<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.489> all<00:00:41.579> three<00:00:41.820> instruments<00:00:42.390> so

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
doing exams on all three instruments so

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.900 
doing exams on all three instruments so
in<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> syllabuses<00:00:43.710> you're<00:00:43.920> usually<00:00:44.430> asked

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
in the syllabuses you're usually asked

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.650 
in the syllabuses you're usually asked
to<00:00:45.000> play<00:00:45.180> either<00:00:45.510> harmonic<00:00:46.410> or<00:00:46.649> melodic<00:00:47.660> I'm

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
to play either harmonic or melodic I'm

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.060 
to play either harmonic or melodic I'm
not<00:00:48.840> gonna<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.079> too<00:00:49.140> much<00:00:49.379> into<00:00:49.620> melodic

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
not gonna go too much into melodic

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.380 
not gonna go too much into melodic
scales<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.489> confuse<00:00:50.820> everybody<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.239> this

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
scales and confuse everybody at this

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.580 
scales and confuse everybody at this
point<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:51.920> harmonic<00:00:52.920> minor<00:00:53.250> scales<00:00:53.789> are

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
point but harmonic minor scales are

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.959 
point but harmonic minor scales are
there<00:00:55.590> scales<00:00:55.920> based<00:00:56.190> around<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.789> key

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
there scales based around the key

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.930 
there scales based around the key
signature<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.289> example<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.760> key

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
signature so for example the key

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.209 
signature so for example the key
signature<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.750> C<00:01:01.109> major<00:01:01.350> doesn't<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.070> any

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
signature of C major doesn't have any

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.399 
signature of C major doesn't have any
sharps<00:01:02.640> or<00:01:02.789> any<00:01:02.940> flats<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> key

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
sharps or any flats in but the key

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.490 
sharps or any flats in but the key
signature<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:05.220> C<00:01:05.549> minor<00:01:05.939> has<00:01:06.420> three<00:01:06.840> flats<00:01:07.140> in

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
signature of C minor has three flats in

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.090 
signature of C minor has three flats in
a<00:01:07.650> B<00:01:07.890> flat<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> E<00:01:08.520> flat<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.210> flat<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.470> you

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
a B flat and E flat and a flat so you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.520 
a B flat and E flat and a flat so you
would<00:01:11.250> play<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> C<00:01:11.880> minor<00:01:12.180> according<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
would play a C minor according to the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.950 
would play a C minor according to the
key<00:01:13.710> signature<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.700> it'll<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> normal<00:01:15.420> C<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
key signature so it'll be a normal C a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.770 
key signature so it'll be a normal C a
normal<00:01:16.409> D<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.520> would<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.790> an<00:01:17.909> E<00:01:18.150> flat<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
normal D then it would be an E flat and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.120 
normal D then it would be an E flat and
F<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.409> G<00:01:19.799> an<00:01:20.100> A<00:01:20.369> flat<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.030> B<00:01:21.240> flat<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.020> C<00:01:22.380> so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
F a G an A flat and B flat and a C so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.950 
F a G an A flat and B flat and a C so
that<00:01:23.700> would<00:01:23.970> actually<00:01:24.479> that's<00:01:24.720> what<00:01:24.869> I've

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
that would actually that's what I've

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.200 
that would actually that's what I've
actually<00:01:25.080> described<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> natural<00:01:26.640> minor

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
actually described as a natural minor

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.600 
actually described as a natural minor
scale<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.290> you're<00:01:28.710> basically<00:01:29.369> you're<00:01:29.549> not

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
scale so you're basically you're not

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.550 
scale so you're basically you're not
deviating<00:01:30.240> from<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.570> key<00:01:30.720> signature<00:01:30.960> at<00:01:31.350> all

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
deviating from the key signature at all

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.310 
deviating from the key signature at all
a<00:01:32.030> harmonic<00:01:33.030> minor<00:01:33.270> scale<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.020> where<00:01:34.200> you

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
a harmonic minor scale is where you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.830 
a harmonic minor scale is where you
would<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> key<00:01:35.070> signature<00:01:35.310> says

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
would do what the key signature says

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.539 
would do what the key signature says
except<00:01:36.840> when<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.350> got<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> seventh<00:01:38.220> note

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
except when you got to the seventh note

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.600 
except when you got to the seventh note
you<00:01:39.299> would<00:01:39.479> raise<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.619> semitone<00:01:41.100> or<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you would raise it up a semitone or a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.060 
you would raise it up a semitone or a
half<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.210> step<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:43.439> those<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.770> who<00:01:43.890> aren't

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
half a step for those of you who aren't

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.030 
half a step for those of you who aren't
familiar<00:01:44.159> with<00:01:44.549> semitone<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> C<00:01:46.770> minor

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
familiar with semitone so for a C minor

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.249 
familiar with semitone so for a C minor

flat<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:50.040> play<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> normal<00:01:50.430> C<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.090> normal<00:01:51.600> D<00:01:51.810> then

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
flat you play a normal C a normal D then

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.230 
flat you play a normal C a normal D then
you<00:01:52.560> play<00:01:52.770> an<00:01:52.890> E<00:01:53.100> flat<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> key<00:01:54.060> signature

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you play an E flat as the key signature

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.480 
you play an E flat as the key signature
says<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.200> play<00:01:55.470> an<00:01:55.590> F<00:01:55.799> then<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.159> play<00:01:56.460> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
says then you play an F then you play a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.230 
says then you play an F then you play a
G<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.360> play<00:01:57.630> an<00:01:57.750> a-flat<00:01:58.460> but<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.700> next

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
G then you play an a-flat but the next

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.760 
G then you play an a-flat but the next
note<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.810> come<00:02:00.990> into<00:02:01.170> which<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
note that you come into which is the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.999 
note that you come into which is the
seventh<00:02:02.250> note<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> scale<00:02:02.820> c<00:02:03.390> d<00:02:03.630> e<00:02:03.659> f<00:02:03.899> G<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.710> B

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
seventh note of the scale c d e f G a B

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.950 
seventh note of the scale c d e f G a B
so<00:02:05.939> that's<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.210> seventh<00:02:06.479> note<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.840> scale

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
so that's the seventh note of the scale

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.440 
so that's the seventh note of the scale
the<00:02:07.590> key<00:02:07.770> signature<00:02:08.009> says<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.759> b-flat<00:02:09.119> so

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the key signature says it's a b-flat so

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.780 
the key signature says it's a b-flat so
you<00:02:09.509> should<00:02:09.810> play<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> b-flat<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:11.129> for<00:02:11.760> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
you should play a b-flat but for a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.910 
you should play a b-flat but for a
harmonic<00:02:12.330> minor

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
harmonic minor

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.100 
harmonic minor
you<00:02:12.980> raise<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.640> seventh<00:02:14.030> note<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.840> would

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
you raise the seventh note so you would

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.150 
you raise the seventh note so you would
raise<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.440> b-flat<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.030> being<00:02:17.420> natural<00:02:18.160> so

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
raise a b-flat to a being natural so

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.650 
raise a b-flat to a being natural so
then<00:02:19.340> you'd<00:02:19.489> play<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.670> B<00:02:19.880> natural<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.540> then

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
then you'd play a B natural and then

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.240 
then you'd play a B natural and then
obviously<00:02:20.810> you'd<00:02:21.080> finish<00:02:21.380> off<00:02:21.530> with<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.739> C<00:02:22.010> and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
obviously you'd finish off with a C and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.890 
obviously you'd finish off with a C and
then<00:02:22.520> you'd<00:02:22.640> work<00:02:22.819> your<00:02:22.849> way<00:02:23.150> back<00:02:23.390> down<00:02:23.599> again

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
then you'd work your way back down again

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.440 
then you'd work your way back down again
so<00:02:24.410> that's<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.830> harmonic<00:02:25.340> minor<00:02:25.610> scale<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:26.420> a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
so that's a harmonic minor scale so a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.500 
so that's a harmonic minor scale so a
harmonic<00:02:27.110> minor<00:02:27.140> scale<00:02:27.739> is<00:02:28.209> where<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.330> would

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
harmonic minor scale is where you would

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.900 
harmonic minor scale is where you would
do<00:02:29.660> exactly<00:02:30.319> what<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.010> key<00:02:31.190> signature<00:02:31.430> said

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
do exactly what the key signature said

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.910 
do exactly what the key signature said
for<00:02:32.300> all<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.690> minor<00:02:32.930> key<00:02:33.230> signature<00:02:33.650> for<00:02:33.800> that

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
for all the minor key signature for that

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.640 
for all the minor key signature for that
scale<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.550> are<00:02:34.700> in<00:02:34.850> F<00:02:35.180> minor<00:02:35.569> G<00:02:36.050> minor<00:02:36.319> D

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
scale that you are in F minor G minor D

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.770 
scale that you are in F minor G minor D
minor<00:02:36.680> whatever<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.489> were<00:02:37.610> in<00:02:37.790> but<00:02:38.360> when<00:02:38.660> you

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
minor whatever you were in but when you

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.750 
minor whatever you were in but when you
got<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.170> seventh<00:02:39.560> know<00:02:39.769> whatever<00:02:40.400> it

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
got to the seventh know whatever it

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.309 
got to the seventh know whatever it
would<00:02:41.000> have<00:02:41.300> been<00:02:41.510> from<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.900> key<00:02:42.080> signature

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
would have been from the key signature

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.190 
would have been from the key signature
you<00:02:43.069> would<00:02:43.220> raise<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:43.849> up<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.269> half<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.690> step<00:02:44.930> or<00:02:45.140> a

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
you would raise it up a half a step or a

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.960 
you would raise it up a half a step or a
semitone<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.420> natural<00:02:48.380> minor<00:02:49.130> scale<00:02:49.640> is

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
semitone so a natural minor scale is

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.020 
semitone so a natural minor scale is
where<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.870> would<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.370> same<00:02:52.549> process<00:02:52.910> as

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
where you would it's the same process as

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.670 
where you would it's the same process as
a<00:02:53.060> major<00:02:53.299> scale<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.870> would<00:02:53.959> do<00:02:54.110> exactly

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
a major scale you would do exactly

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.100 
a major scale you would do exactly
whatever<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.280> said<00:02:55.489> in<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.700> key<00:02:55.880> signature<00:02:56.150> so

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
whatever it said in the key signature so

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.570 
whatever it said in the key signature so
I<00:02:57.470> know<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.709> can't<00:02:57.920> see<00:02:58.069> my<00:02:58.160> hands<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:58.489> the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.220

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
harmonic it gives you that slightly

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.570 
harmonic it gives you that slightly
different<00:04:06.830> sound<00:04:07.830> that<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.130> can<00:04:08.160> hear<00:04:08.310> at<00:04:08.520> the

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
different sound that you can hear at the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.390 
different sound that you can hear at the
top<00:04:08.790> therefore<00:04:09.300> a<00:04:09.330> natural

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.640 

it's<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.269> slightly<00:04:14.540> different<00:04:14.659> sound<00:04:15.110> there<00:04:15.409> so

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
it's a slightly different sound there so

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.770 
it's a slightly different sound there so
so<00:04:16.190> there<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.400> go<00:04:16.549> it's<00:04:16.790> there<00:04:17.359> was<00:04:17.479> a<00:04:17.510> really

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
so there you go it's there was a really

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.000 
so there you go it's there was a really
an<00:04:17.840> awful<00:04:18.079> lot<00:04:18.169> of<00:04:18.199> difference<00:04:18.650> if<00:04:18.799> you<00:04:18.919> were

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
an awful lot of difference if you were

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.390 
an awful lot of difference if you were
doing<00:04:19.130> exams<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:20.120> would<00:04:20.269> do<00:04:20.709> harmonic<00:04:21.709> miners

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
doing exams you would do harmonic miners

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.010 
doing exams you would do harmonic miners
it<00:04:22.790> would<00:04:22.910> be<00:04:23.000> very<00:04:23.240> rare<00:04:23.449> that<00:04:23.600> we<00:04:23.660> do<00:04:23.870> the

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
it would be very rare that we do the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.280 
it would be very rare that we do the
natural<00:04:24.440> minor<00:04:24.710> scales<00:04:25.180> in<00:04:26.180> music<00:04:26.720> we<00:04:26.990> quite

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
natural minor scales in music we quite

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.560 
natural minor scales in music we quite
often<00:04:27.530> raise<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.580> seventh<00:04:28.940> note<00:04:29.240> just

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
often raise the seventh note just

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.260 
often raise the seventh note just
because<00:04:30.050> it's<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:31.340> seventh<00:04:31.669> note<00:04:31.910> is<00:04:32.060> like<00:04:32.210> a

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
because it's the seventh note is like a

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.450 
because it's the seventh note is like a
leading<00:04:32.810> note<00:04:33.050> into<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.889> main<00:04:34.070> note<00:04:34.220> of<00:04:34.370> the

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
leading note into the main note of the

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.170 
leading note into the main note of the
scale<00:04:34.550> again

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
scale again

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.890 
scale again
for<00:04:35.360> example<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.830> raising<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:37.880> b-flat<00:04:38.270> in<00:04:38.600> C

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
for example the raising the b-flat in C

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.980 
for example the raising the b-flat in C
minor<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:40.100> B<00:04:40.280> is<00:04:40.490> one<00:04:40.699> before<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.690> the

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
minor the the B is one before the the

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.689 
minor the the B is one before the the
main<00:04:42.199> note<00:04:42.410> of<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.710> scale<00:04:42.830> then<00:04:43.250> but<00:04:43.460> a<00:04:43.490> bit

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
main note of the scale then but a bit

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.450 
main note of the scale then but a bit
higher<00:04:43.910> up<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:44.840> would<00:04:45.410> raise<00:04:45.650> that<00:04:45.979> so<00:04:46.310> it

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
higher up you would raise that so it

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.520 
higher up you would raise that so it
sounds<00:04:47.060> like<00:04:47.240> what<00:04:47.510> we<00:04:47.600> would<00:04:47.780> call<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:47.990> leading

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
sounds like what we would call a leading

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.159 
sounds like what we would call a leading
note<00:04:48.710> so<00:04:48.889> it<00:04:49.010> sounds<00:04:49.370> very<00:04:49.430> nice<00:04:50.060> leading<00:04:50.990> in

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
note so it sounds very nice leading in

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.779 
note so it sounds very nice leading in
to<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.610> final<00:04:53.090> note<00:04:53.360> of<00:04:53.660> C<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:54.919> that's<00:04:55.520> why

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
to the the final note of C so that's why

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.790 
to the the final note of C so that's why
we<00:04:56.000> we<00:04:56.270> sort<00:04:56.449> of<00:04:56.510> do<00:04:56.660> mainly<00:04:56.960> harmonics

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
we we sort of do mainly harmonics

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.189 
we we sort of do mainly harmonics
there<00:04:58.039> are<00:04:58.220> melodic<00:04:58.729> s--<00:04:58.760> you<00:04:59.660> raise<00:04:59.870> the

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
there are melodic s-- you raise the

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060
