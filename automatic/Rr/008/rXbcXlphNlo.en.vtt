chapter 616 review by bolt in this
chapter<00:00:05.879> on<00:00:06.710> Garen<00:00:07.710> shukaku<00:00:08.099> take<00:00:08.550> more<00:00:09.240> than

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
chapter on Garen shukaku take more than

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.890 
chapter on Garen shukaku take more than
more<00:00:11.190> than<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.400> half<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.030> chapter<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.719> it

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
more than a half of the chapter and it

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.120 
more than a half of the chapter and it
really<00:00:13.230> makes<00:00:13.410> me<00:00:13.530> think<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:13.799> they

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
really makes me think that they

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.849 
really makes me think that they
basically<00:00:14.790> put<00:00:15.330> their<00:00:15.690> relationship<00:00:16.500> and

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
basically put their relationship and

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.570 
basically put their relationship and
bonds<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:18.000> at<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.080> time<00:00:19.380> just<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.279> they<00:00:20.400> could

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
bonds in at this time just so they could

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.630 
bonds in at this time just so they could
set<00:00:20.789> up<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.150> freaking<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.800> big<00:00:23.130> cliffhanger

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
set up the freaking the big cliffhanger

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.230 
set up the freaking the big cliffhanger
at<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.210> end<00:00:24.300> where<00:00:25.369> kurama<00:00:26.369> gets<00:00:26.880> sucked<00:00:27.150> out
