00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 they are all boys and welcome to this 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.680
 new video his team eod we are 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.940
 found are the theories of flour states 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.360
 slow 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.929
 today we will talk about balon goals then how 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.529
 we know 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.890
 since winter it is an easter egg that can 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.550
 happen in random moments in frenetic 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.310
 of these two easter eggs consists of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.800
 appearance of this species of baloon boy 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.470
 female version under ours 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:37.079
 desk that stares at us but doesn't 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:41.489
 it will attack you other things then 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:45.149
 according to me this kind of 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.950
 easter egg looks a little like easter 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.050
 egg in which flour float 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.969
 landscape throw and all the heads there 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.879
 are in the backstage they turn towards the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.559
 camera 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.109
 so maybe internet to distract 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.960
 we can give this pair of baloon boy 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.630
 which is active and which they have forgotten 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.939
 to dismantle maybe that's maybe those 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.729
 can attack us or as infallible 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.980
 3d stu, that is the part of the skeleton e 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.990
 then appears 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.400
 sometimes but that does n't attack us then 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.750
 some people have succeeded in 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.630
 decode hidden game files 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:31.670
 and therefore they found the real name of 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:36.280
 balloon girl that would be jj then not 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:39.710
 you know what what jj means 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.060
 since it is a name that is good for both 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.680
 boys than girls then 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:51.250
 sixteen that is still a mystery though 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:56.300
 the official name is precisely jj then 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.850
 jjc fixed under the desk and it seems 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.330
 almost interested to see how there 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:07.040
 let's move then maybe it could be 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.770
 let's say a spy that I do n't know is in 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.410
 contact with one of the animatronics 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.480
 maybe he could tell him ours 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.810
 movements therefore if we are checking 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.030
 the camera or something 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.580
 so maybe maybe she spies on us for 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.850
 all seven nights though sometimes 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.400
 let's say it's not very careful and therefore 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.110
 let us discover it 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.570
 in fact, if we don't pay much 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.190
 be careful while being discovered not 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.880
 we can give because we say that 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.040
 pay attention to under the desk 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.590
 a bit difficult especially in the nights 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.840
 more advanced where you have to with heavens 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.540
 focus on the two fans and the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.140
 corridor 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.390
 so according to me well lungern remains 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.880
 throughout the duration of the game below 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.060
 our desk and sometimes so 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.940
 it is 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.020
 to pay us a visit to see what 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:08.340
 we are doing all the other data on the 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:11.430
 balon girl not only is there just yet 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.670
 then hidden or will make a reappearance 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.190
 influnet fradis 3 or we'll keep it as 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.830
 an unsolved mystery of cold braking 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.050
 its ok guys 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.900
 that was all I had from 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.540
 say on the balloon girl however before 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.239
 end the video I wanted you wanted 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.459
 greet one of my writings that has me 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.860
 actually gave a game up 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.150
 steam which is unfortunately not 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.220
 I can do because the PC binds me too much 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:46.400
 so okay i just wanted to say hello 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.400
 in the cinema the next theory is in the bulk
