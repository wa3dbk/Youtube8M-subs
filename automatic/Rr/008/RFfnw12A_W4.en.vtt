00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.170 
race this made is when I really noticed
the<00:01:50.070> difference<00:01:50.430> between<00:01:50.579> racing<00:01:51.000> someone

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
the difference between racing someone

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.819 
the difference between racing someone
and<00:01:51.390> not<00:01:51.450> racing<00:01:51.810> someone<00:01:52.140> because<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.649> don't

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and not racing someone because you don't

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.499 
and not racing someone because you don't
all<00:01:53.159> your<00:01:53.369> focus<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.790> beating<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.149> person

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
all your focus is beating that person

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.969 
all your focus is beating that person
like<00:01:54.659> forget<00:01:55.020> thinking<00:01:55.320> about<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> race<00:01:55.770> you

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
