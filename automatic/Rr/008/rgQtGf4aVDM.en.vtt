00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
alright welcome so in this one I try to

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.140 
alright welcome so in this one I try to
explain<00:00:03.410> what<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.440> transformer<00:00:05.400> is<00:00:05.580> how<00:00:05.910> they

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
explain what a transformer is how they

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.620 
explain what a transformer is how they
are<00:00:06.180> made<00:00:06.359> who<00:00:07.290> makes<00:00:07.620> them<00:00:08.010> who<00:00:08.790> uses<00:00:09.210> the

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
are made who makes them who uses the

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.410 
are made who makes them who uses the
Allspark<00:00:10.290> how<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.590> Allspark<00:00:11.280> was<00:00:11.519> used<00:00:11.940> with

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
Allspark how the Allspark was used with

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.780 
Allspark how the Allspark was used with
the<00:00:12.599> harvester<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.620> why<00:00:14.250> there<00:00:14.490> were<00:00:14.580> two

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
the harvester and why there were two

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.230 
the harvester and why there were two
demolishers<00:00:15.389> check<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.719> out<00:00:16.010> hey<00:00:18.170> why<00:00:19.170> did

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
demolishers check it out hey why did

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.679 
demolishers check it out hey why did
mudflap<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.510> get<00:00:21.720> stuck<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:23.689> dead

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
mudflap and I get stuck on the dead

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.200 
mudflap and I get stuck on the dead
robot<00:00:25.310> guarding<00:00:26.310> duty<00:00:26.550> what's<00:00:26.910> up<00:00:27.060> with<00:00:27.180> that

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
robot guarding duty what's up with that

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.859 
robot guarding duty what's up with that
we've<00:00:27.660> taken<00:00:28.230> us<00:00:28.500> out<00:00:28.619> there<00:00:29.510> okay<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.570> guys

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
we've taken us out there okay you guys

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.380 
we've taken us out there okay you guys
are<00:00:31.170> stupid<00:00:31.410> as<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.700> I'm<00:00:32.880> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.149> try

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
are stupid as so I'm going to try

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.610 
are stupid as so I'm going to try
to<00:00:33.420> explain<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.440> again<00:00:36.350> these<00:00:37.350> guys

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
to explain it to you again these guys

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.549 
to explain it to you again these guys
are<00:00:37.980> offline<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.700> know<00:00:42.320> your<00:00:43.320> spark<00:00:44.219> is

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
are offline so as you know your spark is

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.790 
are offline so as you know your spark is
contained<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.730> spark<00:00:48.120> housing<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.930> that

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
contained in a spark housing and that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.439 
contained in a spark housing and that
spark<00:00:50.219> housing<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.000> connected<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.989> your<00:00:52.289> body

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
spark housing is connected to your body

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.880 
spark housing is connected to your body
so<00:00:55.460> these<00:00:56.899> Cybertronians<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.289> had<00:00:58.590> their

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
so these Cybertronians have had their

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.599 
so these Cybertronians have had their
spark<00:00:59.309> housings<00:00:59.969> damaged<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.399> when<00:01:02.399> that

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
spark housings damaged and when that

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.500 
spark housings damaged and when that
happens<00:01:03.470> there<00:01:05.810> spark<00:01:06.810> changes<00:01:07.710> back<00:01:08.040> into

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
happens there spark changes back into

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.039 
happens there spark changes back into
rarefied<00:01:09.530> Energon<00:01:11.119> that's<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.540> happened<00:01:12.930> to

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
rarefied Energon that's what happened to

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.469 
rarefied Energon that's what happened to
jazz<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.950> Fallen<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.729> all<00:01:14.970> these<00:01:15.180> guys

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
jazz and the Fallen and all these guys

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.249 
jazz and the Fallen and all these guys
so<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:16.470> are<00:01:16.650> beyond<00:01:17.810> repair

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.469 

Jetfire<00:01:22.259> was<00:01:23.100> able<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> remove<00:01:23.820> his<00:01:24.270> whole

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
Jetfire was able to remove his whole

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.770 
Jetfire was able to remove his whole
spark<00:01:24.900> housing<00:01:25.439> intact<00:01:26.070> from<00:01:26.369> his<00:01:26.640> body<00:01:26.880> so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
spark housing intact from his body so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.139 
spark housing intact from his body so
we're<00:01:28.020> keeping<00:01:28.409> him<00:01:28.439> separate<00:01:29.340> from<00:01:29.939> these

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
we're keeping him separate from these

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.940 
we're keeping him separate from these
guys<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.890> they're<00:01:32.310> beyond<00:01:33.320> repair<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.710> we

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
guys so they're beyond repair but we

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.810 
guys so they're beyond repair but we
still<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.610> guard<00:01:35.880> them<00:01:36.210> why<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.080> that

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
still have to guard them why is that

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.310 
still have to guard them why is that
because<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:40.170> guy<00:01:41.360> hey<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.690> guy<00:01:42.869> looks

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
because of that guy hey that guy looks

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.279 
because of that guy hey that guy looks
like<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.549> guy<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:45.030> killed<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.539> China<00:01:45.869> that's

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
like the guy we killed in China that's

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.249 
like the guy we killed in China that's
demolisher<00:01:47.159> isn't<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.549> if<00:01:47.700> there<00:01:48.659> are<00:01:48.869> two

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
demolisher isn't it if there are two

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.719 
demolisher isn't it if there are two
demolishers<00:01:51.140> how<00:01:52.140> many<00:01:52.520> devastators<00:01:53.520> are

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
demolishers how many devastators are

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.100 
demolishers how many devastators are
there<00:01:54.020> what's<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.289> on<00:01:56.030> okay<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.690> a<00:01:57.810> little

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
there what's going on okay it's a little

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.340 
there what's going on okay it's a little
hard<00:01:58.319> to<00:01:58.500> explain<00:01:58.890> but<00:02:00.380> listen<00:02:01.380> close<00:02:01.619> so

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
hard to explain but listen close so

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.229 
hard to explain but listen close so
there<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.429> only<00:02:05.479> one<00:02:07.069> demolisher<00:02:08.239> there's

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
there is only one demolisher there's

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.059 
there is only one demolisher there's
only<00:02:09.450> one<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:12.150> looks<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:13.110> Decepticons

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
only one it looks like the Decepticons

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.960 
only one it looks like the Decepticons
have<00:02:14.370> been<00:02:14.790> using<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.569> process<00:02:15.870> called

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
have been using a process called

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.259 
have been using a process called
fractioning<00:02:18.019> where<00:02:19.019> they<00:02:19.890> take<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.850> spark<00:02:21.450> of

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
fractioning where they take the spark of

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.890 
fractioning where they take the spark of
cybertronian<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.920> divide<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.690> order<00:02:27.690> to

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
cybertronian and divide it in order to

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.650 
cybertronian and divide it in order to
make<00:02:28.109> more<00:02:29.239> soldiers<00:02:30.239> more<00:02:30.690> warriors<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:32.660> to

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
make more soldiers more warriors and to

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.729 
make more soldiers more warriors and to
do<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.079> they<00:02:34.380> need<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.620> keeper<00:02:35.299> so<00:02:36.560> when<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
do this they need a keeper so when the

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.930 
do this they need a keeper so when the
keeper<00:02:38.160> divides<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.910> spark<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:41.100> abilities

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
keeper divides the spark the abilities

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.470 
keeper divides the spark the abilities
are<00:02:43.070> also<00:02:44.070> divided<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.859> the<00:02:46.970> Cybertronian<00:02:47.970> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
are also divided so the Cybertronian the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.970 
are also divided so the Cybertronian the
Decepticon<00:02:49.200> we<00:02:49.410> killed<00:02:49.739> in<00:02:50.010> China<00:02:50.870> that

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
Decepticon we killed in China that

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.970 
Decepticon we killed in China that
demolisher<00:02:52.980> could<00:02:53.850> not<00:02:54.209> change<00:02:54.980> into

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
demolisher could not change into

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.809 
demolisher could not change into
Devastator

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
Devastator

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.839 
Devastator
and<00:02:57.909> this<00:02:58.390> demolisher<00:02:59.200> here<00:02:59.409> in<00:02:59.530> Egypt<00:02:59.849> could

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
and this demolisher here in Egypt could

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.319 
and this demolisher here in Egypt could
change<00:03:01.659> into<00:03:02.079> Devastator<00:03:02.799> but<00:03:05.849> he<00:03:06.849> probably

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
change into Devastator but he probably

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.220 
change into Devastator but he probably
couldn't<00:03:08.290> change<00:03:08.650> into<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.459> robot<00:03:09.760> or<00:03:10.299> probably

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
couldn't change into a robot or probably

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.770 
couldn't change into a robot or probably
didn't<00:03:11.859> have<00:03:12.069> the<00:03:12.280> memories<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.629> other

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
didn't have the memories of the other

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.059 
didn't have the memories of the other
demolisher<00:03:14.439> so<00:03:14.709> you<00:03:15.670> get<00:03:15.909> another<00:03:17.069> warrior

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
demolisher so you get another warrior

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.770 
demolisher so you get another warrior
another<00:03:18.599> soldier<00:03:19.599> however<00:03:20.549> he<00:03:21.549> is<00:03:21.579> half<00:03:22.269> or<00:03:22.750> a

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
another soldier however he is half or a

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.179 
another soldier however he is half or a
third<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:24.609> original<00:03:25.209> soldier<00:03:25.599> so<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:27.159> a

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:27.189 
third of the original soldier so it is a

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.530 
third of the original soldier so it is a
trade-off<00:03:27.749> so<00:03:28.749> we<00:03:29.079> don't<00:03:29.379> really<00:03:29.650> do<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.540> so

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
trade-off so we don't really do that so

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.000 
trade-off so we don't really do that so
that<00:03:31.930> would<00:03:32.109> explain<00:03:34.109> devastators<00:03:35.109> stupidity

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
that would explain devastators stupidity

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.170 
that would explain devastators stupidity
and<00:03:36.069> why<00:03:36.579> it<00:03:36.639> was<00:03:36.939> all<00:03:37.090> kind<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.449> rare<00:03:39.000> hmm<00:03:40.000> I

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
and why it was all kind of rare hmm I

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.689 
and why it was all kind of rare hmm I
thought<00:03:41.699> the<00:03:42.699> keepers<00:03:43.209> were<00:03:43.449> all<00:03:44.340> killed<00:03:45.340> off

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
thought the keepers were all killed off

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:51.750 
thought the keepers were all killed off
in<00:03:47.730> an<00:03:48.730> attack<00:03:49.389> on<00:03:49.629> Cybertron<00:03:50.439> before<00:03:51.010> even

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
in an attack on Cybertron before even

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.490 
in an attack on Cybertron before even
the<00:03:52.199> Megatron<00:03:53.250> Optimus<00:03:54.250> Prime<00:03:55.199> Civil<00:03:56.199> War

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
the Megatron Optimus Prime Civil War

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.599 
the Megatron Optimus Prime Civil War
started<00:03:57.569> yes<00:03:58.569> we<00:03:58.840> were<00:03:58.959> told<00:03:59.319> that<00:03:59.859> all<00:04:00.459> the

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
started yes we were told that all the

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.999 
started yes we were told that all the
keepers<00:04:01.030> were<00:04:01.239> lost<00:04:01.510> but<00:04:02.049> you<00:04:02.709> have<00:04:02.889> to

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:03.009 
keepers were lost but you have to

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.509 
keepers were lost but you have to
remember<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:05.519> Cybertronian

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
remember that that Cybertronian

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.710 
remember that that Cybertronian
government<00:04:07.470> eventually<00:04:08.470> became<00:04:09.340> the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
government eventually became the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.379 
government eventually became the
Decepticons<00:04:10.720> so<00:04:11.709> why<00:04:12.099> are<00:04:12.159> we<00:04:12.400> worried<00:04:12.939> if<00:04:13.180> the

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
Decepticons so why are we worried if the

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:18.629 
Decepticons so why are we worried if the
Decepticons<00:04:14.229> have<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:15.159> keeper<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.979> keepers

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
Decepticons have a keeper so the keepers

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.390 
Decepticons have a keeper so the keepers
were<00:04:19.539> the<00:04:19.780> ones<00:04:20.109> who<00:04:20.759> used<00:04:21.759> the<00:04:22.509> Allspark

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
were the ones who used the Allspark

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.399 
were the ones who used the Allspark
after<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.699> was<00:04:25.259> recharged<00:04:26.259> by<00:04:26.650> a<00:04:27.580> harvester<00:04:28.449> so

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
after it was recharged by a harvester so

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.060 
after it was recharged by a harvester so
the<00:04:29.680> harvester<00:04:30.250> would<00:04:31.199> extract<00:04:32.199> all<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.949> the

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
the harvester would extract all of the

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.570 
the harvester would extract all of the
energy<00:04:33.570> from<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.840> Sun<00:04:35.289> a<00:04:35.590> star<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:38.130> put<00:04:39.130> it<00:04:39.280> into

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
energy from a Sun a star and put it into

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.870 
energy from a Sun a star and put it into
the<00:04:40.210> Allspark<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.110> inside<00:04:42.009> the<00:04:42.190> Allspark<00:04:42.699> was

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
the Allspark and inside the Allspark was

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.620 
the Allspark and inside the Allspark was
a<00:04:42.909> rarified<00:04:43.719> inner<00:04:44.169> John<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:46.210> keepers

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
a rarified inner John and the keepers

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:53.040 
a rarified inner John and the keepers
would<00:04:46.840> use<00:04:47.169> that<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:49.199> recharge<00:04:50.759> the<00:04:52.050> primes

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
would use that to recharge the primes

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.890 
would use that to recharge the primes
recharge<00:04:53.860> all<00:04:54.250> of<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.610> seekers<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.389> all<00:04:55.659> of

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
recharge all of the seekers and all of

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.460 
recharge all of the seekers and all of
the<00:04:56.110> helpers<00:04:56.650> and<00:04:56.860> workers

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
the helpers and workers

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.390 
the helpers and workers
the<00:04:59.100> keepers<00:04:59.580> like<00:05:00.350> nexus<00:05:01.350> prime<00:05:02.030> would<00:05:03.030> also

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
the keepers like nexus prime would also

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.170 
the keepers like nexus prime would also
convert<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.880> rarefied<00:05:06.780> Energon<00:05:08.180> into

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
convert that rarefied Energon into

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.000 
convert that rarefied Energon into
sparks<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:11.390> take<00:05:12.390> those<00:05:12.720> sparks<00:05:13.260> out<00:05:13.470> of<00:05:13.860> the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
sparks and take those sparks out of the

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.820 
sparks and take those sparks out of the
Allspark<00:05:14.390> put<00:05:15.390> them<00:05:15.510> into<00:05:15.690> spark<00:05:16.200> housings

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
Allspark put them into spark housings

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.270 
Allspark put them into spark housings
put<00:05:17.220> them<00:05:17.340> into<00:05:17.520> bodies<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:18.920> increase<00:05:19.920> the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
put them into bodies and increase the

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.670 
put them into bodies and increase the
number<00:05:20.700> of<00:05:21.200> Cybertronians<00:05:22.220> so<00:05:23.220> if<00:05:23.880> the

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
number of Cybertronians so if the

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.810 
number of Cybertronians so if the
Decepticons<00:05:25.680> have<00:05:26.180> a<00:05:27.180> keeper<00:05:28.070> they<00:05:29.070> might<00:05:29.490> be

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
Decepticons have a keeper they might be

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.560 
Decepticons have a keeper they might be
able<00:05:30.000> to<00:05:30.360> rebuild<00:05:30.780> an<00:05:30.990> army<00:05:32.030> so<00:05:33.030> these<00:05:33.270> guys

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
able to rebuild an army so these guys

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.500 
able to rebuild an army so these guys
are<00:05:34.020> beyond<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:35.010> ratchets<00:05:35.550> ability<00:05:36.240> to

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
are beyond the ratchets ability to

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.410 
are beyond the ratchets ability to
repair<00:05:36.990> but<00:05:37.290> if<00:05:37.920> the<00:05:38.130> Decepticons<00:05:38.820> do<00:05:39.150> have<00:05:39.390> a

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
repair but if the Decepticons do have a

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.020 
repair but if the Decepticons do have a
keeper<00:05:40.200> you<00:05:40.830> know<00:05:40.950> who<00:05:41.130> knows<00:05:41.160> what<00:05:41.700> they<00:05:41.820> can
