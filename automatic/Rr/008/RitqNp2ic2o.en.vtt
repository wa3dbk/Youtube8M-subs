00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
so because they want to I guess they

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.550 
so because they want to I guess they
want<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.549> get<00:02:37.700> more<00:02:38.140> articulation<00:02:39.140> out<00:02:39.349> of<00:02:39.470> it

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
want to get more articulation out of it

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.350 
want to get more articulation out of it
so<00:02:39.769> they<00:02:40.069> kind<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.519> made<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:40.790> part<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.269> it

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
so they kind of made that part of it

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.660 
so they kind of made that part of it
sure<00:02:41.510> like<00:02:41.720> just<00:02:42.079> not<00:02:42.680> attached<00:02:43.129> to<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.489> rest

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.360 
sure like just not attached to the rest
of<00:02:43.849> it<00:02:45.160> it's<00:02:46.160> uh<00:02:47.290> it's<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.560> little<00:02:48.769> faulty<00:02:49.340> I

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
want to add to the realism I guess if

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.870 
want to add to the realism I guess if
you<00:04:07.310> want<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.549> call<00:04:07.729> it<00:04:07.910> it<00:04:08.810> comes<00:04:09.079> with<00:04:09.289> an

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
you want to call it it comes with an

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.130 
you want to call it it comes with an
extra<00:04:10.880> face

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.360

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:46.000 
can or you can do him charging up
charging<00:05:21.650> up<00:05:21.770> for<00:05:22.040> it<00:05:24.940> so<00:05:25.940> yeah

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.480 

he<00:05:47.010> also<00:05:47.190> comes<00:05:47.640> with<00:05:47.790> a<00:05:48.000> couple<00:05:48.360> other<00:05:48.720> hands

he also comes with a couple other hands

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.700 
he also comes with a couple other hands
which<00:05:50.490> my<00:05:51.480> least<00:05:51.720> favorite<00:05:52.200> they're<00:05:52.470> just

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
which my least favorite they're just

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.660 
which my least favorite they're just
more<00:05:53.100> these<00:05:53.400> open<00:05:54.060> palm<00:05:55.130> hands<00:05:56.130> I<00:05:56.220> guess<00:05:56.430> if<00:05:56.640> he

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
more these open palm hands I guess if he

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:05.770 
more these open palm hands I guess if he
wants<00:05:57.030> to<00:05:57.090> just<00:05:57.300> do<00:05:57.540> a<00:05:59.210> gent<00:06:00.230> generate<00:06:02.360> blast

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
all but yeah you you can think of if you

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.240 
all but yeah you you can think of if you
can<00:06:22.020> think<00:06:22.260> of<00:06:22.350> something<00:06:22.740> to<00:06:22.860> do<00:06:22.950> with<00:06:23.070> these

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
can think of something to do with these

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.380 
can think of something to do with these
and<00:06:23.280> more<00:06:23.970> power<00:06:24.240> to<00:06:24.420> you<00:06:24.600> well<00:06:25.470> yeah<00:06:25.770> they're

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
and more power to you well yeah they're

and more power to you well yeah they're
there<00:06:27.390> you<00:06:28.020> can<00:06:28.170> think<00:06:28.410> of<00:06:28.530> so<00:06:28.860> many<00:06:29.270> different

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
there you can think of so many different

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.550 
there you can think of so many different
ways<00:06:30.450> to<00:06:30.870> pose<00:06:31.800> him<00:06:32.100> up<00:06:32.280> so<00:06:32.820> in<00:06:33.120> conclusion

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
ways to pose him up so in conclusion

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.360 
ways to pose him up so in conclusion
this<00:06:34.560> is<00:06:34.920> probably<00:06:35.730> one<00:06:36.030> of<00:06:36.060> the<00:06:36.210> best

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
this is probably one of the best

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.880 
this is probably one of the best

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
pretty much perfected style with

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.020 
pretty much perfected style with
articulation<00:06:44.130> and<00:06:46.280> options<00:06:47.280> with<00:06:47.700> all<00:06:47.880> these

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
articulation and options with all these
