00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 the museum director DEG to build a car for an old BMW Ford engine 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.259
 But we did not know that per kilogram 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.240
 he did not know anything about the money 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.019
 "I've always had the least harmless than sociable Abdennour 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.639
 It is appreciated that way 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.839
 3 4 20 meters Nelson want the airfield in nearby taxes today 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.880
 Herrmann with us a technician Dietmar Gulden cover the guests for the first time 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.929
 after 8 years of construction 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.089
 Nobody knows how the over two-tonne engine is completely over engine 

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:35.089
 Easy to Monster behavior becomes 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
 the maiden voyage with all due care 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.720
 An inferno could break loose when an uncontrolled gas shock 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.970
 Brakes only affect the narrow rear wheels 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.319
 and that makes one 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.319
 paltry 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.990
 the proverbial red on the cannonball 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.810
 one must 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.689
 there must just know you have an engine here with the most extensive 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.620
 that you almost can not imagine so you have to be careful with the clutch 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.590
 Bypass because she needs otherwise and then the accelerator will fall more or less 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.280
 just cancel out the interest of slut by hindering disability 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.650
 then laces the vehicle on incursions 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.700
 only a coarse wire net protects the crew in front of the huge Schuon 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.330
 disc 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.730
 In the early thirties, the 47-meter bmw engine is installed in the aircraft 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.760
 every tenth has almost four liters of displacement 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.390
 the 57 hp and the engine draws at 1000 700 crankshaft revolutions from the 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.090
 sleeve 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.410
 already at the second start attempt is good East Styrian 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.179
 many banks the tank is still almost full despite an estimated 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:09.940
 consumption 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.670
 from about the tenants 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.230
 Per kilometer Lyre and Guldental need screws 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.029
 Robin Dutt stays 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.259
 they wanted another try 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.329
 the product worlds 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.299
 then you would have to know this year the museum director the beast itself 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.299
 call 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:52.249
 but the otherwise daring museum chief terrifies the monstrous 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.179
 power 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.179
 then it follows that is unthinkable 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.379
 previously St 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.840
 from the road overturned another with a tractor pulling that was 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.919
 is included 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.369
 and approach would make clutch more or less 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.049
 and that goes at 1140 59 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.559
 McCourt was fleeing his catch of persecution 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.119
 through virtual 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.479
 Richemont are 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.809
 Not even Brutus keeps his elemental force standing the wave pumping the water 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:24.669
 Drive this demolished 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.069
 and so is now by after a messed up but impressive 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.709
 Appearance in the museum disappear
