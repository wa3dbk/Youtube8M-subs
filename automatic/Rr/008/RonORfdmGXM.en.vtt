00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
 i 

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.630
 according to scientists our solar system 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.940
 it was formed 4,600 million years ago the 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.330
 life arose 1500 million years 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.889
 later and 24 years ago AdriÃ¡n was born 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.889
 ceviche morel 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:28.640
 the fire rolls the penicillin the 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:32.509
 automobile the most potatoes the bulb the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.329
 internet the vanilla cocacola 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.550
 they have all these elements in common and 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.550
 each of them have contributed in 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.769
 smaller or greater measure to the welfare and 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.070
 development of what we know today as 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:49.370
 modern civilization so come with me 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.089
 Well I'm going to put it full to see 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.699
 the information there are three theories in 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.129
 around the discovery of fire one of 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.110
 they the first one talks about the impact of a 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.199
 lightning on the branch of a tree which 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.340
 unleashed a fire that dazzled everything 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.869
 be prehistoric that lived there 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.909
 there is a second theory around 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.700
 discovery of the fire was a 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.170
 volcanic eruption whose lava incinerated already 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.920
 ended the life of thousands of beings 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.560
 tiny 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.290
 according to scientists it is known as the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.130
 first great roast beef organized by 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.590
 God 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.570
 There is a third theory around 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.950
 discovery of the town that few people 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.590
 knows and is that in 1981 with the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.960
 launch of the album game the group 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.829
 often from the world to its fans integrated 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.439
 by johnny lozada 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.539
 ricky martin who included his tremendous 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.240
 homosexuality and has a relationship with 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.640
 rebecca de alba carajo own the truth 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.710
 and you wonder what were the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.569
 main benefits that the name 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.929
 got with the discovery of 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.780
 fire 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.970
 inlet could boil the water which 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.880
 made it much more drinkable by eliminating 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.799
 bacteria those smoke signals served 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.560
 also as development of the first 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.360
 communication systems lighting 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.489
 in the dark 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.450
 they also used fire to defend themselves 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.030
 of nearby tribes attacking 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.480
 so too but more important 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.420
 It is probably that the first beings 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.360
 prehistoric could cook their 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.420
 food everything they used to eat raw 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.360
 now they ate it cooked though 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.760
 currently there are those who prefer to follow 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.110
 you are eating it raw like ricky martin 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.170
 who hid his tremendous sexuality 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.870
 recurring organic there is another 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.019
 invention that is probably the most 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.599
 has transformed for good to the 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.690
 civilization we are talking about the 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:55.680
 roll if those chips so tasty that 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.099
 love the gift in 950 version 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.470
 grams consell and it is very tasty in 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.470
 the recess in the cooperative of the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.760
 school only 750 you will take some 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.189
 good chips 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.810
 among the innumerable advantages that 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.959
 brought with it the invention of the wheel 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:18.310
 you find the creation of the pulley 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:21.849
 who along with this helped a lot in 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.730
 construction work and also this way of 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.440
 architecture and your pulleys with people 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.480
 good but not everything was honey about 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.610
 flaps around the invention of the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.530
 wheel is said that along with the 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.200
 development of this magnificent artifact 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.810
 also what we know today as 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.870
 the bullying and is that the mother of the creator 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.299
 of the wheel was a fucking cool it was already 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.099
 loose that pinche wheel pinche wheel 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.209
 my son is not going to feed you 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:53.579
 altea collect fruits start reading the 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.579
 click my son's love code 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.859
 it's a shame the time is over 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.980
 but if you liked that I put it all 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.790
 complete the information we see here 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.790
 next week
