00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.430
 sure if good morning then today I'm here 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.529
 to ask you for advice because today 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.589
 I should have published according to mine 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.460
 mental ladder the video on barcelona 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:14.879
 because I have been to barcelona has me 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.890
 made a blog type but I found myself 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.140
 today as is happening 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.870
 lately without having mounted it 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.670
 video so I decided it was 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.090
 the time has come to make this video 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.650
 which in reality obviously from a bit of 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.780
 ask you advice i need to 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.369
 I advise then to play a point 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.510
 of my existence 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.370
 rather complicated rather difficult 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.120
 there have been changes there will be 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.489
 of changes in the coming period that 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.829
 I am a very anxious person 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.840
 suffering and the last period 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.860
 crossed strong period of crisis with 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.780
 myself because I have not done for years and 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.820
 years and years for all my life in 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.530
 reality the account with a part of me and 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.579
 then I found myself facing 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.170
 all together things with my brain that 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.130
 I had left pending so it was 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.659
 a rather intense period for me 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.310
 to me 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.050
 in any case only a little distressed 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.060
 you can see from my fa 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.310
 face suffering then what they are 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.720
 here to ask you today I need 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.740
 look at my channel from outside i have 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.300
 need to watch what i am 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.220
 doing on youtube from outside and then I have 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.320
 need your advice lately 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.670
 the channel is not going well is not 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.060
 going in the direction I want 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.520
 that goes in the sense that I am little me 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.940
 I apply little and therefore produce videos 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.800
 also of little doubt content 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.899
 interesting perhaps even in part 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.789
 surely with discontinuity because 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.560
 jump weeks then I put two then not 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.330
 receive disappear for a while, in short, is 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.920
 that this is not something that is good for 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.569
 channel 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.890
 on the other side there is also see 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.420
 very little participation by 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.429
 yours therefore means that the contents 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.890
 which public does not involve you and does not involve you 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.170
 I care at least I believe 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.910
 ok because there is a public video 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.369
 few visualizations with respect to those 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.259
 that they were kneaded and above all to 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.030
 few comments that are the things that I do 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.340
 they care more if you don't feel like it 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.560
 to comment and give me your opinion 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.800
 on this on what I know that 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.210
 you saw asking today is from 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.370
 advise me in which direction to go 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.860
 in the past I have also given you launched 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.210
 I have proposed things to you 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.830
 I don't want to do this this time 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.620
 I would really like it to start with you 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.650
 made to say you do this to me rather 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.230
 that I would like to see this 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.480
 I wouldn't like to see this anymore 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.950
 another thing I would like criticism of me 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.690
 would really like me to do some 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.300
 constructive criticism of course because 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.330
 those on infamous are of no use 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.800
 I would like to know from you what is not there 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.260
 like more than me or what never is 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.880
 liked it or what you don't like 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.550
 now so I can improve if I do 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.310
 video if I publish videos if only on 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.930
 youtube they are partly for me because it is 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.570
 one thing that I enjoy doing 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.430
 I like it and I'm passionate about it too 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.110
 to create interesting content for 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.520
 you therefore if these contents not only 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.050
 more interesting if you don't like it anymore 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.790
 how am I if you don't like what anymore 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.430
 I'm doing so 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.770
 in short, tell me that it is very clearly 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.330
 so that I can evaluate the 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.709
 situation and even look at me with a 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.690
 external eye that always a very thing 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:26.130
 useful and redirect let's say 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.530
 direct me to take back the 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.730
 channel so beautifully 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.900
 for you too 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.200
 so yes, in short, I'm asking you to 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.519
 advise me which way to go e 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.769
 to criticize what does not live and of myself 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.080
 of the channel sorry if I'm a bit like that 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.549
 dark I don't feel a bit grim because 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.450
 something tough happened this morning 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:53.700
 and then over a period of 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.830
 sentimental mental upheavals 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.870
 a disaster a disaster I do not know if it is a 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.700
 disaster there are sometimes changes 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.800
 the changes are shocking 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.230
 hoping you can lose 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.240
 lose, indeed, give me because they knew 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.340
 plus a big gift you give me 5 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.230
 minutes of your time today when 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.990
 see this video to write me a 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.880
 comment that it can't be useful 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.090
 I greet you and go to the next video 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.090
