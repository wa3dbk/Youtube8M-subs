00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
estimate DOB would have been a lot nicer

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:25.580 
estimate DOB would have been a lot nicer
let's<00:03:08.000> try<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:08.420> tune<00:03:09.079> this<00:03:09.260> end

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
the other Phillips one you can see the

the other Phillips one you can see the
speaker<00:03:32.500> in<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:32.799> probably<00:03:33.340> will<00:03:33.519> not<00:03:33.700> be<00:03:33.819> as

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
speaker in this probably will not be as

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:42.240 
speaker in this probably will not be as
good<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:40.140> change<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.349> setting<00:03:41.769> which<00:03:42.099> I

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
good to change the setting which I

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:50.819 
good to change the setting which I
think's<00:03:42.670> on<00:03:42.790> this<00:03:42.939> side<00:03:43.120> yet<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:50.500> volumes

think's on this side yet the volumes
down<00:03:51.010> here<00:03:51.159> isn't<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:57.209> also<00:03:58.209> let<00:03:58.599> this<00:03:58.690> two

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
down here isn't it also let this two

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.699 
down here isn't it also let this two
settings<00:03:59.290> for<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.650> brightness<00:04:00.190> that's<00:04:01.120> high

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
settings for the brightness that's high

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.860 
settings for the brightness that's high
that's<00:04:02.709> low<00:04:02.920> pretty<00:04:03.730> constant<00:04:04.030> as<00:04:04.090> well<00:04:04.239> on

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
that's low pretty constant as well on

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.929 
that's low pretty constant as well on
the<00:04:04.989> video<00:04:05.230> but<00:04:05.470> in<00:04:06.189> the<00:04:06.459> pitch<00:04:06.609> black<00:04:06.639> and

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:06.939 
the video but in the pitch black and

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:20.909 
the video but in the pitch black and
neither<00:04:07.060> can<00:04:07.359> make<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.569> lot<00:04:07.720> of<00:04:07.750> difference<00:04:19.919> yes

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
neither can make a lot of difference yes

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:21.960 
neither can make a lot of difference yes
I<00:04:21.070> seems<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.370> be<00:04:21.459> running<00:04:21.579> all<00:04:21.789> right

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
I seems to be running all right

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.629 
I seems to be running all right
and<00:04:23.009> throughout<00:04:24.009> someone<00:04:24.310> use<00:04:24.430> it<00:04:24.550> because

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
and throughout someone use it because

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.350 
and throughout someone use it because
the<00:04:24.820> speaking<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.389> iPhones<00:04:25.750> are<00:04:25.870> actually

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:40.730 

listen<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.449> this

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.900 

so<00:04:41.740> it's<00:04:41.889> a<00:04:41.919> bit<00:04:42.040> more<00:04:42.130> bass<00:04:42.310> in<00:04:42.340> this<00:04:42.550> one<00:04:42.730> but

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
so it's a bit more bass in this one but

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.730 
so it's a bit more bass in this one but
you<00:04:42.940> know<00:04:43.120> I'll<00:04:43.270> hopefully<00:04:44.110> work<00:04:44.410> in<00:04:44.530> just<00:04:44.680> the

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
you know I'll hopefully work in just the

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.230 
you know I'll hopefully work in just the
radio<00:04:44.980> that<00:04:45.130> we<00:04:45.220> find<00:04:45.430> but<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.610> dual<00:04:45.760> arms<00:04:45.910> not

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
radio that we find but the dual arms not

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.810 
radio that we find but the dual arms not
and<00:04:47.110> so<00:04:47.740> there<00:04:47.889> we<00:04:47.949> go<00:04:47.979> you<00:04:48.130> can<00:04:48.250> see<00:04:48.520> it<00:04:48.550> nice

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
and so there we go you can see it nice

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.420 
and so there we go you can see it nice
mirror<00:04:49.120> effect<00:04:49.449> I<00:04:49.690> won't<00:04:50.560> last<00:04:50.770> long<00:04:51.040> I<00:04:51.220> tell
