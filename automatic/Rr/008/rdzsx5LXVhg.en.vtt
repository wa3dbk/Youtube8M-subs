contemporary is this little switch gear
right<00:02:28.930> here<00:02:29.230> which<00:02:29.530> changes<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.099> from<00:02:30.700> two

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
right here which changes it from two

what<00:02:33.700> that's<00:02:33.909> plastic<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.629> go<00:02:35.290> figure<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:38.230> is

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
what that's plastic to go figure this is

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.559 
what that's plastic to go figure this is
a<00:02:38.409> beautiful<00:02:38.920> interior<00:02:39.239> lots<00:02:40.239> of<00:02:40.389> nice<00:02:40.540> stuff

roughly<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:50.430> component<00:02:51.430> here<00:02:52.349> it<00:02:53.349> hits<00:02:53.530> my

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
roughly this component here it hits my

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.309 
roughly this component here it hits my
knee<00:02:53.769> right<00:02:54.400> here<00:02:54.609> makes<00:02:55.480> my<00:02:55.599> leg<00:02:55.870> jerk<00:02:56.139> around

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319

smack my knee against this it causes a

I think Roma's only has four and yes I
do<00:03:20.470> fit<00:03:21.099> but<00:03:21.340> barely<00:03:21.669> there<00:03:22.239> is<00:03:22.419> not<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.720> lot<00:03:22.959> of

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
do fit but barely there is not a lot of

because<00:03:25.299> obviously<00:03:25.780> this<00:03:26.169> one's<00:03:26.440> trail<00:03:26.739> rated

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
because obviously this one's trail rated

because obviously this one's trail rated
so<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.280> want<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:27.609> have<00:03:27.729> some<00:03:27.879> ground

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
so you want to have some ground

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.140 
so you want to have some ground
clearance<00:03:28.379> and<00:03:29.379> the<00:03:29.680> sea<00:03:29.889> of<00:03:30.129> black<00:03:30.400> continues

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
bit more and modern a little bit more oh

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.730 
bit more and modern a little bit more oh
gosh<00:03:37.139> interesting<00:03:38.139> I<00:03:38.199> guess<00:03:38.349> will<00:03:38.500> be<00:03:38.530> award

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.070 

lots<00:03:42.740> of<00:03:42.890> good<00:03:43.070> storage<00:03:43.370> in<00:03:43.610> this<00:03:43.730> thing<00:03:44.080> it's

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
lots of good storage in this thing it's

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.020 
lots of good storage in this thing it's
not<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.560> true<00:03:45.830> off-road<00:03:46.250> vehicle<00:03:46.730> so<00:03:46.850> there's

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
not a true off-road vehicle so there's

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.000 
not a true off-road vehicle so there's
no<00:03:47.150> solid<00:03:47.540> axle<00:03:47.900> underneath<00:03:48.320> there's<00:03:48.680> no<00:03:48.800> leaf

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
no solid axle underneath there's no leaf

no solid axle underneath there's no leaf
springs<00:03:49.310> or<00:03:49.430> any<00:03:49.520> silliness<00:03:49.910> like<00:03:50.090> that

springs or any silliness like that

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.150

there's<00:03:51.200> plenty<00:03:51.350> of<00:03:51.500> space<00:03:51.830> it's<00:03:52.070> a

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
there's plenty of space it's a

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.780 
there's plenty of space it's a
relatively<00:03:52.610> low<00:03:53.240> load<00:03:53.780> in<00:03:53.960> and<00:03:54.310> for<00:03:55.310> me<00:03:55.430> I

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
relatively low load in and for me I

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.430 
relatively low load in and for me I
could<00:03:56.360> actually<00:03:56.480> have<00:03:56.720> a<00:03:56.750> siesta<00:03:57.170> in<00:03:57.230> here

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
could actually have a siesta in here

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.040 
could actually have a siesta in here
it's<00:03:58.130> roomy<00:03:58.490> it's<00:03:58.700> practical

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.990 

all<00:04:05.050> right<00:04:05.140> Nathan<00:04:05.319> I<00:04:06.190> don't<00:04:06.610> know<00:04:06.760> how<00:04:06.849> many

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
all right Nathan I don't know how many

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.330 
all right Nathan I don't know how many
comments<00:04:07.360> I've<00:04:07.510> now<00:04:07.690> answer<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.680> date<00:04:08.950> why

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
comments I've now answer the date why

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.010 
comments I've now answer the date why
are<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.610> time<00:04:09.880> so<00:04:10.120> slow<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:10.750> reason<00:04:10.989> for

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
are you time so slow and the reason for

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.320 
are you time so slow and the reason for
that<00:04:11.200> is<00:04:11.500> we're<00:04:12.069> at<00:04:12.220> high<00:04:12.400> altitude<00:04:13.030> a<00:04:13.150> mile

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
that is we're at high altitude a mile

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.479 
that is we're at high altitude a mile
above<00:04:13.599> sea<00:04:13.660> level<00:04:14.010> actually<00:04:15.010> more<00:04:15.160> than<00:04:15.310> that

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
above sea level actually more than that

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.370 
above sea level actually more than that
and<00:04:15.760> because<00:04:16.209> of<00:04:16.239> that<00:04:16.389> it's<00:04:16.750> very<00:04:16.840> difficult

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
and because of that it's very difficult

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.750 
and because of that it's very difficult
for<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.590> vehicle<00:04:17.919> to<00:04:18.010> get<00:04:18.130> air<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.459> order<00:04:18.639> to

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
for the vehicle to get air in order to

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.520 
for the vehicle to get air in order to
create<00:04:18.970> combustion<00:04:19.570> so<00:04:19.810> it's<00:04:19.930> something<00:04:20.380> that

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
create combustion so it's something that

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.330 
create combustion so it's something that
slows<00:04:20.889> it<00:04:21.010> down

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
slows it down

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.010 
slows it down
all<00:04:21.489> right<00:04:21.579> ready<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:21.940> go<00:04:21.970> yep<00:04:22.300> okay<00:04:22.780> tap
