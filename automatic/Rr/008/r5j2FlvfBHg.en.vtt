00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.090
 the treatment of Crohn 's disease 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.820
 and ulcerative colitis changes 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.060
 constantly in fact if we compare 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.789
 our guide our tips today in 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.369
 the 2014 with which we gave 4 5 or 6 ago 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.869
 years would be completely different and 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.880
 the treatment changes to all 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.589
 levels since from the most cases 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.419
 simple to the most complex cases like this 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:36.020
 the trend the recommendations 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.420
 Current changes would include changes 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.180
 simpler mesalazine treatments than 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.310
 we use a lot in ulcerative colitis 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.690
 always use them at high doses all 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.300
 the pills or all the envelopes 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.060
 used dice in the morning as dosage 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.800
 only using mesalazine 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.440
 also rectally via topical 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.970
 to improve the results and 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.100
 keeping patients with doses 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.490
 high also this is something that makes 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.530
 I insist a few years ago we did not 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.400
 we also use differently 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.710
 immunosuppressants or immunomodulators 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.930
 for example we are recovering the use 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.150
 of methotrexate in Crohn's disease a 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.850
 drug that we use a lot in 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.530
 inflammatory rheumatology as well 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.630
 in crohn's disease we knew it was 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.870
 effective but its use is becoming widespread 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.750
 now in recent years 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.610
 also in the group of steroid 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.800
 cortisone and similar drugs 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.470
 we know that systemic steroids 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.460
 have harmful side effects that 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.550
 we try to avoid and this has led to 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.950
 development of steroids that although it 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.470
 give orally its effect be local 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.390
 localized system and affect very 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.210
 little bit to the rest of the organism and there 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.190
 we have very well positioned budesonide 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.400
 in crohn's disease and the 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.680
 beclomethasone ulcerative colitis and for 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.810
 last in biological therapy which is the 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.780
 most powerful weapons that we have today in 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.050
 day we are not only learning to 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.790
 optimize the use of infliximab and adelino 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.730
 map in crohn's disease and colitis 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.610
 ulcerative measuring drug levels 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.020
 measuring the presence of antibodies 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.450
 learning when we have to intensify 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.060
 or increase the dose or when we can 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.920
 reduce it or even suspend them 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.720
 and I think it's important to mention and 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.090
 I think it's cause for joy for all 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.349
 the arrival of new drugs every time 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.090
 we have new options for 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.489
 treatment and there they are 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.250
 umap dollis that can be sure will be a 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.630
 excellent drug in both chrome and 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.630
 in ulcerative colitis I would say that 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.390
 especially in ulcerative colitis or 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.340
 golimumab therefore I believe that the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.959
 patients with Crohn's disease with 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.780
 ulcerative colitis us doctors 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.900
 that we serve them we have many reasons 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.970
 of satisfaction because the treatment and 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.819
 the way to handle each of these 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.739
 cases that must be very individualized 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.299
 there is no 'custom-made suit' there is no 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.120
 coffee for everyone must be a suit to 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.299
 measure for each patient so I insist 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.569
 the options are getting better and better 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.430
 and this I'm sure will result in a 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.940
 better care of our patients than 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.940
 is what we want
