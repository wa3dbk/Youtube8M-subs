right foot left foot right foot left
foot<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.940> sometimes<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.629> kind<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.870> easier

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
foot but sometimes it's kind of easier

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.250 
foot but sometimes it's kind of easier
holding<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.890> someone's<00:00:50.430> hand<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.260> if

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
holding like someone's hand and if

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.420 
holding like someone's hand and if
you're<00:00:52.469> doing<00:00:52.590> what<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> person<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.340> you

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you're doing what the person that you

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.639 
you're doing what the person that you
know<00:00:53.640> or<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.149> they<00:00:54.329> know<00:00:54.510> how<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> do<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.079> it's

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
know or like they know how to do it it's

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.229 
know or like they know how to do it it's
kind<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.949> easier<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:56.489> they<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.850> keep

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
kind of easier because they kind of keep

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.240 
kind of easier because they kind of keep
you<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> rhythm<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.890> know<00:00:58.980> show

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you in the rhythm and like you know show

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.910 
you in the rhythm and like you know show
you<00:00:59.309> exactly<00:00:59.699> how<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.000> start<00:01:00.960> off<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.440> how

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
you exactly how you start off and how

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.369 
you exactly how you start off and how
how<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.149> done<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.480> guess<00:01:03.809> so

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
how it's really done I guess so

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.140 
how it's really done I guess so
sometimes<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.280> easier<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:06.060> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
sometimes it's easier to do that just to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.700 
sometimes it's easier to do that just to
keep<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> rhythm<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.200> now<00:01:07.380> we're<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.650> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
keep the rhythm so now we're going to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.050 
keep the rhythm so now we're going to
show<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.950> how<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.729> done

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
show you how it's done

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.600 
show you how it's done
with<00:01:09.810> some<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> music<00:01:10.860> because<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
with some of the music because it is a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.130 
with some of the music because it is a
lot<00:01:11.850> easier<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.390> music<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:12.960> then

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
lot easier with the music because then

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.380 
lot easier with the music because then
you<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> little<00:01:13.770> beat<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:15.299> we

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you get a little beat going so here we

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:33.499 
you get a little beat going so here we
go<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.740> some<00:01:32.070> people<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:33.180> do<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.450> a

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
go and some people like to do like a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.540 
go and some people like to do like a
little

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
little

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.710 
little
body<00:01:34.730> turn<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:35.720> it<00:01:35.840> kind<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.200> like<00:01:36.350> this<00:01:36.560> and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
body turn so it kind of like this and

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.110 
body turn so it kind of like this and
usually<00:01:38.770> it's<00:01:39.770> just<00:01:39.950> you're<00:01:40.460> doing<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.790> exact

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
usually it's just you're doing the exact

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.220 
usually it's just you're doing the exact
same<00:01:41.420> steps<00:01:41.720> okay<00:01:42.400> but<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:43.580> are<00:01:43.820> doing<00:01:44.230> bigger

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
same steps okay but you are doing bigger

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.100 
same steps okay but you are doing bigger
like<00:01:45.650> bigger<00:01:45.950> steps<00:01:48.610> it's<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.790> exact<00:01:50.060> same

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
like bigger steps it's the exact same

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:59.890 
like bigger steps it's the exact same
concept<00:01:51.110> you're<00:01:51.590> just<00:01:51.740> doing<00:01:58.540> some<00:01:59.540> ways<00:01:59.720> to

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
concept you're just doing some ways to

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.800 
concept you're just doing some ways to
do<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:01.040> actually<00:02:01.310> have<00:02:01.730> to<00:02:01.940> do<00:02:02.090> the

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
do it and I actually have to do the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.430 
do it and I actually have to do the
chunga<00:02:03.230> Changa<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:04.840> easier<00:02:05.840> than<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.110> cumbia

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
chunga Changa is easier than the cumbia
