00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.750
 about this video we will look at 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.660
 advanced facility common 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.900
 light source this object existed 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.969
 and earlier versions of archicados but 18 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.469
 version it has been completely redesigned as 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.469
 and all other light sources 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.050
 the main changes are 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.910
 next previous versions of archicados 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.460
 common light source allowed to create 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.919
 only clear shadows 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.410
 this limitation is essentially a fairy tale for 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.329
 realistic visualization as shadows 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.440
 in fact almost never 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.480
 are clear 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.170
 their contours are usually more or less 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.719
 blurred 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.329
 starting from step 1 of 18 all objects 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.399
 light sources and fixtures allow 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.370
 create realistic shadows usually 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.789
 called shading area when it is 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.610
 is about 3d visualization given 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.769
 The image was created in the archive from 18 s. 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.680
 using the visualization mechanism 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.299
 blue render when compared with the previous one 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.670
 visualization can be noted the following 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.470
 difference 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.930
 shadow cast located in 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.090
 center of morphs it consists of two parts and 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.090
 with a clear ones carry slightly blurred edges 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.490
 and one more appearing as a result 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.490
 reflections of light from the walls and ceiling 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.790
 on the left wall we can see another one 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.520
 interesting effect upper shadow borders 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.530
 It looks almost clear while 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.530
 the left and the border is slightly blurry 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.080
 when palm 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.370
 Shadow area parameters common 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.430
 the light source also has other 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.380
 settings and effects similar 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.100
 other sources present 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.140
 lighting 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.260
 also as units 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.290
 lighting brightness can be used as 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.729
 lumen and so and gander all listed 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.490
 changes make a common source 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.680
 lighting the perfect tool 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.450
 stage lighting allows you to imitate 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.450
 color of real fixtures
