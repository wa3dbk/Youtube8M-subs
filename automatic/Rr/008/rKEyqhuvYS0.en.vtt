00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
such simple commands it's not really

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.340 
such simple commands it's not really
useful<00:01:19.830> however<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.780> commands

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
useful however you can have one commands

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.649 
useful however you can have one commands
for<00:01:23.040> example<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.390> pretty

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
for example this one here is pretty

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.330 
for example this one here is pretty
complicated<00:01:25.310> it's<00:01:26.310> still<00:01:26.640> short<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.299> well

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
complicated it's still short but well

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.130 
complicated it's still short but well
what<00:01:29.340> happens<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.060> forget<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.750> bracket

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
what happens if you forget this bracket

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.069 
what happens if you forget this bracket
here<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.790> see<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.390> gets<00:01:33.720> highlighted

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
here as you can see it gets highlighted

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.980 
here as you can see it gets highlighted
in<00:01:34.650> gray<00:01:35.070> however<00:01:35.850> without<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> mode<00:01:36.720> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
in gray however without the mode you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.630 
in gray however without the mode you
won't<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.350> able<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.560> see<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.220> you'd<00:01:38.460> have

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
won't be able to see it and you'd have

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.340 
won't be able to see it and you'd have
to<00:01:38.939> search<00:01:39.210> for<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.509> manually<00:01:41.600> now<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.659> also

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
to search for it manually now we also

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.550 
to search for it manually now we also
have<00:01:43.860> those<00:01:44.670> commands<00:01:45.119> right<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.810> which<00:01:46.409> are

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
have those commands right here which are

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.800 
have those commands right here which are
pretty<00:01:46.759> pretty<00:01:47.759> long<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.920> yeah<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.390> as<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
pretty pretty long and yeah so as you

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.630 
pretty pretty long and yeah so as you
can<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.439> where<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.920> mod<00:01:53.100> actually

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
can see this is where the mod actually

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
can see this is where the mod actually
becomes<00:01:54.479> extremely<00:01:55.200> useful<00:01:56.990> now<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.469> just

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
becomes extremely useful now if we just

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.560 
becomes extremely useful now if we just
go<00:01:59.070> around<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.670> here<00:02:00.030> somewhere

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
go around in here somewhere

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.200 
go around in here somewhere
yes<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.320> here<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.130> see<00:02:02.430> at<00:02:02.640> entities

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
yes and here as you can see at entities

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.050 
yes and here as you can see at entities
lectures<00:02:03.689> they<00:02:04.020> also<00:02:04.259> get<00:02:04.799> selected<00:02:05.610> or

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
lectures they also get selected or

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.990 
lectures they also get selected or
highlighted<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:08.220> see<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.610> something

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
highlighted and you can see if something

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.320 
highlighted and you can see if something
is<00:02:09.090> wrong

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330

going<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.400> be<00:02:15.520> in<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.790> description<00:02:15.910> as<00:02:16.510> well

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
going to be in the description as well

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.870 
going to be in the description as well
as<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:17.200> all<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.620> other<00:02:17.650> resources<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.550> tools

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
as for all the other resources and tools

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.540 
as for all the other resources and tools
and<00:02:19.180> now<00:02:19.720> it's<00:02:19.930> time<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.440> move<00:02:20.650> on<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.220> number

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
and now it's time to move on to number

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.360 
and now it's time to move on to number
two<00:02:22.000> at<00:02:22.240> number<00:02:22.840> 2<00:02:23.050> we<00:02:23.290> have<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.770> Jason

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
two at number 2 we have the Jason

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.610 
two at number 2 we have the Jason
generator<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.050> something<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.470> I

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
generator and this is something that I

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.650 
generator and this is something that I
have<00:02:26.830> been<00:02:26.860> using<00:02:27.220> for<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.700> long<00:02:27.910> time<00:02:28.210> now<00:02:28.480> and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
have been using for a long time now and

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.560 
have been using for a long time now and
it's<00:02:29.140> very<00:02:29.350> useful<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.520> its<00:02:30.670> main<00:02:30.880> purpose<00:02:31.120> is

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
it's very useful so its main purpose is

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.140 
it's very useful so its main purpose is
to<00:02:31.600> generate<00:02:32.260> colored<00:02:32.860> text<00:02:33.370> which<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.940> can

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
to generate colored text which you can

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.710 
to generate colored text which you can
click<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.930> do<00:02:35.650> actions<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:36.970> for<00:02:37.270> example

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
click on and do actions so for example

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.840 
click on and do actions so for example
let's<00:02:37.960> do<00:02:38.820> something<00:02:39.820> like<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:41.940> 5<00:02:43.020> tools<00:02:44.020> and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
let's do something like this 5 tools and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.850 
let's do something like this 5 tools and
resources<00:02:45.850> for<00:02:47.400> command<00:02:48.400> block<00:02:49.050> map<00:02:50.050> makers<00:02:50.590> I

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
resources for command block map makers I

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.400 
resources for command block map makers I
think<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.610> title<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:52.000> going<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.360> be<00:02:52.600> this<00:02:53.050> but

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
think the title is going to be this but

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.930 
think the title is going to be this but
it<00:02:53.530> might<00:02:53.709> be<00:02:53.860> different<00:02:54.100> because<00:02:54.490> I'm<00:02:54.790> not

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
it might be different because I'm not

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.610 
it might be different because I'm not
sure<00:02:55.240> yet<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:57.370> we're<00:02:57.910> going<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.660> just<00:02:59.110> select

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
sure yet and we're going to just select

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.199 
sure yet and we're going to just select
it<00:03:00.160> with<00:03:00.910> both<00:03:01.300> let's<00:03:02.140> see<00:03:02.670> how<00:03:03.670> about<00:03:03.910> gold

a website by jagneauxs so he has a lot
of<00:04:57.280> command<00:04:57.610> block<00:04:57.790> generators<00:04:58.479> and<00:04:58.750> he<00:04:59.050> also

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
of command block generators and he also

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.050 
of command block generators and he also
has<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.620> lot<00:04:59.860> of<00:05:00.010> command<00:05:00.310> MOOC<00:05:00.430> tutorials

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.170 
has a lot of command MOOC tutorials
basically<00:05:01.840> resources<00:05:02.800> for<00:05:03.310> command<00:05:03.669> box<00:05:03.880> and

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
basically resources for command box and

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.600 
basically resources for command box and
in<00:05:05.140> case<00:05:05.350> you<00:05:05.470> don't<00:05:05.620> know<00:05:05.770> about<00:05:05.890> his<00:05:06.190> channel

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
in case you don't know about his channel

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
just dragna's and he also has auto

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.430 
just dragna's and he also has auto
comment<00:05:11.710> box<00:05:11.919> tutorials<00:05:12.580> for<00:05:12.880> that<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:13.479> yes

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440

so<00:05:14.740> what<00:05:15.010> do<00:05:15.100> we<00:05:15.160> have<00:05:15.370> here<00:05:15.790> for<00:05:15.970> example

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
so what do we have here for example

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.210 
so what do we have here for example
you've<00:05:16.720> got<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:17.140> mob<00:05:17.290> generator<00:05:17.770> banner

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
you've got the mob generator banner

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.880 
you've got the mob generator banner
generator<00:05:18.990> custom<00:05:19.990> head<00:05:20.229> walk<00:05:20.470> generator

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
generator custom head walk generator

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.440 
generator custom head walk generator
this<00:05:21.160> is<00:05:21.310> something<00:05:21.729> that<00:05:21.760> I<00:05:21.940> have<00:05:22.150> used

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
this is something that I have used

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.320 
this is something that I have used
before<00:05:22.690> by<00:05:23.200> the<00:05:23.229> way<00:05:23.380> for<00:05:24.250> one<00:05:24.490> of<00:05:24.610> my<00:05:24.760> projects

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
before by the way for one of my projects

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.190 
before by the way for one of my projects
but<00:05:25.660> it's<00:05:26.290> not<00:05:26.950> done<00:05:27.220> yet<00:05:27.250> maybe<00:05:28.090> to<00:05:28.390> be<00:05:28.600> done

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
but it's not done yet maybe to be done

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.560 
but it's not done yet maybe to be done
in<00:05:29.440> the<00:05:29.560> future<00:05:29.740> but<00:05:30.250> for<00:05:30.280> now<00:05:30.640> it's<00:05:30.940> just<00:05:31.210> on

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
in the future but for now it's just on

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.350 
in the future but for now it's just on
hold<00:05:34.020> anyways<00:05:35.130> let's<00:05:36.130> move<00:05:36.280> on<00:05:36.520> to<00:05:36.880> the<00:05:37.180> last

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
hold anyways let's move on to the last

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.159 
hold anyways let's move on to the last
one<00:05:37.630> and<00:05:38.370> was<00:05:39.370> but<00:05:39.640> at<00:05:39.820> least<00:05:40.030> this<00:05:40.780> one<00:05:41.020> is

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
one and was but at least this one is

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.860 
one and was but at least this one is
especially<00:05:41.380> useful<00:05:41.950> for<00:05:42.250> map

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
especially useful for map

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.080 
especially useful for map
which<00:05:43.320> like<00:05:43.680> to<00:05:43.890> make<00:05:44.070> adventure<00:05:44.580> maps<00:05:44.790> and

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
which like to make adventure maps and

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.780 
which like to make adventure maps and
other<00:05:45.360> complicated<00:05:46.260> maps<00:05:46.590> it<00:05:47.460> is<00:05:47.820> MC<00:05:48.750> as<00:05:48.960> it<00:05:49.790> so

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
other complicated maps it is MC as it so

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:51.890 
other complicated maps it is MC as it so
where<00:05:51.120> do<00:05:51.210> I<00:05:51.270> start

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
where do I start

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.540 
where do I start
well<00:05:52.350> basically<00:05:52.740> this<00:05:52.890> program<00:05:53.280> allows<00:05:53.520> you

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
well basically this program allows you

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.970 
well basically this program allows you
to<00:05:53.910> open<00:05:54.180> your<00:05:54.240> word<00:05:54.600> safe<00:05:54.930> in<00:05:55.170> Minecraft<00:05:55.710> and

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
to open your word safe in Minecraft and

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.850 
to open your word safe in Minecraft and
it<00:05:56.850> allows<00:05:57.060> you<00:05:57.300> to<00:05:57.360> manage<00:05:58.260> it<00:05:58.470> more<00:05:58.650> easily

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
it allows you to manage it more easily

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.190 
it allows you to manage it more easily
so<00:05:59.490> for<00:05:59.730> example<00:06:00.180> I<00:06:00.330> have<00:06:00.540> this<00:06:00.720> cake<00:06:00.990> right

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
so for example I have this cake right

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.070 
so for example I have this cake right
here<00:06:01.530> I<00:06:01.770> can<00:06:02.310> copy<00:06:02.550> it<00:06:02.790> and<00:06:02.940> then<00:06:03.000> I<00:06:03.600> can<00:06:03.810> paste

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
here I can copy it and then I can paste

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.920 
here I can copy it and then I can paste
it<00:06:04.350> anywhere<00:06:04.530> else<00:06:05.100> where<00:06:05.520> I<00:06:05.550> want<00:06:05.820> I<00:06:06.060> can<00:06:06.810> also

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
it anywhere else where I want I can also

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.180 
it anywhere else where I want I can also
move<00:06:07.440> it<00:06:07.560> around<00:06:07.830> like<00:06:08.310> this<00:06:09.710> if<00:06:10.710> I<00:06:10.860> don't<00:06:11.040> like

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
move it around like this if I don't like

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.650 
move it around like this if I don't like
it<00:06:11.370> I<00:06:11.520> can<00:06:11.790> delete<00:06:12.180> it<00:06:13.010> and<00:06:14.240> if<00:06:15.240> I<00:06:15.360> begin

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
it I can delete it and if I begin

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.780 
it I can delete it and if I begin
listing<00:06:16.200> of<00:06:16.380> the<00:06:16.590> features<00:06:17.070> then<00:06:17.430> it's<00:06:17.580> going

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
listing of the features then it's going

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.080 
listing of the features then it's going
to<00:06:17.940> take<00:06:18.120> me<00:06:18.330> a<00:06:18.540> long<00:06:18.750> long<00:06:19.230> time<00:06:19.880> but<00:06:20.880> yeah

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
to take me a long long time but yeah

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.460 
to take me a long long time but yeah
that's<00:06:21.750> about<00:06:22.020> it

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
that's about it

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.470

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
that those five things aren't the only

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.710 
that those five things aren't the only
tools<00:06:34.800> and<00:06:35.220> resources<00:06:35.550> which<00:06:36.000> you<00:06:36.030> can<00:06:36.420> use

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
tools and resources which you can use

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.860 
tools and resources which you can use
there<00:06:37.500> are<00:06:37.620> a<00:06:37.740> lot<00:06:37.920> more<00:06:37.950> obviously<00:06:38.790> and<00:06:39.180> here

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
there are a lot more obviously and here

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.810 
there are a lot more obviously and here
by<00:06:40.320> the<00:06:40.380> way<00:06:40.590> if<00:06:40.890> you<00:06:41.190> think<00:06:41.220> I<00:06:41.550> missed

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
by the way if you think I missed

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.110 
by the way if you think I missed
anything<00:06:42.180> let<00:06:42.570> me<00:06:42.720> know<00:06:42.870> what<00:06:43.230> and<00:06:43.500> why<00:06:44.040> I<00:06:44.340> know

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
anything let me know what and why I know

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.750 
anything let me know what and why I know
there<00:06:45.450> are<00:06:45.690> a<00:06:45.900> few<00:06:46.290> other<00:06:46.530> tools<00:06:46.860> like<00:06:47.340> for

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
there are a few other tools like for

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.160 
there are a few other tools like for
example<00:06:47.850> I<00:06:48.360> think<00:06:48.630> there<00:06:48.780> might<00:06:48.930> be<00:06:48.990> more

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.170 
example I think there might be more
