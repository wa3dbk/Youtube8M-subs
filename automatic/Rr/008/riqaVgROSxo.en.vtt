00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
diving it sounds really intense a little

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.700 
diving it sounds really intense a little
bit<00:00:37.090> worried<00:00:37.390> now<00:00:37.660> it's<00:00:38.200> easy<00:00:38.350> to<00:00:38.530> use

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
bit worried now it's easy to use

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.470 
bit worried now it's easy to use
basically<00:00:39.220> it's<00:00:39.340> a<00:00:39.400> 12<00:00:39.670> bought<00:00:39.820> diving<00:00:40.210> system

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
basically it's a 12 bought diving system

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.820 
basically it's a 12 bought diving system
here<00:00:40.660> which<00:00:41.110> kind<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.380> bridges<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:41.800> gap

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
here which kind of bridges the gap

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.460 
here which kind of bridges the gap
between<00:00:42.160> snorkeling<00:00:42.730> and<00:00:42.850> scuba<00:00:42.940> so<00:00:43.600> how<00:00:44.410> does

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
between snorkeling and scuba so how does

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.810 
between snorkeling and scuba so how does
it<00:00:44.559> work<00:00:44.650> does<00:00:44.949> this<00:00:45.100> system<00:00:45.309> stay<00:00:45.640> on<00:00:45.699> the

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
it work does this system stay on the

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.700 
it work does this system stay on the
boat<00:00:45.970> or<00:00:46.180> this<00:00:46.690> unit<00:00:46.960> floats<00:00:47.170> behind<00:00:47.470> the<00:00:47.559> two

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
boat or this unit floats behind the two

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.320 
boat or this unit floats behind the two
divers<00:00:48.070> it's<00:00:48.309> got<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.460> 12<00:00:48.699> volt<00:00:48.940> motor<00:00:49.090> and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
divers it's got a 12 volt motor and

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.910 
divers it's got a 12 volt motor and
battery<00:00:49.420> inside<00:00:49.900> it<00:00:50.080> and<00:00:50.199> it's<00:00:50.590> really<00:00:50.800> easy

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
battery inside it and it's really easy

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.590 
battery inside it and it's really easy
to<00:00:50.980> use<00:00:51.190> so<00:00:51.400> the<00:00:51.670> two<00:00:51.820> divers<00:00:51.970> could<00:00:52.239> go<00:00:52.390> diving

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
to use so the two divers could go diving

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
to use so the two divers could go diving
in<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:52.900> water<00:00:53.020> for<00:00:53.230> how<00:00:53.290> long

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
in the water for how long

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.049 
in the water for how long
basically<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.250> unit<00:00:54.489> would<00:00:54.610> die<00:00:54.699> for<00:00:54.940> one

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
basically the unit would die for one

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.970 
basically the unit would die for one
hour<00:00:55.239> and<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.870> depths<00:00:56.199> are<00:00:56.290> about<00:00:56.470> two<00:00:56.650> divers

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
hour and the depths are about two divers

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.220 
hour and the depths are about two divers
