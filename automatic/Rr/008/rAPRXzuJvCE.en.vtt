00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
all the sides so it doesn't end up being

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.790 
all the sides so it doesn't end up being
crooked<00:00:44.660> or<00:00:44.960> uneven

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.899 

kind<00:01:24.870> of<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> messy<00:01:25.380> project<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.100> poly<00:01:26.310> best

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909

just<00:01:36.780> pack<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.020> down<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> little<00:01:37.560> bit<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.860> don't

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
just pack it down a little bit I don't

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.460

want<00:01:38.190> to<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.370> it<00:01:38.460> too<00:01:38.610> tight<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.120> um

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
want to get it too tight but just um

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.680 
want to get it too tight but just um
secure<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.160> doesn't<00:01:41.310> follow<00:01:41.730> me

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
secure it so it doesn't follow me

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.530 
secure it so it doesn't follow me
or<00:01:43.020> elsewill<00:01:43.230> out<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> stake<00:01:43.800> this<00:01:44.010> one<00:01:44.250> too

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
or elsewill out the stake this one too

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.980 
or elsewill out the stake this one too
we<00:01:45.540> shouldn't<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.110 

I've<00:01:53.770> got<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.950> little<00:01:54.220> too<00:01:54.340> much<00:01:54.400> soil<00:01:54.790> on<00:01:55.090> top

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
I've got a little too much soil on top

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:04.670 
I've got a little too much soil on top
so

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.559 

there<00:02:05.680> we<00:02:05.799> go<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:08.649> pretty<00:02:08.920> good<00:02:09.360> maybe<00:02:10.360> I'll

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
there we go it's pretty good maybe I'll

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.340 
there we go it's pretty good maybe I'll
put<00:02:11.200> one<00:02:11.410> steak<00:02:11.860> in<00:02:12.100> here<00:02:12.430> this<00:02:13.110> one's<00:02:14.110> going

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
put one steak in here this one's going

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:32.690 
put one steak in here this one's going
all<00:02:14.530> at<00:02:14.680> all<00:02:15.959> till<00:02:16.959> it's<00:02:17.110> rooted

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.220 

the<00:02:33.209> lies<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.720> think<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:34.050> looks<00:02:34.230> pretty<00:02:34.380> nice

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.920 

all<00:02:38.769> right
