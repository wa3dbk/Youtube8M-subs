that is TV still staying alive these are

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.950 
that is TV still staying alive these are

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
hit on that only ones willing at this

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.500 
hit on that only ones willing at this
point<00:04:56.250> I<00:04:56.430> think<00:04:56.550> hit<00:04:56.760> speeds<00:04:57.120> can<00:04:57.210> hit<00:04:57.360> that

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
point I think hit speeds can hit that

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.510

to<00:04:59.580> cash<00:04:59.760> it<00:04:59.940> over<00:05:00.240> word<00:05:00.360> but<00:05:00.540> I<00:05:00.570> don't<00:05:00.780> think

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
to cash it over word but I don't think

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.840 
to cash it over word but I don't think
it's<00:05:01.020> going<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.170> be<00:05:01.230> there<00:05:01.560> have<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.310> few<00:05:02.580> medics

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
it's going to be there have a few medics

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.070 
it's going to be there have a few medics
out<00:05:03.000> there<00:05:03.180> so<00:05:03.360> we're<00:05:03.480> gonna<00:05:03.570> see<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.870> sea<00:05:03.990> is

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
out there so we're gonna see the sea is

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.440 
out there so we're gonna see the sea is
still<00:05:04.470> not<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:04.860> large<00:05:05.070> a<00:05:05.280> force<00:05:05.550> did<00:05:06.270> get<00:05:06.420> a

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
still not that large a force did get a

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.850 
still not that large a force did get a
scan<00:05:06.690> off<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.050> working<00:05:07.320> on<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.440> zebra<00:05:07.590> right

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
scan off and working on a zebra right

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.710 
scan off and working on a zebra right
now<00:05:08.010> so<00:05:08.370> his<00:05:08.550> mutant<00:05:08.880> defenses<00:05:09.240> are<00:05:09.390> gonna<00:05:09.570> be

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
now so his mutant defenses are gonna be

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.850 
now so his mutant defenses are gonna be
happy<00:05:09.930> is<00:05:10.020> gonna<00:05:10.170> have<00:05:10.320> a<00:05:10.350> couple<00:05:10.530> of<00:05:10.680> charts

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
happy is gonna have a couple of charts

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.710 
happy is gonna have a couple of charts
out<00:05:11.100> there<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.310> think<00:05:11.430> in<00:05:11.700> time<00:05:11.910> spire

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
out there I think in time spire

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.450 
out there I think in time spire
meanwhile<00:05:13.050> on<00:05:13.320> good<00:05:13.560> on<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.950> way<00:05:14.040> so<00:05:14.100> she's

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
meanwhile on good on the way so she's

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.770 
meanwhile on good on the way so she's
definitely<00:05:14.760> gonna<00:05:14.820> have<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.090> turret<00:05:15.390> timing

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
definitely gonna have the turret timing

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.440 
definitely gonna have the turret timing
and<00:05:15.960> also<00:05:16.710> going<00:05:16.830> for<00:05:17.040> firebats<00:05:17.610> so<00:05:18.090> that's

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
and also going for firebats so that's

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.850 
and also going for firebats so that's
interesting<00:05:18.720> might<00:05:19.050> have<00:05:19.170> been<00:05:19.260> expecting

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
interesting might have been expecting

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.220 
interesting might have been expecting
some<00:05:20.040> sort<00:05:20.070> of<00:05:20.280> ground<00:05:20.940> push<00:05:21.420> from<00:05:21.900> great

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
some sort of ground push from great

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.420 
some sort of ground push from great
didn't<00:05:22.500> see<00:05:22.620> any<00:05:22.740> aggressive<00:05:22.980> move<00:05:23.250> coming

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
didn't see any aggressive move coming

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.710 
didn't see any aggressive move coming
from<00:05:23.610> it<00:05:23.760> so<00:05:23.880> gonna<00:05:24.060> go<00:05:24.240> for<00:05:24.390> privates

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
from it so gonna go for privates

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.940 
from it so gonna go for privates
wondering<00:05:25.170> was<00:05:25.290> actually<00:05:25.500> gonna<00:05:25.590> try<00:05:25.770> for<00:05:25.830> a

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
break right away does have those

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.450 
break right away does have those
