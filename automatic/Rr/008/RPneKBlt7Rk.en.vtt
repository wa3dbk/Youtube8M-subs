significant<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:25.550> actually<00:02:28.180> recharges

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
significant and it actually recharges

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.600 
significant and it actually recharges
fairly<00:02:29.660> fast<00:02:31.840> yeah<00:02:32.920> surprisingly<00:02:33.920> fast

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.460 

so<00:02:38.610> yeah<00:02:39.030> don't<00:02:39.360> be<00:02:39.540> afraid<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.990> let<00:02:40.290> loose

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
so yeah don't be afraid to let loose

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.650 
so yeah don't be afraid to let loose
with<00:02:40.650> them<00:02:40.850> you<00:02:41.850> also<00:02:41.970> have<00:02:42.210> the<00:02:42.300> missiles

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
with them you also have the missiles

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.460 
with them you also have the missiles
like<00:02:47.450> they<00:02:48.450> do<00:02:48.540> sometimes<00:02:48.930> suffer<00:02:49.440> from

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
like they do sometimes suffer from

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.140 
like they do sometimes suffer from
graphical<00:02:50.130> glitches<00:02:50.400> where<00:02:50.700> they<00:02:50.820> will<00:02:51.000> look

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
graphical glitches where they will look

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.460 
graphical glitches where they will look
like<00:02:51.360> they<00:02:51.540> are<00:02:51.570> not<00:02:51.810> actually<00:02:52.200> headed

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
like they are not actually headed

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.570 
like they are not actually headed
towards<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:52.740> target<00:02:53.130> when<00:02:53.310> they<00:02:53.400> actually

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
towards the target when they actually

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.680 
towards the target when they actually
are<00:02:55.400> do<00:02:56.400> not<00:02:56.460> be<00:02:56.760> afraid<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.120> fire<00:02:57.300> them<00:02:57.510> off

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
are do not be afraid to fire them off

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.090 
are do not be afraid to fire them off
and<00:02:57.990> think<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.620> they're<00:02:58.740> not<00:02:58.890> actually

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
and think that they're not actually

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.740 
and think that they're not actually
going<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.520> track<00:02:59.730> on<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.940> target<00:03:00.330> they<00:03:00.480> will

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
going to track on a target they will

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.120 
going to track on a target they will
track<00:03:01.050> on<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.320> target<00:03:01.620> if<00:03:01.710> you've<00:03:01.830> got<00:03:02.010> it

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
track on the target if you've got it

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.400 
track on the target if you've got it
locked<00:03:02.250> up<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:03.330> you'll<00:03:03.810> know<00:03:03.990> when<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.260> have

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
locked up and you'll know when you have

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.390 
locked up and you'll know when you have
it<00:03:04.500> locked<00:03:04.590> up<00:03:04.830> because<00:03:05.010> it'll<00:03:05.250> have<00:03:05.340> a

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
it locked up because it'll have a

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.930 
it locked up because it'll have a
annoying<00:03:06.240> little<00:03:06.360> tone<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:06.870> your<00:03:06.990> ear<00:03:07.640> all<00:03:08.640> of

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
annoying little tone in your ear all of

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.560 
annoying little tone in your ear all of
the<00:03:09.060> missiles<00:03:09.330> have<00:03:09.510> tone<00:03:14.120> battle<00:03:15.120> armor<00:03:15.330> also

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
the missiles have tone battle armor also

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.560 
the missiles have tone battle armor also
carried<00:03:15.870> grenades<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:17.730> basic<00:03:18.120> retain<00:03:18.390> is

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
carried grenades the basic retain is

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:34.340 
carried grenades the basic retain is
this<00:03:18.780> c8<00:03:19.230> thing

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.260 

so<00:03:35.190> yeah<00:03:35.640> c8<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:37.830> sticks<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.430> things<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.030> then

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
so yeah c8 it sticks on things and then

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.449 
so yeah c8 it sticks on things and then
it<00:03:39.420> ton<00:03:39.720> has<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.410> timer<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.070> then<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.280> blows

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
it ton has the timer and then it blows

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.550 
it ton has the timer and then it blows
up<00:03:41.930> just<00:03:42.930> like<00:03:43.020> that

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
up just like that

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.310 
up just like that
timer<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.310> believe<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.150> three<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.050> five

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
timer I believe is a three to five

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.280 
timer I believe is a three to five
seconds<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:46.980> ever<00:03:47.190> actually<00:03:47.340> timed<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.910> out

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
seconds that ever actually timed it out

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.470 
seconds that ever actually timed it out
it<00:03:49.290> does<00:03:49.680> tend<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.190> bounce<00:03:50.489> off<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.030> things

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
it does tend to bounce off of things

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.020 
it does tend to bounce off of things
that<00:03:51.690> are<00:03:51.780> moving<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.890> it's<00:03:53.489> better<00:03:53.730> used

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
that are moving so it's better used

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.430 
that are moving so it's better used
against<00:03:54.300> stationary<00:03:54.810> targets<00:03:55.550> and<00:03:56.570> also<00:03:57.570> not

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
against stationary targets and also not

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.800 
against stationary targets and also not
on<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:59.010> legs<00:03:59.310> interestingly<00:04:00.060> enough<00:04:00.600> of

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
on the legs interestingly enough of

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.190 
on the legs interestingly enough of
Mac's<00:04:01.730> it<00:04:02.730> sticks<00:04:03.120> with<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:03.630> higher<00:04:03.959> frequency

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
Mac's it sticks with a higher frequency

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.390 
Mac's it sticks with a higher frequency
the<00:04:04.980> higher<00:04:05.010> up<00:04:05.459> get<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.000> the

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
the higher up get to the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.940 
the higher up get to the
and<00:04:07.519> so<00:04:08.360> arms<00:04:08.750> are<00:04:08.959> good<00:04:09.110> torsos<00:04:09.590> are<00:04:09.620> better

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
and so arms are good torsos are better

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.460 
and so arms are good torsos are better
hips<00:04:10.280> excellent<00:04:11.030> but<00:04:11.780> if<00:04:11.989> you<00:04:12.110> hit<00:04:12.230> it<00:04:12.349> on<00:04:12.409> the

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
hips excellent but if you hit it on the

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.319 
hips excellent but if you hit it on the
leg<00:04:12.709> it's<00:04:12.890> not<00:04:13.159> gonna<00:04:13.340> stick<00:04:13.640> probably<00:04:14.180> about

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
leg it's not gonna stick probably about

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.229 
leg it's not gonna stick probably about
80%<00:04:14.659> of<00:04:15.019> the<00:04:15.110> time<00:04:15.910> switching<00:04:16.910> between<00:04:17.030> your

yeah you're going to be hitting the
ground<00:06:16.840> pretty<00:06:17.840> quickly<00:06:18.080> happening<00:06:18.710> lift<00:06:19.100> off
