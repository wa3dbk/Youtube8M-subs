impressive anyway I guess it's exciting

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:33.750 
impressive anyway I guess it's exciting
that<00:00:32.560> it's<00:00:32.800> going<00:00:32.950> on<00:00:33.070> at<00:00:33.130> the<00:00:33.190> same<00:00:33.310> time<00:00:33.520> but

that it's going on at the same time but

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.670 
that it's going on at the same time but
I<00:00:33.940> remember<00:00:34.510> years<00:00:34.660> that<00:00:34.960> we<00:00:35.050> didn't<00:00:35.440> have<00:00:35.469> at

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
I remember years that we didn't have at

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.110 
I remember years that we didn't have at
the<00:00:35.800> same<00:00:35.980> time<00:00:36.160> and<00:00:36.430> that<00:00:36.460> was<00:00:36.610> really<00:00:36.850> cool

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
the same time and that was really cool

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.020 
the same time and that was really cool
because<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:38.620> would<00:00:38.860> even<00:00:39.010> get<00:00:39.250> to<00:00:39.460> watch<00:00:39.789> some

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
because we would even get to watch some

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.279 
because we would even get to watch some
of<00:00:40.059> the<00:00:40.180> kids<00:00:40.329> field<00:00:40.570> training<00:00:40.870> runs<00:00:41.050> and

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
of the kids field training runs and

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:42.810 
of the kids field training runs and
that's<00:00:41.440> fun<00:00:41.710> it's<00:00:41.949> always<00:00:42.190> exciting<00:00:42.520> watching

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
that's fun it's always exciting watching

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.310 
that's fun it's always exciting watching
on<00:00:43.059> TV<00:00:43.329> and<00:00:43.449> I<00:00:43.480> guess<00:00:43.510> since<00:00:43.780> we're<00:00:43.989> earlier

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
on TV and I guess since we're earlier

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.200 
on TV and I guess since we're earlier
that<00:00:44.980> means<00:00:45.190> we<00:00:45.370> are<00:00:45.460> done<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:45.850> we<00:00:45.969> can<00:00:46.000> get

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
that means we are done and we can get

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.610 
that means we are done and we can get
back<00:00:46.360> to<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.570> hotel<00:00:46.660> de<00:00:46.960> watch<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.379> same
