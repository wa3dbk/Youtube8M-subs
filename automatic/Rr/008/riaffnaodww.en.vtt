00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.440 
commentary and I see a club in my eyes
that<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.829> what<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> only<00:01:47.729> one<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.180> my

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
that it is what it's the only one in my

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.569 
that it is what it's the only one in my
eyes<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.079> look<00:01:49.229> around<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.070> owner

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
eyes that you look around that the owner

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.010 
eyes that you look around that the owner
actually<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.619> here<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:54.149> guy<00:01:54.299> who<00:01:54.360> runs<00:01:54.750> it

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
actually it is here the guy who runs it

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.780 
actually it is here the guy who runs it
owns<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.560> you've<00:01:56.100> got<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> franchise

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
owns it you've got the franchise

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.300 
owns it you've got the franchise
everything<00:01:57.450> all<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.780> other<00:01:57.930> clubs<00:01:58.860> are<00:01:59.100> like

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
everything all the other clubs are like

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.639 
everything all the other clubs are like
they<00:01:59.729> read<00:01:59.939> their<00:02:00.149> stadiums<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:01.469> is

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
they read their stadiums this is

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.649 
they read their stadiums this is
completely<00:02:02.189> different<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.850> very<00:02:03.060> unique<00:02:03.479> in

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
completely different and very unique in

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.760 
completely different and very unique in
the<00:02:04.200> speedway<00:02:04.590> world<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:06.540> that's<00:02:07.200> one<00:02:07.680> of

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
the speedway world and so that's one of

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.990 
the speedway world and so that's one of
the<00:02:07.829> big<00:02:08.009> selling<00:02:08.340> things

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the big selling things

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.390 
the big selling things
is<00:02:09.210> that<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.750> mr.<00:02:10.380> Sandhu<00:02:10.770> owns<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.190> place

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
is that it mr. Sandhu owns this place

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.000 
is that it mr. Sandhu owns this place
and<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.090> think<00:02:12.660> there's<00:02:13.200> other<00:02:13.380> things<00:02:13.470> we<00:02:13.800> can

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
and I think there's other things we can

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.550 
and I think there's other things we can
move<00:02:14.190> on<00:02:14.340> to
