00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
much fuller like that you can see just

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.719 
much fuller like that you can see just
by<00:01:54.659> filling<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.890> creates<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.490> much

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
by filling that it creates a much

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.459 
by filling that it creates a much
smoother<00:01:57.210> appearance<00:01:57.329> up<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.140> now<00:01:58.290> watch

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
smoother appearance up in here now watch

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.709 
smoother appearance up in here now watch
one<00:01:58.680> eye<00:01:58.710> let<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.100> go<00:01:59.310> when<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> let<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.540> go

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
one eye let that go when I let that go

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.810 
one eye let that go when I let that go
you're<00:02:00.930> gonna<00:02:01.020> see<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.560> sinks<00:02:01.979> down<00:02:02.159> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
you're gonna see that that sinks down it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.030 
you're gonna see that that sinks down it
creates<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.509> trough<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.710> makes<00:02:04.860> this

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
creates this trough and it makes this

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.010 
creates this trough and it makes this
heavier<00:02:05.430> which<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.030> really<00:02:06.329> what<00:02:06.540> forms<00:02:06.869> this

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
heavier which is really what forms this

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.199 
heavier which is really what forms this
line<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.710> we're<00:02:08.220> gonna<00:02:08.310> put<00:02:08.550> some<00:02:08.580> filler<00:02:09.030> in

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
line so we're gonna put some filler in

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.419 
line so we're gonna put some filler in
this<00:02:09.390> area

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.920 
it's really deep into the cheek or we
want<00:06:06.490> to<00:06:06.580> get<00:06:06.730> a<00:06:06.760> little<00:06:06.940> further<00:06:07.150> into<00:06:07.480> here

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
want to get a little further into here

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.050 
want to get a little further into here
we're<00:06:08.770> typically<00:06:09.160> going<00:06:09.430> to<00:06:09.520> need<00:06:09.760> three

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
we're typically going to need three

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.870 
we're typically going to need three
syringes<00:06:10.420> of<00:06:10.660> material<00:06:11.320> to<00:06:11.980> cover<00:06:12.430> all<00:06:12.700> those

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
syringes of material to cover all those

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.480 
syringes of material to cover all those
areas<00:06:13.240> so<00:06:13.870> it's<00:06:14.290> really<00:06:14.500> a<00:06:14.830> function<00:06:15.100> of<00:06:15.340> how

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
areas so it's really a function of how

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.610 
areas so it's really a function of how
many<00:06:15.550> areas<00:06:16.060> we're<00:06:16.270> treating<00:06:16.630> and<00:06:16.870> what<00:06:17.470> the

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
many areas we're treating and what the

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.300 
many areas we're treating and what the
expectation<00:06:18.400> is<00:06:18.580> of<00:06:18.610> what<00:06:19.180> type<00:06:19.360> of<00:06:19.390> result

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
expectation is of what type of result

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.610 
expectation is of what type of result
how<00:06:21.310> do<00:06:21.370> you<00:06:21.580> feel<00:06:21.880> did<00:06:22.150> it<00:06:22.270> hurt<00:06:22.630> do<00:06:23.170> you<00:06:23.230> feel

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
how do you feel did it hurt do you feel

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.070 
how do you feel did it hurt do you feel
anything<00:06:23.970> you<00:06:24.970> just<00:06:25.210> feel<00:06:25.510> a<00:06:25.540> little<00:06:25.750> thick

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
anything you just feel a little thick

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:42.380 
anything you just feel a little thick
that's<00:06:26.500> about<00:06:26.770> it<00:06:27.040> and<00:06:27.190> don't<00:06:27.340> feel<00:06:27.910> anything

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.270 

but<00:06:43.390> you<00:06:43.510> don't<00:06:43.720> think<00:06:44.050> that<00:06:44.260> you<00:06:44.410> guys<00:06:44.590> see

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280
