00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
not going to pinpoint everything cal

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:44.810 
not going to pinpoint everything cal
sounds<00:00:25.529> like<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:26.119> very<00:00:27.119> simple<00:00:43.670> we<00:00:44.670> have

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
sounds like this very simple we have

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.690 
sounds like this very simple we have
just<00:00:44.850> repeats<00:00:45.390> over<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.840> over<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:47.219> over<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
just repeats over and over and over and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:59.120 
just repeats over and over and over and
then<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.480> when<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.170> get<00:00:49.350> into<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> song

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.840 

so<00:01:00.130> let's<00:01:00.310> start<00:01:00.520> on<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.060> d<00:01:01.390> minor<00:01:02.170> 7<00:01:02.920> which<00:01:03.340> is<00:01:03.580> d

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
so let's start on a d minor 7 which is d

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.380 
so let's start on a d minor 7 which is d
minor<00:01:04.120> d<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:05.470> f<00:01:06.340> eight<00:01:07.410> seats<00:01:08.410> and<00:01:08.770> so<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:10.210> do

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
minor d and f eight seats and so we do

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.930 
minor d and f eight seats and so we do
run<00:01:11.170> back<00:01:11.530> and<00:01:11.560> forth<00:01:11.770> from<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.520> mouth<00:01:12.550> from

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
run back and forth from the mouth from

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.390 
run back and forth from the mouth from
the<00:01:13.000> core<00:01:13.300> to<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.600> same<00:01:16.560> with<00:01:17.560> addy<00:01:17.860> octave

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
the core to the same with addy octave

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.750 
the core to the same with addy octave
and<00:01:18.670> then<00:01:19.660> we'll<00:01:19.840> say<00:01:20.110> investing<00:01:20.860> one<00:01:21.130> so<00:01:23.730> so<00:01:24.730> a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
and then we'll say investing one so so a

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.760 
and then we'll say investing one so so a
cabin<00:01:25.210> for<00:01:27.210> 34<00:01:28.210> never<00:01:28.510> change<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:29.380> b-flat

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
cabin for 34 never change to b-flat

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.180 
cabin for 34 never change to b-flat
major<00:01:30.490> which<00:01:31.150> this<00:01:31.360> is<00:01:31.540> an<00:01:31.570> aversion<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.190> be

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
major which this is an aversion to be

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.590 
major which this is an aversion to be
flat<00:01:33.490> on<00:01:33.520> tiffa<00:01:33.970> here<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.680> we<00:01:36.640> tell<00:01:36.820> us<00:01:37.060> be<00:01:37.330> fat

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.460 
flat on tiffa here and we tell us be fat
version<00:01:38.470> 50<00:01:39.160> ft<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:40.360> which<00:01:40.570> is<00:01:40.690> relevant<00:01:41.080> for

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
version 50 ft and which is relevant for

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.010 
version 50 ft and which is relevant for
from<00:01:41.979> them<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:44.020> we<00:01:44.170> count<00:01:44.410> 3<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.720> then<00:01:46.720> on<00:01:46.930> the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
from them but we count 3 and then on the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.600 
from them but we count 3 and then on the
fourth<00:01:47.229> we<00:01:47.619> hit<00:01:47.800> C<00:01:48.580> octave<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:51.220> this<00:01:51.400> sounds

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
fourth we hit C octave so this sounds

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:05.520 
fourth we hit C octave so this sounds
like<00:02:01.920> one<00:02:02.920> then<00:02:03.610> we<00:02:03.730> go<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:03.880> earth<00:02:04.270> even<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.290> fox
