00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
with a bunch of other videos though but

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.639 
with a bunch of other videos though but
yeah<00:02:08.820> so<00:02:09.090> they<00:02:09.210> posted<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.229> got<00:02:10.410> all

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
yeah so they posted it and it got all

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.150 
yeah so they posted it and it got all
these<00:02:10.860> views<00:02:12.500> but<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.530> was<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:13.860> very

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
these views but I was just very

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.290 
these views but I was just very
surprised<00:02:14.610> because<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.540> know<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:16.620> like

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
surprised because you know it's like

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.760 
surprised because you know it's like
it's<00:02:18.300> just<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.570> slow-motion<00:02:18.990> video<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.530> baby

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
it's just a slow-motion video of baby

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.760 
it's just a slow-motion video of baby
but<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.130> guess<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:22.110> they<00:02:22.350> wanted<00:02:22.710> to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
but I guess the that they wanted to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.990 
but I guess the that they wanted to
share<00:02:23.070> it<00:02:23.190> because<00:02:23.370> they<00:02:23.520> were<00:02:23.580> they<00:02:23.790> did<00:02:23.970> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
share it because they were they did a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.780 
share it because they were they did a
column<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.690> slow<00:02:25.560> motion<00:02:25.950> videos<00:02:26.280> for<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.640> new

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.390 
videos when I first get it so a couple
them<00:02:50.459> before<00:02:50.820> for<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.180> iPhone<00:02:51.540> 5<00:02:51.840> were

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
them before for the iPhone 5 were

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.420 
them before for the iPhone 5 were
featured<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.850> stuff<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.770> it<00:02:55.770> happens<00:02:56.160> pretty

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
featured and stuff so it happens pretty

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.070 
featured and stuff so it happens pretty
much<00:02:56.580> once<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.090> year<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:57.450> I'm<00:02:57.510> pretty<00:02:57.690> used<00:02:57.989> to

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
much once a year so I'm pretty used to

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.380 
much once a year so I'm pretty used to
it<00:02:58.230> but<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.739> was<00:02:59.430> just<00:02:59.610> surprised<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.000> that

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
it but I was just surprised that that

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.880 
it but I was just surprised that that
video<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.750> particular<00:03:00.870> got<00:03:01.410> all<00:03:01.590> those<00:03:01.739> views

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
video in particular got all those views

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.710 
video in particular got all those views
cuz<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.550> know<00:03:02.670> it's<00:03:02.880> just<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.150> slow<00:03:03.360> motion

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
cuz you know it's just a slow motion

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.390 
cuz you know it's just a slow motion
video<00:03:03.959> it's<00:03:04.140> not<00:03:04.200> like<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> review<00:03:04.980> or<00:03:05.160> anything

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
video it's not like a review or anything

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.750
