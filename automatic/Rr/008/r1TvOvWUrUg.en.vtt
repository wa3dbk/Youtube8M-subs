00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Everyone had to order it there. 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:13.110
 You series that I like but they 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:15.000
 are not so well known and yes I am 46 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.310
 To show you guys, let's go there. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.470
 The first one I'll tell you is the chronicles. 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.090
 Nose to lose weight may now here in 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.060
 Brazil is getting a little more famous 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.070
 released yes scale and so I do not see 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.260
 the recognition that deserved a tent did not 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.730
 Arrives there in nursery is still jules 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.539
 car interests had not more than one 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.189
 year ago 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.170
 I really liked both 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.520
 take a little while and ask grows because 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.410
 I'm too lazy to buy 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.000
 internationally but all those who 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.340
 there were more gringos than I see I speak 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.710
 that grows is destructive and is the best of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.660
 three and I'm sure the series will 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.430
 enjoy a good one because we in those two 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.379
 first ones were good already 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.649
 the third will bust a series of 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.020
 science fiction free indicated beyond 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.239
 of a fairy tale then the first 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.370
 sinder the second cinderella of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.399
 Little Red Riding Hood third 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.890
 abuse and last inter will be about the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.409
 snow white on the spoiler because that 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.869
 It's all rolled up in synthesis. 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.460
 to know that mechanics in every way 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.400
 that business lesson works for 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.040
 back has saying that this is 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.840
 borg people but cheated soccer that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.619
 in this world there is a plague that has wiped out 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.180
 a lot of people are very well the future this 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.070
 business with the prince but it really is 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.049
 surprising reached the second step 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.000
 milk rolling up everything we go 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.650
 know the scales in this book then 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.390
 cause of the book has a character 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.310
 difference is different but all 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.900
 stories understand goal when reading all 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.140
 clinic books on the nose when 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.030
 I want to leave the intermission. 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.070
 the review of the four books that 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.930
 I found the science fiction that is very 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.700
 cool, have some fantasy stuff 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.260
 also because it is showing that the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.479
 newspapers because there is a colony of 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.490
 people on the globe and the queen of this colony 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.990
 It was very cool, I recommend the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.850
 Chronic places for you are sure 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.470
 that you will like us a lot 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.460
 that I have been indicated one of my 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.759
 preferred 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.770
 the request and the secret society diana asks 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.020
 fraud was one of the first series 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.989
 polita was damaged because these are 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.130
 four books even and elson ready one 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.290
 very loving subject turned the sound is 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.380
 very good first book rosito no 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.360
 will tell the story is mm is a girl 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.040
 which is normal of faculty only in this 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.780
 university one of the most 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.640
 famous that you have a secret society 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.739
 almost everyone is invited by a 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.750
 secret society she really thinks 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.880
 will be invited to a certain one there 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.769
 has to do with her because she likes to 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.480
 writing you like these things said that 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.870
 the hair so horrible in that bun 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.239
 only he is worse still loose pat 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.130
 I'll see you in 10 000 euros but it 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.110
 ends up being invited is another 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.269
 secret society these cities teams 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.579
 most dreaded of the campus because they are 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.470
 funny spin and the rose turn story 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.269
 del that will be low and there I am 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.459
 very funny is a character who 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.130
 really is very real has nothing 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.350
 driving ball so she was very 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.329
 It's funny and it 's really cool the way it 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.940
 she is in every book has a certain mystery 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.070
 different june really recommend for 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.170
 you if you like terzigno and 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.790
 funny people and have fun complete 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.290
 people you cry with you you laugh with 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.150
 It might be that I'm going to talk is a 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.040
 technology I already told you we never 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.320
 Same Mermaid Pitcher Goals 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.910
 bath has only the last two because I 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.410
 I read the first loan but finally this 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.930
 is a technology that will count more or 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.370
 least on testing where they are unfounded 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.739
 This heavy story said 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.420
 and she has a certain mystery in fact the 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.090
 The first mystery book is a 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.980
 Very cool suspense I love it I love the 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.780
 characters and I really really like 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.060
 from the novel that they are very good 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.709
 read up circus team and of course you want 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.019
 find out what's going to happen and it's 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.390
 basically the story that Sister Dalva 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.329
 dies for a certain thing she goes to 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.980
 place where your sister died the heads 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.420
 because people think that if they do not 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.579
 committed suicide but she is sure not to 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.890
 put glaucomas listen to brother's voice 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.480
 in the head goes after two people who 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.060
 will help her discover the mysteries 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.379
 Do you read how to speak, too? 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.230
 say with certainty that you have already heard 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.329
 talk but they went out last year 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.340
 has released here the latest book I 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.440
 I did not see anyone talking about him and he already has 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.900
 a book but I still have not read I know I 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.970
 I want it to end but it's size 42 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.980
 not fat and yesterday was the first team to 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.900
 today in the library by school and it is very 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.910
 best way to make it look can 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.919
 look like a book about self help because 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.690
 disputed collected on google took 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.210
 while the other also an ego of the 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.610
 size does not matter the size 42 and 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.039
 ready to destroy us, we'll follow the 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.410
 Straight history she's a wife 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.780
 starting American was not very famous 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.820
 and had a shape and half and a half not 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.220
 became very famous and then she got fat 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.169
 her boyfriend attracted her lost 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.970
 all this fame she was created the director 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.979
 college accommodation because it does 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.919
 all feel that as incredible as it may seem 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.750
 of the book the system with suspense between 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.520

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.440
 things are weird and the rule has to 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.419
 find out what's happening 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.880
 preferred is the first stage because 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.289
 make a hit so all of her I prefer 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.090
 the first one maybe like the others 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.220
 because they are more fun than law to 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.870

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.729
