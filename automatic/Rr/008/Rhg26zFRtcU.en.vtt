00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:03.740
 my first training in a week of volunteer work I have today in 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.970
 Pena from KindsmÃ¼ller 4 can cause terminally ill and disabled children 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.139
 relax with their families a bit and go on vacation, so to speak 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.820
 and we owe a bit behind the scenes more specifically to the kitchen 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.820
 and will see how I can make it useful 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.919
 an important element in the daily routine a children's hospice is the preparation 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.219
 of lunch and I do it now together with wife Karin Schulze 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.349
 but fired 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.349
 How did you come to work as a volunteer? 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.630
 I have a good feeling that he is 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.340
 Our society is actually that everyone thinks and takes only in itself 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.390
 and the meaning of actually no egoist and then there I was whole 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.230
 consciously also set a sign by taking a piece of my time too 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.010
 betray 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.850
 around 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.489
 and then I wondered where can I do that has different things 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.560
 tried out 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.780
 and then when we were immediately acted 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.070
 and why just here 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.809
 I felt like she needed help herself and samples 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.189
 unlike the other the problem i realized every feeling when i go to 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.020
 Home drive Interfax with 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.860
 the janitor very special atmosphere 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.510
 which is also due to the fact that it is about Aachen and wine 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.510
 around and when I go home in the evening that is with around 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.380
 that laugh and cry belong to life 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.750
 and 4 found that my age problem or the stress issue is one 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.270
 so have in the normal job 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.930
 HM is changing 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.930
 can and indeed positive one develops a certain serenity 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.610
 to be able to deal with different topics quite differently and make me feel scary 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.730
 enriching for me as well so I take from the paper what to take home the house 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.320
 means they do not see that not only as support for the people 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.890
 Here and there they work here but actually as an asset to 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.320
 have their own lives, so to speak, two are exactly Anna 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.030
 the questionable condition that here in this house 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.009
 on 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.350
 also questions existential questions regarding St 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.880
 Hagen and it is also that my contacts to people with the whole 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.240
 Other areas of employment Employees 30 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.509
 and I work in a job that's why he's paying so much 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:06.970
 sober work 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.919
 what is your job what do you probably have employee bank 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.139
 and thus has to deal with numbers often with the driving more 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.409
 and here in the house it's about other things 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.980
 and that his and I say so he quarrels immensely that is very enriching 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.580
 contribute to break 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.300
 and also to start at all I grab a knife directly and 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.699
 First, Mrs. Schulze keeps the potato peeling 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:35.109
 Of course, that church is not only new to volunteers 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.049
 full-time employees as last year attracts 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.280
 How long does the company have the new one that comes in one? 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:42.329
 democracy 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.749
 so if he finds a new airline for upcoming elections or 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.819
 The club has a hospitating year 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.709
 that means we have points 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:51.599
 from the 8th 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.319
 working with the data an independent can work us 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.979
 Baden-Baden 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.249
 if that is explained 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.739
 come back here 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.079
 from a very simple other way, first of all, to put in a dishwasher 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.499
 consume for a while 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.499
 Smaller crafts and Ballack again 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:14.729
 There is a lot to do in the kitchen and you can not go anywhere 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.969
 and also someone who has never worked in the kitchen with her no 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.439
 Problems have an entry to find 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.999
 At any rate, I immediately felt at ease here 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:26.439
 and if you feel good then the work is much better and that works 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.419
 Eating is then punctually on the table 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.099
 after the preparations for the lunch must be certain and 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.839
 Of course, rinsed and cleaned for piece 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.789
 that's not my favorite discipline but here it is 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:41.359
 Working climate so good that even I do not mind 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.419
 then it is almost done and this happened from finds 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:45.699
 be granted 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.699
 So people can come to dinner and have it tasted 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:56.249
 yes everything is at medico winking left 8 make an interesting day i 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:59.389
 Until now, this had been implemented with hired volunteers 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:00.070
 employees 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.839
 mainly 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:05.329
 There is also something else to do for volunteers here 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.079
 to work in his kitchen 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.619
 those who see these are no longer in this beautiful garden the garden was 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:13.709
 created with the help of volunteers 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.870
 so we could use it here in the garden, we can still support 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.930
 the volunteer support us there and we also need volunteers for 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.430
 public relations means more public relations 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.249
 Occupy information booths 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.099
 even if the handed over 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.879
 and give lectures 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.669
 the trade really is a deficit and that would be nice 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.819
 if we still had support there 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.149
 and there is somehow somewhere in the particular Heidi someone should bring 

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:42.909
 Werner should work here pay attention to what you want or want 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.199
 to do something specific from these people 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.319
 No no 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:50.669
 Essel a few then percent of the fun in the foreground and is natural 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.059
 also so we volunteer the short schools 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:58.269
 So she comes to his info-meeting and will be informed there by Kieners 

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:02.549
 until wild autumn and then do a short training and be there 

00:05:02.549 --> 00:05:05.469
 They are as prepared as they are in a kitchen 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.360
 started by so to speak so that means that it is 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.930
 no problem at all 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.770
 one position has that one could think of others as well 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.629
 would rather do something else 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.569
 So who percent I like to be in the kitchen it's a lot of fun 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.600
 but now I am full-time 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.890
 more clamped there it is of course that there is not so much 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.470
 Schaeffler softeners also provide info booths and donations 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.319
 do not take lectures it's all fun 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.249
 it just always has to be 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.579
 Percent the way you think it's no fun and that you do 

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:40.360
 So overloaded is that I'm not here when overloaded 

00:05:40.359 --> 00:05:41.069
 are 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.719
 it's more like that when she forced it and say I have my job 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:48.569
 Home not so then you should really think about volunteering 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.009
 to get a little shorter 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.620
 the singers certainly have a variety of tasks and fields of application here 

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:56.070
 to which they can participate 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.070
 They would throw at you if they proved themselves under then if they were 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.760
 here one can also do their part to help
