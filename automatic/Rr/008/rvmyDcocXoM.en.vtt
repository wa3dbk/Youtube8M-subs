00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.450
 welcome to this new video we are going to 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.560
 be talking about what is a 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.900
 hosting 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.430
 leonardo was from leonard roberts to point 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.960
 net and it's how well you know we're 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.750
 talking about different topics 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.550
 related to making money for 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.490
 internet today I want to talk about this 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.590
 important issue that is a hosting for 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.050
 that you can understand then what 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.019
 It usually deals when we 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.769
 we load a web page and we paste the 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:43.320
 true address www ej dotcom and we 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.059
 leads to a page now so that this 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.450
 page is available every day 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.860
 of the year at all times true this online 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.800
 so that anyone can access 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.050
 from anywhere in the world 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.059
 page has to be hosted in a 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.399
 computer on a computer usually 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.640
 called a server because they are big 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.629
 great computers 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.810
 I like a diagram I have a good face 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.119
 to make these more clear 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.670
 servers then as I said to you are 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.100
 teams that are usually the usa 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.649
 true or in some country that provides 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.350
 hosting services then you go 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.270
 to be able to mount your page so that 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.939
 can upload this page this server 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.610
 you're going to have to pay a membership 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.939
 monthly or annual access there are different 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.220
 options and you will be able to charge your 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.679
 hosting new files images 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.380
 your website except for the 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.959
 people can access it a hosting 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.220
 it's more or less something like this this is my 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.380
 hosting service I'm going to enter 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.619
 so you can see what options you have 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.619
 inside 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.530
 this is the panel or panel 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.200
 my hosting configuration and it's very 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.329
 similar to the different hosting that you 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.619
 you can find on the internet I will download 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.439
 here so you can see what it has 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.630
 innumerable options but the most 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.240
 important is that you here driving very 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.250
 little html code or any other 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.650
 programming language you will be able to 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.140
 mount your page and so you do not know anything that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.910
 mind you're going to throw google and you will 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.180
 look for examples of pages and you're going to 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.370
 start working on code that how 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.700
 you will see later it is not very difficult 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.190
 so do not be afraid about it 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.620
 this is then a hosting that like you 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.319
 he said is the physical place where they go to 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.440
 be stored the files of the 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.480
 different pages on the internet this 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.550
 diagram that I have here then shows 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.050
 how anyone works here 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.220
 when you want to enter for example 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.250
 facebook digital facebook.com is 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.200
 petition goes to the internet but so that 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.650
 can finally unfold in the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.870
 The client's computer has to go to the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.989
 server search page to search the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.330
 information this is simply in a 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.980
 hosting and how you work that way 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.160
 you can access any site in this 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.620
 minute 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.840
 and you have to differentiate very well what it is 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.240
 a hosting of a domain usually 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.200
 the people who start in this are you 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.320
 confuse a bit a hosting could be 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.080
 the space or where it is housed 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.120
 the page and the domain is simply the 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.790
 address the www 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.310
 something dotcom for this to buy a 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.050
 domain there are other types of companies or 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.020
 usually the companies that sell 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.420
 hosting also sell domains but that 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.250
 we will talk about it in a next video 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.970
 but I want you to be clear that a 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.760
 domain is the address of the www and the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.530
 hosting is the space where it is hosted 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.020
 the page you to be able to mount any 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.990
 page on the internet you have to have a 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.380
 hosting and you also have to have a 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.210
 domain 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.800

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.470
