could have easily been photoshopped in
there<00:00:53.420> now<00:00:53.809> from<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.020> looks<00:00:54.170> of<00:00:54.260> this<00:00:54.620> weapon

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920

negative<00:00:58.700> 2<00:00:59.120> clip<00:01:00.020> size<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:00.559> it's<00:01:00.890> kind<00:01:01.100> of

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
negative 2 clip size so it's kind of

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.920

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
use that weapon because you'll probably

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.609 
use that weapon because you'll probably
only<00:01:50.420> have<00:01:50.659> enough<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:51.020> kill<00:01:51.200> one<00:01:51.409> or<00:01:51.439> two

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840
