there<00:03:44.160> if<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.300> remember<00:03:45.720> right<00:03:45.960> how<00:03:46.650> I'm<00:03:46.740> gonna

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
there if I remember right how I'm gonna

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.140 
there if I remember right how I'm gonna
check<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.490> make<00:03:47.520> sure<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:47.850> don't<00:03:47.970> mess

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
check this to make sure I don't mess

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.950 
check this to make sure I don't mess
this<00:03:48.330> up<00:03:50.390> on<00:03:52.040> there<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.130> go

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
this up on there you go

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.170 
this up on there you go
yeah<00:03:56.170> so<00:03:56.380> just<00:03:57.340> put<00:03:57.550> it<00:03:57.670> right<00:03:57.700> here<00:03:58.060> in<00:03:58.120> the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
yeah so just put it right here in the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.900 
yeah so just put it right here in the
main<00:03:58.300> folder<00:03:59.250> doesn't<00:04:00.250> matter<00:04:00.370> where<00:04:00.550> and

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
main folder doesn't matter where and

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.870 
main folder doesn't matter where and
then<00:04:01.770> I'm<00:04:02.770> pretty<00:04:02.920> sure<00:04:03.160> you<00:04:03.250> need<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.430> run<00:04:03.580> ad

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
then I'm pretty sure you need to run ad

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.980 
then I'm pretty sure you need to run ad
but<00:04:04.660> do<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.020> want<00:04:05.170> to<00:04:05.230> take<00:04:05.320> in<00:04:05.410> here

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
but do you want to take in here

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.490 
but do you want to take in here
yeah<00:04:07.990> then<00:04:08.710> run<00:04:08.890> a<00:04:08.920> DS<00:04:09.160> alright<00:04:09.460> so<00:04:10.270> this<00:04:11.200> part

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
yeah then run a DS alright so this part

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.610 
yeah then run a DS alright so this part
takes<00:04:11.770> a<00:04:11.920> little<00:04:12.130> bit<00:04:13.050> basically<00:04:14.050> depending

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
takes a little bit basically depending

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.229 
takes a little bit basically depending
on<00:04:14.710> how<00:04:14.860> fast<00:04:15.070> your<00:04:15.220> computer<00:04:15.340> is<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:16.090> could

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
on how fast your computer is you could

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.340 
on how fast your computer is you could
be<00:04:16.359> sitting<00:04:16.600> here<00:04:16.810> for<00:04:17.170> an<00:04:17.820> hour<00:04:18.820> that's<00:04:19.690> the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
be sitting here for an hour that's the

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.780 
be sitting here for an hour that's the
fastest<00:04:20.769> I<00:04:20.859> ever<00:04:20.890> got<00:04:21.100> this<00:04:21.220> done<00:04:21.459> was<00:04:21.579> in<00:04:21.700> the

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
fastest I ever got this done was in the

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.310 
fastest I ever got this done was in the
hour<00:04:21.940> I'm<00:04:22.420> running<00:04:22.690> four<00:04:22.900> gigs<00:04:23.110> in<00:04:23.230> this

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
hour I'm running four gigs in this

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.770 
hour I'm running four gigs in this
computer<00:04:26.400> before<00:04:27.400> getting<00:04:27.820> around<00:04:28.030> basically

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
computer before getting around basically

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.230 
computer before getting around basically
if<00:04:28.900> you<00:04:29.020> have<00:04:29.169> a<00:04:29.200> slower<00:04:29.530> computer<00:04:30.000> with<00:04:31.000> one

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
if you have a slower computer with one

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.120 
if you have a slower computer with one
gigs<00:04:31.450> of<00:04:31.600> RAM<00:04:31.780> this<00:04:32.020> will<00:04:32.260> be<00:04:32.380> done<00:04:32.620> in<00:04:32.890> a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
gigs of RAM this will be done in a

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.940 
gigs of RAM this will be done in a
little<00:04:33.940> under<00:04:34.060> two<00:04:34.330> hours<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.960> tested<00:04:35.890> this

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
little under two hours I tested this

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.730 
little under two hours I tested this
with<00:04:36.130> my<00:04:36.220> old<00:04:36.370> computer<00:04:37.230> well<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.560> other

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
with my old computer well the other

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.400 
with my old computer well the other
computer<00:04:39.100> I<00:04:39.160> have<00:04:39.310> so<00:04:39.760> it<00:04:40.330> runs<00:04:40.720> just<00:04:40.840> fine<00:04:41.050> on

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
computer I have so it runs just fine on

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.550 
computer I have so it runs just fine on
slow<00:04:41.830> computers<00:04:42.720> but<00:04:43.720> it<00:04:43.930> does<00:04:44.050> take<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.350> little

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
slow computers but it does take a little

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.680 
slow computers but it does take a little
while<00:04:46.500> well<00:04:48.090> basically<00:04:49.090> you're<00:04:49.419> gonna<00:04:49.540> have

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
while well basically you're gonna have

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.900 
while well basically you're gonna have
to<00:04:49.780> let<00:04:49.960> this<00:04:50.140> do<00:04:50.410> this<00:04:50.530> thing<00:04:50.740> for<00:04:51.130> when<00:04:51.610> until

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
to let this do this thing for when until

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.720 
to let this do this thing for when until
it<00:04:52.000> gets<00:04:52.150> done<00:04:52.330> once<00:04:53.080> this<00:04:53.260> is<00:04:53.440> done<00:04:53.740> you<00:04:54.610> need

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
it gets done once this is done you need

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.980 
it gets done once this is done you need
to<00:04:54.850> go<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.260> on<00:04:57.930> back<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:58.960> your<00:04:59.200> thing<00:04:59.620> and<00:04:59.919> uh

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
to go to on back to your thing and uh

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.450 
to go to on back to your thing and uh
open<00:05:01.990> your<00:05:02.080> wild<00:05:02.290> rocker<00:05:02.440> again<00:05:02.590> and<00:05:03.010> then

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
open your wild rocker again and then

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.880 
open your wild rocker again and then
you're<00:05:03.700> gonna<00:05:03.820> see<00:05:04.030> maps<00:05:04.330> after<00:05:05.290> it's<00:05:05.710> fully

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
you're gonna see maps after it's fully

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.330 
you're gonna see maps after it's fully
done<00:05:06.130> you<00:05:06.490> need<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:06.729> copy<00:05:07.000> this<00:05:07.450> Maps<00:05:07.750> folder

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
done you need to copy this Maps folder

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.500 
done you need to copy this Maps folder
into<00:05:09.340> AC<00:05:10.000> ultimate<00:05:10.660> repack<00:05:11.110> under<00:05:11.710> I<00:05:12.510> think

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
into AC ultimate repack under I think

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.390 
into AC ultimate repack under I think
it's<00:05:13.660> Ark<00:05:13.900> EMU<00:05:14.350> let<00:05:14.620> me<00:05:14.710> make<00:05:14.890> sure<00:05:14.919> I'm<00:05:15.250> right

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
it's Ark EMU let me make sure I'm right
