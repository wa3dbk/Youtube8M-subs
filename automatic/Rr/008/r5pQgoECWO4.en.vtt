00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:20.030
 to make a change to our blouse 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.840
 that less we are going to accommodate the way it is 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.580
 right way let's say and what I 'm going to 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.580
 to do is to fold it in half 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.030
 so that the two sleeves 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.870
 Y 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.140
 I stayed what is the part of the front 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.649
 outward and the part of the back 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.890
 inward also what we're going to 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.050
 to do is to separate the fabric because as 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.210
 let's cut only we want 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.559
 cut the part of the back and not that 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.799
 we are going to break all the blues 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:00.610
 then let's accommodate the something like that 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:03.640
 with the two sleeves together we separate the 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.280
 front fabric and we leave the fabric of the 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.890
 back I will accept a little bit the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.390
 camera to accommodate the 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.390
 because it has to be 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.640
 exactly in half I advise them 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.640
 join the seams 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.299
 and extend it 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.540
 so that they are left 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.190
 something like that 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.820
 and then what we are going to do is 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.820
 cut 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.130
 horizontal lines throughout 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.130
 the back 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.909
 ok as you can see the light is here 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.000
 shortened you can do the design 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.130
 who want me I went in a kind of 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.540
 curve that went widening but 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.090
 you can make the cut that 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.670
 they want can do the right thing can 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.560
 make the cut not so deep can 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.390
 doing it deep can make a 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.810
 kind of triangle what are they 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.810
 happen 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.690
 once we have finished cutting 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.690
 let's straighten the blouse 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.590
 as at the beginning 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.849
 leaving again the part of the back 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.849
 forward 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.760
 today you can see how it is already open and 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.400
 what we are going to do next is 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.070
 pulling the fabric is why I make a 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:54.860
 cotton type fabric so you can 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:54.860
 Stretch and do not deform or tear 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.170
 let's go strip by strip 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.850
 what we are going to do is 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.980
 is to throw it 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.080
 if you can see how it takes a form 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.040
 different from the other strips 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.040
 let's stretch 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.090
 breathe 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:26.230
 we take from the shores 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.230
 and we pull one by one we give it 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.989
 strips 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.430
 and so on until we finish stretching 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.840
 all 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.840
 strips that will remain 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.060
 good that we already have what is all the 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.730
 blouse 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.700
 cut and stretched can see the 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.190
 difference and good because either taste 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.610
 they can leave it like this or they can start 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.370
 knot one part with the other so that you do not 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:13.280
 is so uncovered and good now 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.280
 I explain how we are going to knot
