make<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.390> sort<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.260> color<00:00:22.470> correction<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.189> so

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
make that sort of color correction I so

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.630 
make that sort of color correction I so
first<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.600> your<00:00:24.660> back<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.369> it's<00:00:26.369> going<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
first on your back and it's going to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.620 
first on your back and it's going to
make<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> sore<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:28.680> grade<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.039> black<00:00:29.630> so

what's making doing to the text I
sometimes<00:00:44.340> bring<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:44.969> text<00:00:45.420> as<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.719> saw

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
sometimes bring in this text as you saw

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.410 
sometimes bring in this text as you saw
in<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.770> other<00:00:46.950> picture<00:00:48.140> make<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.289> bigger

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.130

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
alright so here we have the text alright

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.260 
alright so here we have the text alright
so<00:00:58.559> once<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> text<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.760> just<00:01:00.090> want

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
so once you have the text on just want

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.210 
so once you have the text on just want
to<00:01:00.420> place<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.910> go<00:01:02.910> down<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.270> little<00:01:04.220> black

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
to place it go down this little black

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.460 
to place it go down this little black
and<00:01:05.430> white<00:01:05.580> cookie<00:01:05.880> thing<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.260> go<00:01:07.409> to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and white cookie thing and go to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.160 
and white cookie thing and go to
gradient<00:01:07.890> map<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:09.479> first<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:09.990> you're<00:01:10.049> going

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
gradient map the first one you're going

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.550 
gradient map the first one you're going
to<00:01:10.260> make<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> be<00:01:11.010> black<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:12.210> white

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
to make is going to be black to white

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.800 
to make is going to be black to white
you<00:01:13.560> should<00:01:13.799> make<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.250> normal<00:01:14.460> overlay<00:01:15.270> bring

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you should make the normal overlay bring

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.070 
you should make the normal overlay bring
it<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.200> 60<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.750> makes<00:01:18.900> it

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
it to 60 as you can see it makes it

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:28.760 
it to 60 as you can see it makes it
darker<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:20.600> look<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:21.869> good<00:01:27.680> let<00:01:28.680> me

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
darker and look really good let me

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.249 
darker and look really good let me

going<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.229> change<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.099> color<00:02:08.429> my<00:02:08.700> text<00:02:09.090> by

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
going to change the color my text by

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.170 
going to change the color my text by
rasterize<00:02:09.720> layer<00:02:10.160> image<00:02:11.180> adjustments

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
rasterize layer image adjustments

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.760 
rasterize layer image adjustments
hue/saturation

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
hue/saturation

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.460 
hue/saturation
and<00:02:15.710> there<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:17.070> have<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.090> color<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.200> now

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
and there I have the color of that now

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.260 
and there I have the color of that now
so<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.070> pretty<00:02:20.400> much<00:02:20.490> want<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.850> make<00:02:20.940> the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
so you pretty much want to make the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.340 
so you pretty much want to make the
gradient<00:02:21.540> map<00:02:21.810> three<00:02:22.200> match<00:02:23.100> your<00:02:23.430> text<00:02:23.760> color

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
gradient map three match your text color

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.870 
gradient map three match your text color
all<00:02:25.350> right<00:02:25.440> them<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:26.010> go<00:02:26.190> over<00:02:26.490> gradient<00:02:27.240> map

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
all right them to go over gradient map

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.960 
all right them to go over gradient map
may<00:02:29.880> find<00:02:30.240> one<00:02:30.650> I'm<00:02:31.650> going<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.920> use<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.640> one

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
may find one I'm going to use this one

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.930 
may find one I'm going to use this one
the<00:02:33.240> light<00:02:33.840> dark<00:02:34.380> blue<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:35.070> like<00:02:35.520> yellowish

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
the light dark blue to like yellowish

Tanner shot on huh soft light make this

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.050 
Tanner shot on huh soft light make this
130<00:02:42.830> then<00:02:43.830> we<00:02:43.980> go<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.160> top<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.820> gradient

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
130 then we go on top of the gradient

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.170 
130 then we go on top of the gradient
map<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.750> on<00:02:46.110> top<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.560> all<00:02:46.740> of<00:02:46.770> them<00:02:46.920> go<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.490> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
map to on top of all of them go to the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.200 
map to on top of all of them go to the
block<00:02:48.360> away<00:02:48.510> cooking<00:02:48.810> curves<00:02:50.030> bring<00:02:51.030> this<00:02:51.210> up

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
block away cooking curves bring this up

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.230 
block away cooking curves bring this up
and<00:02:54.210> bring<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.540> down<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.140> little<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:57.060> want

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
and bring that down a little I just want

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.890 
and bring that down a little I just want
to<00:02:57.330> make<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.600> your<00:02:57.660> text<00:02:58.400> gradient<00:02:59.400> overlay

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
to make to your text gradient overlay

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.640 
to make to your text gradient overlay
let's<00:03:00.900> make<00:03:01.050> that<00:03:01.200> overlay<00:03:03.110> make<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.320> black

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
let's make that overlay make the black

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.570 
let's make that overlay make the black
like<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.220> light<00:03:05.490> ash<00:03:05.640> gray<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:08.010> make<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.310> white

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
like a light ash gray and make the white

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:17.660 
like a light ash gray and make the white
bit<00:03:09.210> darker<00:03:13.550> see<00:03:14.550> like<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:16.490> seem<00:03:17.490> a<00:03:17.640> bit

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
bit darker see like that seem a bit

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.860 
bit darker see like that seem a bit

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
later alright so they just want to make

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.460 
later alright so they just want to make
a<00:03:21.959> drop<00:03:22.170> shot<00:03:22.410> real<00:03:22.620> quick<00:03:22.650> distance<00:03:23.610> 0<00:03:24.470> drag

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
a drop shot real quick distance 0 drag

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.210 
a drop shot real quick distance 0 drag
that<00:03:25.590> size<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.120> spread<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.980> your<00:03:28.980> growth

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
that size and the spread and your growth

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.460 
that size and the spread and your growth
I<00:03:29.580> get<00:03:30.270> white<00:03:31.430> screen<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.640> overlay<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.470> drag

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
I get white screen to overlay and drag

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:42.380 
I get white screen to overlay and drag
the<00:03:34.650> size<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.930> about<00:03:36.930> 10<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:40.970> then<00:03:41.970> once<00:03:42.270> you

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
the size to about 10 and then once you

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.060 
the size to about 10 and then once you
have<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.540> i'm<00:03:43.350> just<00:03:43.500> going<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.650> fix<00:03:43.860> the

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
have that i'm just going to fix the

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.100 
have that i'm just going to fix the
curves<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.700> get<00:03:45.120> not<00:03:45.300> so<00:03:45.480> high<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:48.110> this

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
curves I get not so high and that this

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.690 
curves I get not so high and that this
is<00:03:49.260> some<00:03:49.470> really<00:03:49.620> nice<00:03:49.830> color<00:03:50.100> correction<00:03:50.550> in

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
is some really nice color correction in
