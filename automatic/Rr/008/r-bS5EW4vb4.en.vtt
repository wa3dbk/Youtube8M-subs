00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.999
 Check the ball logo alignment again here 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.640
 Putter do this but it was foam at this vertical line 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.120
 Because even in the case of putting it looks from just above the ball 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:22.070
 Foreball is not old or nine 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:26.100
 So if you look at the top of nine people from above, this vertical line is 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:33.030
 Please poised now paragraph 3 also in the Yes I think you straight looks 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:36.770
 Never the target of the case a bit of say this line of just above because it viewed from an oblique 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.590
 In contrast, when you look at it from Sochi, you 'll feel very illusion 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:47.560
 In order to show really straight look at the current situation 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:51.400
 It is like this where it faces the angle of this child line from Ms. 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:56.440
 Really it's not sure straight line If you do not match 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:01.360
 But the I mean turn to the diagonal how much of an angle to match that way is of their own 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:04.670
 Isn't it very difficult to send the ball to really face the sight you see? 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:12.049
 So except putting 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:16.670
 When tee-up and aligning this line, it is difficult to get the right angle contamination to the target . 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.290
 And put the ball on it and push the face face to this 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:25.910
 In parallel 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:31.130
 If the wilderness is knocked down , this vertical line with respect to these nine planes is this vertical line with respect to these nine planes 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:37.090
 Is not it does not look only to the same line when viewed from any angle is to say less of the face surface 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.090
 Image you do not have error bent the illusion absolutely match 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:48.160
 It is better to match the national flag with this target line at the time of the shot you took with your mother 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.690
 It is easy to hit if Ms. Ms. 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.360
 It is how to put together 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:02:00.190
 I started straight to the wheat without any doubt even if I started barley Even now it looks from behind 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:04.210
 I'm driver is oblique tight this even in war you have each other when viewed from directly above 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:09.679
 For example, if it becomes a par 3 iron this will be seen from above more 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:16.010
 Even if it's always right above, this is another view if the view you 're looking at changes the angle 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:21.590
 Since the war is likely to be seen in the different direction where also because lays the subtle Nico's 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.260
 The more you get out of the castle or the more you get out then the landing is good and the landing point is good and the drop point is an error 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.760
 Because it gets bigger 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:33.730
 I'm aware of it and I 'm going to adjust it like this from now on 4 I knew for the first time 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:38.230
 Well distance also struck from somewhere that apart from the direction of me the ball I'm a again question 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:43.250
 The ball's current performance is almost unchanged 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:48.980
 It's already making a new team together like this, but it's also seamless 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.930
 In any angle also hit 360 degrees from the direction of the road or terms of performance made so that the eyes do not know at all 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.230
 That's right does not change 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:01.110
 Even one one really riding taking such like he's does not fly because something stuck excellent 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:03.769
 If you know how to put the logos of the shot and putt 2 ways together and try to use it for your practice, 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.769
 What do you think
