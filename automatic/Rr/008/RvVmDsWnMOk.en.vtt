a long time ago I want to say this was
done<00:04:17.090> in<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.299> early<00:04:17.540> 80s<00:04:17.900> I<00:04:18.049> think<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.620> big

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
done in the early 80s I think the big

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.949 
done in the early 80s I think the big
thing<00:04:18.829> about<00:04:19.040> this<00:04:19.430> is<00:04:19.669> that<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.060> was<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.750> drag

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
thing about this is that it was the drag

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.340 
thing about this is that it was the drag
coefficient<00:04:21.169> lightweight<00:04:22.070> materials<00:04:23.350> almost
