FPS<00:00:26.609> games<00:00:26.939> I'd<00:00:27.060> give<00:00:27.300> Cod<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> bit<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.840> go<00:00:27.990> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
FPS games I'd give Cod a bit of a go and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.349 
FPS games I'd give Cod a bit of a go and
play<00:00:28.859> for<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.100> bit<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.730> here<00:00:29.939> are<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> few<00:00:30.090> things

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
play for a bit so here are a few things

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.330 
play for a bit so here are a few things
to<00:00:30.599> make<00:00:30.630> yourself<00:00:30.960> better<00:00:31.140> at<00:00:31.410> PC<00:00:31.920> gaming<00:00:32.129> in

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
to make yourself better at PC gaming in

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.950 
to make yourself better at PC gaming in
particular<00:00:32.580> now<00:00:33.269> the<00:00:33.330> obvious<00:00:33.720> difference

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
particular now the obvious difference

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.869 
particular now the obvious difference
over<00:00:34.110> PC<00:00:34.350> gaming<00:00:34.590> -<00:00:34.769> console<00:00:35.100> gaming<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.610> that

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
over PC gaming - console gaming is that

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.569 
over PC gaming - console gaming is that
you<00:00:35.970> have<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.239> use<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.449> mouse<00:00:36.840> now<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.829> came

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
you have to use a mouse now I came

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.700 
you have to use a mouse now I came
originally<00:00:39.149> from<00:00:39.570> Halo<00:00:39.899> into<00:00:40.350> counter-strike

originally from Halo into counter-strike
source<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.309> aiming<00:00:41.700> was<00:00:41.850> one<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> harder

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
source and aiming was one of the harder

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.990 
source and aiming was one of the harder
things<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.320> had<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.620> pick<00:00:43.739> up<00:00:43.950> because<00:00:44.790> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
things that I had to pick up because I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.760 
things that I had to pick up because I
just<00:00:45.300> wasn't<00:00:45.600> used<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.989> playing<00:00:46.230> with<00:00:46.440> her<00:00:46.559> or

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
just wasn't used to playing with her or

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.200 
just wasn't used to playing with her or
being<00:00:47.040> so<00:00:47.250> accurate<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.790> mouse<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.120> was

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
being so accurate with a mouse I was

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.180 
being so accurate with a mouse I was
used<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> two<00:00:48.809> joysticks<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.410> now<00:00:49.739> today<00:00:50.039> I

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
used to two joysticks now now today I

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.160 
used to two joysticks now now today I
can't<00:00:50.489> use<00:00:50.610> joysticks<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.000> shit<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:52.020> back

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
can't use joysticks for shit but back

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.680 
can't use joysticks for shit but back
then<00:00:52.440> joysticks<00:00:53.309> were<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.640> my<00:00:54.120> life<00:00:54.329> and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
then joysticks were my my life and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.689 
then joysticks were my my life and
getting<00:00:55.379> used<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> Mouse<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.129> didn't<00:00:56.489> really

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
getting used to Mouse just didn't really

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.010 
getting used to Mouse just didn't really
work<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:56.940> me<00:00:57.059> they<00:00:57.360> were<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.539> few<00:00:57.690> things<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
work for me they were a few things to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.209 
work for me they were a few things to
making<00:00:58.289> used<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.530> mask<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.920> little<00:00:59.129> bit

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
making used to mask that little bit

00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.689 
making used to mask that little bit
easier

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
easier

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.369 
easier
first<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.239> adjust<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.660> sensitivity<00:01:00.870> make

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
first of all adjust the sensitivity make

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.450 
first of all adjust the sensitivity make
sure<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.649> low<00:01:01.829> enough<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.219> you've<00:01:02.340> got

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
sure it's low enough that you've got

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.430 
sure it's low enough that you've got
good<00:01:02.640> accuracy<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.600> not<00:01:03.750> too<00:01:03.989> low<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.199> you

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
good accuracy but not too low that you

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.230 
good accuracy but not too low that you
have<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.710> fling<00:01:05.460> your<00:01:05.610> mouse<00:01:05.789> across<00:01:06.090> your

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
desk to try and turn around and same in

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.880 
desk to try and turn around and same in
the<00:01:09.330> other<00:01:09.450> sort<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.960> spectrum<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.740> if

the other sort of spectrum of that if

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.050 
the other sort of spectrum of that if
it's<00:01:11.040> too<00:01:11.189> high<00:01:11.369> you're<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.820> gonna<00:01:11.970> be

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
it's too high you're just not gonna be

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.100 
it's too high you're just not gonna be
able<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> gather<00:01:12.330> accuracy<00:01:12.810> you're<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.049> to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
able to gather accuracy you're going to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.830 
able to gather accuracy you're going to
be<00:01:13.229> moving<00:01:13.950> left<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.939> right<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.330> down<00:01:15.570> too

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
be moving left and right up down too

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.340 
be moving left and right up down too
much

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
much

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.010 
much
thus<00:01:16.799> making<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.189> gameplay<00:01:17.520> very<00:01:17.939> poor<00:01:18.240> if

thus making your gameplay very poor if

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.210 
thus making your gameplay very poor if
you<00:01:19.140> haven't<00:01:19.320> already<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> gaming<00:01:20.040> mouse

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
you haven't already get a gaming mouse

you haven't already get a gaming mouse
now<00:01:20.520> gaming<00:01:21.060> mice<00:01:21.560> really<00:01:22.560> provide<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
now gaming mice really provide the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.469 
now gaming mice really provide the
accuracy<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.460> need<00:01:23.700> if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.299> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
accuracy that you need if you if you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.880 
accuracy that you need if you if you
already<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> gaming<00:01:25.259> mouse<00:01:25.439> make<00:01:25.740> sure
