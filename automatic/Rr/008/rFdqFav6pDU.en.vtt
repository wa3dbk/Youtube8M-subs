00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.140 
just goes to show you it's a quick
simple<00:03:25.110> experiment<00:03:25.800> you<00:03:26.550> know<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:26.820> isn't<00:03:27.120> a

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
simple experiment you know this isn't a

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.800 
simple experiment you know this isn't a
research<00:03:28.850> experiment<00:03:29.850> it's<00:03:30.239> not<00:03:30.420> backed<00:03:30.660> by

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
research experiment it's not backed by

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.630 
research experiment it's not backed by
research<00:03:30.989> it's<00:03:31.500> just<00:03:31.680> real<00:03:31.920> life<00:03:32.160> research

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
research it's just real life research

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.949 
research it's just real life research
okay<00:03:33.090> you're<00:03:33.330> going<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.510> see<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.660> big

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
okay you're going to see a big

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.530 
okay you're going to see a big
difference<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.620> how<00:03:34.680> these<00:03:35.640> living<00:03:36.180> creatures

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
difference in how these living creatures

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.900 
difference in how these living creatures
are<00:03:36.660> made<00:03:36.840> by<00:03:37.080> what<00:03:37.290> they<00:03:37.440> eat<00:03:37.470> okay<00:03:38.310> if<00:03:38.820> you

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
are made by what they eat okay if you

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.280 
are made by what they eat okay if you
want<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.150> learn<00:03:39.209> more<00:03:39.269> about<00:03:39.510> this<00:03:39.870> just<00:03:40.140> do

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
want to learn more about this just do

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.280 
want to learn more about this just do
more<00:03:40.880> experimentation<00:03:41.880> on<00:03:42.120> yourself<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:43.140> can

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
more experimentation on yourself you can

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.240 
more experimentation on yourself you can
actually<00:03:43.470> read<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:43.920> book<00:03:44.100> called

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
actually read the book called

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.940 
actually read the book called
pottinger's<00:03:44.790> cats<00:03:45.090> okay<00:03:46.080> he<00:03:46.260> has<00:03:46.350> a<00:03:46.380> book<00:03:46.709> and

the cats died he would actually look at
the<00:04:20.850> bone<00:04:21.090> structure<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:21.630> he<00:04:21.690> showed<00:04:21.900> that

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
the bone structure and he showed that

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.020 
the bone structure and he showed that
the<00:04:22.140> cats<00:04:22.349> were<00:04:22.500> fed<00:04:22.770> conventional<00:04:23.610> cat<00:04:23.789> food

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
the cats were fed conventional cat food

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.180 
the cats were fed conventional cat food
and<00:04:24.210> actually<00:04:24.810> very<00:04:25.110> weak<00:04:25.380> brittle<00:04:25.740> bones<00:04:25.919> and

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
and actually very weak brittle bones and

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
and actually very weak brittle bones and
it<00:04:26.250> holds<00:04:26.490> in<00:04:26.760> their<00:04:26.880> bone

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
it holds in their bone

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.059 
it holds in their bone
even<00:04:27.479> in<00:04:27.569> their<00:04:27.660> skulls<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.289> they<00:04:28.770> actually

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
even in their skulls and they actually

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:30.800 
even in their skulls and they actually
had<00:04:29.220> bones<00:04:29.490> I<00:04:29.669> weren't<00:04:29.910> even<00:04:30.090> fully<00:04:30.300> formed

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
had bones I weren't even fully formed

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.360 
had bones I weren't even fully formed
and<00:04:30.990> then<00:04:31.530> on<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.710> other<00:04:31.740> side<00:04:32.069> he<00:04:32.190> showed

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
and then on the other side he showed

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.249

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
that the bones of the dead cats just

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.520 
that the bones of the dead cats just
from<00:04:34.440> age<00:04:34.819> that<00:04:35.819> Drake<00:04:36.060> raw<00:04:36.599> milk<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.050> meat

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
from age that Drake raw milk and meat

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.710 
from age that Drake raw milk and meat
their<00:04:38.520> bone<00:04:38.699> structure<00:04:39.030> was<00:04:39.150> strong<00:04:39.419> and<00:04:39.449> they

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
their bone structure was strong and they

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.120 
their bone structure was strong and they
didn't<00:04:39.990> have<00:04:40.080> holes<00:04:40.289> in<00:04:40.410> their<00:04:40.560> bones<00:04:40.740> so<00:04:41.069> you

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
didn't have holes in their bones so you

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.850 
didn't have holes in their bones so you
can<00:04:41.280> learn<00:04:41.400> more<00:04:41.460> by<00:04:41.699> about<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.860> about

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
can learn more by about that about

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.830 
can learn more by about that about
