00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.670
 in our harsh climate 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.490
 heat supply matter literally 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.249
 life and death do not need to be a specialist 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.769
 to watch the winter eternal breakthroughs corpse 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:17.710
 on smaller blocks of ice a growing steam board 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.410
 understand how much money and resources are there 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.630
 disappears into the empty present economically 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.369
 unstable situation and special attention 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.980
 the country's leadership to the question 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.570
 energy costs have caused recent 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.029
 consideration of the draft federal law 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.390
 about energy saving and increasing 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.860
 energy efficiency 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.750
 governing principles and approaches 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.610
 energy saving issues 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.530
 but despite the fact that the law is now 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.360
 passes consideration in Moscow we 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.440
 still as the great dmitry said 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.539
 Mendeleev drown the sky bills like this 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.550
 previously produced and produced 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.730
 to this day pipe insulation 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.370
 on this site we see the insulation 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.399
 from the use of mineral wool and related 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.399
 of materials 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.009
 here we see another example 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:20.380
 classical insulation seems to be 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.439
 everything is done for glory 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.140
 specials were used 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.509
 polyurethane shells on top applied 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.330
 dyed a layer of fiberglass but 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.939
 as we see anyway remained not 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.369
 isolated plot because there was no 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.880
 such material that decided this 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.880
 the problem 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.200
 Well, armor is often not without participation 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.570
 human atmospheric phenomena 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.830
 factor it all looks later 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.830
 short time 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.770
 part of the heat directed through these pipes 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.740
 to our homes and businesses literally 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.180
 air flies away what's called heating 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.500
 faces 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.180
 Naturally about any rational 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.990
 energy use 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.450
 there can be no question here so this 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.570
 problem can be solved with the help of liquid 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.830
 ultrafine thermal insulation corundum 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.790
 allowing with less material 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.980
 labor costs 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.080
 effectively insulate not only 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.350
 straight pipe sections but also 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.270
 areas with complex geometry 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.720
 surface insulation life 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.780
 corundum 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.989
 is about 15 years while she 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.550
 resistant to atmospheric phenomena and 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.220
 UV compared 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.660
 with other insulating materials 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.720
 corundum has the lowest rate 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.760
 thermal conductivity which allows to reduce to 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.730
 minimum heat loss throughout 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.820
 pipeline length is a coating 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.400
 is anti-vandal has aesthetic 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.200
 appearance and easy to repair 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.180
 because unlike the usual 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.459
 thermal insulation consisting of several 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.610
 layers guarantor is 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.209
 single-layer coating thickness from 1 to 3 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.370
 millimeters 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.950
 allowing to provide reliable 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.340
 high thermal protection for long 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.860
 the years 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.850
 As for the issue of energy saving 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.459
 in construction 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.040
 then the application of material corundum is one of 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.060
 the most successful decisions 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.310
 environmental friendliness and fire safety 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.140
 material allows you to use it for 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.019
 effective thermal protection of residential and 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.100
 industrial facilities both outside and 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.780
 indoors introduced back in 1995 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.510
 year requirements for thermal insulation 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.610
 the quality of the exterior of the building led 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.470
 to the massive use of multilayer 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.930
 designs using 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.849
 not enough effective insulation 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.489
 which dramatically complicated the construction 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.530
 affecting the workload and overall 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.829
 cost of work besides 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.400
 heterogeneity of materials used 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.739
 one and a half to two times 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.199
 reduced the life of the coating and 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.090
 created certain problems when 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.229
 future repair ultra thin 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.690
 thermal insulation corundum 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.789
 solves such problems easily and reliably 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.020
 allowing you to completely give up 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.639
 multilayer walls 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.370
 because the layer of corundum is somewhat thick 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.160
 millimeters performs the same functions as 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.870
 standard multilayer heat insulation to 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.419
 the same thermal insulation material 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.550
 corundum can be used in construction 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.910
 any part of the building from the foundation to 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.229
 roofs with any method of construction 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.389
 the introduction of such technologies in our lives 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.280
 in the near future will allow 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.889
 significantly reduce heat consumption 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.940
 energy and significantly reduce costs 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.009
 for heating 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.039
 after all, no matter how much they call our country 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.690
 most energetically powerful 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:10.509
 waste of precious 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.509
 richer resources have not made anyone yet
