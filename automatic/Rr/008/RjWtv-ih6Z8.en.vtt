00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.480 

so<00:00:03.300> hey<00:00:03.720> guys<00:00:03.750> today<00:00:04.560> we<00:00:04.830> are<00:00:04.859> doing<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.310> Red

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
so hey guys today we are doing the Red

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.830 
so hey guys today we are doing the Red
Bull<00:00:05.759> milk<00:00:06.720> challenge<00:00:08.389> what<00:00:09.389> we're<00:00:09.510> gonna<00:00:09.599> do

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
Bull milk challenge what we're gonna do

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.680 
Bull milk challenge what we're gonna do
is<00:00:10.050> mix<00:00:10.320> Red<00:00:10.559> Bull<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.070> milk<00:00:11.610> together<00:00:11.759> now<00:00:12.150> so

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
is mix Red Bull and milk together now so

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.020 
is mix Red Bull and milk together now so
Red<00:00:12.900> Bull<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.290> an<00:00:13.500> acidic<00:00:13.830> drink<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.429> there<00:00:14.849> is

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
Red Bull is an acidic drink and there is

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.810 
Red Bull is an acidic drink and there is
protein<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.630> milk<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.680> when<00:00:16.890> those<00:00:17.039> two<00:00:17.369> mixed

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
protein and milk so when those two mixed

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.970 
protein and milk so when those two mixed
together<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.480> creates<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:19.109> salt<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.800> it

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
together it creates this salt and it

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.010 
together it creates this salt and it
coagulates<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.699> makes<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.210> little<00:00:21.390> gross

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
coagulates and makes a little gross

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.019 
coagulates and makes a little gross
looking<00:00:22.350> foam<00:00:22.650> stuff<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.460> that's<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.760> science

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
looking foam stuff so that's the science

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.410 
looking foam stuff so that's the science
behind<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.630> we're<00:00:24.900> gonna<00:00:25.099> drink<00:00:26.099> it

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
behind it and we're gonna drink it

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.080 
behind it and we're gonna drink it
scientifically<00:00:28.010> science<00:00:29.010> alright<00:00:29.699> let's<00:00:29.910> do

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
scientifically science alright let's do

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:55.790 
scientifically science alright let's do
this<00:00:30.300> go<00:00:52.280> let<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.430> combine<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.809> settle<00:00:55.199> what's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
this go let it combine and settle what's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.200 
this go let it combine and settle what's
the<00:00:55.890> word<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.219> our<00:00:56.460> powers<00:00:56.879> combined

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the word with our powers combined

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.580 
the word with our powers combined
quietly<00:00:57.629> look<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.020> starting<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
quietly look it's starting you see the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.670 
quietly look it's starting you see the
cloudiness<00:00:58.920> when<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.520> cloudy<00:00:59.730> oh<00:01:00.090> yeah<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
cloudiness when it's cloudy oh yeah it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.100 
cloudiness when it's cloudy oh yeah it
just<00:01:01.710> gets<00:01:01.949> super<00:01:02.219> cloudy<00:01:02.460> okay<00:01:03.300> guys<00:01:03.629> we're

Oh guys hey you know drink another glass

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:33.470 
Oh guys hey you know drink another glass
man<00:02:28.010> how'd<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.250> do<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:30.860> took<00:02:31.860> one<00:02:32.099> sip<00:02:32.480> are

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
man how'd you do that I took one sip are

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.030 
man how'd you do that I took one sip are
you<00:02:33.569> crying<00:02:36.349> I<00:02:37.349> can't

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
you crying I can't

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.610 
you crying I can't
it's<00:02:38.340> texture<00:02:38.940> is<00:02:38.970> weird<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.630> then<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.349> milk

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
it's texture is weird and then the milk

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.550 
it's texture is weird and then the milk
and<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.880> proteins<00:02:42.269> all<00:02:42.480> about<00:02:42.930> here<00:02:43.170> when<00:02:43.440> you

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
and the proteins all about here when you

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.089 
and the proteins all about here when you
drink<00:02:43.769> it

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
drink it

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:55.520 
drink it
think<00:02:44.849> of<00:02:44.970> yogurt<00:02:45.299> I<00:02:54.140> didn't<00:02:55.140> believe<00:02:55.349> it

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
think of yogurt I didn't believe it

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.620 
think of yogurt I didn't believe it
enough<00:02:55.799> really<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.760> think<00:02:57.060> that's<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.480> same

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
enough really I think that's the same

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.089 
enough really I think that's the same
cool<00:02:57.900> I'm<00:02:58.140> usually<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.530> one<00:02:58.560> who<00:02:58.680> throws<00:02:58.950> out

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
cool I'm usually the one who throws out

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.670 
cool I'm usually the one who throws out
oh<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.959> know<00:03:01.079> you<00:03:01.170> got<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> drink<00:03:01.500> another

bad<00:03:29.329> what<00:03:30.329> happened<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:32.510> guess<00:03:33.510> over<00:03:33.870> time<00:03:34.139> it

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
bad what happened I guess over time it
