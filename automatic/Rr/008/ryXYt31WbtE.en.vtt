00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.639
 having people this is thomas i hope that 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.840
 you alright guys for me is 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.190
 really great 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.139
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.289
 new video tutorial on minecraft 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.720
 to install maps via your pc 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.939
 to your ps3 so today I you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.920
 showed with new york and a mini map 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.630
 gta5 so for that you will have to 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.800
 download the winrar files that get 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.630
 will find in the description 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.679
 then you will have to open them and 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 extract the records ps3 and ps3 had on 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.059
 your office you will then put 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.950
 a usb key in the pc in the usb key 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.719
 you will create a folder that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.340
 is called ps3 so you write it 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.890
 exactly like me in the video 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.600
 inside this ps3 folder you 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.969
 create a new folder that will be called 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.190
 save data so I would put you well the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.940
 tutorial written in the description for not 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.910
 you were wrong 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.410
 and then once in this folder cf 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.340
 data you go simple it's all 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.010
 just dragged the file npe b and c 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.570
 is full of numbers in this folder 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.729
 this date has so you do it with 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.979
 the two folders you have 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.310
 previously extracted on your desktop 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.650
 so with both ps3 folders hooted ps3 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.509
 anyway so you extract well the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.000
 file starting with ntv 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.040
 and once both will be put in 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.710
 the yves saint file you will not have 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.210
 more than go on the ps3 so 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.610
 you can do this tutorial with anyone 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.659
 which maps downloaded on the internet I 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.060
 you would put a site together 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.619
 several maaf so once on the ps3 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.659
 you put the usb key into the port 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.340
 right from the ps3 you go in 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.799
 utilities saved data 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.840
 usb devices and then you will have 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.119
 the two minecraft maps you make 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.930
 triangle copy for both maps you 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.270
 accept etc 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.680
 if ever there to messages and the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.329
 following once both will be 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.810
 copied you will just have to launch 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.130
 minecraft us afterwards you 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.930
 wait for small loads and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.210
 cetera you accept the different 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.670
 messages you play and then that's it 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.049
 will charge a little bit long the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.790
 time that it will load the maps 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.799
 once the mavs are loaded 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.820
 you will see them as if they are 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.259
 your maps 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.599
 so then you will not be left 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.580
 than to click on them to load them the 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.710
 only drawback is that it is not 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.690
 you who would have created 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.670
 map this is going to put you a message like 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.380
 what the trophies will be disabled 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.180
 but well everyone is not playing at 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.460
 minecraft to get trophies 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.870
 we can also play for fun so 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.280
 there you can have fun on 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.450
 great maps like new york 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.220
 as you will see in the sequel 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.120
 of video with all the big 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.340
 buildings etc 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.990
 the skyscrapers really a very map 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.240
 well done I'll put both maps 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.230
 that I showed you in the video I 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.690
 you will put them in the description 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.420
 as well as a site gathering really 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.020
 many maps maps for the pvp 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.360
 etc. 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.860
