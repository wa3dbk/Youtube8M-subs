00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.990
 and then personal youtube knew what 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.870
 with samsung galaxy s 5 and i'll show 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.670
 for you the functionality of the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.460
 personal digital printing 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.900
 That's right, and I'll explain to you. 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.880
 How does it work? 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.330
 I'll set up my 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.850
 This is the level of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.730
 security is that digital printing 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.699
 so let's go there settings 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.210
 we have here in quick configurations 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.700
 we have here the digital reader 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.559
 let's go then that the manager of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.809
 digital printing no print 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.270
 digitally recorded then we go 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.930
 to do will register an impression 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.100
 recognition of 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.110
 fingerprint works correctly 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.700
 your fingerprint needs to be 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.699
 registered is stored in your 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.699
 device after registering there you can 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.160
 is to use your fingerprint for 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.859
 below the lock with 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.500
 fingerprint check account 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.369
 samsung and pay with paypal then that already 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.720
 are one of the three features with 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.560
 fingerprint 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.000
 Ok guys then one ok he talks and 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.740
 register the fingerprint he speaks 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.790
 To pass the finger, look, you're talking about the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.290
 schematic and how it puts the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.509
 indicator but I'm going to put my thumb 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.460
 here we go there first the already the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.520
 quadradinho already changed color to let 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.030
 closest to the second 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.590
 let's go here until we complete the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.590
 last quadrant lior 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.830
 now it's going to dictate a 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.520
 password here has to be at least 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.930
 password to use as a password. 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.070
 alternative to your prints 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.480
 digital 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.510
 So, for example, what are we going to do? 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.550
 do here we will put here 11 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:15.360
 11 which for example 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:18.600
 ok 111 for example continue 111 ok 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.460
 so fingerprint has been recorded is 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:27.700
 touch to go to check the lock selection 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:29.830
 screen to stop there ok to go 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.600
 select the screen lock and then 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.910
 set the fingerprint as your 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.910
 screen lock method it 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.170
 hurting the Portuguese is not right 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.970
 fingerprint 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.400
 We have already selected touch on the 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.260
 screen lock is protected with a 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.550
 locking by fingerprint let's see 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.620
 if now is running person is 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.650
 here asking let's pass an indicator 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.120
 that he is not the one without 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.030
 correspondence 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.980
 Let's go over here again, without 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:12.600
 Now match the thumb 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.880
 recognized soon unlocked the 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.600
 the right device but if I do not want 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:24.370
 more for example the indicator you want 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:27.450
 the indicator you can register your 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.450
 number up to 3 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.989
 so the alternative or here the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.850
 recognized it is possible to register up to 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.860
 three fingerprints 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.700
 ah but I want to erase the one I did 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.110
 so you come here to remove registry 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.280
 you will want to remove with this 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.140
 fingerprint here comes and removes a 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.410
 fingerprint will be removed from the 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.130
 record the type of screen lock will be 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.630
 changed 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.730
 slide, ok , that's it 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:09.280
 Let's see how the screen lock got 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:11.920
 Now then slide right personnel is 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.110
 this can take up to three impressions 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.239
 digital and recorded on this side can be 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:22.450
 having a thumb is yours, for example. 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.360
 girlfriend understood from his wife 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.330
 some people do not like your daughter 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.110
 Your son, your father, understood to be able to 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.350
 move on your cell phone 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:39.340
 or just your understanding of the staff then this 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:42.550
 it is safe he says that it is as if 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.470
 a certain level of security is a self 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.570
 I have not seen yet, you need to study right in 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.570
 those who say they do not read the honey right 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.330
 that he read right understood is not seen 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.150
 big difficulties right but there are people 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.660
 The one who talks about what he has already mocked is a 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:02.560
 lots of such stuff with the digital reader 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:05.920
 also had the apple 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.320
 says that it is not 100% safe either 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.810
 method but do not do what at least 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.350
 he already inhibited a little there I have 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.180
 that you pass here and give nothing and if 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.670
 You type have to have hair 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.130
 less one letter and 4 think 4 or 5 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.350
 numbers have also inhibits a bit too 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.360
 Do you want to unblock by password? 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.610
 and is also personal 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.550
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.550
 liked do not forget settings 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.260
 here the digital reader 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.980
 That's the functionality there for you. 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.900
 do 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.570
 let's focus on what it is to focus on because 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.060
 background has chosen is the functionality 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.670
 digital player there for the safety of 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.300
 your device what they see it is 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:53.230
 which is more information in the states 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:56.470
 united the iphones 5 5 s 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:59.350
 after apple adopted or biometrics 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.590
 said that the number of thefts decreased 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.760
 Fuck you and with samsung. 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.850
 probably with this reader here 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.480
 also have the same effect also come 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:14.920
 greatly reduce theft because the 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.660
 the person with these intentions does not 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.090
 will more steal this type of device 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.880
 because of this security that 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.560
 virtually destroyed the device but 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.320
 You should also have your way there to 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.650
 to be able to unlock there it should have 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.860
 I fixed a way there to be able to 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.230
 to cheat that is nothing is by 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.630
 example on cell phone nothing is 100% guaranteed 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.600
 not even apple can block your 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:44.680
 devices and always have a break game 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.360
 to do there cross there and so 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:52.810
 unlock your phone 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:55.600
 just as I said something and active 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:58.180
 that the right google google then is 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.730
 This if you liked the ladybug leaves the 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.900
 Personal touch message thank you and see you later 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.900
 said the staff
