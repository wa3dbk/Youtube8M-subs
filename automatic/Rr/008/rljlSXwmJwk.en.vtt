00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.990 
little hard to see since minor blacks
have<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> black<00:00:48.090> handle<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.820> part<00:00:50.820> that

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
have a black handle and the part that

have a black handle and the part that

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
but it is also plastic so I do wish that

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.740 
but it is also plastic so I do wish that
this<00:00:57.390> was<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.050> padded<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.730> shoulder<00:01:00.120> resting

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
this was a padded like shoulder resting

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.210 
this was a padded like shoulder resting
but<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.530> adjustable<00:01:03.830> but<00:01:04.830> that's<00:01:05.010> okay

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
but it is adjustable but that's okay

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.280 
but it is adjustable but that's okay
