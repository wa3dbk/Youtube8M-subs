so Ben tell us a little bit about the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.730 
so Ben tell us a little bit about the
Oakland<00:00:24.300> extreme<00:00:24.660> pan<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.080> used<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.500> play<00:00:25.650> with

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
Oakland extreme pan I used to play with

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.580 
Oakland extreme pan I used to play with
the<00:00:25.859> k-factor<00:00:26.390> blade<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:28.109> always<00:00:28.410> found

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
the k-factor blade and I always found

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.109 
the k-factor blade and I always found
that<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.920> didn't<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.220> enough<00:00:29.250> stop<00:00:29.670> for<00:00:29.970> me

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
that it didn't have enough stop for me

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.700 
that it didn't have enough stop for me
didn't<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.480> enough<00:00:30.689> speed<00:00:30.990> not<00:00:31.470> slightly

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
didn't have enough speed not slightly

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.620 
didn't have enough speed not slightly
enough<00:00:31.890> power<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:33.149> always<00:00:33.300> really<00:00:33.540> wanted

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
enough power and I always really wanted

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.720 
enough power and I always really wanted
them<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> come<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.559> more<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> street

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
them to come up with more on the street

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.000 
them to come up with more on the street
plans<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.600> has<00:00:36.750> really<00:00:36.780> hit<00:00:37.200> home<00:00:37.380> it's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
plans so this has really hit home it's

it's fantastic it's is you easy access
to<00:00:40.980> spin<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.879> bit<00:00:42.059> more<00:00:42.210> power<00:00:42.450> both<00:00:43.020> on

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
to spin a little bit more power both on

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.580 
to spin a little bit more power both on
from<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> ground<00:00:43.829> strokes<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.059> serve

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
from the ground strokes and and on serve

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.630 
from the ground strokes and and on serve
really<00:00:46.590> found<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.829> extra<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.460> serve

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
really found that extra on serve

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
conversely to you I actually prefer the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.179 
conversely to you I actually prefer the
1820<00:01:06.390> version<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.320> um<00:01:07.409> P<00:01:07.560> fills<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
1820 version the um P fills in the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.039 
1820 version the um P fills in the
handle<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.700> makes<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.090> more<00:01:09.210> solid<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.020> whole

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
handle it makes it more solid the whole

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.320 
handle it makes it more solid the whole
racket<00:01:10.560> feels<00:01:10.950> very<00:01:11.159> solid<00:01:11.430> I'm<00:01:11.820> thirty<00:01:12.090> three

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
racket feels very solid I'm thirty three

racket feels very solid I'm thirty three
hundred<00:01:12.630> four<00:01:12.840> grams<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.350> really<00:01:13.560> does<00:01:13.740> pass

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
hundred four grams it really does pass

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:14.690 
hundred four grams it really does pass
through<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> ball

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
through the ball

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.880 
through the ball
now<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> also<00:01:15.390> used<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.780> use<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.170> came<00:01:16.380> out<00:01:16.590> K

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
now I also used to use the came out K

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.310 
now I also used to use the came out K
factor<00:01:17.280> version<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.700> these<00:01:17.820> racquets<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.420> I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
factor version of these racquets and I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.649 
factor version of these racquets and I
have<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> little<00:01:20.310> go<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.790> BL<00:01:21.030> explains<00:01:21.450> as

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
have a little go with the BL explains as

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.840 
have a little go with the BL explains as
well<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.979> actually<00:01:23.040> think<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
well and I actually think this is the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.600 
well and I actually think this is the
best<00:01:24.060> racquet<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> blade<00:01:25.259> line<00:01:25.500> thus<00:01:26.340> far

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
best racquet in the blade line thus far

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.270 
best racquet in the blade line thus far
the<00:01:27.360> 1820<00:01:27.930> string<00:01:28.170> pattern<00:01:28.500> really<00:01:28.740> gives<00:01:29.189> you

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the 1820 string pattern really gives you

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.800 
the 1820 string pattern really gives you
a<00:01:29.310> nice<00:01:29.460> tight<00:01:29.820> sweet<00:01:30.119> spot<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:30.689> go

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
a nice tight sweet spot you really go

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.120 
a nice tight sweet spot you really go
where<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.110> balls<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.680> there's<00:01:31.799> plenty<00:01:32.100> of

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
where the balls go and there's plenty of

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.670 
where the balls go and there's plenty of
control<00:01:32.579> there's<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.479> don't<00:01:33.509> find<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.320> problem

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
control there's I don't find the problem

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.609 
control there's I don't find the problem
creating<00:01:35.130> spin<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.600> coming<00:01:37.380> up<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
creating spin with it and coming up to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.260 
creating spin with it and coming up to
the<00:01:37.710> next<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.280> solid<00:01:38.579> feeling<00:01:38.790> racquet

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the next just a solid feeling racquet

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.510 
the next just a solid feeling racquet
for<00:01:39.780> such<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> light<00:01:40.470> framing<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.159> are<00:01:41.310> very
