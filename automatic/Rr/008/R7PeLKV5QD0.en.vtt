ahead and put it on momentum and move
into<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.610> work<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:39.680> kind<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.830> switch<00:02:41.040> around

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
into this work I kind of a switch around

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.620 
into this work I kind of a switch around
with<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.519> just<00:02:41.820> for<00:02:41.970> fun<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.150> know<00:02:42.450> have<00:02:42.570> a

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
with this just for fun you know have a

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.479 
with this just for fun you know have a
different<00:02:42.959> weapons<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.590> here<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.250> know<00:02:44.340> what

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
different weapons in here you know what

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.580 
different weapons in here you know what
gives<00:02:44.820> us<00:02:44.940> that's<00:02:45.269> for<00:02:45.390> power<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.019> this<00:02:46.440> is

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
gives us that's for power and this is

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.800 
gives us that's for power and this is
for<00:02:46.739> my<00:02:46.890> accuracy<00:02:47.310> as<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.360> can<00:02:48.480> tell<00:02:48.690> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
for my accuracy as you can tell the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.060 
for my accuracy as you can tell the
damage<00:02:49.140> like<00:02:49.380> 720<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.610> damage<00:02:51.030> on<00:02:51.299> the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
damage like 720 and the damage on the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.380 
damage like 720 and the damage on the
this<00:02:53.070> thing<00:02:53.310> can<00:02:53.489> do<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:54.530> 894<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:56.010> it's<00:02:56.160> a

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
this thing can do is 894 but it's a

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.420 
this thing can do is 894 but it's a
average<00:02:57.390> speed<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.290> accuracy<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.160> not<00:02:59.310> as

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
average speed and accuracy is not as

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.470 
average speed and accuracy is not as
good<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.410> won't<00:03:02.190> be<00:03:02.280> hitting<00:03:02.519> as<00:03:02.760> much<00:03:05.480> so

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
good so I won't be hitting as much so

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.150 
good so I won't be hitting as much so
but<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.110> pretty<00:03:07.530> easy<00:03:07.680> task<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:09.950> kind<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.040> was

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
but a pretty easy task I kind of was

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.039 
but a pretty easy task I kind of was
developing<00:03:11.519> in<00:03:11.610> my<00:03:11.640> next<00:03:11.850> class<00:03:12.000> videos<00:03:12.510> i<00:03:12.630> had
