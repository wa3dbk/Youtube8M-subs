yo Elliott well today's question is a

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.490 
yo Elliott well today's question is a
text<00:00:15.330> question<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.780> comes<00:00:15.929> from<00:00:16.049> our<00:00:16.199> friend

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
text question that comes from our friend

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.760 
text question that comes from our friend
who<00:00:16.650> has<00:00:16.859> one<00:00:17.580> leg<00:00:17.910> shorter<00:00:18.420> than<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.560> other

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
who has one leg shorter than the other

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.759 
who has one leg shorter than the other
here's<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.460> picture<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.880> he<00:00:21.150> sent<00:00:21.480> us<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.960> way

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
here's a picture that he sent us the way

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.160 
here's a picture that he sent us the way
he<00:00:22.949> describes<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:24.390> leg<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.840> think<00:00:25.050> it's

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
he describes it is one leg I think it's

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.470 
he describes it is one leg I think it's
his<00:00:25.289> left<00:00:25.500> leg<00:00:25.740> sort<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.160> hikes<00:00:26.640> up<00:00:26.880> higher<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
his left leg sort of hikes up higher and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.019 
his left leg sort of hikes up higher and
rotates<00:00:28.230> out<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:29.070> bit<00:00:29.429> more<00:00:29.640> than<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> other

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
rotates out a bit more than the other

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.580 
rotates out a bit more than the other
one<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.869> very<00:00:31.050> first<00:00:31.140> thing<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.410> want<00:00:31.560> to

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
one so the very first thing you want to

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.180 
one so the very first thing you want to
consider<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.219> do<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.420> functional<00:00:34.350> or

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
consider is do you have a functional or

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.389 
consider is do you have a functional or
a<00:00:35.270> structural<00:00:36.270> leg<00:00:36.899> length<00:00:37.230> discrepancy<00:00:37.590> that

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
a structural leg length discrepancy that

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.360 
a structural leg length discrepancy that
basically<00:00:38.790> means<00:00:39.090> are<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.870> born<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.950> one

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
basically means are you born with one

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.750 
basically means are you born with one
femur<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:42.960> lower<00:00:43.260> leg<00:00:43.559> where<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.550> bones

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
femur or one lower leg where the bones

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.410 
femur or one lower leg where the bones
are<00:00:45.030> shorter<00:00:45.629> than<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> other<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.920> or<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:48.329> you

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
are shorter than the other one or do you

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.049 
are shorter than the other one or do you
have<00:00:48.539> muscular<00:00:49.039> imbalances<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.700> side<00:00:51.030> of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
have muscular imbalances on one side of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.229 
have muscular imbalances on one side of
your<00:00:51.600> body<00:00:51.960> that's<00:00:52.350> causing<00:00:52.680> your<00:00:53.039> hip<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
your body that's causing your hip to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.889 
your body that's causing your hip to
hike<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:56.160> teach<00:00:56.940> my<00:00:57.270> string<00:00:57.539> ecology

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
hike up so I teach my string ecology

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.569 
hike up so I teach my string ecology
students<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.379> my<00:00:58.500> advanced<00:00:58.800> students<00:00:59.370> how<00:00:59.550> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
students in my advanced students how to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.229 
students in my advanced students how to
do<00:00:59.879> muscular<00:01:00.739> imbalance<00:01:01.739> test<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.550> see<00:01:02.820> like

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
do muscular imbalance test to see like

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.690 
do muscular imbalance test to see like
we<00:01:03.809> call<00:01:03.960> them<00:01:04.080> leg<00:01:04.680> length<00:01:04.890> discrepancy<00:01:05.010> test

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
we call them leg length discrepancy test

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.090 
we call them leg length discrepancy test
to<00:01:06.420> see<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:07.080> actually<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:08.000> functional

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
to see if it's actually a functional

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.620 
to see if it's actually a functional
discrepancy<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.310> way<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:12.030> teach<00:01:12.479> our

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
discrepancy that way we can teach our

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.450 
discrepancy that way we can teach our
clients<00:01:12.810> how<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.140> stretch<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.830> right<00:01:13.950> muscles

the<00:01:15.180> best<00:01:15.479> thing<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.159> just

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the best thing for you to to do is just

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.850 
the best thing for you to to do is just
to<00:01:17.400> look<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> mirror<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.409> notice

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
to look in the mirror and if you notice

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.730 
to look in the mirror and if you notice
one<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.729> hip<00:01:20.909> bones<00:01:21.150> sort<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.049> hikes<00:01:22.439> up

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
one of your hip bones sort of hikes up

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.399 
one of your hip bones sort of hikes up
or<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.340> higher<00:01:24.299> than<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> other<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.170> just

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
or is higher than the other one just

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.960 
or is higher than the other one just
look<00:01:25.530> at<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> mirror<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.369> know<00:01:26.520> your<00:01:26.790> shirt

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
look at the mirror you know your shirt

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.090 
look at the mirror you know your shirt
off<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.330> your<00:01:27.450> pants<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.140> sort<00:01:29.009> of

off and your pants have and sort of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.850 
off and your pants have and sort of
notice<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:29.820> one<00:01:30.240> hip<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.750> hiking<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:31.619> higher

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
notice if one hip is hiking up higher

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.770 
notice if one hip is hiking up higher
than<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.130> other<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:33.119> side<00:01:33.450> that's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
than the other one the side that's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.480 
than the other one the side that's
shorter<00:01:34.290> you're<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> recognize<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
shorter you're going to recognize the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.719 
shorter you're going to recognize the
hiking<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> hip<00:01:37.170> now<00:01:37.829> that's<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.520> case

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
hiking up of the hip now that's the case

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.210 
hiking up of the hip now that's the case
then<00:01:39.570> you're<00:01:39.900> you're<00:01:40.259> good<00:01:40.530> because<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.159> a

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
then you're you're good because it's a

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.300 
then you're you're good because it's a
muscular<00:01:41.700> imbalance<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.240> not<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.740> true<00:01:43.740> like

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
muscular imbalance it's not a true like

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.660 
muscular imbalance it's not a true like
then<00:01:44.520> leg<00:01:44.850> length<00:01:45.090> discrepancy<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:46.670> generally

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
then leg length discrepancy so generally

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.100 
then leg length discrepancy so generally
speaking<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.390> muscles<00:01:48.689> you're<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
speaking the muscles you're going to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.740 
speaking the muscles you're going to
want<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.290> stretch<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.820> side<00:01:51.329> are

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
want to stretch just on that side are

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.109 
want to stretch just on that side are
going<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.470> your<00:01:52.649> qlo<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.579> best<00:01:53.729> way<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.909> do

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
going to be your qlo the best way to do

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.420 
going to be your qlo the best way to do
that<00:01:54.240> hopefully<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:54.750> see<00:01:54.899> me<00:01:55.020> instead<00:01:55.770> if

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
that hopefully you can see me instead if

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.330 
that hopefully you can see me instead if
this<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.729> side<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.030> short<00:01:57.479> cross<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.350> leg

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
this is a side that short cross that leg

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.539 
this is a side that short cross that leg
and<00:01:59.700> reach<00:02:00.630> over<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.259> top<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.890> same<00:02:02.250> arm

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
and reach over the top of that same arm

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.830 
and reach over the top of that same arm
you're<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.909> stretch<00:02:03.210> out<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> entire

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
you're going to stretch out the entire

you're going to stretch out the entire
side<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.860> hip<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.689> this<00:02:06.689> side<00:02:07.619> right<00:02:08.039> so

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
side and the hip on this side right so

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.880 
side and the hip on this side right so
another<00:02:10.140> thing<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.560> you're<00:02:10.679> going<00:02:10.830> to

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
another thing that you're going to

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.710 
another thing that you're going to
recognize<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.910> most<00:02:12.090> part<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.540> again

recognize for the most part and again

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.600 
recognize for the most part and again
these<00:02:12.959> are<00:02:13.020> all<00:02:13.170> assumptions<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.220> you're

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
these are all assumptions is that you're

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.370 
these are all assumptions is that you're
going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.819> rotate<00:02:15.660> your<00:02:15.780> hips<00:02:16.080> going<00:02:16.290> to

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
going to rotate your hips going to

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.630 
going to rotate your hips going to
rotate<00:02:16.500> forward<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> little<00:02:17.099> bit<00:02:17.220> more<00:02:17.459> on<00:02:17.580> that

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
rotate forward a little bit more on that

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.880 
rotate forward a little bit more on that
same<00:02:17.970> side<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.900> means<00:02:18.989> your<00:02:19.170> hip<00:02:19.319> flexor<00:02:19.709> is

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
same side that means your hip flexor is

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.670 
same side that means your hip flexor is
going<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.610> be<00:02:20.730> tight<00:02:21.030> also<00:02:21.450> now<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.319> also

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
going to be tight also now you also

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.460 
going to be tight also now you also
mention<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.190> on<00:02:23.519> your<00:02:24.269> I<00:02:24.780> think<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.380> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
mention that on your I think it's the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.910 
mention that on your I think it's the
left<00:02:25.680> side<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.550> leg<00:02:27.440> externally<00:02:28.440> rotates

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
left side the leg externally rotates

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.400 
left side the leg externally rotates
just<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.730> bit<00:02:29.880> more<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.420> also<00:02:30.750> mentioned

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
just a bit more and you also mentioned

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.370 
just a bit more and you also mentioned
the<00:02:31.950> tucking<00:02:32.790> under<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.209> your<00:02:33.239> butt<00:02:33.660> right<00:02:34.019> so

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
the tucking under of your butt right so

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.720 
the tucking under of your butt right so
that<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.650> have<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:36.350> big<00:02:37.350> panther<00:02:37.769> posture<00:02:38.220> like

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
that you have a big panther posture like

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.640 
that you have a big panther posture like
I've<00:02:38.880> described<00:02:39.269> described<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.019> other<00:02:40.110> videos

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
I've described described in other videos

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.490 
I've described described in other videos
so<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.700> piriformis<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.750> probably<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.350> bit

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
so the piriformis is probably a bit

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.050 
so the piriformis is probably a bit
tight<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:44.250> glutes<00:02:44.489> are<00:02:44.640> probably<00:02:44.849> a<00:02:44.910> bit

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
tight the glutes are probably a bit

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.420 
tight the glutes are probably a bit
tight<00:02:45.239> on<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.510> side<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.110> do<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> 90<00:02:47.069> 90

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
tight on that side so do like a 90 90

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.140 
tight on that side so do like a 90 90
stretch<00:02:47.760> I've<00:02:48.239> showed<00:02:48.480> these<00:02:48.690> in<00:02:49.019> my<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:50.040> my

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
stretch I've showed these in my in my

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.039 
stretch I've showed these in my in my
bioenergetic<00:02:51.150> normal<00:02:51.420> video<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.750> can<00:02:51.930> check

bioenergetic normal video you can check

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.750 
bioenergetic normal video you can check
that<00:02:52.200> out<00:02:52.260> one<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.010> very<00:02:53.160> last<00:02:53.310> stretches

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
that out one of the very last stretches

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.240 
that out one of the very last stretches
is<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.940> 90<00:02:54.390> 90<00:02:54.750> stretch<00:02:55.019> where<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.560> cross<00:02:55.980> the
