00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
I mean that doesn't make any sense to me

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.809 
I mean that doesn't make any sense to me
because<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.540> mean<00:03:04.780> no<00:03:04.930> Sasuke's<00:03:05.830> period<00:03:06.640> has

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
because I mean no Sasuke's period has

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.550 
because I mean no Sasuke's period has
been<00:03:06.849> on<00:03:07.180> for<00:03:07.480> like<00:03:07.599> three<00:03:07.900> or<00:03:08.019> four<00:03:08.049> years<00:03:08.470> now

been on for like three or four years now
and<00:03:09.040> that's<00:03:09.700> all<00:03:09.880> he<00:03:10.060> cares<00:03:10.330> about<00:03:10.450> is

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
and that's all he cares about is

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.770 
and that's all he cares about is
destroying<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.860> Kolob<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.700> know<00:03:12.819> Konoha<00:03:13.239> so

I just added some see him help without
know<00:03:16.959> until<00:03:17.170> unless<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:18.340> know<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.820> has

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
know until unless you know it has

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.110 
know until unless you know it has
something<00:03:19.420> dude<00:03:19.600> screw<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.350> only<00:03:20.590> way

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
something dude screw and the only way

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.210 
something dude screw and the only way
Sasuke<00:03:22.120> can<00:03:22.329> do<00:03:22.510> something<00:03:23.019> is<00:03:23.260> if<00:03:23.799> he<00:03:23.950> defeats

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
Sasuke can do something is if he defeats

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.289 
Sasuke can do something is if he defeats
murderer<00:03:24.609> with<00:03:24.850> dummy

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
murderer with dummy

Kishimoto<00:03:25.750> but<00:03:26.170> have<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.380> good<00:03:26.890> explanation<00:03:27.250> of

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
Kishimoto but have a good explanation of

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.140 
Kishimoto but have a good explanation of
why<00:03:28.239> Sasuke<00:03:28.870> helps<00:03:29.200> out<00:03:29.380> Naruto<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.160> mean<00:03:30.519> it's

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
why Sasuke helps out Naruto I mean it's

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.270 
why Sasuke helps out Naruto I mean it's
but<00:03:31.540> it's<00:03:31.750> possible<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.560> is<00:03:32.769> possible

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
but it's possible that it is possible

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.729 
but it's possible that it is possible
but<00:03:33.400> I'm<00:03:33.760> just<00:03:34.030> thinking<00:03:34.239> it's<00:03:35.109> possible<00:03:35.319> but

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
but I'm just thinking it's possible but

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.199 
but I'm just thinking it's possible but
it's<00:03:35.829> not<00:03:35.890> probable<00:03:36.579> if<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.940> makes<00:03:37.120> any

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
it's not probable if that makes any

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.020 
it's not probable if that makes any
sense<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:37.690> guys<00:03:37.930> like<00:03:38.769> it<00:03:39.519> can't<00:03:39.790> happen

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
sense to you guys like it can't happen

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.400 
sense to you guys like it can't happen
but<00:03:40.299> I<00:03:40.420> don't<00:03:40.600> think<00:03:40.780> it's<00:03:40.900> going<00:03:41.079> to<00:03:41.109> happen

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
but I don't think it's going to happen

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
but I don't think it's going to happen
and<00:03:41.639> I<00:03:42.639> mean<00:03:43.440> we've<00:03:44.440> been<00:03:44.889> watching<00:03:45.130> Naruto

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
and I mean we've been watching Naruto

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.430 
and I mean we've been watching Naruto
for<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.850> while<00:03:45.970> you<00:03:46.180> know<00:03:46.269> Naruto<00:03:46.690> is<00:03:46.930> known<00:03:47.139> for

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
for a while you know Naruto is known for

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.280 
for a while you know Naruto is known for
his<00:03:47.530> twist<00:03:48.069> sometimes<00:03:48.940> with<00:03:49.630> some<00:03:49.810> shit<00:03:50.170> is

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
his twist sometimes with some shit is

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.379 
his twist sometimes with some shit is
very<00:03:50.500> predictable<00:03:50.829> but<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.880> just<00:03:52.180> don't<00:03:52.269> think

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
very predictable but I just don't think

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.319 
very predictable but I just don't think
he<00:03:52.630> should<00:03:52.660> model<00:03:52.959> we<00:03:53.049> just<00:03:53.200> want<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.410> bring<00:03:53.560> up

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
he should model we just want to bring up

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.410 
he should model we just want to bring up
just<00:03:56.190> throw<00:03:57.190> Sasuke<00:03:57.639> in<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:57.850> fight<00:03:58.060> because<00:03:58.209> I

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
just throw Sasuke in the fight because I

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.629 
just throw Sasuke in the fight because I
think<00:03:58.660> that<00:03:59.380> there'll<00:04:00.100> be<00:04:00.130> him<00:04:00.370> pulling

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
think that there'll be him pulling

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.940 
think that there'll be him pulling
something<00:04:00.910> out<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.060> his<00:04:01.239> ass<00:04:01.420> so<00:04:01.989> I<00:04:02.319> think<00:04:02.650> that

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
something out of his ass so I think that

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.590 
something out of his ass so I think that

anybody I think

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.890 
anybody I think
it<00:04:26.860> might<00:04:27.039> be<00:04:27.190> Obito<00:04:27.789> but<00:04:28.449> I'm<00:04:28.539> thinking

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
it might be Obito but I'm thinking

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.860 
it might be Obito but I'm thinking
Kakashi<00:04:29.259> is<00:04:29.940> something<00:04:30.970> Kakashi's<00:04:31.539> gonna<00:04:31.720> be

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
Obito but you know I think that fight is

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.580 
Obito but you know I think that fight is
gonna<00:04:35.349> be<00:04:35.849> not<00:04:36.849> resolved<00:04:37.479> but<00:04:37.750> I<00:04:37.990> don't<00:04:38.440> think

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
gonna be not resolved but I don't think

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.430 
gonna be not resolved but I don't think
Sasuke<00:04:39.550> is<00:04:39.639> gonna<00:04:39.849> get<00:04:40.360> a<00:04:40.419> chance<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.990> swing<00:04:41.139> or

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
thinking that Madara versus Hashima

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.100 
thinking that Madara versus Hashima
I<00:06:20.919> strong<00:06:21.849> wouldn't<00:06:22.210> automatically<00:06:22.719> win<00:06:22.960> it

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
I strong wouldn't automatically win it

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.899 
I strong wouldn't automatically win it
will<00:06:23.229> be<00:06:23.259> a<00:06:23.319> struggle<00:06:23.650> with<00:06:24.099> us<00:06:24.279> struggle<00:06:24.729> and

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
will be a struggle with us struggle and

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.450 
will be a struggle with us struggle and
if<00:06:25.180> it<00:06:25.330> was<00:06:25.419> just<00:06:25.449> my<00:06:26.020> turret<00:06:26.349> versus<00:06:27.009> hushing

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
if it was just my turret versus hushing

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.879 
if it was just my turret versus hushing
drama<00:06:27.669> then<00:06:28.449> I<00:06:28.479> think<00:06:28.960> Madara<00:06:29.440> will<00:06:29.529> end<00:06:29.740> up

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
drama then I think Madara will end up

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.370 
drama then I think Madara will end up

Sasuke<00:07:01.710> that's<00:07:01.919> what<00:07:02.130> I<00:07:02.340> would<00:07:02.580> like<00:07:02.610> to<00:07:02.789> see

that's what was more likely to happen

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.920 
that's what was more likely to happen
because<00:07:04.680> of<00:07:05.070> course<00:07:05.610> if<00:07:06.270> hashirama<00:07:06.690> comes

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
because of course if hashirama comes

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.840 
because of course if hashirama comes
back<00:07:07.080> he<00:07:07.259> still<00:07:07.530> wouldn't<00:07:07.800> want<00:07:07.949> to<00:07:08.009> protect
