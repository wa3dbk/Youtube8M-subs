seven<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.370> half<00:03:09.400> hours<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.269> it<00:03:10.600> would<00:03:10.690> have

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
seven and a half hours so it would have

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.240 
seven and a half hours so it would have
been<00:03:10.810> unlikely<00:03:11.200> we<00:03:11.440> wouldn't<00:03:11.680> have<00:03:11.829> survivors

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
been unlikely we wouldn't have survivors

been unlikely we wouldn't have survivors
have<00:03:12.549> this<00:03:12.670> happen<00:03:13.030> further<00:03:13.299> rather<00:03:13.480> than<00:03:13.630> the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
have this happen further rather than the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
have this happen further rather than the
