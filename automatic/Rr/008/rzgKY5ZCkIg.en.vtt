00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.800
 hello to all of you guys and well to this 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.169
 new video are hands and I do this 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.310
 video on the fly because I have a battery 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.840
 download 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.300
 in five minutes I have to go eat 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.440
 and it is hot from the madonna there are three of me 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.900
 excellent reasons to make a video of 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.480
 5 minutes but you don't give a fuck 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.269
 probably and it is a very right thing 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.809
 I almost just want to introduce you 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:53.260
 this little game that it really is 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.019
 cool locresi type to one euro on steam 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.180
 but now I don't know how much they put it 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.010
 anyway I'll show you a little 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.869
 to make you understand what you are 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.350
 speaking of juan who saw her from 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:08.070
 now it is practically this game is one 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.650
 mockery 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.880
 how to say this way of doing today 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.670
 all these dlc for games indeed 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.049
 I don't know if now some dlc this 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.130
 play because you notice that I finished it 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.340
 however satin to show it to you 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:29.499
 really going ahead 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:32.310
 we will unlock dnc that is small lc 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:34.810
 that will give us the weapons guns 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.140
 hats that would be the mockery of 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.140
 team fortress 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.789
 filters for game filters ie for 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.789
 the visual 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.560
 I don't know anymore double jump coins and 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.319
 all these crap here 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.950
 we will start that practically cannot 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:59.979
 he saw us move, nor did I think to the right 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.590
 on the right in a left then 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.950
 we must go on and find say 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.229
 the seller who will sell this dlc for 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.260
 make us move both to the right and to 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:17.680
 left then we will find paid and all 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:20.709
 these things so it is nothing anyway 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:26.250
 really nice to make full of 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:29.260
 zelda references to supermario zelda 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.170
 all all the games in anyway 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.849
 I also know some modern games 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.489
 precisely as a team fortress and battlefield 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:45.100
 things like that if in the 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:47.650
 citations that in the citations that 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.880
 in the plc that will touch us some 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.549
 things that clearly refer to 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.370
 I said well I hope so to these 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.430
 just games that I mentioned as ad 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.000
 example I believe is of battlefield like 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.099
 parody the fact that there is every time not 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.950
 I know if the thing raised with a dlc 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:13.000
 that first you buy dlc that you support 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.900
 add has in the background you go 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.849
 add all and all in the background 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.549
 billboards with type writing 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.639
 buy the coke bought things and 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.519
 like with another tlc you have to take this off 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.050
 small thing is bullshit but anyway 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.600
 really pretty and 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.610
 even if this doesn't make sense anyway 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.070
 here I finished this game then 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.500
 I'm playing around randomly talking to 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.490
 zombie that doesn't make sense one thing here is 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.020
 I also know what it is and this would be the 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.760
 seller who sells you of l 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.750
 excess that leaves some to see the lc 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.430
 that we are there we all took kind there is 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.660
 the animation pack that at the very beginning 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.440
 all new but not seen 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.780
 animations 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.860
 now instead with the package after that 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.660
 you bought it the character comes alive 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:10.060
 I was seeing phases of why we say 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:13.490
 he also didn't register if I don't know why he is 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.770
 nothing then there is the audio bach and has some 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:20.239
 like or better than the name of the game 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:23.450
 and wanting that I don't know why who 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.640
 he knows that would be that game that plan 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.450
 slowly unblocking things I don't 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.690
 remember how it makes you unlock it 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.190
 more and more things and makes you advance in age 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.980
 public video let's say in quotation marks 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.070
 at the beginning if in two type of 23 of then 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.650
 begin to unlock new modes of 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.930
 game becomes like diablo then it becomes 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.350
 as final fantasy and all these things 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.150
 of this it is very similar but not the same 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.540
 however you are boys there is a fear 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.540
 who in the video camera is now turned off 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.130
 they are a terrible fear and unfortunately I have to 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.960
 greet you 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.300
 I'm sorry if the video maybe was 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.390
 a little short but I just wanted to present the 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.780
 I didn't want to play gameplay because 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:11.210
 I finished it and I don't know I have no idea how 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.680
 to start it from scratch I swear I don't know 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.490
 how it is done so less arranges so 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.680
 good guys 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.870
 anyway 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.599
 like i said if you like the kind of 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.810
 video you can ask for others maybe 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.699
 you want if I know a game and you want 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.789
 let him advise this 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.199
 let's do some buying tips 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.909
 to show you let's say like this 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.680
 play if you want more games than 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.199
 present and that the stacks is a little bit 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.629
 how they work in those cloth if you 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.190
 like the video, however, the title of the 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:48.060
