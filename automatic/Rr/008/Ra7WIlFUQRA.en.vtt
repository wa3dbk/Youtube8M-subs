00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
working to that in my head it's around

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.879 
working to that in my head it's around
1900<00:03:46.060> just<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.019> card<00:03:47.260> that<00:03:47.349> I've<00:03:47.530> added<00:03:47.650> up

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
then and that doesn't include these

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.740 
then and that doesn't include these
these<00:03:51.099> minor<00:03:51.430> contract<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.180> if<00:03:52.239> we've<00:03:52.359> got<00:03:52.480> one
