the<00:01:50.369> last<00:01:50.399> hand<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.060> last<00:01:51.299> month<00:01:51.540> least

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the last hand this last month least

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.330 
the last hand this last month least
whenever<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.350> playing<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.860> ended<00:01:53.280> up

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
whenever I was playing I ended up

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.760 
whenever I was playing I ended up
getting<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:54.060> think<00:01:54.750> four<00:01:55.049> nukes<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.560> map

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
getting I think four nukes on this map

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.990 
getting I think four nukes on this map
one<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.040> them<00:01:56.189> all<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.430> think<00:01:56.640> was<00:01:56.790> with

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
one of them all I think was with

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.969 
one of them all I think was with
subscribers<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.530> rest<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.829> them<00:01:58.920> were

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
subscribers and the rest of them were

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.850 
subscribers and the rest of them were
just<00:01:59.159> kind<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.369> randoms<00:01:59.700> that<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.060> played<00:02:00.360> but

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
just kind of randoms that I played but

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.649 
just kind of randoms that I played but
anyway<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.399> was<00:02:02.969> kind<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.299> fun<00:02:03.450> gameplay

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
anyway this was kind of a fun gameplay

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.880 
anyway this was kind of a fun gameplay
so<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.990> thought<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.200> guys<00:02:04.229> might<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.770> if
