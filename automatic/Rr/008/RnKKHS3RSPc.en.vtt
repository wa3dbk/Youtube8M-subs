00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
you know be able to have some stability

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.640 
you know be able to have some stability
in<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.910> makes<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.930> little<00:02:24.019> bit<00:02:24.170> more<00:02:24.260> fun<00:02:24.530> to

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
in it makes a little bit more fun to

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.770 
in it makes a little bit more fun to
shoot<00:02:25.660> optics<00:02:26.660> are<00:02:27.310> really<00:02:28.310> advised<00:02:28.970> on<00:02:29.420> this

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
shoot optics are really advised on this

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.770 
shoot optics are really advised on this
weapon<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:32.060> doesn't<00:02:32.360> have<00:02:32.480> much<00:02:32.600> of<00:02:32.630> a

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
weapon and it doesn't have much of a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.070 
weapon and it doesn't have much of a
trigger<00:02:32.989> pull<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.910> if<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:35.420> could<00:02:35.540> put<00:02:35.690> optic

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
trigger pull so if you could put optic

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.770 
trigger pull so if you could put optic
on<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.410> anything<00:02:37.250> would<00:02:37.340> help<00:02:37.600> like<00:02:38.600> I<00:02:38.720> said

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
this is a fun weapon I mean originally

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.370 
this is a fun weapon I mean originally
they<00:02:41.120> were<00:02:41.150> just<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.510> little<00:02:41.690> over<00:02:41.870> 100<00:02:41.989> bucks

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
they were just a little over 100 bucks

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.530 
they were just a little over 100 bucks
there<00:02:43.100> a<00:02:43.400> whole<00:02:43.580> lot<00:02:43.730> more<00:02:43.880> than<00:02:43.940> I<00:02:44.180> think

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
there a whole lot more than I think

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.640 
there a whole lot more than I think
you're<00:02:44.660> probably<00:02:45.190> 4-500<00:02:46.190> now<00:02:47.650> depending

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
you're probably 4-500 now depending

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.090

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
screw on a suppressor I do have a dumb

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.130 
screw on a suppressor I do have a dumb
beasts<00:02:55.519> of<00:02:55.640> pressure<00:02:55.850> for<00:02:56.090> this<00:02:56.239> one<00:02:56.420> just<00:02:56.989> as

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
beasts of pressure for this one just as

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.210 
beasts of pressure for this one just as
a<00:02:57.200> hand<00:02:57.709> hole<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.870> can<00:03:00.079> bump<00:03:00.380> fire<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:00.920> and

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
a hand hole you can bump fire this and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.819 
a hand hole you can bump fire this and
it<00:03:01.820> does<00:03:02.000> boat<00:03:02.209> fire<00:03:02.450> quite<00:03:02.690> well<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.560> only

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
it does boat fire quite well the only

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.940 
it does boat fire quite well the only
problem<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.340> once<00:03:04.730> you<00:03:05.200> swap<00:03:06.200> over<00:03:06.440> your

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
problem is once you swap over your

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.949 
problem is once you swap over your
charging<00:03:07.340> handle<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:08.360> doesn't<00:03:08.660> bump<00:03:08.810> fire

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
charging handle it doesn't bump fire

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.120 
charging handle it doesn't bump fire
very<00:03:09.200> well<00:03:09.380> because<00:03:09.650> you're<00:03:09.739> adding<00:03:10.010> more

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
very well because you're adding more

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.640 
very well because you're adding more
mass<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.850> once<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.690> add<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:11.870> mass<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.530> it

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
mass and once you add that mass to it

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.039 
mass and once you add that mass to it
and<00:03:13.040> make<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.220> extremely<00:03:14.030> difficult<00:03:14.239> and<00:03:14.930> now

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
and make it extremely difficult and now

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.840 
and make it extremely difficult and now
if<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.320> take<00:03:15.350> that<00:03:15.769> out<00:03:15.980> put<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.340> original<00:03:16.430> one

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
if I take that out put the original one

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.789 
if I take that out put the original one
in<00:03:16.880> there<00:03:17.180> or<00:03:17.360> if<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.840> drop<00:03:18.079> in<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.320> little<00:03:18.650> bit<00:03:18.739> of

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
in there or if I drop in a little bit of

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.620 
in there or if I drop in a little bit of
one<00:03:18.980> or<00:03:19.220> just<00:03:19.280> take<00:03:19.670> it<00:03:19.820> out<00:03:19.880> completely<00:03:20.030> and

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
one or just take it out completely and

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.390 
one or just take it out completely and
just<00:03:20.739> use<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.950> punch<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.549> cock<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.480> weapon<00:03:24.400> just

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
just use a punch to cock the weapon just

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.080 
just use a punch to cock the weapon just
think<00:03:25.549> boat<00:03:25.730> fires<00:03:25.970> very<00:03:26.690> well<00:03:28.030> it's<00:03:29.030> just

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
think boat fires very well it's just

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.569 
think boat fires very well it's just
kind<00:03:29.329> of<00:03:29.390> pointless<00:03:29.660> though<00:03:30.400> there's<00:03:31.400> some

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
kind of pointless though there's some

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.599 
kind of pointless though there's some
weapons<00:03:32.000> boat<00:03:32.359> fire<00:03:32.570> very<00:03:32.810> well<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.890> there

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
weapons boat fire very well and there

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.370 
weapons boat fire very well and there
