Bath &amp; Body Works back when it was um I

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.810 
Bath &amp; Body Works back when it was um I
believe<00:01:09.060> still<00:01:09.299> being<00:01:09.540> made<00:01:09.659> by<00:01:09.840> slackin<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
believe still being made by slackin and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.390 
believe still being made by slackin and
um<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.330> kind<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.840> outgrew<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.290> sent<00:01:13.740> over<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
um I kind of outgrew that sent over the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.210 
um I kind of outgrew that sent over the
years<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.150> i<00:01:15.780> thought<00:01:16.619> i<00:01:16.680> would<00:01:16.890> give<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
years and i thought i would give this a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.800 
years and i thought i would give this a
try<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.549> see<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:17.939> i<00:01:18.030> would<00:01:18.210> fall<00:01:18.390> back<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.780> love

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
try to see if i would fall back in love

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.289 
try to see if i would fall back in love
with<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.320> i<00:01:19.950> really<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.909> think<00:01:21.030> that

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
with it and i really have I think that

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.210 
with it and i really have I think that
the<00:01:21.540> rhubarb<00:01:21.960> really<00:01:22.470> makes<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.189> big

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the rhubarb really makes a big

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.370 
the rhubarb really makes a big
difference<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.330> particular<00:01:24.600> candle

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
difference in this particular candle

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.210 
difference in this particular candle
because<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.520> does<00:01:26.790> take<00:01:27.299> away<00:01:27.990> from<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.619> kind

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
because it does take away from that kind

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.960 
because it does take away from that kind
of<00:01:29.400> overly<00:01:30.390> sweet<00:01:30.990> strawberry<00:01:31.710> scent<00:01:32.130> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
of overly sweet strawberry scent that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.200 
of overly sweet strawberry scent that
strawberry<00:01:33.750> candles<00:01:34.229> tend<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.549> it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
strawberry candles tend to have and it

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.210 
strawberry candles tend to have and it
just<00:01:36.420> sort<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.689> changes<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.350> enough<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.009> where

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
just sort of changes it enough to where

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.490 
just sort of changes it enough to where
it<00:01:38.869> doesn't<00:01:39.869> become<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.979> Khloe<00:01:41.610> anymore<00:01:42.500> so

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
it doesn't become so Khloe anymore so

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.499 
it doesn't become so Khloe anymore so
i'm<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> show<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.399> guys<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:47.210> wicks<00:01:48.210> on

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.330 
i'm going to show you guys the wicks on
this<00:01:48.689> bad<00:01:48.930> boy<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.130> there's

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
this bad boy so as you can see there's

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.490 
this bad boy so as you can see there's
some<00:01:50.549> pretty<00:01:50.820> big<00:01:51.149> mushroom<00:01:51.720> tops<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
some pretty big mushroom tops on the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.580 
some pretty big mushroom tops on the
wigs<00:01:52.740> these<00:01:53.640> are<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.180> wicks<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.780> have<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
wigs these are the wicks that have the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.340 
wigs these are the wicks that have the
metal<00:01:56.310> running<00:01:56.909> through<00:01:57.210> them<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.170> this

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
metal running through them so this

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.289 
metal running through them so this
candle<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.860> burning<00:01:59.130> pretty<00:01:59.670> quickly<00:01:59.969> and

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
candle is burning pretty quickly and

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.830 
candle is burning pretty quickly and
it's<00:02:00.450> burning<00:02:00.810> pretty<00:02:01.170> hot<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.460> from<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.810> time

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
it's burning pretty hot so from the time

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.499 
it's burning pretty hot so from the time
that<00:02:04.409> i<00:02:04.590> lit<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.939> started<00:02:06.210> out

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
that i lit it and it started out

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.990 
that i lit it and it started out
probably<00:02:07.469> right<00:02:08.220> about<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.580> level<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
probably right about the level of the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.780 
probably right about the level of the
label<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:10.319> already<00:02:10.709> gone<00:02:10.830> down<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.550> much

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
label it's already gone down this much

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.980 
label it's already gone down this much
in<00:02:11.970> about<00:02:12.180> five<00:02:12.390> hours

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
in about five hours

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.500 
in about five hours
so<00:02:13.080> it's<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.260> pretty<00:02:13.380> quick<00:02:13.710> burning<00:02:14.070> candle<00:02:14.510> as

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
so it's a pretty quick burning candle as

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.150 
so it's a pretty quick burning candle as
you<00:02:15.660> can<00:02:15.750> see<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.990> has<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.110> nice<00:02:16.290> deep<00:02:16.590> waxpool

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
you can see it has a nice deep waxpool

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.050 
you can see it has a nice deep waxpool
there<00:02:17.580> um<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:19.020> it's<00:02:19.860> pretty<00:02:20.130> strong<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.820> would

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
there um and it's pretty strong I would

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.690 
there um and it's pretty strong I would
put<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.420> throw<00:02:21.810> at<00:02:22.260> about<00:02:22.860> an<00:02:24.080> eight<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:26.070> it's

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
put the throw at about an eight so it's

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.000 
put the throw at about an eight so it's
strong<00:02:27.270> it's<00:02:27.690> not<00:02:27.930> strong<00:02:28.350> enough<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.800> where<00:02:28.980> I

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
strong it's not strong enough to where I

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.040 
strong it's not strong enough to where I
can<00:02:29.160> smell<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.850> way<00:02:30.060> upstairs<00:02:30.300> in<00:02:30.900> my

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
can smell it all the way upstairs in my

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.520 
can smell it all the way upstairs in my
house<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.710> so<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:33.060> can<00:02:33.900> smell<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.260> all

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
house and so I can smell it all

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.480 
house and so I can smell it all
