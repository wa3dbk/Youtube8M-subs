extra<00:01:38.220> glow<00:01:38.549> cream<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:40.860> actually<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.640> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
extra glow cream and I actually like it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.179

more<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> highlighter<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.680> want<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.009> more

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
more as a highlighter if I want a more

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.469 
more as a highlighter if I want a more
dramatic<00:01:44.399> effect<00:01:46.549> so<00:01:47.549> packaging<00:01:48.180> still

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
dramatic effect so packaging still

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.020 
dramatic effect so packaging still
exactly<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.110> same<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.610> color<00:01:50.820> is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
exactly the same you see the color is

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.330 
exactly the same you see the color is
lighter<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.659> guess<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.229> should<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.500> left<00:01:52.619> it's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
lighter I guess I should have left it's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.999 
lighter I guess I should have left it's
not<00:01:53.460> open<00:01:54.829> but<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> color<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.250> lighter<00:01:56.579> it's

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
not open but the color is lighter it's

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.480 
not open but the color is lighter it's
more<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.549> luminescent<00:02:00.180> pearl<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:02.159> it

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
more of just a luminescent pearl so it

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.999 
more of just a luminescent pearl so it
doesn't<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:03.000> quite<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> skin<00:02:03.930> tone<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.979> it

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
doesn't have quite the skin tone to it

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.980 
doesn't have quite the skin tone to it
it's<00:02:05.700> more<00:02:05.880> luminescent<00:02:06.540> pearl<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.869> just

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it's more luminescent pearl and just

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.839 
it's more luminescent pearl and just
looking<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.530> container<00:02:08.160> itself<00:02:08.610> it's

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
looking in the container itself it's

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.200 
looking in the container itself it's
much<00:02:09.209> more<00:02:09.770> iridescent

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
much more iridescent

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.710 
much more iridescent
than<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:12.770> original<00:02:13.460> cream<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.510> actually

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
than the original cream and I actually

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.450 
than the original cream and I actually
after<00:02:15.230> using<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.650> one<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:15.830> actually<00:02:16.160> think

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
after using this one I actually think

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.720 
after using this one I actually think
this<00:02:16.730> one<00:02:16.940> is<00:02:16.970> more<00:02:17.540> lightweight<00:02:17.990> than<00:02:18.730> the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
this one is more lightweight than the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.090 
this one is more lightweight than the
original<00:02:20.180> cream<00:02:20.450> it's<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.780> lot<00:02:20.990> i<00:02:21.260> want<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.920> say

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
original cream it's a lot i want to say

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.610 
original cream it's a lot i want to say
fluffier<00:02:22.670> but<00:02:23.540> it's<00:02:23.780> lighter<00:02:24.080> weight<00:02:24.380> its

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
fluffier but it's lighter weight its

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.140 
fluffier but it's lighter weight its
moves<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.070> lot<00:02:25.340> clearer<00:02:25.580> but<00:02:25.700> as<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:26.000> can

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
moves on a lot clearer but as you can

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.650 
moves on a lot clearer but as you can
see<00:02:26.500> this<00:02:27.500> one<00:02:27.740> already<00:02:28.130> is<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:28.700> lighter<00:02:29.300> and

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
see this one already is just lighter and

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.980 
see this one already is just lighter and
has<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.770> lot<00:02:31.250> more<00:02:31.280> glow<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.150> just<00:02:32.330> luminescent

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
has a lot more glow and just luminescent

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.420 
has a lot more glow and just luminescent
to<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.230> than<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.530> original<00:02:34.990> so<00:02:35.990> get<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:36.950> on

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
to it than the original so get that on

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.490 
to it than the original so get that on
there<00:02:38.270> so<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.570> can<00:02:38.690> see<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:38.990> is<00:02:39.170> where<00:02:39.350> the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
there so you can see this is where the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.290 
there so you can see this is where the
extra<00:02:39.830> glow<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:40.640> where<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.910> original

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
extra glow is this is where the original

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.630 
extra glow is this is where the original
is<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.720> just<00:02:41.810> looking<00:02:42.530> at<00:02:42.770> my<00:02:42.920> hand<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.490> can

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
is and just looking at my hand you can

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.490 
is and just looking at my hand you can
see<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.060> distinct<00:02:44.510> line<00:02:44.720> where<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.170> extra

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
see the distinct line where the extra

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.290 
see the distinct line where the extra
glow<00:02:45.740> is<00:02:45.950> versus<00:02:46.460> where<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.730> original<00:02:47.120> is

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
glow is versus where the original is

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.450 
glow is versus where the original is
this<00:02:47.510> side<00:02:47.750> kind<00:02:48.110> of<00:02:48.230> it's<00:02:48.830> got<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.070> little<00:02:49.220> bit

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
this side kind of it's got a little bit

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.770 
this side kind of it's got a little bit
of<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.610> globe<00:02:49.910> but<00:02:50.120> just<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.390> little<00:02:50.570> bit<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:50.750> a

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
of the globe but just a little bit of a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.190 
of the globe but just a little bit of a
shimmer<00:02:51.020> whereas<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:51.500> one<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.860> very

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
shimmer whereas this one is very

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.320 
shimmer whereas this one is very
luminescent<00:02:54.200> glowy<00:02:54.640> this<00:02:55.640> really<00:02:55.940> shines

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
luminescent glowy this really shines

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.210 
luminescent glowy this really shines
kind<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:56.990> i<00:02:57.380> keep<00:02:57.860> want<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.100> say<00:02:58.190> just

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
luminescent like a move but it goes on

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.520

extremely<00:03:01.910> lightweight<00:03:02.290> much<00:03:03.290> more

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
extremely lightweight much more

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
lightweight than the original i think

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.190 
lightweight than the original i think
and<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:07.400> doesn't<00:03:07.910> have<00:03:08.120> much<00:03:08.390> of<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.630> smell<00:03:08.990> I

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
and it doesn't have much of a smell I

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.450 
and it doesn't have much of a smell I

bit<00:03:10.550> of<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.670> smell<00:03:11.000> but<00:03:11.120> it's<00:03:11.270> very<00:03:11.360> faint<00:03:11.750> not

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
bit of a smell but it's very faint not

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.550 
bit of a smell but it's very faint not
enough<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:12.650> be<00:03:13.060> overpowering<00:03:14.290> these<00:03:15.290> are<00:03:15.470> the

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
enough to be overpowering these are the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.340 
enough to be overpowering these are the
two<00:03:15.710> creams<00:03:16.010> together<00:03:16.370> see<00:03:16.880> original<00:03:17.150> has<00:03:17.960> the

of them I do have very oily skin and

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.940 
of them I do have very oily skin and
this<00:03:28.970> does<00:03:29.150> not<00:03:29.450> add<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.050> oil<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:30.470> my<00:03:30.680> face

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
this does not add to the oil of my face

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.070 
this does not add to the oil of my face
it<00:03:31.280> stays<00:03:31.910> light<00:03:32.210> weight<00:03:32.450> throughout<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.900> day

it stays light weight throughout the day

it stays light weight throughout the day
my<00:03:33.830> only<00:03:34.160> concern<00:03:34.490> would<00:03:34.940> be<00:03:35.000> if<00:03:35.270> you<00:03:35.390> are

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
my only concern would be if you are

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.290 
my only concern would be if you are
darker<00:03:36.200> complected<00:03:36.650> that<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.610> extra<00:03:38.030> glow

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
darker complected that the extra glow

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.510 
darker complected that the extra glow
might<00:03:38.690> be<00:03:38.990> a<00:03:39.290> little<00:03:39.530> too<00:03:39.650> light<00:03:40.130> for<00:03:40.160> your

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
might be a little too light for your

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.330 
might be a little too light for your
skin<00:03:40.880> because<00:03:41.210> as<00:03:41.390> you<00:03:41.570> it's<00:03:41.840> definitely<00:03:42.340> very

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
skin because as you it's definitely very

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.170 
skin because as you it's definitely very
shiny<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.300> shimmery<00:03:44.720> I<00:03:44.990> have<00:03:45.680> very<00:03:45.860> fair<00:03:46.550> pale

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
shiny and shimmery I have very fair pale

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.290 
shiny and shimmery I have very fair pale
skin<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.950> looks<00:03:49.160> great<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.670> think<00:03:50.150> on<00:03:50.270> my

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
skin and this looks great I think on my

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.560 
skin and this looks great I think on my
skin<00:03:50.750> but<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:51.830> think<00:03:52.190> if<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.610> were<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.790> be<00:03:52.940> have

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
skin but I think if you were to be have

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.240 
skin but I think if you were to be have
the<00:03:53.750> darker<00:03:54.080> complexion<00:03:54.590> this<00:03:54.770> may<00:03:55.040> not<00:03:55.190> look

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
the darker complexion this may not look

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.120 
the darker complexion this may not look
as<00:03:55.640> good<00:03:56.060> because<00:03:56.300> it<00:03:56.570> is<00:03:56.810> so<00:03:57.230> pale<00:03:58.100> and

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
as good because it is so pale and

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.770 
as good because it is so pale and
iridescent<00:03:58.790> then<00:03:59.210> it<00:03:59.300> just<00:03:59.420> might<00:03:59.600> look<00:03:59.720> a

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
iridescent then it just might look a

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.960 
iridescent then it just might look a
little<00:03:59.930> awkward<00:04:00.320> but<00:04:00.610> definitely<00:04:01.610> recommend

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
little awkward but definitely recommend

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.270 
little awkward but definitely recommend
both<00:04:02.180> of<00:04:02.360> them<00:04:02.540> they<00:04:03.110> are<00:04:03.140> by<00:04:03.410> I<00:04:03.440> co<00:04:03.890> which<00:04:04.130> is
