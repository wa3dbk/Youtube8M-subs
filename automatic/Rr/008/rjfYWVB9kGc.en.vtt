00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.590
 new valentine's recipe that are 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.320

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.970

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.970
 subscribe to the channel we started 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.940
 for the dough we will need 425 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.670
 grams of flour 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.640
 215 grams of softened butter 1 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.890
 egg and 2 teaspoons of extract of 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.199
 vanilla and to decorate our 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.620
 cookies we're going to need a tablet 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:52.070
 of milk chocolate 250 grams of 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.320
 fondant red and silver balls about it 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.280
 first thing we're going to do is mix the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.280
 butter with sugar 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.760
 now we throw out the sugar 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.760
 and mix it well with butter 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.070
 and now we are going to mix a little bit 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.670
 little flour we're going to sift 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.520
 do not have lumps 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.060
 let's take the two teaspoons of 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.060
 vanilla 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.100
 and now let's start mixing it 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.690
 it must be done with your hands because 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.690
 the dough gets too hard because as 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.360
 You see we have finished doing our 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.300
 biscuit dough well let's go to 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.540
 start stretching the dough to cut 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.080
 the cookies as you see we have left the 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.690
 mass about one centimeter 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.700
 We cut the cookie and remove the dough 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.000
 around you have to be very careful 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.910
 because this mass immediately breaks down 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.720
 We will bake them for 15 minutes at 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.880
 180 degrees let them cool on 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.190
 the tray as you see we have not left them 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.650
 of praying because they are going to be covered 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.810
 chocolate but you can leave it 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.610
 now if you want yours goes to like 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.040
 then let's merge our 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.470
 chocolate in the microwave we have gotten 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.720
 this bowl with the chocolate in the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.370
 microwave at very short intervals what 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.680
 We have been moving and we already have it 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.630
 cast now let's cover the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.940
 cookies we will throw a little bit of 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.170
 chocolate here in the center and we're going to 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.170
 extend with this palette 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.180
 until covering all surfaces of the 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.810
 cookie now we are going to put some 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.810
 pearls 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.290
 we will continue cutting our fondant 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.459
 we will pour a little icing sugar and 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.459
 we will stretch the cover 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.890
 let's stretch it well with the roller 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.620
 now with this short cookie in shape 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.660
 with a little heart 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.660
 let's go cutting our hearts 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.650
 and finally we will finish decorating 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.780
 our cookies we will put the 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.770
