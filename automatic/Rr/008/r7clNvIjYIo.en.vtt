00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
and that ended up being about 40 by

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.120 
and that ended up being about 40 by
seven<00:01:09.229> TV<00:01:09.500> when<00:01:10.460> you're<00:01:10.490> watching<00:01:10.869> 3d<00:01:11.869> TV<00:01:12.560> it

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
seven TV when you're watching 3d TV it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.630 
seven TV when you're watching 3d TV it
tends<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:13.670> break<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.360> barrier<00:01:14.840> of<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.409> TV<00:01:15.860> so

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
tends to break the barrier of the TV so

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.390 
tends to break the barrier of the TV so
that<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:16.939> 3d<00:01:17.360> image<00:01:17.659> comes<00:01:17.960> outside<00:01:18.400> whereas

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
that the 3d image comes outside whereas

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.789 
that the 3d image comes outside whereas
now<00:01:19.670> it<00:01:20.360> comes<00:01:20.600> out<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.020> it's<00:01:21.200> surrounded<00:01:21.680> by

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
now it comes out and it's surrounded by

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.520 
now it comes out and it's surrounded by
black<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:23.030> basically<00:01:23.180> your<00:01:23.840> 3d<00:01:24.200> image

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
black so that basically your 3d image

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.620 
black so that basically your 3d image
becomes<00:01:24.950> larger<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:26.060> looks<00:01:26.240> as<00:01:26.329> if<00:01:26.479> you've

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
becomes larger and it looks as if you've

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.120 
becomes larger and it looks as if you've
got<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:26.840> large<00:01:27.020> container<00:01:27.470> what's<00:01:28.100> next

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
got a large container what's next

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.069 
got a large container what's next
perhaps<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.479> next<00:01:30.600> thing<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.869> we're

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
perhaps the next thing that we're

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.800 
perhaps the next thing that we're
