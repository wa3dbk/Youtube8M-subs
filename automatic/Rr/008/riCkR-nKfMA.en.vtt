00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.870
 now I would like to talk to you about this 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.360
 what is called planning then in 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.319
 clear planning at kant or you 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.769
 start from your real potential to a 

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:23.819
 goal as fair as possible in 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:25.609
 function of your abilities so already in 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.899
 first place you must know already 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.939
 some wings and our real potential 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.879
 that is, as you speak in 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.379
 percentage terms it's like 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.429
 speak in terms of mass index 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.469
 corporeal 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:40.649
 it's not credible when we talk 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.379
 of a body mass must dissociate 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.460
 absolutely the fat mass of the mass 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.410
 muscular 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.379
 when you climb on a scale is 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.100
 not credible that does not indicate exactly 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.199
 what are you made of or the content of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.550
 Your figure 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.079
 on the other hand when you look in a 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.909
 mirror 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.379
 it's not credible because you have to be 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.480
 able to also have a look 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.030
 outside to discover the points 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.040
 strong and weak points that you 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.640
 are not able to observe because you 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.009
 do not have an eye yet enough 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.520
 exercise so you have these at 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.320
 consider your real potential is 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.369
 can not be based on a 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.950
 percentage 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.110
 when you are young beginners 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.790
 explain when you say I 'm going to put 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.329
 a 40% bar 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.020
 you are talking about 100% but are you 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.329
 know what the word means 100% 100% 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.810
 it means being able to develop 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.490
 your 100% gold potential in 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.509
 statistics and in all 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.049
 human experiences that have been 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.020
 made a maximum person of his 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.490
 nervousness will come to 70 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.479
 percent it means that when you 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.100
 go and slap you in the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.710
 street when you go back you 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.780
 can develop 70% in the worst of 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.479
 insults possible to react 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.159
 for people who are said gifted 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.619
 genetically say they have a system 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.069
 nervous that sufficiently developed by 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.739
 velocity exercises those there 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:15.000
 will be able to develop about 80 % 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:19.970
 maximum the body will keep whoever you 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.590
 be a margin of 20% medically 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.250
 impossible to exploit by his own 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.239
 will 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.880
 which means that the 100% of your 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:33.900
 theoretical potential and already false this 100 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.150
 % is already 80% of your true maximum and 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.900
 80% in the best case 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.060
 at worst it will be at 10 or even 20 for 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.730
 hundred because because it takes a long time 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.920
 learning to be able to 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.930
 express themselves through an activity a 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.720
 more or less long time depending on 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.130
 your sporty past which means that 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.819
 when you go into a room and we 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.459
 will put you for example 60% of our 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.590
 charge says maximum on what we are in 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.209
 see you in the hope that you 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.609
 be awake because if it's 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.500
 a day when you're tired it goes down 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.170
 again the percentage what makes that 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.060
 going to see people for example that they are going 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.849
 be able to make a draw of 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:21.630
 realities at 50 kg arrived at 30 kg the day 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.260
 test and who will train on 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.560
 percentages 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.130
 causing them to do sets of 10 or 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.410
 even wine even with ten kilos and at the 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.880
 lower haye where we will still descend 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.110
 the purchase so we arrive in 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.670
 aberrations of people who 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.410
 we work with five minutes of 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.440
 recovery and who will work 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.760
 between 5 and 10% of their potential then 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.920
 I tell you in this case it is worth 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.840
 better go shopping and wore 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.260
 a tray of water to put it in the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.240
 chest 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.250
 at that moment you will see you will have 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.500
 certainly a better result in 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.000
 terms of velocity or so they go 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.160
 even better work in a construction site 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.480
 there you will be much stronger than 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.430
 whoever is going to hunt you who is going 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.970
 work in the room with 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.160
 percentages also theoretical and also to 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.310
 unison so me what I recommend 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.090
 to start any planning it's 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.440
 to go into the room to train you 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.109
 without taking up time 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.500
 you start your session you you 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:22.380
 express to the best of your ability and to 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.500
 last two months minimum 1 5 minimum 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.990
 you start to estimate yourself on a 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.120
 series of 10 passionate series of a because 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.460
 that it will be absolutely impossible to 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.890
 develop such strength in so few 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.620
 recoil time and serial drive 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:41.430
 of 10 you will evaluate yourself and there you 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.370
 will have a theoretical maximum on a series 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.770
 of 10 who will approach a little more than one 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.380
 percentage we will say just and consistent 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.190
 although we will be far behind 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.380
 I advise you 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.419
 secondly when you go to attack 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.430
 your session whatever the plan that 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.200
 you will set up to become 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.520
 respect this principle of becoming 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.669
 best at each session 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.410
 that is, to go beyond even 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.200
 science goals that you put 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.880
 going on that will come close to that 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.160
 you really wanted to start 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.540
 put in place it's very important if 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.580
 is given to you for example say the 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.930
 petitions if you can ferrand if you 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.840
 can do 12 or 15 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.090
 it's a success for your site 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.410
 you make 5 imagine that you 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.470
 may already have a 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.840
 underestimation has more than that what in 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.699
 returns to doing group classes or 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.040
 to ride a bike or to do cardio 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.050
 will bring you many more things 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.020
 than to practice planning 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.270
 muscle in terms of bodybuilding 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.810
 this guy so remember that everything 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.460
 balance sheet is based on what you 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.560
 go develop what you're going 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.419
 give in your essay years so that's 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.300
 very important to start the letter 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.940
 alpha of your planning by these 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.280
 our limits no recovery time 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:58.070
 no charges defined initially you 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.650
 give thoroughly for two months in 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.229
 respecting the dab of your body and 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.630
 your physiology to be able only to 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.610
 take a test on just about one 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.440
 dozen recovery to approach 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:14.440
 a theoretical real potential roughly 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.440
 coherent
