00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.420 
say was one of those times in call of
duty<00:01:21.380> where<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.500> pretty<00:01:22.799> much<00:01:22.920> added

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
duty where they pretty much added

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.370 
duty where they pretty much added
something<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.000> we've<00:01:24.119> never<00:01:24.150> seen<00:01:24.540> before<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
something that we've never seen before I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.350

in<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.830> previous<00:01:26.070> Call<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.460> Duty<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.000> wasn't

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
in a previous Call of Duty and it wasn't

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.149 
in a previous Call of Duty and it wasn't
something<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.869> mind-blowing<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.829> anything

basically<00:01:37.290> getting<00:01:37.619> different<00:01:37.920> variations

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
basically getting different variations

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.520 
basically getting different variations
of<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.509> he's<00:01:39.689> seen<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.990> black<00:01:40.200> ops<00:01:40.409> 2

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
of this and as he's seen in black ops 2

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.560 
of this and as he's seen in black ops 2
we<00:01:40.829> also<00:01:40.979> got<00:01:41.250> another<00:01:41.670> dolphin<00:01:42.090> dive<00:01:42.329> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
we also got another dolphin dive and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.780 
we also got another dolphin dive and
then<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.049> recently<00:01:43.500> changed<00:01:43.950> into<00:01:44.220> cod<00:01:44.460> ghosts

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
then it recently changed into cod ghosts

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.760 
then it recently changed into cod ghosts
last<00:01:45.060> year<00:01:45.390> when<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:46.110> got<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> slide<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
last year when we got the slide and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
last year when we got the slide and
since<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.399> its<00:01:47.579> kind<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.990> changing<00:01:48.990> around

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
since then its kind of changing around

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.109 
since then its kind of changing around
from<00:01:49.470> infinity<00:01:49.920> ward<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.310> trial<00:01:50.579> changing<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
from infinity ward in trial changing it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.910 
from infinity ward in trial changing it
from<00:01:51.210> dolphin<00:01:51.659> diving<00:01:51.840> back<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.320> sliding<00:01:52.710> back

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
from dolphin diving back to sliding back

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.920 
from dolphin diving back to sliding back
and<00:01:52.950> forth<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.640> sledgehammer<00:01:54.450> games<00:01:54.540> this

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
and forth and sledgehammer games this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.410 
and forth and sledgehammer games this
year<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.380> we've<00:01:55.590> got<00:01:55.829> are<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.460> open<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.210> get

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
year what we've got are we open to get

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.719 
year what we've got are we open to get
the<00:01:57.600> exosuit<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:59.040> basically<00:01:59.280> allowed

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the exosuit and that basically allowed

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.700 
the exosuit and that basically allowed
us<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.909> double<00:02:00.390> jump<00:02:00.659> straight<00:02:00.930> side<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.500> side

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
us to double jump straight side to side

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.160 
us to double jump straight side to side
and<00:02:01.979> since<00:02:02.640> then<00:02:03.000> about<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.360> few<00:02:03.659> months<00:02:03.960> in

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
and since then about a few months in

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.139 
and since then about a few months in
pretty<00:02:04.770> much<00:02:04.979> everyone<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.700> game<00:02:05.909> has

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
pretty much everyone in the game has

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.700 
pretty much everyone in the game has
grown<00:02:06.420> accustomed<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.350> which<00:02:07.500> means

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
grown accustomed to it which means

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.830 
grown accustomed to it which means
basically<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.879> has<00:02:09.090> been<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.660> game<00:02:09.780> for

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
basically this has been in the game for

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.720 
basically this has been in the game for
about<00:02:10.170> three<00:02:10.500> months<00:02:10.679> everyone<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.430> quite

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
about three months everyone is quite

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.780 
about three months everyone is quite
used<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.480> know

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
used to it you know

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.309 
used to it you know
double<00:02:13.060> jumping<00:02:13.360> around<00:02:13.510> we're<00:02:13.870> changing<00:02:14.200> up

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
double jumping around we're changing up

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.839 
double jumping around we're changing up
our<00:02:14.439> play<00:02:14.709> style<00:02:15.069> we're<00:02:15.519> pretty<00:02:15.670> much

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
our play style we're pretty much

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.759 
our play style we're pretty much
actually<00:02:16.299> sitting<00:02:16.629> around<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.109> map<00:02:17.349> trying

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
actually sitting around the map trying

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.039 
actually sitting around the map trying
to<00:02:17.950> flank<00:02:18.189> around<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.879> because<00:02:19.569> they<00:02:19.719> added

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
to flank around and because they added

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.259 
to flank around and because they added
it<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.409> we<00:02:20.829> have<00:02:21.010> changed<00:02:21.250> our<00:02:21.519> play<00:02:21.819> styles

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
it in we have changed our play styles

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.509 
it in we have changed our play styles
dramatically<00:02:23.079> and<00:02:23.230> if<00:02:23.590> we<00:02:23.709> go<00:02:23.859> back<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.069> black

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
dramatically and if we go back to black

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.429 
dramatically and if we go back to black
ops<00:02:24.760> 2<00:02:25.030> or<00:02:25.299> another<00:02:25.629> call<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.989> duty<00:02:26.260> that

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
ops 2 or another call of duty that

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.380 
ops 2 or another call of duty that
didn't<00:02:26.709> have<00:02:26.829> this<00:02:26.950> implemented<00:02:27.640> we<00:02:28.209> would

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
didn't have this implemented we would

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.059 
didn't have this implemented we would
pretty<00:02:28.599> much<00:02:28.689> be<00:02:28.840> playing<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.409> different<00:02:29.859> play

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
pretty much be playing a different play

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.339 
pretty much be playing a different play
style<00:02:30.489> so<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.790> would<00:02:31.180> find<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.659> kind<00:02:31.959> of<00:02:32.079> odd

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
style so I would find it kind of odd

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.830 
style so I would find it kind of odd
that<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:33.189> whole<00:02:33.489> year<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.879> advance<00:02:34.269> warfare

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
that this whole year in advance warfare

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.080 
that this whole year in advance warfare
we've<00:02:35.109> been<00:02:35.379> getting<00:02:35.950> used<00:02:36.519> to<00:02:36.730> basically

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
we've been getting used to basically

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.910 
we've been getting used to basically
getting<00:02:37.390> these<00:02:37.569> mechanics<00:02:38.170> down<00:02:38.409> to<00:02:38.650> start

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
getting these mechanics down to start

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.770 
getting these mechanics down to start
double<00:02:39.340> boosting<00:02:39.790> up<00:02:39.909> in<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.180> air<00:02:40.329> starting

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
double boosting up in the air starting

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.569 
double boosting up in the air starting
to<00:02:40.900> strafe<00:02:41.170> side<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.650> side<00:02:41.829> when<00:02:42.069> we<00:02:42.159> need<00:02:42.430> to

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
to strafe side to side when we need to

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.399 
to strafe side to side when we need to
and<00:02:42.819> more<00:02:43.450> or<00:02:43.569> less<00:02:43.750> all<00:02:43.989> around<00:02:44.230> it's

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
and more or less all around it's

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.830 
and more or less all around it's
basically<00:02:44.739> made<00:02:45.159> the<00:02:45.370> gameplay<00:02:45.909> faster<00:02:46.629> and

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
basically made the gameplay faster and

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.740 
basically made the gameplay faster and
if<00:02:47.560> they<00:02:47.859> suddenly<00:02:48.129> put<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.849> to<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.090> halt<00:02:49.480> and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
if they suddenly put this to a halt and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.750 
if they suddenly put this to a halt and
they<00:02:50.139> move<00:02:50.349> to<00:02:50.530> world<00:02:50.829> at<00:02:50.980> war<00:02:51.159> number<00:02:51.519> two

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
they move to world at war number two

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.580 
they move to world at war number two
which<00:02:52.030> is<00:02:52.180> probably<00:02:52.480> triac<00:02:53.019> is<00:02:53.200> going<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.470> do

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
which is probably triac is going to do

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.710 
which is probably triac is going to do
whether<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:54.010> be<00:02:54.099> World<00:02:54.310> War<00:02:54.430> two<00:02:54.730> or<00:02:55.000> black<00:02:55.480> ops

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
whether it be World War two or black ops

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.420 
whether it be World War two or black ops
3<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.049> they<00:02:56.109> put<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.379> straight<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.859> a<00:02:56.889> halt<00:02:57.250> and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
3 and they put it straight to a halt and

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.210 
3 and they put it straight to a halt and
they<00:02:57.939> reverse<00:02:58.329> back<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.139> old<00:02:59.319> black<00:02:59.680> ops<00:02:59.950> 2

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
they reverse back to the old black ops 2

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.490 
they reverse back to the old black ops 2
or<00:03:00.970> any<00:03:01.209> other<00:03:01.540> old<00:03:01.840> college<00:03:02.230> eating

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
or any other old college eating

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.020 
or any other old college eating
mechanics<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.189> basically<00:03:03.579> we<00:03:03.790> don't<00:03:03.939> have

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
mechanics and basically we don't have

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.089 
mechanics and basically we don't have
exosuits<00:03:04.659> anymore<00:03:05.049> I<00:03:05.230> don't<00:03:05.799> think<00:03:05.980> they're

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
exosuits anymore I don't think they're

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.920 
exosuits anymore I don't think they're
going<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.310> do<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.639> at<00:03:06.760> all<00:03:06.849> personally<00:03:07.480> how

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
going to do that at all personally how

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.990 
going to do that at all personally how
I'm<00:03:08.109> gonna<00:03:08.290> see<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.680> is<00:03:08.799> that<00:03:09.010> somehow<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.489> triac

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000

two I mean we could we couldn't who
really<00:03:46.930> does<00:03:47.169> know<00:03:47.530> it's<00:03:47.680> probably<00:03:47.949> only<00:03:48.069> try

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
really does know it's probably only try

up<00:03:48.549> themselves<00:03:48.780> but<00:03:49.780> as<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:49.989> said<00:03:50.319> before<00:03:50.530> the
