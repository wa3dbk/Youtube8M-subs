 [Music] 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:21.300
 well then I 'm here in a truck 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.849
 constellation 24 250 volkswagen com 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.550
 motor sister okay I'll show that is the 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:30.779
 of the fuel line it is only 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.060
 here the right high pressure pump 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.440
 I installed the manometer here at the entrance 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.610
 of the high pump 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.680
 is here the inlet hose I 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.110
 I unplugged an AC adapter. 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.450
 This is the way she comes in. 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.990
 here where I installed the hose 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.150
 blue and I installed it here on the filter where 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.930
 has the lyrics here of the filter letter of 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.500
 goes to the pump inlet. 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.880
 High 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.410
 good so now we will give 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.060
 departure to see how much pressure 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.360
 during the match must be greater than 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:08.340
 between one and two neighborhoods 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.950
 starting it goes up when a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.770
 little more although he took more than 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.829
 during from the pressure 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.140
 is a parent I always think feed the 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:22.350
 high pump even if this implies the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 vacuum pump powered efficiently 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.509
 after having to evaluate the pressure with 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.729
 slow idle here 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.569
 slow looks only the band between 4 and 5 neighborhood 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.030
 potion 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:44.759
 I speed up the vehicle so I can read there 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.829
 I accelerate there 353 5 and 6 for printing on 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.399
 high has to give more than five dies 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.670
 on slow more than 4 and during the match 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:58.380
 more than a neighborhood of pressure and six 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:02.729
 are the details of pressure the truck is 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:07.009
 volkswagen 20 480 driver mann 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.009
 even with the sound that's fine thanks
