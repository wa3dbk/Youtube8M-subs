motherboard<00:01:13.670> let's<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:14.820> ahead<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.090> open<00:01:15.119> this

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
motherboard let's go ahead and open this

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.970 
motherboard let's go ahead and open this
up

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.700

the bottom these pants are made in Japan
so<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.770> can't<00:01:26.070> go<00:01:26.190> wrong<00:01:26.370> with<00:01:26.520> Japanese<00:01:27.050> you

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
so you can't go wrong with Japanese you

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:41.700 
so you can't go wrong with Japanese you
know<00:01:28.140> Japanese<00:01:28.620> a<00:01:29.450> innovation

good<00:02:21.520> for<00:02:21.670> cable<00:02:21.940> management<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.540> don't

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
good for cable management so you don't

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.930 
good for cable management so you don't
need<00:02:22.810> any<00:02:22.930> more<00:02:23.110> extensions<00:02:26.880> well<00:02:27.880> I'm

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
need any more extensions well I'm

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
guessing you need extension ah yes

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.760 
guessing you need extension ah yes
pretty<00:02:32.230> long<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:34.390> there<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.470> have<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.620> I

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
pretty long so there you have it I

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.010 
pretty long so there you have it I
bought<00:02:35.950> two<00:02:36.280> I'm<00:02:37.239> going<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.480> place<00:02:37.780> I'm<00:02:37.930> going

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
bought two I'm going to place I'm going

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.410 
bought two I'm going to place I'm going
to<00:02:38.080> push-pull<00:02:38.709> configuration<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:40.239> next

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
to push-pull configuration and the next

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.030 
to push-pull configuration and the next
part<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.720> video<00:02:40.810> will<00:02:41.080> showcase<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:41.890> how

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
part of the video will showcase you how

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.990 
part of the video will showcase you how
loud<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.610> fan<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:43.570> stay<00:02:43.840> tuned

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
loud the fan is so stay tuned

00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:15.850 
loud the fan is so stay tuned
let's<00:02:46.000> go<00:02:46.120> ahead<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.330> test<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.600> noise<00:02:46.810> out

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.369 

oh<00:03:16.150> my<00:03:17.150> goodness

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:28.070 

like<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.069> static<00:03:22.879> pressure<00:03:23.120> in<00:03:23.299> these

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.170 

so<00:03:28.920> theoretically<00:03:29.220> it's<00:03:29.910> going<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.120> be

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
so theoretically it's going to be

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.550 
so theoretically it's going to be
designed<00:03:30.450> like<00:03:30.540> this<00:03:30.720> because<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.170> radiator

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
designed like this because the radiator

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.690 
designed like this because the radiator
would<00:03:31.740> be<00:03:31.830> in<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:31.950> middle<00:03:33.980> there<00:03:34.980> yeah<00:03:37.700> those

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
would be in the middle there yeah those

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.790 
would be in the middle there yeah those
are<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.030> Kazi<00:03:39.540> Junie<00:03:40.430> 1800<00:03:41.430> rpm<00:03:42.200> 110<00:03:43.200> CFM

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
are the Kazi Junie 1800 rpm 110 CFM

00:03:43.800 --> 00:04:20.449 
are the Kazi Junie 1800 rpm 110 CFM
ready<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.850> be<00:03:44.970> installed

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:33.090 

and<00:04:20.989> this<00:04:21.989> is<00:04:22.139> the<00:04:22.259> Kazi<00:04:22.710> juni<00:04:24.050> 4000

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.020 

let's<00:04:33.610> check<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.910> CFM<00:04:34.420> on<00:04:34.600> this<00:04:34.810> one
