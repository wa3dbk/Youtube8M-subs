00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
a game where we ask different questions

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.800 
a game where we ask different questions
between<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:13.940> different<00:01:14.210> schools<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.660> then

bring it back to our groups and the
answer<00:01:16.430> of<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:16.610> felt<00:01:17.120> like<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.270> survey<00:01:17.720> but<00:01:17.780> it's

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
answer of it felt like a survey but it's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.120

a way to communicate with the other

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:30.100 
a way to communicate with the other
students<00:01:28.509> what<00:01:29.509> we're<00:01:29.630> trying<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.900> do<00:01:29.990> is

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
students what we're trying to do is

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.859 
students what we're trying to do is
connect<00:01:30.619> grade<00:01:31.160> 11<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.670> 12<00:01:31.880> with<00:01:32.390> incoming

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
connect grade 11 and 12 with incoming

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.109 
connect grade 11 and 12 with incoming
grade<00:01:33.050> nines<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.710> we're<00:01:34.280> trying<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:34.580> really

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
grade nines and we're trying to really

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.760 
grade nines and we're trying to really
make<00:01:35.300> that<00:01:35.600> transition<00:01:35.990> process<00:01:36.590> more

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
make that transition process more

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.740 
make that transition process more
successful<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.400> effective<00:01:37.580> it<00:01:38.270> turns<00:01:38.570> out

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
successful and effective it turns out

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.999 
successful and effective it turns out
that<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.960> grade<00:01:39.140> nine<00:01:39.290> is<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.440> leverage<00:01:39.770> year

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
that the grade nine is a leverage year

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.499 
that the grade nine is a leverage year
when<00:01:40.190> kids<00:01:40.430> do<00:01:40.610> better<00:01:40.790> in<00:01:40.970> grade<00:01:41.119> nine<00:01:41.300> they

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
when kids do better in grade nine they

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.390 
when kids do better in grade nine they
do<00:01:41.570> better<00:01:41.840> in<00:01:41.960> every<00:01:42.350> other<00:01:42.500> grade<00:01:42.800> and<00:01:43.070> often

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
do better in every other grade and often

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.100 
do better in every other grade and often
in<00:01:43.520> life<00:01:43.700> when<00:01:44.360> they<00:01:44.450> don't<00:01:44.600> do<00:01:44.810> as<00:01:44.930> well<00:01:45.080> a

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
in life when they don't do as well a

stumbling block and can it kind of set

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.630 
stumbling block and can it kind of set
them<00:01:48.259> down<00:01:48.320> in<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:48.649> vicious<00:01:48.890> cycle<00:01:49.220> instead
