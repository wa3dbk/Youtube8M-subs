we<00:00:01.540> go<00:00:09.420> click<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:13.150> we<00:00:13.750> have<00:00:13.870> a<00:00:13.900> working<00:00:14.290> lens

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:14.470 
we go click and we have a working lens

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:22.080 
we go click and we have a working lens
again<00:00:16.980> at<00:00:17.980> least<00:00:18.190> this<00:00:18.400> part<00:00:19.440> let's<00:00:20.440> not<00:00:21.090> roll

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
again at least this part let's not roll

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.000 
again at least this part let's not roll
it<00:00:22.270> out<00:00:22.390> completely<00:00:22.980> let's<00:00:25.080> put<00:00:26.080> it<00:00:26.170> back<00:00:26.289> like

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
it out completely let's put it back like

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.429 
it out completely let's put it back like
this<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.949> now<00:00:30.250> let's<00:00:30.520> turn<00:00:30.880> that<00:00:31.810> indoor<00:00:32.140> park

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
this and now let's turn that indoor park

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.469 
this and now let's turn that indoor park
clockwise<00:00:36.690> if<00:00:37.690> it's<00:00:38.649> still<00:00:38.800> all<00:00:39.039> the<00:00:39.249> way

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:39.479 
clockwise if it's still all the way

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:42.479 
clockwise if it's still all the way
turned<00:00:40.479> into<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.929> rails<00:00:41.139> if<00:00:41.440> you<00:00:42.219> turn<00:00:42.429> it

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
turned into the rails if you turn it

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.270 
turned into the rails if you turn it
clockwise<00:00:42.760> it<00:00:43.359> will<00:00:43.449> go<00:00:43.690> down<00:00:44.499> at<00:00:44.769> first<00:00:47.280> then

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
clockwise it will go down at first then

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.739 
clockwise it will go down at first then
it'll<00:00:48.519> go<00:00:48.699> up<00:00:50.100> when<00:00:51.100> it's<00:00:51.249> going<00:00:51.549> up<00:00:51.749> stop

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
it'll go up when it's going up stop

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.629 
it'll go up when it's going up stop
somewhere<00:00:53.229> there<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.299> just<00:00:55.949> push<00:00:56.949> the<00:00:57.399> rest

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:57.639 
somewhere there and just push the rest

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:01.289 
somewhere there and just push the rest
of<00:00:57.789> the<00:00:57.879> lens<00:00:58.089> back<00:00:58.389> in<00:00:59.670> don't<00:01:00.670> let<00:01:00.819> it<00:01:00.850> go<00:01:01.059> all

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
of the lens back in don't let it go all

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.180 
of the lens back in don't let it go all
the<00:01:01.600> way<00:01:01.629> back<00:01:01.899> because<00:01:02.709> then<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.010> lens

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
the way back because then the lens

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.150 
the way back because then the lens
fallout<00:01:03.909> as<00:01:04.120> it<00:01:05.020> just<00:01:05.260> did<00:01:07.380> now<00:01:08.380> just<00:01:08.620> to<00:01:08.800> test

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
fallout as it just did now just to test

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.610 
fallout as it just did now just to test
everything<00:01:10.410> we<00:01:11.410> put<00:01:11.620> this<00:01:11.770> little<00:01:12.010> ring<00:01:13.620> into

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
everything we put this little ring into

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.750 
everything we put this little ring into
the<00:01:14.770> mechanism<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:17.500> very<00:01:17.800> careful<00:01:18.220> with<00:01:18.550> this

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
the mechanism be very careful with this

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.930 
the mechanism be very careful with this
part<00:01:19.060> because<00:01:19.690> as<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:21.130> can<00:01:21.160> see<00:01:21.340> I've<00:01:21.730> already

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
part because as you can see I've already

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.190 
part because as you can see I've already
had<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.480> glue<00:01:22.660> it<00:01:22.750> it's<00:01:23.380> very<00:01:23.590> fragile<00:01:25.200> these

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
had to glue it it's very fragile these

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.840 
had to glue it it's very fragile these
things<00:01:26.560> were<00:01:26.770> really<00:01:27.130> not<00:01:27.400> made<00:01:27.670> for

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
things were really not made for

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.190 
things were really not made for
repairing<00:01:30.750> especially<00:01:31.750> if<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:31.900> don't<00:01:32.080> know

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
repairing especially if you don't know

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.110 
repairing especially if you don't know
how<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.380> reassemble<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:33.340> lens<00:01:33.550> you're

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
how to reassemble the lens you're

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.890 
how to reassemble the lens you're
definitely<00:01:34.540> going<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.140> break<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:39.090> now<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.210> to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
definitely going to break it now to to

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.350 
definitely going to break it now to to
put<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.230> small<00:01:41.500> part<00:01:41.770> back<00:01:41.950> in<00:01:42.060> first<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.180> all

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
put the small part back in first of all

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.030 
put the small part back in first of all
we<00:01:43.480> have<00:01:43.510> to<00:01:43.720> turn<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:45.250> big<00:01:45.960> gear<00:01:46.960> here<00:01:47.230> to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
we have to turn the big gear here to

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.220 
we have to turn the big gear here to
turn<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.370> all<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.580> way<00:01:48.850> out<00:01:48.970> so<00:01:49.659> we<00:01:49.810> can't<00:01:50.050> go

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
turn it all the way out so we can't go

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.470 
turn it all the way out so we can't go
any<00:01:50.409> further

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.970 

put<00:01:56.110> it<00:01:56.200> in<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.780> going<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.080> fit<00:01:59.320> into<00:01:59.590> these

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
put it in it's going to fit into these

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.800 
put it in it's going to fit into these
grooves<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:01.830> that's<00:02:02.830> when<00:02:03.160> we<00:02:03.610> can<00:02:03.910> very

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
grooves and that's when we can very

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.760 
grooves and that's when we can very
gently<00:02:05.280> push<00:02:06.280> everything<00:02:06.610> back<00:02:06.820> in<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.770> just

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
gently push everything back in and just

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.880 
gently push everything back in and just
turn<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.280> gear<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.550> bit<00:02:09.820> and<00:02:10.810> it'll<00:02:11.050> all<00:02:11.440> fall

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
turn the gear a bit and it'll all fall

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.840 
turn the gear a bit and it'll all fall
into<00:02:12.100> place<00:02:12.810> do<00:02:13.810> not<00:02:13.840> apply<00:02:14.530> too<00:02:15.340> much<00:02:15.370> force

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
into place do not apply too much force

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.490 
into place do not apply too much force
as<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:17.080> will<00:02:17.260> definitely<00:02:18.040> break<00:02:18.910> off<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
as you will definitely break off the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
as you will definitely break off the
smallest<00:02:20.920> parts<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:22.120> there<00:02:22.390> we<00:02:22.510> go<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:24.190> is<00:02:24.340> a

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
smallest parts and there we go that is a

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:36.420 
smallest parts and there we go that is a
working<00:02:24.970> lens<00:02:29.970> push<00:02:30.970> everything<00:02:31.330> back<00:02:35.430> turn

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
working lens push everything back turn

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.550 
working lens push everything back turn
the<00:02:36.580> gear<00:02:36.790> all<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.180> way<00:02:37.300> out<00:02:37.330> again<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.170> we<00:02:38.320> can

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
the gear all the way out again so we can

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.470 
the gear all the way out again so we can
take<00:02:38.950> out<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.370> ring<00:02:39.870> there<00:02:40.870> we<00:02:40.990> go<00:02:43.830> put<00:02:45.480> this

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
take out the ring there we go put this

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.260 
take out the ring there we go put this
piece<00:02:46.840> through<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.650> ring<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.940> we<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.270> put<00:02:52.480> it

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
piece through the ring so we can put it

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.410 
piece through the ring so we can put it
into<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.300> rest<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.110> floods<00:02:57.960> there<00:02:58.960> we<00:02:59.050> go

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
into the rest of the floods there we go

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:11.160 
into the rest of the floods there we go
and<00:03:02.010> then<00:03:03.010> reapply<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:03.940> ring

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:20.119 

ok

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.059 

and<00:03:21.129> then<00:03:21.909> turn<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.599> gears<00:03:22.750> again<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.319> watch

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
and then turn the gears again and watch

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.149 
and then turn the gears again and watch
it<00:03:24.280> all<00:03:24.400> fall<00:03:24.610> into<00:03:24.819> place<00:03:25.439> if<00:03:26.439> it<00:03:26.680> falls<00:03:26.920> into

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
it all fall into place if it falls into

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.020 
it all fall into place if it falls into
place<00:03:27.310> if<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.120> doesn't<00:03:28.829> try<00:03:29.829> again<00:03:30.069> don't

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
place if it doesn't try again don't

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.440 
place if it doesn't try again don't
apply<00:03:31.239> too<00:03:31.299> much<00:03:31.480> force<00:03:32.400> there<00:03:33.400> we<00:03:33.489> go<00:03:36.450> this

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
apply too much force there we go this

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.720 
apply too much force there we go this
thing<00:03:37.780> is<00:03:38.170> working<00:03:40.200> everything<00:03:41.200> went<00:03:41.859> better

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
thing is working everything went better

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.179 
thing is working everything went better
than<00:03:42.909> expected<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:47.049> rest<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.379> the<00:03:47.680> reassembly

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
than expected the rest of the reassembly

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.140 
than expected the rest of the reassembly
is<00:03:48.400> straightforward<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:50.670> hope<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.790> helped<00:03:52.030> you

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
is straightforward I hope I helped you

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.949 
is straightforward I hope I helped you
guys<00:03:54.629> stay<00:03:55.629> patient<00:03:57.180> don't<00:03:58.180> get<00:03:58.420> a<00:03:58.450> hammer<00:03:58.720> and

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
guys stay patient don't get a hammer and

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.410 
guys stay patient don't get a hammer and
smash<00:03:59.739> it<00:03:59.769> off<00:04:00.069> even<00:04:00.519> though<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.180> really

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
smash it off even though you really

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.890 
smash it off even though you really
really<00:04:01.690> want<00:04:01.989> to<00:04:02.079> at<00:04:02.290> times<00:04:06.299> it<00:04:07.299> might<00:04:07.659> be

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
really want to at times it might be

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.089 
really want to at times it might be
