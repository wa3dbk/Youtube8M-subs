00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.960
 hello everyone welcome to my 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.480
 There are days when the kitchen is a lot of free 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.860
 time and morning want to pamper yourself 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.490
 some special not ordinary breakfast 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.980
 for this we need an egg in the yolk 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.710
 I have now separated us later. 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.420
 it means the protein of one egg I will cook 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.900
 only on themselves so it's all for 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.250
 single serving soft cheese 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.589
 you have to grate the cheese and the more the better 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:55.710
 means we are doing to us now 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:59.610
 you need to shake the protein with salt in this 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.260
 dense mass and so squirrels have whipped us 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:07.049
 here's a cool mass 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.020
 we lay the mold for baking paper 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:17.030
 for baking and neatly 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.030
 lay this mass around on paper 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.970
 so laid out now a small recess 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.970
 doing here 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.020
 in the deepening pour cheese 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.810
 you can sprinkle some greens on me 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.000
 dried parsley but it's actually on 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.880
 your discretion here just 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.180
 dried potion they fit fresh 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.610
 because it can be like this very much 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.450
 finely fine 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.450
 to pour 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.880
 and a little bit at the edges of the protein so that later 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.950
 was beautiful 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.950
 sprinkle lightly with black pepper 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.520
 and to top it all in the middle 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:37.960
 place but we did not quite 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:40.540
 the middle well, egg yolk and send 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.140
 all this in the oven until the protein is not 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.420
 redden cheese melted and that's when 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.140
 you can already get literally 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.570
 some six seven minutes later we 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.180
 It happened to you here is such a luxury 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.430
 and see how it all turned red 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.540
 kite 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.490
 Yummy such from meringue I decided 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.660
 have a little broccoli breakfast 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:10.210
 made the salad so light so 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.610
 I hope that you will like this 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.270
 breakfast option all enjoyable 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.270
 appetite
