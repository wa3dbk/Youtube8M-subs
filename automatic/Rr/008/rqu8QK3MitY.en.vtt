together very tightly one might think
you<00:00:37.710> could<00:00:37.890> open<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.550> way<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.360> seems<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
you could open it this way it seems to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.650 
you could open it this way it seems to
be<00:00:40.470> where<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> most<00:00:40.980> plastic<00:00:41.220> is<00:00:41.700> I'm<00:00:42.360> sure

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660

to open a piece of cheese no it's not

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.049 
to open a piece of cheese no it's not
this<00:00:58.050> method<00:00:58.470> either<00:00:59.480> the<00:01:00.480> secret<00:01:00.900> is<00:01:01.019> in<00:01:02.059> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
this method either the secret is in the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.620 
this method either the secret is in the
wrapper<00:01:03.360> itself<00:01:03.980> on<00:01:05.060> the<00:01:06.060> back<00:01:07.250> hidden<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.630> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
wrapper itself on the back hidden is a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.880 
wrapper itself on the back hidden is a
tiny<00:01:10.050> flap<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.740> plastic<00:01:12.200> once<00:01:13.200> peeled<00:01:13.590> back

tiny flap of plastic once peeled back

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.530 
tiny flap of plastic once peeled back
the<00:01:14.250> process<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.030> relatively<00:01:15.420> simple<00:01:15.870> its

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
the process is relatively simple its

middle you can cause tearing and folding

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.690 
middle you can cause tearing and folding
of<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> cheese<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.310> where

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
of the cheese and you can see here where

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.490 
of the cheese and you can see here where
the<00:01:56.729> choke<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.210> there<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.600> goes<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.320> is

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the choke in there it goes this is

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.499 
the choke in there it goes this is
exactly<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.280> happen<00:01:59.429> if<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.210> try<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
exactly what can happen if you try to

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.389 
exactly what can happen if you try to
grab<00:02:00.780> toward<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.229> middle<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.130> we're<00:02:02.250> going<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
grab toward the middle so we're going to

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.529 
grab toward the middle so we're going to
grab<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> corner<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.359> peel<00:02:04.229> back<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:06.210> is

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
grab a corner and peel back and that is

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:15.200 
grab a corner and peel back and that is
how<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.200> open<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.979> piece<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.759> cheese

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210
