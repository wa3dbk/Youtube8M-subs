pretty good power it's certainly not

pretty good power it's certainly not
slow<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> gearing<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.640> manual

acceleration<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.860> might<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
acceleration so you might have to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.550 
acceleration so you might have to
downshift<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.970> order<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> maintain<00:01:06.420> speed<00:01:07.140> but

that's not really a big deal with the

stick shift clutch pedal travel it's a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.880 
stick shift clutch pedal travel it's a
bit<00:01:12.090> long<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.659> also<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.200> diesel<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.740> bit

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
bit long and also the diesel it's a bit

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.530 
bit long and also the diesel it's a bit
easy<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.340> stall<00:01:14.760> when<00:01:15.030> you're<00:01:15.180> first<00:01:15.360> learning

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540
