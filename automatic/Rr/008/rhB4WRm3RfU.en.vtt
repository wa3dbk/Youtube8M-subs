this is something that you can take care

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.229 
this is something that you can take care
of<00:01:03.140> in<00:01:03.290> either<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:03.770> maclab<00:01:04.250> are<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:04.940> adding

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
of in either the maclab are you adding

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.090 
of in either the maclab are you adding
more<00:01:05.420> heat<00:01:05.600> sinks<00:01:05.960> or<00:01:06.259> you<00:01:06.710> can<00:01:06.890> take

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
more heat sinks or you can take

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.880 
more heat sinks or you can take
advantage<00:01:07.220> of<00:01:08.170> mutton<00:01:09.170> groups

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
advantage of mutton groups
