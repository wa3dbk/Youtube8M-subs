00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Slackline walking on a loosely stretched with 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.740
 trail a new kind of extreme sports 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.120
 gaining popularity in Nizhny Novgorod 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.070
 Nizhny Novgorod Slackline became 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.870
 Gorky square where regularly in the evenings 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.870
 are going to fans of this sport 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.920
 I have known each other for a long time 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.110
 keep your back straight is a little 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.550
 as organizers to watch 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.730
 stay in hell. 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.770
 you are all the time you 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.020
 Yes . highlights if you will often 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.870
 walk not winery there suryn try not 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.840
 give up and not so hard you 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.090
 several falls on your back on your shoulders and 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.260
 stretching the network passes again stand 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.540
 somehow forget the unsafe and sport 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.989
 very concentrated generally straight 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.199
 very difficult to distract I like and 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:19.729
 all the time how to write real 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:22.670
 feelings can not be bad block but it 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.119
 hard enough and as you look with 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.280
 parties 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.490
 weiss bend a little bit to 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.189
 strap-on was considered both hand and backlight 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.500
 to try to balance a name like 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.360
 make it fuel much better than me 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.140
 The first time I really became myself once 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.180
 40 and I did not work out well for a long time 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.509
 only better but if i learn venus 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.470
 there will be such violent emotions 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.170
 positive and joy well in the first times 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.150
 doesn't understand what happened when 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.840
 already learned how to do it all 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.840
 how to describe it 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.440
 feeling of complete control of the situation when 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.910
 it would not seem to be all 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.070
 depends only on you actually how 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.890
 far you want to go when i started 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.860
 I do not think at all . they are all now 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.110
 escalated into a more serious hobby 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.690
 be sure to keep your hands up 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.940
 in the initial stages 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.360
 There are pros who can walk already and 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.550
 bizu 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.690
 but then I was also a rumor that does not fight at 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.690
 you pull what u 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.319
 one of the static tricks is called 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.190
 at home, I ran off the books when both knees are lowered 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.810
 down quite a complicated trick 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.569
 wait 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.370
 the birds are full 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.370
 and then I didn't leave 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.650
 but so how do i jump is difficult 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.130
 I say so man is very much 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.990
 depends on and to learn to walk is simple 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.810
 an ordinary person goes this day well 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.270
 know learn to stand muted 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.310
 On sports such enough democratic 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.180
 despite the fact that people think that 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.440
 it is unreal 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.440
 in fact, everything is real
