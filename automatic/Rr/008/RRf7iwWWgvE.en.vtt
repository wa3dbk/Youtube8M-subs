00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
going to do is just hit it all the way

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.439 
going to do is just hit it all the way

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
around because sometimes that gets keys

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.869

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.790 
little bit at a time to get the drum to
 sideways<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.290> it's<00:01:39.410> gonna<00:01:39.560> see

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
 sideways and it's gonna see

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.260

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
something and it's not gonna want to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.120 
something and it's not gonna want to
spin<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:41.840> if<00:01:41.930> that<00:01:42.020> happens<00:01:42.440> just<00:01:42.530> tap<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:42.980> back

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
spin so if that happens just tap it back

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.830 
spin so if that happens just tap it back
on<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.550> then<00:01:43.640> just<00:01:43.670> slowly<00:01:44.030> keep<00:01:44.420> spinning<00:01:44.780> it

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
on and then just slowly keep spinning it

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.980 
on and then just slowly keep spinning it
while<00:01:45.050> you<00:01:45.140> try<00:01:45.290> to<00:01:45.320> tap<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:46.870> next<00:01:47.870> thing

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
while you try to tap it next thing

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.200 
while you try to tap it next thing
you're<00:01:48.110> gonna<00:01:48.170> want<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.440> do<00:01:48.620> is<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.910> can<00:01:49.940> check

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
you're gonna want to do is you can check

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.780 
you're gonna want to do is you can check
your<00:01:50.420> wheel<00:01:50.600> bearing<00:01:51.130> if<00:01:52.130> your<00:01:52.340> wheel<00:01:52.490> bearing

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
your wheel bearing if your wheel bearing

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.580 
your wheel bearing if your wheel bearing
spins<00:01:53.120> on<00:01:53.300> its<00:01:53.450> own<00:01:53.660> if<00:01:53.900> you<00:01:53.990> go<00:01:54.080> like<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:54.229> it

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
spins on its own if you go like that it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.810 
spins on its own if you go like that it
just<00:01:54.740> keeps<00:01:54.860> spinning<00:01:55.190> that<00:01:55.460> means<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.729> have

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
just keeps spinning that means you have

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.890 
just keeps spinning that means you have
a<00:01:55.850> bad<00:01:56.000> wheel<00:01:56.240> bearing<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.690> that<00:01:56.810> would

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
a bad wheel bearing and that would

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.120 
a bad wheel bearing and that would
probably<00:01:57.080> be<00:01:57.260> a<00:01:57.320> good<00:01:57.440> time<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.710> replace<00:01:58.070> it

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
probably be a good time to replace it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.360 
probably be a good time to replace it
these<00:01:58.940> ones<00:01:59.060> aren't<00:01:59.300> bad<00:01:59.920> cuz<00:02:00.920> they<00:02:01.100> stop

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
these ones aren't bad cuz they stop

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.550 
these ones aren't bad cuz they stop
pretty<00:02:01.580> much<00:02:01.760> nothing<00:02:01.940> wrong<00:02:02.470> next<00:02:03.470> thing

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
pretty much nothing wrong next thing

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.010 
pretty much nothing wrong next thing
you're<00:02:03.650> gonna<00:02:03.710> want<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.010> do<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:04.310> take<00:02:04.520> off<00:02:05.020> the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
you're gonna want to do is take off the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.320 
you're gonna want to do is take off the
springs<00:02:06.380> there's<00:02:07.310> gonna<00:02:07.400> be<00:02:07.550> one<00:02:07.700> long<00:02:07.940> spring

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
springs there's gonna be one long spring

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.630 
springs there's gonna be one long spring
on<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.170> top<00:02:09.380> which<00:02:09.649> is<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.890> same<00:02:10.130> as<00:02:10.250> this<00:02:10.369> way

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
on the top which is the same as this way

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.910 
on the top which is the same as this way
on<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.850> bottom<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:12.260> there's<00:02:12.500> gonna<00:02:12.620> be<00:02:12.770> this

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
on the bottom and there's gonna be this

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.740 
on the bottom and there's gonna be this
short<00:02:13.100> spring<00:02:13.490> right<00:02:13.670> here<00:02:13.730> which<00:02:14.240> has<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.480> hook

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
short spring right here which has a hook

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.280 
short spring right here which has a hook
on<00:02:14.900> one<00:02:15.110> end<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.560> it's<00:02:15.650> kind<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:15.980> like<00:02:16.160> a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
on one end and it's kind of like a

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.080 
on one end and it's kind of like a
jagged<00:02:18.290> almost<00:02:18.709> half<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.160> z<00:02:19.400> shape<00:02:19.700> on<00:02:19.940> this

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
jagged almost half a z shape on this

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.740 
jagged almost half a z shape on this
side<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:21.560> take<00:02:21.740> those<00:02:21.920> Springs<00:02:22.250> off<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:22.820> also

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
side so take those Springs off and also

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.699 
side so take those Springs off and also
these<00:02:23.870> little<00:02:23.930> pins<00:02:24.410> right<00:02:24.650> here<00:02:25.000> have<00:02:26.000> like<00:02:26.450> a

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
these little pins right here have like a

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.080 
these little pins right here have like a
part<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:27.770> sticks<00:02:28.100> out<00:02:28.280> all<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.820> got<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.030> do

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
part that sticks out all you got to do

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.620 
part that sticks out all you got to do
is<00:02:29.209> squeeze<00:02:29.540> this<00:02:29.780> together<00:02:31.420> next<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.510> want

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
is squeeze this together next you want

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.800 
is squeeze this together next you want
to<00:02:32.660> pop<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.020> ebrake<00:02:33.650> cable<00:02:34.040> off<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.340> back

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
to pop the ebrake cable off the back

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.690 
to pop the ebrake cable off the back
it's<00:02:35.810> pretty<00:02:35.959> easy<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.320> do<00:02:36.530> just<00:02:36.739> right<00:02:37.489> here

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
it's pretty easy to do just right here

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.479 
it's pretty easy to do just right here
it<00:02:37.790> just<00:02:37.820> slides<00:02:38.209> right<00:02:38.330> off<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:40.130> after<00:02:40.370> that

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
it just slides right off and after that

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.060 
it just slides right off and after that
take<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:41.060> rubber<00:02:41.330> bumper<00:02:41.720> off<00:02:41.900> that's<00:02:42.860> just

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
take this rubber bumper off that's just

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.380 
take this rubber bumper off that's just
a<00:02:43.190> sealant<00:02:43.580> that<00:02:43.640> goes<00:02:43.850> right<00:02:44.030> there<00:02:44.180> on<00:02:44.300> the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
a sealant that goes right there on the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.030 
a sealant that goes right there on the
outside<00:02:44.510> just<00:02:45.080> pop<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.500> off<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.830> then<00:02:45.950> this

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
outside just pop that off and then this

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.440 
outside just pop that off and then this
whole<00:02:46.250> thing<00:02:46.310> will<00:02:46.640> slide<00:02:46.910> right<00:02:46.940> out<00:02:47.150> after

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
whole thing will slide right out after

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.540 
whole thing will slide right out after
you<00:02:47.630> have<00:02:47.720> all<00:02:47.840> those<00:02:47.930> Springs<00:02:48.260> off<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.769> don't

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
you have all those Springs off I don't

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.680 
you have all those Springs off I don't
even<00:02:49.610> bother<00:02:49.790> taking<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.269> spring<00:02:50.510> off

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
even bother taking this spring off

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.270 
even bother taking this spring off
there's<00:02:50.930> really<00:02:51.080> no<00:02:51.290> reason<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.680> that's<00:02:52.190> just

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
there's really no reason to that's just

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.830 
there's really no reason to that's just
the<00:02:52.549> self<00:02:53.000> adjuster<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:55.400> get<00:02:55.549> this<00:02:55.700> pad<00:02:56.000> or

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
the self adjuster to get this pad or

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.650 
the self adjuster to get this pad or
this<00:02:57.049> shoe<00:02:57.950> off<00:02:58.120> you're<00:02:59.120> gonna<00:02:59.209> have<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.420> spray

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
this shoe off you're gonna have to spray

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.090 
this shoe off you're gonna have to spray
a<00:02:59.690> whole<00:02:59.900> bunch<00:03:00.080> of<00:03:00.200> PB<00:03:00.440> Blaster<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:01.010> might

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
a whole bunch of PB Blaster it might

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.530 
a whole bunch of PB Blaster it might
even<00:03:01.280> want<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.489> let<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:01.730> soak<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.150> something

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
even want to let it soak in something

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.630 
even want to let it soak in something
for<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.810> couple<00:03:03.080> hours<00:03:03.170> because<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.459> very

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
for a couple hours because this is very

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.900 
for a couple hours because this is very
rusted<00:03:05.239> because<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.530> ebrake<00:03:07.489> doesn't<00:03:07.820> work

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
rusted because the ebrake doesn't work

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.580 
rusted because the ebrake doesn't work
on<00:03:08.060> this<00:03:08.180> car<00:03:08.420> so<00:03:08.690> that<00:03:08.810> just<00:03:09.019> sits<00:03:09.200> still<00:03:09.410> when

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
on this car so that just sits still when

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.530 
on this car so that just sits still when
you<00:03:09.650> pull<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.950> e<00:03:09.980> brake<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.459> it<00:03:10.580> doesn't<00:03:10.880> move

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
you pull the e brake so it doesn't move

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.810 
you pull the e brake so it doesn't move
like<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:12.140> should<00:03:12.410> often<00:03:12.950> enough<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:13.549> it's<00:03:13.670> all

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
like it should often enough so it's all

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.360 
like it should often enough so it's all
rusted<00:03:14.180> together<00:03:14.480> let<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.440> soak<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:15.980> then

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
rusted together let that soak and then

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.890 
rusted together let that soak and then
hit<00:03:16.760> it<00:03:16.790> with<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.000> hammer<00:03:17.060> or<00:03:17.420> something<00:03:17.570> not

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
hit it with a hammer or something not

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.720 
hit it with a hammer or something not
hard<00:03:18.080> enough<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.410> bend<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.739> but<00:03:19.250> that'll<00:03:19.580> allow

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
hard enough to bend it but that'll allow

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.090 
hard enough to bend it but that'll allow
you<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:20.120> get<00:03:20.780> this<00:03:20.989> shoe<00:03:21.230> out<00:03:21.260> from<00:03:21.769> there<00:03:21.950> this

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
you to get this shoe out from there this

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.330
