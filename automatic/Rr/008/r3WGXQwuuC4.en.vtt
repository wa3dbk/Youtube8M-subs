00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
tire pressure and of course what road

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.710 
tire pressure and of course what road
trip<00:02:19.130> would<00:02:19.250> be<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.670> road<00:02:20.000> trip<00:02:20.240> without<00:02:20.390> an

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720
