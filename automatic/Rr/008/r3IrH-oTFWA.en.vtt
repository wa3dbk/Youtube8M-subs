00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.980
 hello welcome to my game of the month here 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.080
 is the umpteenth expansion of our 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.029
 dead beings favorite one of them from 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.310
 this in trip to the second darkness 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.199
 edition on this occasion the oath of 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.869
 the exiled expansion of hermes and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.180
 monsters this extension that contains 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.610
 a lot of plastic are four new heroes 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.860
 and three new monsters with their cards and 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.050
 a couple of adventures is an expansion that 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.850
 personally I find it a little ugly what 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.920
 what they have done with it is worth it is great 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.820
 as you can see it was in this plastic in these 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.250
 bits that do not have easy open and it's expensive 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.840
 but it is that regardless of what 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.280
 we end up with a lot with some 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.809
 miniatures that in this case did not have 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.200
 why come because they are miniatures 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.240
 new but now you will see why it is a 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.360
 gesture a little ugly what they are doing 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.830
 I open this we will have here the paper where 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.170
 we see the back of the 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.940
 monsters and the heroes and we have here the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.130
 instruction manual a double sheet 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.190
 where inside the two adventures come 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.870
 we can play the one rumor of act one the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.150
 oath of the exile and a rumor of 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.200
 act two prison of ice and lies 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.750
 these two adventures can be played 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.570
 loose or we can put them inside a 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.040
 campaign just like rumors 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.600
 well, inside we are in the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.880
 back by the way the summary of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.510
 the monsters and the excesses and inside 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.260
 we found four new letters or 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.410
 cards hero cards that maybe not you 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.840
 tell your images a lot and we are going to 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.510
 say a lot to the plastic the truth is 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.810
 the 411 of each archetype but the same 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.450
 sound the names are three what the strong 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.260
 laurel of the forest bloody chill 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.850
 and what the old man says something we're going to 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.590
 see the monsters we have here the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.140
 monster cards for example from those 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.270
 more sites 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.610
 we have a couple of letters for the lord 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.360
 supreme one for the supreme lord to the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.800
 invisible we have the two letters good 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.280
 we have a letter with compression of 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.500
 ice and lies that is the rumor of act 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.979
 2 and a rumor letter of act 1 that is 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.780
 the oath of the exile and here they are 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.520
 the monster cards and I read your 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.040
 names to the cutting parana poisonous and 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.720
 beast man this sure that if it says to you 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.740
 something more then seriously the plastic that 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:29.110
 comes of course sheathed 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.630
 in this kind of boxes very well brought 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.820
 ok here the Serbs have their hole 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.710
 each one of his and the monsters have 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.430
 no bag we are going to see them in the 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.200
 famous rotating pedestal that rescued 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.579
 first of all we see laurel of the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.859
 bloody forest is an elf that in 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.859
 this case comes to us as an explorer 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.629
 but the strong one is a human and appears 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.819
 As a warrior, look what is 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.819
 pretty pretty aggressive 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.160
 moc the elder is a bow that has something 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.810
 magical powers so appears 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.770
 his cane that the skull is very cool and 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.770
 also quite aggressive 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.720
 and finally chill is I did not know 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.270
 tell us very well what it is but it is a vague 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.959
 is a sorcerer appears with some chains 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.959
 it's pretty spectacular 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.070
 as for the monsters we see in 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.110
 contagious spiders first 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.470
 we have two in bone color and one in 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.470
 Red color 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.050
 here beast 3 men in bone color 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.050
 and 1 in red 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.200
 and the mythical ones to the cutting 3 in color 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.200
 bone also and one in red 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.010
 well then seen the plastic now 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.050
 I explain why this is ugly if they do not sound 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.060
 the names I will tell you that these heroes and 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.010
 these monsters belonged to test in 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.290
 first edition and appear in the others 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.230
 games of terry kingdoms appear to us 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.940
 to appear appear in rumba and although 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.960
 we do not have in Spain appear the 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.600
 ours appear even in quest and they 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.530
 it's a bit ugly that they sold us 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.080
 a pack or a conversion kit with the 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.120
 Heroes chips and cards the 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.130
 letters from the monsters of the first 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.480
 stent edition precisely so that 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.550
 if we had that first edition of the 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.810
 best we could use all the plastic 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.270
 of heroes and all the plastic of 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.310
 monsters is worth it is the kit 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.430
 expansion now it turns out that it's going to 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.170
 replace with this new new heroes 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.180
 plastic for heroes new plastic for 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.969
 monsters of the same jealousy and 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.979
 same classic terrain monsters 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.269
 this life for the fantasy fly page 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.669
 that here you can see that they will come out more 

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:31.709
 of these packs that we understand that 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.679
 over time they are going to put us 

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:36.360
 complete all the heroes we had 

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:39.239
 on the ground and all the monsters that 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.849
 we had then so that you have us 

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:43.199
 sold the pack the conversion kit is 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.419
 now the conversion kit we can 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.309
 pull and all the plastic from in 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.839
 first edition except to play from 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:50.639
 in first edition we can throw it away 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:53.339
 because here we have new plastic 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.500
 new chips and new cards is a 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:57.840
 movement a little ugly to me understand 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.400
 and here you have it so that you can see what 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.400
 bring thank you for your time
