the deck is I believe twelve feet long
five<00:00:57.360> feet<00:00:57.660> wide<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:59.219> these<00:00:59.430> little

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
five feet wide I have these little

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.200 
five feet wide I have these little
removable<00:01:00.420> log<00:01:00.960> holders<00:01:01.410> here<00:01:01.850> they<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.030> fit

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
removable log holders here they just fit

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.770 
removable log holders here they just fit
down<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.710> slot<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:09.180> boom

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
down and slot like that the boom

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
in the bottom section is eight feet so

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.219 
in the bottom section is eight feet so
how's<00:01:16.020> about<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.290> 16<00:01:16.799> foot<00:01:17.130> reach<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
how's about a 16 foot reach this is the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.620 
how's about a 16 foot reach this is the
main<00:01:19.409> lift<00:01:19.710> cylinder<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.479> see

main lift cylinder here as you can see

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
main lift cylinder here as you can see
by<00:01:21.990> hand<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.619> pretty<00:01:22.799> big<00:01:23.040> one<00:01:24.439> this<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
by hand it's a pretty big one this is

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.810 
by hand it's a pretty big one this is
the<00:01:25.740> one<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.100> turns<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.439> outer

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
the one that turns the outer

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.120 
the one that turns the outer
them<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.320> if<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.440> take<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.650> look<00:01:30.860> at<00:01:31.010> that

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
them and if you take a look at that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.219 
them and if you take a look at that
setup<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:32.090> kind<00:01:32.330> of<00:01:32.450> can<00:01:32.659> imagine<00:01:33.080> how<00:01:33.200> it

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
setup you kind of can imagine how it

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.480

does that that boom has a stroke of 14
or<00:01:37.670> 15<00:01:38.030> inches<00:01:38.450> but<00:01:38.780> it<00:01:38.900> will<00:01:38.960> actually<00:01:41.200> move

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
or 15 inches but it will actually move

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.240 
or 15 inches but it will actually move
this<00:01:42.470> boom<00:01:43.369> right<00:01:43.610> here<00:01:43.670> 180<00:01:44.540> degrees<00:01:45.070> by<00:01:46.070> only

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
moving that 14 or 15 inches so if you

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.609 
moving that 14 or 15 inches so if you
set<00:01:49.040> yours<00:01:49.250> up<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:49.580> look<00:01:49.700> like<00:01:49.729> that<00:01:50.590> kind<00:01:51.590> of

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
set yours up to look like that kind of

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.670 
set yours up to look like that kind of
that<00:01:51.800> little<00:01:52.810> twisting<00:01:53.810> thing<00:01:54.050> they<00:01:54.530> use

housing is pretty thick it's like a half
inch<00:02:19.970> thick<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.180> probably<00:02:23.180> one<00:02:23.750> and

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
inch thick and this is probably one and

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.790 
inch thick and this is probably one and
a<00:02:23.959> quarter<00:02:25.840> there's<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.959> bearing<00:02:27.320> down<00:02:27.470> there

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
a quarter there's a bearing down there

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.620 
a quarter there's a bearing down there
to<00:02:28.700> make<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.120> stronger

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
to make it stronger

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.810 
to make it stronger
and<00:02:30.320> of<00:02:30.560> course<00:02:30.769> this<00:02:30.950> bearing<00:02:31.370> up<00:02:31.489> here<00:02:31.730> in

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
and of course this bearing up here in

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.710 
and of course this bearing up here in
the<00:02:31.910> hub<00:02:32.350> this<00:02:33.350> is<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.739> dump<00:02:33.950> truck<00:02:34.540> axle<00:02:35.540> hub

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
the hub this is the dump truck axle hub

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.800 
the hub this is the dump truck axle hub
right<00:02:36.019> here<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:37.220> this<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.459> actually<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.239> wheel

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
right here and this is actually a wheel

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.340 
right here and this is actually a wheel
that's<00:02:39.290> been<00:02:39.470> cut<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.720> then<00:02:41.989> here's<00:02:42.200> the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
that's been cut and then here's the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.539 
that's been cut and then here's the
bolts<00:02:42.650> like<00:02:43.250> you'd<00:02:43.640> have<00:02:43.820> on<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.000> hub<00:02:44.530> so

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
bolts like you'd have on a hub so

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.400 
bolts like you'd have on a hub so
because<00:02:46.549> it's<00:02:46.760> an<00:02:46.880> axle<00:02:47.299> hub<00:02:47.480> it's<00:02:47.989> meant<00:02:48.260> to

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
because it's an axle hub it's meant to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.460 
because it's an axle hub it's meant to
have<00:02:49.090> forces<00:02:50.090> both<00:02:50.450> turning<00:02:51.260> and

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
have forces both turning and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.630 
have forces both turning and
side-to-side<00:02:52.570> which<00:02:53.570> is<00:02:53.720> perfect<00:02:54.140> for<00:02:54.640> what

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
side-to-side which is perfect for what

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.000 
side-to-side which is perfect for what
I'm<00:02:55.760> using<00:02:55.940> this<00:02:56.239> is<00:02:56.299> a<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.930> guess<00:02:57.709> you<00:02:57.860> could

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
I'm using this is a I guess you could

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.490 
I'm using this is a I guess you could
call<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.400> full<00:02:58.549> floating<00:02:58.940> axle<00:02:59.500> meaning

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
call it a full floating axle meaning

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.759 
call it a full floating axle meaning
that<00:03:00.970> it's<00:03:01.970> bolted<00:03:02.480> down<00:03:02.660> here<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:04.040> all<00:03:04.940> the

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
that it's bolted down here so all the

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.270 
that it's bolted down here so all the
force<00:03:06.769> is<00:03:07.070> on<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.930> axle<00:03:08.930> shaft<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.650> axle

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
force is on the axle shaft the axle

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.759 
force is on the axle shaft the axle
housing<00:03:10.310> none<00:03:11.090> of<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.299> force<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:12.140> taken<00:03:12.590> on

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
housing none of the force is taken on

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.690 
housing none of the force is taken on
the<00:03:13.070> axle<00:03:13.489> shaft<00:03:14.049> so<00:03:15.160> if<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.340> were<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.549> build

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
the axle shaft so if you were to build

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.530 
the axle shaft so if you were to build
one<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:18.019> were<00:03:18.140> using<00:03:18.380> a<00:03:18.620> semi<00:03:18.920> floating

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
one and you were using a semi floating

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.660 
one and you were using a semi floating
meaning<00:03:20.540> once<00:03:21.079> you<00:03:21.260> take<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:21.980> axle<00:03:22.370> out<00:03:22.459> you

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
meaning once you take the axle out you

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.170 
meaning once you take the axle out you
can<00:03:22.820> just

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
can just

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.490 
can just
lit<00:03:23.299> out<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.689> don't<00:03:23.780> have<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.989> remove<00:03:24.290> any

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
lit out you don't have to remove any

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.099 
lit out you don't have to remove any
bolts<00:03:24.829> up<00:03:24.950> here<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:26.120> need<00:03:26.329> to<00:03:26.390> have<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.659> really

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
bolts up here you need to have a really

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.789 
bolts up here you need to have a really
strong<00:03:27.560> bearing<00:03:28.159> down<00:03:28.340> here<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:29.659> make<00:03:30.469> sure<00:03:30.620> it

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
strong bearing down here to make sure it

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.059 
strong bearing down here to make sure it
wouldn't<00:03:31.129> break<00:03:31.430> or<00:03:31.700> tilt<00:03:32.200> but<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.469> mean<00:03:33.859> that's

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
wouldn't break or tilt but I mean that's

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.640 
wouldn't break or tilt but I mean that's
a<00:03:34.189> really<00:03:34.459> heavy-duty<00:03:34.730> hub<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:35.450> don't<00:03:35.810> think

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
a really heavy-duty hub so I don't think

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.190 
a really heavy-duty hub so I don't think
I'm<00:03:36.859> going<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.040> have<00:03:37.159> a<00:03:37.519> problem<00:03:37.790> with<00:03:38.030> that

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
I'm going to have a problem with that

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.819 
I'm going to have a problem with that
you<00:03:39.200> can<00:03:39.230> kind<00:03:39.439> of<00:03:39.500> see<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.799> hub<00:03:39.950> right<00:03:40.159> here

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
you can kind of see the hub right here

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.729 
you can kind of see the hub right here
so<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:43.069> whole<00:03:43.219> thing<00:03:43.430> spins<00:03:43.790> on<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.739> and

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
so the whole thing spins on that and

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.379 
so the whole thing spins on that and
then<00:03:46.579> rotates<00:03:47.120> with<00:03:47.659> that<00:03:47.840> so<00:03:48.049> under<00:03:48.319> there

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
then rotates with that so under there

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.789 
then rotates with that so under there
the<00:03:50.389> whole<00:03:50.540> boom<00:03:50.780> is<00:03:50.959> supported<00:03:51.469> with<00:03:51.500> C

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
the whole boom is supported with C

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.589 
the whole boom is supported with C
channel<00:03:52.189> back<00:03:52.370> here<00:03:52.730> that's<00:03:52.939> welded<00:03:53.239> directly

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
channel back here that's welded directly

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.390 
channel back here that's welded directly
on<00:03:54.139> to<00:03:54.349> that<00:03:54.500> wheel<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.799> cylinder<00:03:58.250> goes

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
on to that wheel and the cylinder goes

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.289 
on to that wheel and the cylinder goes
right<00:03:58.639> there

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.870 

two<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:04.510> five-sixteenth<00:04:05.170> inch

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.680 

I<00:04:08.930> apply<00:04:09.930> school<00:04:10.320> valve<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:14.300> one<00:04:15.300> thing<00:04:15.510> about

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
I apply school valve and one thing about

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.170 
I apply school valve and one thing about
this<00:04:15.960> I<00:04:16.230> like<00:04:16.740> using<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.280> cylinder<00:04:17.670> even<00:04:18.060> though

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
this I like using a cylinder even though

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.960 
this I like using a cylinder even though
I<00:04:18.209> only<00:04:18.330> get<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.930> think<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.440> get<00:04:21.110> 120<00:04:22.110> degrees<00:04:22.440> of

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
I only get I think I get 120 degrees of

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.090 
I only get I think I get 120 degrees of
facing<00:04:23.970> out<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.270> boom<00:04:24.680> still<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.830> can<00:04:25.980> do

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
facing out of the boom still you can do

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.330 
facing out of the boom still you can do
it<00:04:26.250> really<00:04:26.460> slowly<00:04:27.170> and<00:04:28.170> it's<00:04:28.830> got<00:04:28.950> lots<00:04:29.220> of

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
it really slowly and it's got lots of

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.940 
it really slowly and it's got lots of
power<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.790> swinging<00:04:30.060> heavy<00:04:30.150> logs<00:04:30.510> around

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
power to swinging heavy logs around

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.680 
power to swinging heavy logs around
before<00:04:31.950> I<00:04:32.190> used<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:33.620> gearbox<00:04:35.330> which<00:04:36.330> I'll<00:04:36.510> show

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
before I used a gearbox which I'll show

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.050 
before I used a gearbox which I'll show
you<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:40.500> there<00:04:40.950> was<00:04:41.070> a<00:04:41.100> hydraulic<00:04:41.460> motor<00:04:41.820> that

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
you and there was a hydraulic motor that

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.510 
you and there was a hydraulic motor that
would<00:04:43.050> drive<00:04:43.260> these<00:04:43.500> gears<00:04:43.800> right<00:04:44.040> in<00:04:44.190> here

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
would drive these gears right in here

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.550 
would drive these gears right in here
the<00:04:45.030> thing<00:04:45.300> had<00:04:45.540> no<00:04:45.720> power<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.380> it<00:04:46.470> would

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
the thing had no power and it would

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.410 
the thing had no power and it would
swing<00:04:46.830> way<00:04:47.100> too<00:04:47.160> fast<00:04:47.610> I<00:04:50.000> would<00:04:51.000> definitely

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
swing way too fast I would definitely

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.390 
swing way too fast I would definitely
recommend<00:04:51.540> going<00:04:52.050> cylinder<00:04:52.860> rather<00:04:53.100> than

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
recommend going cylinder rather than

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.170 
recommend going cylinder rather than
hydraulic<00:04:53.910> motor<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:55.110> swing<00:04:55.350> the<00:04:55.500> will<00:04:59.180> here's

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
hydraulic motor to swing the will here's

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.450 
hydraulic motor to swing the will here's
the<00:05:00.360> engine<00:05:00.750> it's<00:05:01.380> just<00:05:01.620> a<00:05:01.710> lawnmower<00:05:02.100> engine

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
the engine it's just a lawnmower engine

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.100 
the engine it's just a lawnmower engine
12<00:05:02.730> horsepower<00:05:04.700> little<00:05:05.700> tiny<00:05:06.390> gas<00:05:06.660> tank<00:05:06.930> on

12 horsepower little tiny gas tank on

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.530 
12 horsepower little tiny gas tank on
there<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:11.160> engine<00:05:11.490> drives<00:05:11.730> this<00:05:11.880> belt<00:05:12.180> here

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
there the engine drives this belt here

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.160 
there the engine drives this belt here
it's<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.050> gear<00:05:13.230> reduction<00:05:13.710> because<00:05:14.070> my

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
it's a gear reduction because my

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.330 
it's a gear reduction because my
hydraulic<00:05:16.170> pump<00:05:16.380> only<00:05:16.680> takes<00:05:16.890> 2,000<00:05:17.490> rpm<00:05:17.850> on

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
hydraulic pump only takes 2,000 rpm on

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.130 
hydraulic pump only takes 2,000 rpm on
bearing<00:05:20.340> right<00:05:20.520> in<00:05:20.670> there

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
bearing right in there

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.760 
bearing right in there
to<00:05:22.470> minimize<00:05:22.860> wear<00:05:23.790> on<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.240> hydraulic<00:05:24.720> pump

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.970 

there's<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:28.860> hydraulic<00:05:29.250> pump<00:05:29.580> it's<00:05:30.060> a<00:05:30.150> Cessna

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
there's a hydraulic pump it's a Cessna

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.930 
there's a hydraulic pump it's a Cessna
let<00:05:31.980> me<00:05:32.070> see<00:05:32.220> if<00:05:32.340> I<00:05:32.400> can<00:05:32.520> get<00:05:32.640> a<00:05:32.670> close-up<00:05:32.940> view

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
let me see if I can get a close-up view

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.090 
let me see if I can get a close-up view
yep<00:05:34.570> there<00:05:35.080> you<00:05:35.260> can<00:05:35.410> kind<00:05:35.560> of<00:05:35.650> see<00:05:35.830> it<00:05:35.920> better

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
yep there you can kind of see it better

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.540 
yep there you can kind of see it better
and<00:05:37.030> there's<00:05:37.420> the<00:05:37.600> engine

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.780 

here's<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.760> intake<00:05:43.540> line<00:05:43.980> my<00:05:44.980> hydraulic<00:05:45.520> tank

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
here's the intake line my hydraulic tank

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.520 
here's the intake line my hydraulic tank
is<00:05:46.030> just<00:05:46.210> an<00:05:46.390> air-compressor<00:05:46.720> tank<00:05:47.290> that<00:05:47.500> I

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
is just an air-compressor tank that I

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:56.850 
is just an air-compressor tank that I
welded<00:05:47.800> ports<00:05:48.280> on<00:05:48.430> to<00:05:55.020> 12<00:05:56.020> gallon<00:05:56.350> tank

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
welded ports on to 12 gallon tank

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.030 
welded ports on to 12 gallon tank
I<00:05:56.920> just<00:05:57.850> welded<00:05:58.590> some<00:05:59.590> pipe<00:05:59.800> on<00:06:00.010> to<00:06:00.190> it

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
I just welded some pipe on to it

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.060 
I just welded some pipe on to it
my<00:06:03.040> breather<00:06:03.310> cap<00:06:03.430> you<00:06:04.210> can<00:06:04.390> see<00:06:04.570> how<00:06:04.720> I

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
my breather cap you can see how I

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.070 
my breather cap you can see how I
machined<00:06:06.070> out<00:06:06.280> those<00:06:07.000> two<00:06:07.180> slots<00:06:07.570> one<00:06:07.930> right

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
machined out those two slots one right

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.620 
machined out those two slots one right
there<00:06:08.350> one<00:06:08.380> right<00:06:08.620> there<00:06:09.010> to<00:06:10.000> allow<00:06:10.240> for<00:06:10.480> air

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
there one right there to allow for air

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.620 
there one right there to allow for air
to<00:06:11.100> come<00:06:12.100> in<00:06:12.310> and<00:06:12.490> out<00:06:12.550> as<00:06:12.790> you<00:06:13.120> move<00:06:13.150> the

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
to come in and out as you move the

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.000 
to come in and out as you move the
hydraulic<00:06:14.050> cylinder<00:06:14.440> so<00:06:14.560> you<00:06:14.650> have<00:06:14.740> to<00:06:14.920> have

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
hydraulic cylinder so you have to have

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.800 
hydraulic cylinder so you have to have
some<00:06:15.220> sort<00:06:15.370> of<00:06:15.490> a<00:06:15.580> breather<00:06:15.820> on<00:06:16.090> any<00:06:16.300> hydraulic

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
some sort of a breather on any hydraulic

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.620 
some sort of a breather on any hydraulic
system<00:06:17.400> also<00:06:18.400> to<00:06:18.460> definitely<00:06:19.210> recommend

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
system also to definitely recommend

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:35.610 
system also to definitely recommend
putting<00:06:19.870> a<00:06:19.990> filter<00:06:20.200> on<00:06:20.470> it<00:06:34.230> that's<00:06:35.230> the<00:06:35.410> setup

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
putting a filter on it that's the setup

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.740 
putting a filter on it that's the setup
I<00:06:35.860> have<00:06:36.070> for<00:06:36.370> starting<00:06:37.030> it<00:06:37.180> it's<00:06:37.420> just<00:06:37.570> a

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
I have for starting it it's just a

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.380 
I have for starting it it's just a
lawnmower<00:06:38.080> key<00:06:38.470> switch<00:06:38.680> right<00:06:38.890> there

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
lawnmower key switch right there

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.500 
lawnmower key switch right there
throttle<00:06:40.390> and<00:06:40.480> choker<00:06:40.840> right<00:06:41.020> there<00:06:42.510> extended

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
throttle and choker right there extended

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.310

the<00:06:43.600> oil<00:06:43.780> port<00:06:44.140> to<00:06:44.380> make<00:06:44.650> less<00:06:45.160> of<00:06:45.310> a<00:06:45.370> mess

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
the oil port to make less of a mess

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:53.670 
the oil port to make less of a mess
battery<00:06:47.320> goes<00:06:47.770> right<00:06:47.980> in<00:06:48.070> there<00:06:52.290> as<00:06:53.290> I<00:06:53.470> said

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
battery goes right in there as I said

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.110 
battery goes right in there as I said
before<00:06:53.800> I<00:06:54.010> just<00:06:54.190> have<00:06:54.310> a<00:06:54.370> hook<00:06:54.550> on<00:06:54.700> this<00:06:54.880> but

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
before I just have a hook on this but

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.970 
before I just have a hook on this but
I'm<00:06:55.180> going<00:06:55.330> to<00:06:55.360> make<00:06:55.480> a<00:06:55.540> grapple<00:06:55.960> pretty<00:06:56.170> soon

00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:58.980 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.310 

these<00:06:59.980> extra<00:07:00.400> hoses<00:07:00.790> are<00:07:00.940> to<00:07:01.630> control<00:07:02.200> the

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
these extra hoses are to control the

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.770 
these extra hoses are to control the
grapple<00:07:02.800> to<00:07:03.640> or<00:07:03.790> to<00:07:03.940> open<00:07:04.180> and<00:07:04.300> close<00:07:04.480> it<00:07:04.660> and

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
grapple to or to open and close it and

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.810 
grapple to or to open and close it and
to<00:07:04.930> or<00:07:05.020> to<00:07:05.110> spin<00:07:05.320> it<00:07:07.350> I<00:07:08.370> guess<00:07:09.370> that's<00:07:09.610> it

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
to or to spin it I guess that's it

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.080 
to or to spin it I guess that's it
that's<00:07:10.570> all<00:07:10.750> I<00:07:10.810> can<00:07:11.050> think<00:07:11.080> of<00:07:11.790> give<00:07:12.790> you<00:07:12.880> shot

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
that's all I can think of give you shot

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.560 
that's all I can think of give you shot
at<00:07:13.240> the<00:07:13.330> underside<00:07:13.690> hope<00:07:14.020> this<00:07:14.230> helps
