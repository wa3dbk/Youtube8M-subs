00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
game I feel like I just wanted to play

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.300

on<00:01:11.430> ignoring<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.270> stay<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> game<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.310> I

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
on ignoring the stay of the game and I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.060 
on ignoring the stay of the game and I
really<00:01:14.760> enjoyed<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.299> time<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.229> far<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.890> can

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
really enjoyed my time so far it can

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.429 
really enjoyed my time so far it can
take<00:01:17.280> some<00:01:17.490> time<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.759> each<00:01:18.180> battle<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.869> you

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
take some time with each battle and you

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.050 
take some time with each battle and you
really<00:01:19.740> do<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.070> think<00:01:20.369> about<00:01:20.460> each<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
really do have to think about each and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.390 
really do have to think about each and
every<00:01:21.450> move<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.930> take<00:01:22.200> sometimes<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.280> can

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
every move you take sometimes so it can

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.580 
every move you take sometimes so it can
feel<00:01:23.580> when<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.150> tense

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
feel when you tense

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.359 
feel when you tense
which<00:01:25.130> is<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.310> good<00:01:25.579> thing<00:01:25.640> sumed<00:01:27.039> centric<00:01:28.039> can

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
which is a good thing sumed centric can

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.639 
which is a good thing sumed centric can
be<00:01:28.579> vague<00:01:28.969> at<00:01:29.210> times<00:01:29.509> but<00:01:29.990> usually<00:01:30.530> you're

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
be vague at times but usually you're

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.560 
be vague at times but usually you're
more<00:01:30.829> concentrated<00:01:31.549> next<00:01:31.939> move<00:01:32.149> so<00:01:32.329> you<00:01:32.420> don't

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
more concentrated next move so you don't

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.789 
more concentrated next move so you don't
notice<00:01:32.810> it<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:35.030> sounds<00:01:35.390> with<00:01:35.479> attacks<00:01:35.869> can<00:01:36.590> be

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
notice it it sounds with attacks can be

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.399 
notice it it sounds with attacks can be
a<00:01:36.829> bit<00:01:37.100> generic<00:01:37.310> an<00:01:37.819> extent<00:01:38.299> but<00:01:38.569> I<00:01:39.109> personally

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
a bit generic an extent but I personally

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.800 
a bit generic an extent but I personally
don't<00:01:39.619> mind<00:01:39.890> them<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:41.090> just<00:01:41.149> lend<00:01:41.539> them<00:01:41.659> to

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
don't mind them and I just lend them to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.389 
don't mind them and I just lend them to
be<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.020> nice<00:01:42.319> but<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.860> game<00:01:43.450> graphics<00:01:44.450> that
