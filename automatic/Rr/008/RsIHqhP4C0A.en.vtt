screen for a second and so you know you
the<00:01:26.960> other<00:01:27.080> thing<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.410> sometimes<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:27.890> do

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
which is about detail so we pretty much

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.740 
which is about detail so we pretty much
put<00:01:42.320> detail<00:01:42.890> into<00:01:43.250> all<00:01:43.430> our<00:01:43.460> work<00:01:43.820> but<00:01:44.180> just<00:01:44.600> as

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
put detail into all our work but just as

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.440 
put detail into all our work but just as
a<00:01:44.780> kind<00:01:45.080> of<00:01:45.259> ethos<00:01:45.770> in<00:01:45.979> our<00:01:46.100> work<00:01:46.330> because<00:01:47.330> we

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
a kind of ethos in our work because we

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.600 
a kind of ethos in our work because we
always<00:01:47.600> feel<00:01:47.869> that<00:01:47.899> that<00:01:48.229> it's<00:01:48.380> all<00:01:48.530> those<00:01:48.740> the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
always feel that that it's all those the

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.609 
always feel that that it's all those the
collective<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.210> details<00:01:50.630> that<00:01:50.840> then<00:01:50.990> creates

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
collective of details that then creates

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.320 
collective of details that then creates
the<00:01:51.710> bigger<00:01:51.950> picture<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:52.789> creates<00:01:53.119> the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
the bigger picture and and creates the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.020 
the bigger picture and and creates the
the<00:01:53.929> interest<00:01:54.410> and<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.679> story<00:01:54.979> and<00:01:55.280> so

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030
