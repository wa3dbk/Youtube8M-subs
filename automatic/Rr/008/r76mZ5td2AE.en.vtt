00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.039

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:33.390
 for the sauce we need a glass of water in a warm 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:36.390
 not hot warm to dissolve the cup became 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.390
 happened 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:01:16.869
 diluted series spoon / while too 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.869
 a glass 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:29.530
 This is not necessary to put. 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:03:06.769
 battle glass fate score per pound 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:03:06.769
 flour to drink some water 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.700

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.770
 salt water we got but you can 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:26.510
 graze with you still have a glass of yeast 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:32.930
 Now just add my turn 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:39.300
 good dough will be added yeast 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:40.470
 Knead the dough, we got exactly 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.940
 recipe how much water 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.340
 I will point out the dough to lie down 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:52.580
 there is no order of an hour while the dough is with us 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:56.010
 resting we make pizza sauce 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.770
 voices we need tomatoes in our own 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.820
 Juice preferably without peel basil 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.220
 of course alive would be better well, no less 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.760
 we its oils and better of course olive 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.270
 need to 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:15.470
 ordinary sunflower tomatoes we have 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.470
 pizza will probably make three 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.609
 you can certainly use leaks but 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:32.930
 similar to Italian 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.930
 Of course more by the way pizza dough 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.750
 but it is for the calf ordinary flour 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.750
 is added 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.250
 enough oil 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:05.919

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:14.870

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:21.139
 standard test elastic forgot 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.169

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.870

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:52.749
 but the dough is very elastic elastic 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:56.599
 such a pretty pretty consistency 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:59.289
 this sauce will not leak anywhere 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.289
 you don't see 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.980
 mowed 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.670
 our sausage spend 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.670
 not very much 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.800
 our 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.370
 sausage now we take mozzarella cheese but 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.560
 look for pizza principle mozzarella she 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:47.690
 always alone 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:47.690
 one taste by weight 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:56.880

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:31.320
 such beauty 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.320
 problems in the oven 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:44.209
 put the oven on pizza and 180 

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:46.589
 degrees our pizza is ready 

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:50.580

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:52.999
