death and destruction we can't

coming<00:00:56.809> from<00:00:56.930> we<00:00:57.200> just<00:00:57.379> know<00:00:57.559> that<00:00:57.590> they<00:00:57.860> are

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
coming from we just know that they are

coming from we just know that they are
there<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:59.510> question<00:00:59.690> is<00:00:59.870> can<00:01:00.050> we<00:01:00.170> defend

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
there the question is can we defend

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.490 
there the question is can we defend
ourselves<00:01:00.590> against<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.670> next<00:01:01.910> big<00:01:02.120> one

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
ourselves against the next big one

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.550 
ourselves against the next big one
we're<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:04.560> there<00:01:04.770> yet<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.810> think<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:07.380> still

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
we're not there yet I think we still

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.650 
we're not there yet I think we still
have<00:01:07.680> time<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.220> figure<00:01:08.370> this<00:01:08.520> out<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.600> think

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
have time to figure this out but I think

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.180 
have time to figure this out but I think
we<00:01:09.870> have<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> figure<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.440> out<00:01:10.620> it's<00:01:10.830> not<00:01:11.010> for

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
we have to figure this out it's not for

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.600 
we have to figure this out it's not for
the<00:01:11.250> ones<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.640> are<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.940> cause<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
the ones that are going to cause they a

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.370 
the ones that are going to cause they a
bad<00:01:14.610> day<00:01:14.880> we're<00:01:15.390> talking<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.170> that's

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
bad day we're talking for the one that's

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.470 
bad day we're talking for the one that's
gonna<00:01:16.590> cause<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> bad<00:01:17.850> world<00:01:20.120> it's<00:01:21.120> not<00:01:21.450> a

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
gonna cause a bad world it's not a

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.840 
gonna cause a bad world it's not a
question<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.260> if<00:01:22.530> another<00:01:22.890> comet<00:01:23.340> will<00:01:23.520> plunge
