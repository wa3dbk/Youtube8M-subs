I've made if I can find the lead as this
I<00:00:23.289> was<00:00:24.099> using<00:00:24.309> a<00:00:24.460> separate<00:00:24.790> battery<00:00:24.970> just<00:00:25.210> for

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
I was using a separate battery just for

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.580 
I was using a separate battery just for
testing<00:00:25.570> but<00:00:25.750> now<00:00:25.840> I've<00:00:25.930> made<00:00:26.079> up<00:00:26.230> this<00:00:26.380> lead

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
testing but now I've made up this lead

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.569 
testing but now I've made up this lead
here<00:00:26.770> which<00:00:26.950> basically<00:00:27.759> is<00:00:28.210> a<00:00:29.399> balanced<00:00:30.399> lead

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
here which basically is a balanced lead

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.310 
here which basically is a balanced lead
connected<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.119> a<00:00:31.149> J's<00:00:31.390> T<00:00:31.779> because<00:00:32.050> I've<00:00:32.169> put<00:00:32.290> a

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
J steep on the backpack so now I can

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.930 
J steep on the backpack so now I can
plug<00:00:33.969> in<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:35.230> to<00:00:35.590> the<00:00:35.680> J's<00:00:35.920> TV<00:00:36.399> and<00:00:36.640> plug<00:00:36.820> this

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
into the balance lead on the battery

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.470 
into the balance lead on the battery
pack<00:00:38.559> so<00:00:38.710> I'm<00:00:38.860> running<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.610> back<00:00:39.790> deck<00:00:40.000> off

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480

does<00:05:43.940> I<00:05:44.150> had<00:05:44.930> a<00:05:44.960> feeling<00:05:45.260> that<00:05:45.349> the<00:05:45.500> CCD<00:05:45.979> may<00:05:46.099> be

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
does I had a feeling that the CCD may be

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.490 
does I had a feeling that the CCD may be
overheating<00:05:46.669> because<00:05:46.820> it's<00:05:47.289> your<00:05:48.289> on<00:05:48.380> them

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
overheating because it's your on them

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.320 
overheating because it's your on them
not<00:05:48.950> really<00:05:49.160> tolerant<00:05:49.460> of<00:05:49.639> high<00:05:49.760> voltage<00:05:49.910> and

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
not really tolerant of high voltage and

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.700 
not really tolerant of high voltage and
a<00:05:50.479> fully<00:05:50.660> charged<00:05:50.930> like<00:05:51.050> that<00:05:51.200> Packers<00:05:51.500> four

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
a fully charged like that Packers four

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.469 
a fully charged like that Packers four
point<00:05:51.919> six<00:05:52.070> four<00:05:52.700> points<00:05:52.970> twelve<00:05:53.240> point<00:05:53.419> six

point six four points twelve point six

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.230 
point six four points twelve point six
volts<00:05:53.780> sorry<00:05:54.130> but<00:05:55.130> as<00:05:55.310> I<00:05:55.400> say<00:05:55.580> I<00:05:55.610> ran<00:05:56.000> over<00:05:56.060> a

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
volts sorry but as I say I ran over a

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.420 
volts sorry but as I say I ran over a
regulated<00:05:56.720> supply<00:05:56.840> exactly<00:05:57.800> 12<00:05:58.070> volt<00:05:58.280> which

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
regulated supply exactly 12 volt which

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.589 
regulated supply exactly 12 volt which
is<00:05:58.460> what<00:05:58.669> they're<00:05:58.760> supposed<00:05:58.849> to<00:05:59.030> be<00:05:59.090> and<00:05:59.510> it

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
is what they're supposed to be and it

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:01.540 
is what they're supposed to be and it
still<00:05:59.990> did<00:06:00.320> it<00:06:00.349> so<00:06:00.620> I<00:06:00.650> don't<00:06:00.740> know<00:06:00.979> what<00:06:01.280> is

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
still did it so I don't know what is

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.219 
still did it so I don't know what is
going<00:06:01.880> on<00:06:01.970> with<00:06:02.120> it<00:06:02.210> but<00:06:02.389> I<00:06:02.539> mean<00:06:02.840> these<00:06:03.050> are

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
going on with it but I mean these are

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.430 
going on with it but I mean these are
sixteen<00:06:03.800> seventeen<00:06:04.490> dollar<00:06:05.210> cameras<00:06:05.750> just

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
sixteen seventeen dollar cameras just

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.570 
sixteen seventeen dollar cameras just

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.950 
too many more sixteen seventeen dollar
cameras<00:06:10.880> a<00:06:11.000> year<00:06:11.180> you<00:06:11.270> can't<00:06:11.479> expect<00:06:11.720> too<00:06:11.870> much

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
cameras a year you can't expect too much

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.540 
cameras a year you can't expect too much
I'm<00:06:12.380> gonna<00:06:12.470> try<00:06:12.680> as<00:06:12.919> I've<00:06:13.099> got<00:06:13.250> some<00:06:13.370> more

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
I'm gonna try as I've got some more

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.700 
I'm gonna try as I've got some more
expensive<00:06:14.419> but<00:06:14.720> bitter<00:06:15.080> one<00:06:15.470> would<00:06:15.590> hope

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
expensive but bitter one would hope

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.770 
expensive but bitter one would hope
cameras<00:06:16.099> coming<00:06:16.400> some<00:06:16.970> CMOS<00:06:17.300> camera<00:06:17.630> these

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
cameras coming some CMOS camera these

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.570 
cameras coming some CMOS camera these
are<00:06:17.840> CCD<00:06:18.410> got<00:06:18.590> some<00:06:18.710> CMOS<00:06:18.979> cameras<00:06:19.280> coming<00:06:19.430> in

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
are CCD got some CMOS cameras coming in

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.490 
are CCD got some CMOS cameras coming in
some<00:06:19.729> CCDs<00:06:20.210> try<00:06:20.840> them<00:06:20.990> out<00:06:21.080> see<00:06:21.110> which<00:06:21.349> is<00:06:21.470> the

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
some CCDs try them out see which is the

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.719 
some CCDs try them out see which is the
best<00:06:21.770> value<00:06:22.099> because<00:06:22.310> it's<00:06:22.400> no<00:06:22.490> point<00:06:22.610> in

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
best value because it's no point in

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.940 
best value because it's no point in
skimping<00:06:23.180> on<00:06:23.300> a<00:06:23.360> camera<00:06:23.660> because<00:06:24.620> that's<00:06:24.770> the

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
skimping on a camera because that's the

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.560 
skimping on a camera because that's the
bit<00:06:25.130> that<00:06:25.310> is<00:06:25.490> gonna<00:06:25.820> you<00:06:26.180> know<00:06:26.270> one<00:06:26.450> of<00:06:26.479> the

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
bit that is gonna you know one of the

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.150 
bit that is gonna you know one of the
most<00:06:26.660> critical<00:06:27.110> things<00:06:27.650> no<00:06:27.860> good<00:06:27.979> having<00:06:28.130> the

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
most critical things no good having the

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.370 
most critical things no good having the
perfect<00:06:28.370> radio<00:06:28.970> Lincoln<00:06:29.360> fantastic

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
perfect radio Lincoln fantastic

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.570 
perfect radio Lincoln fantastic

just<00:06:31.880> looks<00:06:32.510> like<00:06:32.570> crap<00:06:32.870> so<00:06:33.110> the<00:06:33.860> UK<00:06:34.220> will<00:06:35.210> come

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 
just looks like crap so the UK will come

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:41.200 
just looks like crap so the UK will come
on<00:06:35.900> the<00:06:36.320> FPV<00:06:36.740> epic<00:06:37.219> and<00:06:37.460> if<00:06:37.909> P<00:06:38.120> V<00:06:38.300> made<00:06:38.840> easy
