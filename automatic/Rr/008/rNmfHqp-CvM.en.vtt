process<00:02:50.790> will<00:02:50.970> hardly<00:02:51.299> take<00:02:51.569> two<00:02:51.750> minutes<00:02:51.870> so

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
process will hardly take two minutes so

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:13.360

I<00:02:52.200> will<00:02:52.410> be<00:02:52.560> back<00:02:52.769> once<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.250> done

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.520 

all<00:03:14.370> right<00:03:14.550> so<00:03:14.700> that's<00:03:14.879> done<00:03:15.290> before<00:03:16.290> we<00:03:16.379> could

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
all right so that's done before we could

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.410 
all right so that's done before we could
do<00:03:16.620> anything<00:03:16.650> with<00:03:17.099> root<00:03:17.550> applications<00:03:18.180> you

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
do anything with root applications you

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.270 
do anything with root applications you
will<00:03:18.569> have<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.900> update<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.290> superuser<00:03:19.620> binary

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
will have to update the superuser binary

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.460 
will have to update the superuser binary
it's<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:20.970> fairly<00:03:21.180> simple<00:03:21.420> process<00:03:21.810> just<00:03:22.260> launch

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
it's a fairly simple process just launch

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.410 
it's a fairly simple process just launch
the<00:03:22.650> application<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.519> it'll<00:03:23.879> prompt<00:03:24.390> you

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the application and it'll prompt you

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.930 
the application and it'll prompt you
with<00:03:24.599> the<00:03:24.780> options<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.370> again<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.790> will

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
with the options and again it will

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:43.160 
with the options and again it will
restart<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.739> update<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:29.040> superuser<00:03:29.370> binary

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.680 

so<00:03:44.170> once<00:03:44.379> you<00:03:44.470> boot<00:03:44.709> back<00:03:44.920> you<00:03:45.220> have<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.790> rooted

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
so once you boot back you have a rooted

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.350 
so once you boot back you have a rooted

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
official movie se7en on android kitkat

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.300 
official movie se7en on android kitkat
cool<00:03:49.810> isn't<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.200> let's<00:03:50.830> go<00:03:51.010> ahead<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:51.250> verify

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
cool isn't it let's go ahead and verify

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.970 
cool isn't it let's go ahead and verify
that<00:03:51.550> with<00:03:51.940> battery<00:03:52.390> calibration<00:03:53.080> as<00:03:53.680> you<00:03:53.860> can

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
that with battery calibration as you can

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.890 
that with battery calibration as you can
see<00:03:54.099> I<00:03:54.129> got<00:03:54.519> a<00:03:54.580> prompt<00:03:55.030> for<00:03:55.180> root<00:03:55.390> permissions

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
see I got a prompt for root permissions

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.680 
see I got a prompt for root permissions
so<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.620> verifies<00:03:56.860> root<00:03:57.550> access<00:03:57.819> all<00:03:58.510> right

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
so that verifies root access all right

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.240 
so that verifies root access all right
