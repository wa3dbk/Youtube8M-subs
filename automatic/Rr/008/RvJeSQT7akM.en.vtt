00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.810 
assistant okay great so you need one
coat<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.020> mascara<00:01:37.200> first<00:01:37.740> then<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.460> take<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
coat of mascara first then you take the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.670 
coat of mascara first then you take the
lash<00:01:39.060> extender<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.729> those<00:01:41.729> fibers<00:01:42.470> there<00:01:43.470> we

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
lash extender and those fibers there we

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.230 
lash extender and those fibers there we
go<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.220> these<00:01:44.310> fibers<00:01:44.670> are<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.909> between

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
go and so these fibers are in between

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.569 
go and so these fibers are in between
your<00:01:45.450> natural<00:01:45.810> lashes<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.740> go<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
your natural lashes they go on to the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.480 
your natural lashes they go on to the
national<00:01:47.729> lash<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.780> really<00:01:49.560> adheres<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
national lash it really adheres to the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.870 
national lash it really adheres to the
mascara<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.110> go<00:01:52.350> back<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.880> it's

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
