 the week is so now we're going 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.390
 to pass on case by case we will start 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.129
 with el pocho ezequiel lavezzi who 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.900
 marks a doubled with the holy paris 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.810
 germain face bastia a little disappointed 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.159
 especially for for bedie british and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.120
 wallace my little Marseilles side who 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.799
 speak but I wish he had 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.879
 missing a small bus must face the 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.499
 paris saint germain that would have made the 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.290
 I think of all the fans 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:30.230
 Marseille 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.609
 but it's true that here we are 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.560
 honestly this nor ibrahimovic who 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:38.540
 had two passes end a fair pass 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.569
 enormously small pigeon wing and 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.950
 our not also trust the pole 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.200
 and that's it and it's true we said 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.939
 is really in any case on this match has 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.379
 been really a pure finisher and that makes 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.019
 Here pleasure of death a second 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.030
 form version 87 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.489

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.769
 light drogba are i want to tell you 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.530

 85.2 frachon shower pass are 18 of 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.430
 dribble 52 defense and 88 of the head 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.129
 than to find 1.8 of the head to sow that 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.439
 benteke guys honestly titi drogba 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.189
 which for me one of my goals 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.840
 favorite works 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:18.420
 honestly on a human level 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.069
 on the physical plane on the plane finally 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.080
 honestly he's in the bottom for 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.660
 me it's one of the best anyway 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.099
 it's dirty is for me always in everything 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.290
 case it was for me one of the best 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.830
 in europe with galatasaray it is in 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.000
 surfing and it's true that bello 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.160
 see in karting form it's a pleasure 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.190
 honestly guys and then I like 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.629
 That password 83 84 course 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.730
 general it is always so fun 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.810
 and weird and I love usain bolt good 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.549
 it's really the year 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.950
 one of the favorite goal scorers in any case on 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.110
 these are now we go to the 2nd 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.959
 it felt a tv duality that we are going 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.329
 speak so cool you have it where you had the day 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.620
 who made a very, very good match with 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.590
 schalke 04 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.120
 the dutch of course that is always 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.299
 scorer that's it there is no surprise 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.010
 why he hit 72 of 85 for speed 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.980
 are passing roses are thirteen dribble 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.590
 51 in defense and 83.2 the head guys 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.650
 have definitely its regular version I them 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.569
 at the same time found silence even 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.070
 war time because it's true that 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.320
 sometimes he'll make you fucking 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.510
 match and hearths date nothing to do 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.060
 here he is doing nothing and it's true 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.110
 that this map I test it I'm going 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.720
 maybe give you my opinion on 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.760
 but he just looks really awful 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.520
 anyway those who were there marcelo the 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.800
 mad guy marcelo I'll tell you 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.720
 here is first a good little out 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.480
 percentages rights excuse me 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.370
 boosted by real marcelo here is marcelo 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.050
 it's the one I was waiting for I want them 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.820
 a baby is coming alas I think I'm going 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.740
 a little bit broken piggy bank to 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.170
 anyway the test I have read I the 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.760
 would keep here healthier more if 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.130
 affinities we tell you and it's true that 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.960
 marcelo he at the estac slap anyway 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.380
 four speed kids health oms of 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.780
 hit 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.510
 82 passes 85 dribbles 83 of 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.580
 disenchant 11 of the head so just I 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.590
 think the left defender that more 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.700
 regular in his game stats and I 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.170
 not afraid to say it honestly because 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.820
 that it is true that marcelo I wanted me 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.770
 annoying it's true that I prefer as 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.390
 jordi alba honestly i can not you 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.750
 hide it in the game anyway but 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.880
 marcelo it's still marcelo saraste 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.790
 rest for me it remains for me one 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.550
 of the best left defenders in the world 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.160
 with over there with whom with others with 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.930
 maybe jordi alba the limit and i have 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.240
 I forget one as usual 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.010
 but it's true that still marcelo 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.990
 remains a very very good player 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.950
 now the other two and two 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.530
 others and 2 us 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.090
 I expect I'm lost here they are 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.990
 are there they are there the other two I 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.310
 want to see all the time flat you 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.540
 hear small clicks it's normal 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.730
 huawei 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.470
 yes yes no it's true that I want to 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.880
 say wow because I saw the bus from 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.150
 samoa and it's true he's just 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.640
 outstanding in samoa to wau which allows 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.220
 well what allowed Laayoune to 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.200
 win on the score of 1-0 where I 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.090
 believe by the way yeah that's right he 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.430
 admire imputant fucking pittendrigh goal 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.960
 knocking incoming pole offered the 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.190
 shop i want to tell you asamoah 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.860
 that's passing two teams who ski at 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.870
 84 speed with nineteen strikes 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.220
 I feel that this stat is and has been 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.360
 much increased I do not know why 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.610
 we ask ourselves questions 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.500
 82 passes 80 frames and are as for 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.110
 spending urns 14 of the head one must on 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.729
 to say who's going I think to be well used 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.000
 in the series if berlin goes around the 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:26.380
 world 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.310
 so I leave a little clue here 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.500
 like that because I'm whole 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.930
 now nothing to envy guys would have 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.380
 here I could have put cocker I would have 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.810
 could also put ranocchia there at the limit 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:40.510
 but my little french side 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.830
 melissa dirhams that have to behave malherbe 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.630
 because it's true that I had been 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.669
 surrendered these places I have not been 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.400
 I was not in any case I was not 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:50.740
 fallen and wash the front in middle right 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.810
 maybe to put him in wager that 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.550
 is fun in clothes here at 80 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.370
 small hurdles 52 sentences are sweet of 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.930
 pascal 79-82 defense have eighteen of the 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.030
 head it's true I could have also 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.790
 quote conquer that's because cuca 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.590
 cocker I think he spends a year ago 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.000
 a second a form this week
