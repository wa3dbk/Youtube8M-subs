00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.969
 one of the doubts that most arises 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.980
 at the time of selecting the makeup 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.410
 What better goes to our face is 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.320
 precisely the choice of color 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.560
 then to know exactly where 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.210
 we have to measure this coloration where 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.220
 we have to measure the tonality of the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.470
 Makeup is always in those areas 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.050
 where you have to go makeup that is 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.419
 in the face this we verify it of the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.279
 Next we apply a little touch 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.470
 in this case diminished we could 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.899
 do exactly the same with the 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.780
 compact makeup we apply it in the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.860
 hand and we check in an area of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.940
 face 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:49.480
 with a droplet and we extend it we see that 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.690
 perfectly matches the tone of your 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.820
 skin is very important to know that the tone 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.610
 of makeup has to be exactly 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.160
 just as the skin tone is going to be 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.110
 possible the closest thing I'll 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.940
 explain now a little trick to the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.740
 time to select more accurately 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.479
 the makeup tone that we're going to 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.830
 use in the case of the proposal 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:17.259
 What makes brand is the use always 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.229
 of two two-tone products 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.180
 makeup before the doubt we select the 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.850
 lighter and the darker line 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.360
 cover for your formulation your 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.770
 pigmentation allows us a mixture 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.050
 perfect of the two products with what 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.090
 what to manufacture and we are our 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.540
 own makeup this we do from the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.000
 Next we apply a droplet of 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.720
 makeup 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.720
 Clear 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.420
 and we apply 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.110
 makeup 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.110
 Dark 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.630
 due to its formulation allows us a 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:01.340
 perfect blend of the hue that 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.340
 we wish for every moment 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.069
 here I would have a makeup tone 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.700
 intermediate, it is clear to us then that 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.640
 of the 525 tonalities that have cover 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.880
 if I have the number one and the number 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.480
 five I will have all the intermediates of 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.550
 this form may vary more to the taste 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.410
 tonality of my makeup depending 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.410
 of the moment you use in here
