 the decor of this, he is easily removed further 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.120
 to take off the fan 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.680

 fan turns away to shoot 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.570
 completely hard because there 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.300
 will have to connect the wiring also to 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.850

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.070

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.630
 glove box clean the bottom shelf which
