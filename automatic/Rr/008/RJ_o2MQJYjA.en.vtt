00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.240
 no matter how 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.810
 photo paper was of high quality 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.770
 it was printed photo with 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.320
 tsvetana time is not getting more than 3 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.359
 years of colony 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.849
 pictures tarnish with her missing details 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.229
 using the tool lilz in many 

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:19.609
 cases can be corrected 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.609
 svetlana old photos 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.650
 most old photos are black 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.300
 white color collection comes down to customization 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.010
 image brightness and contrast 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.620
 our photos are displayed in mode 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.980
 korean street 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.160

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.790
 warehouse waltz 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.030
 in this window you can see that drama 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.510
 sliders with which is determined 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.230
 darkest lightest dots and floors 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.140
 then she 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.920
 for the image to be 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.450
 correct sliders are the brightest and most 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.470
 the dark dots should be located on 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.430
 edges of the program you can move them 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.760
 on the eye after which the image will become 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.610
 more contrast 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.600
 however, this method does not provide accurate 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.580
 results because of the form 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.910
 histograms can not always be understood in what 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.910
 the place should be sliders 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.010
 so moving the slider hold 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.570
 pressed alto key until 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.570
 the first dots will not appear on the screen 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.910
 their appearance will mean that the slider 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.910
 need to install in this place 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.860
 in the level setting window you can 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.860
 see a few five-year plans 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.100
 they can be fine tuned 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.580
 color rendition of the image 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.280
 these pipettes match 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.760
 300 grams slider 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.600
 with a single pipette you indicate 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.410
 the brightest point in the image using 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.139
 other darkest 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.169
 another pipette is designed for 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:17.679
 indication of medium shades 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.469
 we can assume that on this 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.289
 photos of the darkest point 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:23.549
 is in the folds of the curtains in the back 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.319
 plan 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.829
 the brightest point of the image on the scaffold 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:29.939
 ladies 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.229
 photo has become clearer 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:34.839
 sometimes in order to unmistakably 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:37.309
 identify the brightest and the darkest 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.639
 one point is enough 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.979
 look at her 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:43.579
 for example, if a shot hit a dark frame 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.689
 the corridor is most likely the dark point 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.349
 will be exactly in this part of the image 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.349
 but identify the darkest and most 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.009
 light dots can not always 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.319
 in this photo is the brightest point 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.479
 probably on the tablecloth but where 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.299
 it is difficult to understand where is the dark 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.349
 the point is also unclear 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.349
 can try to detect these points 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.749
 holding the valker keys moving 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:08.650
 slider but just remember them 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.279
 position is unlikely to succeed 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.369
 in such cases, you can resort to 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:15.529
 the next trick 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.359
 create adjustment layer 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.709
 passed there from the picture disappear halftones and 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.709
 she will become strictly black and white 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:31.999
 move the slider to the left then 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:33.659
 positions where they start to appear 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.329
 first black dots 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.819
 apparently they are the darkest 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.999
 dots image 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.319
 choose a tool and this is first and foremost 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.059
 holding shift will click on one of 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.339
 black dots 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:51.159
 but the image will be set to mark 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.259
 can also be used 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.489
 cadet tool 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.999
 move the slider to the right and in the same way 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:00.320
 define the brightest point 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.320
 set a mark 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.139
 disabled display 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.829
 adjustment layer and open the window 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.319
 level settings now we do not need 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.069
 guess where the brightest and the most 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.309
 bright dots 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:19.879
 choose petrescu defining black 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.879
 the point is also in the middle of the first mark 

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:26.199
 now choose the pipette defining 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.799
 matter point and click the middle of the second 

00:04:28.799 --> 00:04:30.580
 marks 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.270
 the colors in the image will noticeably improve
