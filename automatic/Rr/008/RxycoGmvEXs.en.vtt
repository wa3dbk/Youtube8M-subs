00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.830
 fever is one of the problems of 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.070
 health that most worries during the 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.779
 childhood pediatric consultations 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.550
 they answer every day doubts that they have to 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.100
 see with fever especially the 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.650
 first years of life the fever in a 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.530
 elevation in the temperature in the body 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.980
 human 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.170
 starting 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.329
 of a few ranges above a range 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.210
 that are considered or have been considered 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.379
 as normal 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.000
 body temperature its measure in the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.710
 that we would be interested in would be the temperature 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.790
 inside the body the temperature 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.490
 Exterior 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.710
 fever is a defense mechanism of the 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.630
 organism not only warns that something is going 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.700
 wrong but it activates the system 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.880
 immune to fight against the 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.800
 infection that has caused the fever 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.720
 during childhood in most of 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.970
 the cases the cause of fever is 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.010
 precisely an infection although 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.380
 It can also cause fever one 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.140
 strong emotion a room temperature 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.560
 high and humidity an excessive clothing 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.200
 heat stroke or poisoning 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.079
 good if not external that can call us 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.810
 the attention as it may be for blush in 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.689
 the cheeks to touch him kiss him 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.090
 we have to be hot we can 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.549
 as well 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.740
 notice that your activity has changed its 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.259
 attitude has changed to be more 2000 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.929
 a 2 can be more crybaby but 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.119
 fundamentally the fear that is going to 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.280
 mark the temperature is a few signs that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.049
 the alarm goes off but 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.700
 thermometer essentially not 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.460
 will mark the temperature 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.799
 to take the temperature is possible 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.570
 do it in the rectum and in the armpit and you should 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.700
 keep in mind that the temperature 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.399
 body is superior if taken in the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.119
 straight this is the most reliable site about 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.490
 all children under 2 years the rest has 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.880
 to be in two minutes in this way the 4 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.950
 minutes anyway the thermometers 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.540
 digitals that are what we are 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.040
 are using now because that 's 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.959
 you of the minutes I'm talking to you 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.640
 from mercury because the digital ones that 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:23.860
 are the ones that really are due 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.530
 use drugs if the temperature is not 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.690
 very high and the boy or girl is not very 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.569
 uncomfortable can apply certain 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.190
 measures to refresh it, it should be 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.980
 to start by stripping a bit of 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.540
 excess of clothes you have and take away the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.130
 clothes and leave a little light no 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.530
 leave it in Juarez and llos because neither 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.620
 a very abrupt thing should not be 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.290
 bathing is warm tepid with the code 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.630
 warm because the cold water could be removed 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.860
 and counterproductive then something that is 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.109
 always lower than the temperature 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.109
 body and cook about 10 minutes 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.569
 you never have to use cold water because 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.000
 it could worsen their status the Greek ones of 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.400
 alcohol or cologne should not be used 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.380
 because they produce a rapid decline in 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.810
 temperature but only on the skin 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.360
 immediately fever rises again and 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.280
 drug increases discomfort 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.670
 that are usually taken to lower the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.170
 fever are called antipyretic and are 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.540
 drugs that are symptomatic ie 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.160
 that help us to treat the cause of 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.830
 fever for example if we 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.080
 we have a boy or a girl who has a 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.370
 urine infection or a viral picture by 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.650
 a flu or a throat infection 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.269
 for giving antipyretics we are not going to 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.060
 cure that disease what are we going to 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.190
 do is lower the fever and relieve or 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.140
 improve the possible consequences that 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.220
 this could have on the child the 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.440
 principal before terms that 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.989
 used are paracetamol paracetamol 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.950
 it is a very safe drug the one of choice 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.630
 which we say that the 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.519
 choice is to say the one that should first 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.320
 use a dad or a mom to try 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.140
 fever in your child and you can use 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.150
 every four and six or six hours and a few 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.650
 five times maximum per day 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.420
 the dose depends on the weight and the 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.550
 child and our pediatrician should not tell 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.830
 our doctor 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.480
 then this addition is ibuprofen 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.670
 drug should not be used in children 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.320
 of 6 months and can be used every 68 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.600
 hours is to say at most 4 times 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.160
 day and it is important to remember that no 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.020
 we must alternate antipyretics of 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
 routinely or systematically 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.799
 in children say give paracetamol 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.810
 ibuprofen paracetamol ibuprofen only 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.400
 it must be done in very few cases and 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.410
 always under the prescription of our 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.410
 Family doctor or our pediatrician 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.330
 In addition, you should not use antipyretics if 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.880
 suspect a heat fever either by 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.130
 sunstroke or heat stroke in these 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.470
 cases should keep the child away from the 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.750
 heat source give you plenty of liquid 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.529
 take off his clothes and go to the center 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.019
 nearest toilet 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:49.599
 normally after the administration of 

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:52.089
 medicines lower the temperature that 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:54.129
 descent is from medium to a degree do not wait 

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:56.469
 that the fever goes down so much that 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.719
 normalize your body temperature and 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:00.789
 that the body tries to keep elevated 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:03.039
 the temperature as fight against 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.259
 disease the antibiotics are not 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.419
 medicines to lower fever the 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:10.149
 fever in addition most of the time 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.209
 is caused by viral infections and 

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:16.830
 those for viral infections are not 

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:20.259
 Antibiotics do not work 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.629
 in babies prolonged fever can 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.979
 cause dehydration that's why you should 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.349
 give him to drink to avoid 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.779
 complications something that worries a lot to 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:31.120
 the parents are febrile convulsions 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:33.879
 although they occur very rarely are 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.520
 seizures that appear associated 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.349
 to a feverish process 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.819
 in a boy in a girl and what 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.319
 important is to emphasize that it does not 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.520
 no type of sequel is to say the child 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.470
 after the seizure recovers 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.509
 totally and there is no any left 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.960
 injury appear infrequently 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:50.400
 about 45 percent of children 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.870
 if it's worth noting that if a child or 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.849
 a girl has a fever and presents a 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.020
 compulsive episode because they must go 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.300
 to a health center so that 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.370
 values ​​your primary care physician or your 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.659
 pediatrician to discard that I can 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.659
 have a major infection 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.370
 In case of fever you should go to your 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.550
 health centers 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.910
 spots appear on the skin if the baby 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.570
 is less than 3 months 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:20.870
 If you have fever more than 24 48 hours in 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:24.830
 Children under 2 years of age if they have a fever 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.409
 more than 48 72 hours in children over 2 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.869
 years 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:30.190
 If you have an intense and difficult cry 

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:32.560
 to calm 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.569
 if you totally reject the taking of 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.759
 food and liquids 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:38.320
 If you stop urinating or urine is very 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:41.110
 limited 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.380
 if it shows decay despite lowering 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.380
 fever 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.220
 You must also go to the emergency room if the 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:53.760
 boy and girl has a temperature of 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.380
 more than 40 degrees if you have a high fever and 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.510
 some serious chronic illness 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.889
 if you 're not getting in the neck or 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:03.550
 difficulty moving the neck 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:05.800
 If you have seizures 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.560
 if it has spots of recent appearance 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.420
 dark red or purple that does not 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.430
 disappear when stretching the skin of 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.800
 around 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.220
 if you have difficulty keeping it 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.230
 awake 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.230
 if you have trouble breathing 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.770
 Fever itself is not a sign of 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.720
 gravity there are diseases with evolution 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.390
 benign who may have a fever 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.850
 High fever usually lasts between three 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.160
 days and a week and it's very important 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.050
 drink plenty of liquid because with the 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.410
 fever there are usually water losses by 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.410
 the skin
