other side this I mean has like a really

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.560 
other side this I mean has like a really
angry<00:01:56.100> face<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.670> one<00:01:56.850> she<00:01:56.939> said<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.540> a

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
filling in the excess it obviously this

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.830 
filling in the excess it obviously this
is<00:04:20.370> supposed<00:04:20.639> to<00:04:20.700> be<00:04:20.760> meant<00:04:21.120> like<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.299> water

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.029 
and on the inside not really sure what
that's<00:05:01.479> what<00:05:01.659> I<00:05:01.750> mean<00:05:01.930> no<00:05:02.169> of<00:05:02.349> course<00:05:02.650> I<00:05:02.770> know

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.890 
that's what I mean no of course I know
what<00:05:03.219> it's<00:05:03.370> for<00:05:03.520> but<00:05:03.580> not<00:05:04.419> really<00:05:04.539> sure<00:05:04.750> why

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
what it's for but not really sure why

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.930 
what it's for but not really sure why
they<00:05:04.930> did<00:05:05.199> it<00:05:05.530> I<00:05:05.680> mean<00:05:05.860> I<00:05:06.069> don't<00:05:06.340> believe<00:05:06.789> they

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
they did it I mean I don't believe they

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.730 
they did it I mean I don't believe they
would<00:05:07.060> do<00:05:07.180> this<00:05:07.270> in<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.479> movie<00:05:07.719> but<00:05:07.870> hidden

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
would do this in the movie but hidden

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.089 
would do this in the movie but hidden
inside<00:05:08.919> the<00:05:09.219> boat<00:05:09.400> there<00:05:10.240> is<00:05:10.539> a<00:05:10.990> little<00:05:11.500> stick

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
inside the boat there is a little stick

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.330 
inside the boat there is a little stick
of<00:05:12.159> dynamite<00:05:13.289> so<00:05:14.289> I<00:05:14.349> mean<00:05:14.530> I<00:05:14.560> guess<00:05:14.830> that's<00:05:15.069> a

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
of dynamite so I mean I guess that's a

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.760 
of dynamite so I mean I guess that's a
nice<00:05:15.699> little<00:05:16.120> audition<00:05:16.870> but<00:05:17.289> you<00:05:17.650> know

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
nice little audition but you know

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.420 
nice little audition but you know
nothing<00:05:17.949> too<00:05:18.219> exciting<00:05:19.289> the<00:05:20.289> boat<00:05:20.500> hold<00:05:20.860> on

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
nothing too exciting the boat hold on

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.249 
nothing too exciting the boat hold on
