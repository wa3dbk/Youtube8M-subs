00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.869 
too strong otherwise we have to fully
get<00:00:58.850> power<00:00:59.440> but<00:01:00.440> I'm<00:01:00.829> totally<00:01:01.129> excited<00:01:01.339> the

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
get power but I'm totally excited the

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.369 
get power but I'm totally excited the
only<00:01:02.089> thing<00:01:02.210> is<00:01:02.300> we<00:01:02.420> need<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:02.719> rush<00:01:03.109> because

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
only thing is we need to rush because

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.950 
only thing is we need to rush because
the<00:01:03.979> weather<00:01:04.129> can<00:01:04.339> change<00:01:04.509> like<00:01:05.509> this<00:01:05.659> within

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
the weather can change like this within

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.990 
the weather can change like this within
a<00:01:06.140> second<00:01:06.500> they<00:01:07.159> say<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.520> weather<00:01:07.700> here<00:01:07.909> is

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
a second they say the weather here is

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.539 
a second they say the weather here is
like<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.270> binary<00:01:08.659> system<00:01:09.080> you<00:01:09.140> see<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.380> 01<00:01:10.100> so

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
like the binary system you see the 01 so

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:26.220 
like the binary system you see the 01 so
it's<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:10.850> a<00:01:10.880> sunshine<00:01:11.450> or<00:01:11.690> really<00:01:12.020> dirty

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.550 

we<00:01:26.830> were<00:01:27.130> so<00:01:27.370> excited<00:01:27.490> just<00:01:27.940> to<00:01:28.030> get<00:01:28.240> going<00:01:28.630> we

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
we were so excited just to get going we

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.450 
we were so excited just to get going we
started<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:32.380> immediately<00:01:32.620> got<00:01:32.980> into<00:01:33.370> the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
started and we immediately got into the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.870 
started and we immediately got into the
flow<00:01:33.730> we<00:01:34.000> had<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.180> perfect<00:01:35.130> winter<00:01:36.130> action<00:01:36.640> and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
we did almost 20 knots which is almost

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.830 
we did almost 20 knots which is almost
40<00:01:40.570> km/h<00:01:41.020> which<00:01:41.590> is<00:01:41.740> amazingly<00:01:42.670> fast<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
40 km/h which is amazingly fast the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.620 
40 km/h which is amazingly fast the
first<00:01:47.410> half<00:01:47.680> was<00:01:47.710> actually<00:01:48.280> excellent<00:01:48.640> we

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
moved around 30 to 40 kilometers an hour

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.180 
moved around 30 to 40 kilometers an hour
and<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:55.360> wind<00:01:55.570> was<00:01:55.750> perfect<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.770> ocean<00:01:57.070> was

perfect and everything seemed to work
out<00:01:59.770> really<00:02:00.130> well<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.670> at<00:02:00.940> that<00:02:01.090> moment

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
out really well and at that moment

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.480 
out really well and at that moment
actually<00:02:01.770> thinking<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.800> we're<00:02:03.100> gonna<00:02:03.220> make

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
actually thinking that we're gonna make
