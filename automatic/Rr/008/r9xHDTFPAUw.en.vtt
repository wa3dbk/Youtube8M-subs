00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.020 
ever wear blush so the next time i buy
bronzer<00:00:55.350> I'm<00:00:56.010> probably<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.399> by<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> elf

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
bronzer I'm probably just by the elf

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.639 
bronzer I'm probably just by the elf
bronzer<00:00:57.480> because<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> lot<00:00:58.109> cheaper<00:00:58.140> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
bronzer because it's a lot cheaper and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.080 
bronzer because it's a lot cheaper and
it<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.100> has<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.340> same<00:00:59.579> color<00:00:59.820> payoff

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
it really has the same color payoff

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.880 
it really has the same color payoff
actually<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.170> elf<00:01:01.320> bronzer<00:01:01.710> has<00:01:01.859> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
actually I think the elf bronzer has a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.319 
actually I think the elf bronzer has a
little<00:01:02.039> bit<00:01:02.190> better<00:01:02.280> color<00:01:02.579> playoff<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.210> like

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
little bit better color playoff but like

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.280 
little bit better color playoff but like
yeah<00:01:03.449> I'll<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:03.629> into<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.870> when<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
yeah I'll get into that when I do the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.899 
yeah I'll get into that when I do the
whole<00:01:04.409> review<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.250> right<00:01:05.430> now<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.880> just

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.530 
if I find it I'll put a little clip of
it<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.450> here<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.560> full-size

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
it in here but I have like the full-size

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
it in here but I have like the full-size
deepthroat<00:01:54.540> blush<00:01:54.750> because<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.290> used<00:01:55.470> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
deepthroat blush because like I used to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.649 
deepthroat blush because like I used to
basically<00:01:55.920> collect<00:01:56.579> brush<00:01:56.790> blushes<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.509> like

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
basically collect brush blushes but like

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.090 
basically collect brush blushes but like
I<00:01:57.750> said<00:01:57.810> they're<00:01:58.049> useless<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.560> me<00:01:58.649> because<00:01:58.799> my

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
I said they're useless on me because my

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.969 
I said they're useless on me because my
skin<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.549> red<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> cheeks<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.680> I

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
skin is so red in the cheeks like I

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.889 
skin is so red in the cheeks like I
don't<00:02:02.640> even<00:02:02.850> know<00:02:03.090> what's<00:02:03.450> wrong<00:02:03.570> with<00:02:03.630> me<00:02:03.869> but

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
don't even know what's wrong with me but

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.530 
don't even know what's wrong with me but
I've<00:02:04.140> had<00:02:04.439> I'm<00:02:04.619> naturally<00:02:04.860> blushed<00:02:05.540> basically

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
I've had I'm naturally blushed basically

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.719 
I've had I'm naturally blushed basically
which<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.409> guess<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.950> good<00:02:08.190> thing<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.580> also

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
which is I guess a good thing but also

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.130 
which is I guess a good thing but also
bad<00:02:09.000> things<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.360> can't<00:02:09.539> try<00:02:09.660> out<00:02:09.750> new<00:02:09.780> colors

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
bad things I can't try out new colors

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.199 
bad things I can't try out new colors
because<00:02:10.410> my<00:02:10.560> face<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:10.739> looks<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.099> read<00:02:11.280> so

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
because my face just looks to read so

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.790 
because my face just looks to read so
I'm<00:02:12.660> going<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.840> try<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.050> put<00:02:13.230> these<00:02:13.349> up

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.010 
I'm going to try to put these up
right<00:02:13.980> against<00:02:14.310> each<00:02:14.400> other<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:15.900> see

color<00:03:01.860> in<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.160> pan<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.850> NARS<00:03:03.090> one<00:03:03.330> goes

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
color in the pan but the NARS one goes

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.460 
color in the pan but the NARS one goes
on<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.750> bit<00:03:03.990> shearer<00:03:04.440> um<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:06.390> elf<00:03:06.570> one<00:03:06.870> tends<00:03:07.260> to

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
on a bit shearer um the elf one tends to

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.290 
on a bit shearer um the elf one tends to
go<00:03:07.590> on<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:07.770> little<00:03:08.040> bit<00:03:08.160> heavier<00:03:08.490> so<00:03:08.880> like<00:03:09.180> I

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
go on a little bit heavier so like I

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.850 
go on a little bit heavier so like I
said<00:03:09.360> if<00:03:09.660> you're<00:03:09.750> fair-skinned<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.560> would<00:03:10.710> lean

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
said if you're fair-skinned I would lean

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.530 
said if you're fair-skinned I would lean
more<00:03:11.040> towards<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.430> NARS<00:03:11.610> one<00:03:11.880> whereas<00:03:12.480> if

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
more towards the NARS one whereas if

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.390 
more towards the NARS one whereas if
your<00:03:12.720> olive<00:03:13.080> medium<00:03:13.530> or<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.010> little<00:03:14.220> bit<00:03:14.310> even

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
your olive medium or a little bit even

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.100 
your olive medium or a little bit even
deeper<00:03:14.760> skinned<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.270> would<00:03:15.540> go<00:03:15.660> for<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.960> elf

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
deeper skinned I would go for the elf

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.750 
deeper skinned I would go for the elf
one<00:03:16.350> don't<00:03:16.860> get<00:03:17.040> me<00:03:17.130> wrong<00:03:17.160> though<00:03:17.490> with<00:03:17.640> your

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
one don't get me wrong though with your

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.250 
one don't get me wrong though with your
fair<00:03:18.060> or<00:03:18.209> light<00:03:18.360> skin<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.720> can<00:03:18.810> totally<00:03:19.170> get

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
fair or light skin you can totally get

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.949 
fair or light skin you can totally get
away<00:03:19.440> with<00:03:19.590> using<00:03:19.680> elf<00:03:20.010> bronzer<00:03:20.430> just<00:03:21.060> use<00:03:21.510> a

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
away with using elf bronzer just use a

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.229 
away with using elf bronzer just use a
fluffier<00:03:22.860> brush<00:03:22.980> as<00:03:23.370> whereas<00:03:23.610> I<00:03:23.640> use<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> really

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
fluffier brush as whereas I use a really

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.580 
fluffier brush as whereas I use a really
dense<00:03:24.420> bronzer<00:03:24.870> brush<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.200> that's<00:03:25.350> probably

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
dense bronzer brush so that's probably

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.670 
dense bronzer brush so that's probably
why<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:25.860> goes<00:03:26.040> on<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.400> thick<00:03:26.640> um<00:03:27.590> going<00:03:28.590> a

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
why it goes on so thick um going a

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.500 
why it goes on so thick um going a
little<00:03:28.800> bit<00:03:28.920> more<00:03:29.100> in<00:03:29.160> depth<00:03:29.370> with<00:03:29.610> the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
little bit more in depth with the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.660 
little bit more in depth with the
consistency<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.709> NARS<00:03:31.950> one<00:03:32.190> obviously

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
consistency of it the NARS one obviously

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.850 
consistency of it the NARS one obviously
is<00:03:32.790> higher<00:03:33.150> quality<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.080> it<00:03:34.200> has<00:03:34.410> more<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.800> a

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
is higher quality so it has more of a

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.620 
is higher quality so it has more of a
smoother<00:03:35.130> consistency<00:03:35.300> whereas<00:03:36.300> as<00:03:36.510> you

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
smoother consistency whereas as you

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.030 
smoother consistency whereas as you
start<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.930> use<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.200> elf<00:03:37.350> bronzer<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.770> starts

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
start to use the elf bronzer it starts

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.370 
start to use the elf bronzer it starts
to<00:03:38.130> get<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.250> little<00:03:38.310> bit<00:03:38.520> chunky<00:03:39.090> can<00:03:40.080> you<00:03:40.170> see

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
to get a little bit chunky can you see

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.600 
to get a little bit chunky can you see
that<00:03:40.530> how<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:40.860> can<00:03:41.040> see<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.250> like<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.370> little

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
that how you can see the like a little

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.550 
that how you can see the like a little
chunk<00:03:41.850> starting<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.180> form<00:03:42.390> in<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.570> whereas<00:03:43.230> in

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
chunk starting to form in it whereas in

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.100 
chunk starting to form in it whereas in
the<00:03:43.739> NARS<00:03:43.950> one<00:03:44.450> there<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.630> none<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.989> be<00:03:46.050> found

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
the NARS one there is none to be found

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.380 
the NARS one there is none to be found
it's<00:03:46.470> all<00:03:46.620> smooth<00:03:46.920> surface<00:03:48.050> um<00:03:49.100> in<00:03:50.100> terms<00:03:51.000> of

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
it's all smooth surface um in terms of

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.990 
it's all smooth surface um in terms of
size<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:52.170> both<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.320> these<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.860> eof<00:03:53.370> bronzer<00:03:53.850> is

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
size of both of these the eof bronzer is

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.360 
size of both of these the eof bronzer is
actually<00:03:54.510> slightly<00:03:55.110> bigger<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:56.250> get

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
actually slightly bigger you get

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.270 
actually slightly bigger you get
slightly<00:03:56.670> more<00:03:56.970> product<00:03:57.450> with<00:03:57.630> it<00:03:58.250> can<00:03:59.250> you

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
you can't really see that um try to put

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.310 
you can't really see that um try to put
them<00:04:01.680> side<00:04:01.860> by<00:04:01.890> side<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.840> just<00:04:03.989> share<00:04:04.170> the

if you can really see which I know that
this<00:04:10.050> is<00:04:10.110> really<00:04:10.380> awkward<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.920> way<00:04:10.950> I'm

this is really awkward the way I'm
holding<00:04:11.430> them<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:12.120> NARS<00:04:12.390> bronzer<00:04:12.750> is

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
holding them the NARS bronzer is

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.990 
holding them the NARS bronzer is
slightly<00:04:13.170> thinner<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:14.519> packaging<00:04:14.880> looks

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
slightly thinner the packaging looks

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.400 
slightly thinner the packaging looks
almost<00:04:15.209> exactly<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.690> same<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:16.080> I<00:04:16.169> talked

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
almost exactly the same like I talked

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.610 
almost exactly the same like I talked
about<00:04:16.680> but<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.880> actual<00:04:18.269> square<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.320> it's<00:04:19.470> in

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
about but the actual square that it's in

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.840 
about but the actual square that it's in
a<00:04:19.650> slightly<00:04:19.980> thinner<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:20.459> you<00:04:20.519> do<00:04:20.700> get

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
a slightly thinner so you do get

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.610 
a slightly thinner so you do get
slightly<00:04:21.209> more<00:04:21.480> product<00:04:21.780> with<00:04:21.870> e.l.f<00:04:22.229> bronzer

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
slightly more product with e.l.f bronzer

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.960 
slightly more product with e.l.f bronzer
um<00:04:24.500> looking<00:04:25.500> at<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.710> packaging<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.580> mean

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
you it's very obvious that LF was

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.320 
you it's very obvious that LF was
copying<00:04:31.440> this<00:04:31.590> bronzer<00:04:32.040> as<00:04:32.310> best<00:04:32.700> they<00:04:32.970> could

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
copying this bronzer as best they could

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.160 
copying this bronzer as best they could
um<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:34.620> packaging<00:04:35.190> looks<00:04:35.930> almost<00:04:36.930> exactly

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
also um it's higher at higher end
