00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 speak personal but a good tone in the kitchen 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.730
 starting here is the louis and the chill already 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.580
 It's coming, so we decided to 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.830
 to make a creamy polenta with 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.870
 Gorgonzola is very tasty and it is 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.549
 It's very easy to do and it 's 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.680
 teach you the secrets for your 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.260
 Polenta does not bulk up 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.150
 then there watches a medium saucepan to 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.609
 People are going to start by putting a little bit 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.310
 of water and in this water we will put 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.920
 a few tablespoons of olive oil 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.869
 give a special flavor to your plant 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.020
 Now while it 's just water, it's heating up. 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.329
 another bowl we'll put 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.460
 a little more water and the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.170
 the proportions we are leaving in our 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.260
 ingredients that are in the description of the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.090
 video and we will dissolve our 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.309
 football is how we're going to do it 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.520
 for our policy not to embarrass 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.469
 then a bowl of ice cream before is only 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.110
 and stir with a spoon to 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.120
 absorb all this water after you 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.670
 mix your water well in the pan 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.800
 It must already be boiling so it's just 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.930
 add this mixture in the pan 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.549
 have people who have other techniques to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.020
 the plant does not grow 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.299
 this here was the way that people 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.760
 discovered to make your 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.880
 plant not a plot so it really is 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.700
 It is important for you to dissolve the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.740
 bowl just before putting it on 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.610
 In your pot here, you gave it right to 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.350
 people 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.259
 now just temper with a little bit of 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.470
 salt and here you will start to boil 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.869
 this plant you will lower that fire and 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.590
 this panela will stay there for more or 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.900
 less about 30 minutes every five or ten 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.820
 minutes you can open the cover and 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.520
 stirring from time to time for you to have 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.159
 sure it's just polenta to cooking 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.829
 same as you're not burning the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.630
 background of it here then after d 30 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.240
 minutes and that's the point that people 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.939
 arrived at this pulenta she got this 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.579
 consistency that looks very beautiful then 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.310
 we'll finish by tempering with 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.290
 Parmesan grated like I always say here 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.850
 It's always nice to use the parmesan 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.070
 grated at the time you are going to make a 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.329
 very large difference in its revenue and 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.099
 at this stage here we will go 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.910
 try a little bit to fix 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.770
 the targets then here the people 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.420
 put a little salt and always 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.790
 taking care that in the end we will go 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.400
 cover with gorgonzola cheese and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.830
 salty gorgonzola so be careful 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.540
 here to not too much salt to your plan 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.970
 now just put your plant in a 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.430
 refractory that can then be 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.160
 You'll put your gorgonzola through 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.440
 and distribute everything very well and for 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.990
 You're going to take this gorgonzola to 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.500
 It 's just to bake the oven to 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.970
 brio for about 15 minutes 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.850
 Insurance looks at us already. 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.710
 gratin so juicy're already ready 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.470
 This cheese here is very 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.750
 Polenta is worth inventing and goes a lot 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.610
 well this winter I hope you 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.640
 I enjoyed the recipe today if you 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.120
