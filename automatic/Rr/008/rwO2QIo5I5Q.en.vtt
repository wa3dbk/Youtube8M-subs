activity our goal is to learn how you
think<00:00:11.070> about<00:00:11.309> information<00:00:11.570> so<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.599> we<00:00:12.900> can

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
think about information so that we can

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.440 
think about information so that we can
organize<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.860> website<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.790> way<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.179> makes

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
organize the website in a way that makes

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.810 
organize the website in a way that makes
it<00:00:15.660> easiest<00:00:16.199> for<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.220> find<00:00:17.460> what<00:00:17.670> you're

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
it easiest for you to find what you're

it easiest for you to find what you're
looking<00:00:18.090> for<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:19.260> tool<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.710> you'll<00:00:19.890> be

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
looking for the tool that you'll be

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.929 
looking for the tool that you'll be
using<00:00:20.430> today<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.570> pretty<00:00:22.560> simple<00:00:22.859> but<00:00:23.400> it'll

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
using today is pretty simple but it'll

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.519 
using today is pretty simple but it'll
be<00:00:24.029> even<00:00:24.300> easier<00:00:24.449> after<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.230> brief

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
be even easier after this brief

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.800 
be even easier after this brief
demonstration<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.670> course<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.449> won't<00:00:27.599> be

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
demonstration of course we won't be

demonstration of course we won't be
looking<00:00:27.990> at<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> same<00:00:28.590> list<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.010> items<00:00:29.369> that

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
looking at the same list of items that

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.429 
looking at the same list of items that
you'll<00:00:29.789> be<00:00:29.910> using<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.300> your<00:00:30.449> activity<00:00:30.929> but

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
you'll be using in your activity but

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.930 
you'll be using in your activity but
this<00:00:31.619> will<00:00:31.800> serve<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.160> purposes<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:32.640> our

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.389 
want to split that into two separate
groups<00:02:00.020> for<00:02:01.020> example<00:02:01.500> I'll<00:02:01.710> split<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.219> out

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
groups for example I'll split this out

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.289 
groups for example I'll split this out
right<00:02:02.759> now<00:02:04.070> all<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.310> have<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.520> do<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.880> drag<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
right now all you have to do is drag the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.440 
right now all you have to do is drag the
item<00:02:06.840> from<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.259> group<00:02:07.439> it's<00:02:07.649> currently<00:02:08.039> in

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
item from the group it's currently in

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.960 
item from the group it's currently in
into<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.929> new<00:02:10.470> category<00:02:10.860> or<00:02:11.250> into<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> category

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
into a new category or into the category

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.970 
into a new category or into the category
that<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.239> want<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.540> put<00:02:12.690> it

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
that you want to put it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.160 
that you want to put it
when<00:02:14.550> you're<00:02:14.700> ready<00:02:14.910> don't<00:02:15.390> forget<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.900> each

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
when you're ready don't forget that each

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:25.610 
when you're ready don't forget that each
category<00:02:16.830> does<00:02:17.160> need<00:02:17.550> its<00:02:17.849> own<00:02:18.030> name<00:02:23.000> if<00:02:24.620> you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
category does need its own name if you

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.220 
category does need its own name if you
place<00:02:25.980> something<00:02:26.280> somewhere<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.959> learn

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
place something somewhere and you learn

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.160 
place something somewhere and you learn
that<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:29.640> probably<00:02:30.120> not<00:02:30.569> where<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.930> wanted

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
that it's probably not where you wanted

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.070 
that it's probably not where you wanted
to<00:02:31.260> put<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.650> then<00:02:32.220> go<00:02:32.580> ahead<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.120> move<00:02:33.599> that<00:02:33.660> at

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
to put it then go ahead and move that at

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.100 
to put it then go ahead and move that at
any<00:02:34.319> time<00:02:34.380> if<00:02:35.099> you<00:02:35.760> need<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.150> create<00:02:36.480> more<00:02:36.810> room

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
any time if you need to create more room

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.020 
any time if you need to create more room
for<00:02:37.380> sorting<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:37.950> can<00:02:38.160> go<00:02:38.310> ahead<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.550> drag

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
for sorting you can go ahead and drag

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.630 
for sorting you can go ahead and drag
and<00:02:39.269> drop<00:02:39.300> these<00:02:39.750> groups<00:02:40.170> around<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:41.250> organize

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
and drop these groups around to organize

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.050 
and drop these groups around to organize
them<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.269> whatever<00:02:42.720> way<00:02:43.549> gives<00:02:44.549> you<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.849> space

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
them in whatever way gives you the space

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.300 
them in whatever way gives you the space
that<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.450> need<00:02:45.480> if<00:02:45.930> you're<00:02:46.769> really<00:02:47.160> running

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
that you need if you're really running

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.460 
that you need if you're really running
out<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.610> space<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.299> can<00:02:48.330> also<00:02:48.630> go<00:02:49.200> ahead<00:02:49.319> and

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
out of space you can also go ahead and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.589 
out of space you can also go ahead and
collapse<00:02:49.920> any<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.430> these<00:02:50.610> groups<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.150> then<00:02:51.390> go

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
collapse any of these groups and then go

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.589 
collapse any of these groups and then go
ahead<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.840> expand<00:02:52.380> them<00:02:52.650> at<00:02:52.920> any<00:02:53.130> time<00:02:53.599> once

ahead and expand them at any time once

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.059 
ahead and expand them at any time once
you've<00:02:54.780> accounted<00:02:55.260> for<00:02:55.290> everything<00:02:55.890> on<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069

and once you've given every category its

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.610 
and once you've given every category its
