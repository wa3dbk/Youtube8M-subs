00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.180 
the very first thing you want to do is

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.530 
the very first thing you want to do is
get<00:00:04.330> your<00:00:04.510> machine<00:00:04.930> plugged<00:00:05.319> in<00:00:05.529> and<00:00:05.800> turned

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
get your machine plugged in and turned

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.500 
get your machine plugged in and turned
on<00:00:08.580> you'll<00:00:09.580> see<00:00:09.760> that<00:00:09.879> you<00:00:10.000> have<00:00:10.090> a<00:00:10.119> light<00:00:10.360> in

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.510 
on you'll see that you have a light in

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.170 
on you'll see that you have a light in
here<00:00:10.809> when<00:00:11.110> the<00:00:11.139> factories<00:00:11.830> doze<00:00:12.670> a<00:00:12.699> machine

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
here when the factories doze a machine

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.510 
here when the factories doze a machine
they<00:00:13.360> usually<00:00:13.629> put<00:00:13.959> a<00:00:14.139> nice<00:00:14.740> little<00:00:14.889> sample<00:00:15.430> in

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
they usually put a nice little sample in

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.160 
they usually put a nice little sample in
there<00:00:15.670> so<00:00:15.820> you<00:00:15.910> can<00:00:16.000> take<00:00:16.180> that<00:00:16.360> out<00:00:16.570> and<00:00:16.869> we're

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
there so you can take that out and we're

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.100 
there so you can take that out and we're
ready<00:00:17.199> to<00:00:17.470> get<00:00:18.130> into<00:00:18.490> our<00:00:18.690> accessories<00:00:19.690> and

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
ready to get into our accessories and

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.710 
ready to get into our accessories and
get<00:00:20.320> a<00:00:20.560> bobbin<00:00:21.310> out<00:00:21.460> the<00:00:22.060> accessories<00:00:22.510> you<00:00:22.570> to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
get a bobbin out the accessories you to

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.330 
get a bobbin out the accessories you to
be<00:00:22.840> hidden<00:00:23.050> right<00:00:23.230> in<00:00:23.380> here<00:00:23.650> will<00:00:23.980> kind<00:00:24.160> of<00:00:24.190> go

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
be hidden right in here will kind of go

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.920 
be hidden right in here will kind of go
through<00:00:24.370> those<00:00:24.760> with<00:00:25.030> the<00:00:25.150> following<00:00:25.570> videos

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
through those with the following videos

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.680 
through those with the following videos
just<00:00:26.920> take<00:00:27.130> those<00:00:27.370> out<00:00:27.610> I'll<00:00:28.119> leave<00:00:28.330> that<00:00:28.360> off

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
just take those out I'll leave that off

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.930 
just take those out I'll leave that off
so<00:00:28.930> I<00:00:28.960> can<00:00:29.140> get<00:00:29.230> into<00:00:29.500> the<00:00:29.590> bobbin<00:00:29.770> area<00:00:30.130> as<00:00:30.640> we

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 
so I can get into the bobbin area as we

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.930 
so I can get into the bobbin area as we
go<00:00:31.379> one<00:00:32.379> thing<00:00:32.529> about<00:00:32.619> bobbins<00:00:33.340> is<00:00:33.550> that<00:00:33.789> they

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
go one thing about bobbins is that they

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.080 
go one thing about bobbins is that they
are<00:00:34.440> specific<00:00:35.440> for<00:00:35.470> each<00:00:35.860> machine<00:00:36.190> so<00:00:36.820> this<00:00:36.940> is

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
are specific for each machine so this is

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.610 
are specific for each machine so this is
not<00:00:37.239> a<00:00:37.270> time<00:00:37.600> to<00:00:37.630> be<00:00:37.870> mixing<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:38.440> matching

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
not a time to be mixing and matching

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.740 
not a time to be mixing and matching
from<00:00:39.550> other<00:00:39.760> machines<00:00:40.239> if<00:00:40.480> your<00:00:40.600> machine

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
from other machines if your machine

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.360 
from other machines if your machine
takes<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.260> plastic<00:00:41.680> bobbin<00:00:42.010> it<00:00:42.130> takes<00:00:42.280> a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
takes a plastic bobbin it takes a

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.400 
takes a plastic bobbin it takes a
plastic<00:00:42.730> bobbin<00:00:43.090> metal<00:00:43.720> bobbins<00:00:44.110> are<00:00:44.200> for

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
plastic bobbin metal bobbins are for

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.530 
plastic bobbin metal bobbins are for
machines<00:00:44.770> that<00:00:44.950> take<00:00:45.100> metal<00:00:45.340> bobbin<00:00:45.820> so

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
machines that take metal bobbin so

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.150 
machines that take metal bobbin so
definitely<00:00:47.140> make<00:00:47.380> sure<00:00:47.440> it<00:00:47.710> let's<00:00:47.860> see<00:00:47.980> here

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
definitely make sure it let's see here

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.450 
definitely make sure it let's see here
in<00:00:48.309> here<00:00:48.579> we've<00:00:48.730> got<00:00:48.880> one<00:00:49.090> two<00:00:49.390> three<00:00:50.460> bobbins

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
in here we've got one two three bobbins

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.780 
in here we've got one two three bobbins
and<00:00:52.559> sometimes<00:00:53.559> they<00:00:53.890> actually<00:00:54.130> put<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.309> bobbin

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
and sometimes they actually put a bobbin

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.560 
and sometimes they actually put a bobbin
in<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.960> bobbin<00:00:56.170> case<00:00:56.770> yes<00:00:57.430> we've<00:00:58.120> got<00:00:58.149> a<00:00:58.329> total

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
in the bobbin case yes we've got a total

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.930 
in the bobbin case yes we've got a total
of<00:00:58.809> four<00:00:58.870> bobbins<00:00:59.649> to<00:01:00.219> work<00:01:00.399> with<00:01:00.610> when<00:01:00.820> you

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
of four bobbins to work with when you

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.840 
of four bobbins to work with when you
get<00:01:01.390> your<00:01:01.510> machine<00:01:01.870> so<00:01:02.800> let's<00:01:03.129> take<00:01:03.340> a<00:01:03.370> look<00:01:03.579> in

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
get your machine so let's take a look in

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.120 
get your machine so let's take a look in
the<00:01:04.059> accessory<00:01:04.570> box<00:01:04.780> I'm<00:01:05.469> going<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.649> pull<00:01:05.890> out

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
the accessory box I'm going to pull out

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.449 
the accessory box I'm going to pull out
a<00:01:06.399> vertical<00:01:07.149> spool<00:01:07.600> pin<00:01:07.659> just<00:01:08.439> so<00:01:08.560> we<00:01:08.709> can<00:01:08.920> talk

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:09.459 
a vertical spool pin just so we can talk

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:11.819 
a vertical spool pin just so we can talk
about<00:01:09.670> it<00:01:09.999> as<00:01:10.179> we<00:01:10.420> get<00:01:10.630> started<00:01:11.229> with<00:01:11.319> winding

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829 
about it as we get started with winding

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:13.949 
about it as we get started with winding
our<00:01:11.950> bobbins<00:01:12.429> and<00:01:12.670> where<00:01:12.939> our<00:01:12.969> spool<00:01:13.569> needs<00:01:13.810> to

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:13.959 
our bobbins and where our spool needs to

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:16.709 
our bobbins and where our spool needs to
actually<00:01:14.530> go<00:01:14.709> now<00:01:15.490> this<00:01:15.759> is<00:01:15.939> actually<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.329> cross

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
actually go now this is actually a cross

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.629 
actually go now this is actually a cross
wound<00:01:17.109> thread<00:01:17.590> cross<00:01:17.950> bone<00:01:18.159> thread<00:01:18.459> actually

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:18.639 
wound thread cross bone thread actually

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:20.819 
wound thread cross bone thread actually
means<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:19.240> you<00:01:19.509> can<00:01:19.689> kind<00:01:19.899> of<00:01:19.959> see<00:01:20.139> little

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
means that you can kind of see little

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.529 
means that you can kind of see little
X's<00:01:21.399> on<00:01:21.639> the<00:01:22.799> spool<00:01:23.799> and<00:01:24.189> we<00:01:24.819> go<00:01:24.969> ahead<00:01:25.270> if<00:01:25.509> you

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
X's on the spool and we go ahead if you

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.050 
X's on the spool and we go ahead if you
have<00:01:25.689> two<00:01:26.079> spool<00:01:26.529> caps<00:01:26.829> this<00:01:27.399> one's<00:01:27.609> a<00:01:27.700> fairly

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
have two spool caps this one's a fairly

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.730 
have two spool caps this one's a fairly
large<00:01:28.389> one<00:01:28.659> that<00:01:28.899> would<00:01:29.020> be<00:01:29.109> used<00:01:29.319> for<00:01:29.529> bigger

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
large one that would be used for bigger

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.039 
large one that would be used for bigger
spools<00:01:30.609> but<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:31.060> one<00:01:31.209> has<00:01:31.389> a<00:01:31.420> little<00:01:31.779> bit<00:01:31.899> of

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
spools but this one has a little bit of

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.809 
spools but this one has a little bit of
a<00:01:32.170> smaller<00:01:32.709> end<00:01:33.099> so<00:01:33.340> we're<00:01:33.459> just<00:01:33.609> going<00:01:33.729> to<00:01:33.759> use

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
a smaller end so we're just going to use

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.609 
a smaller end so we're just going to use
the<00:01:34.060> small<00:01:34.389> spool<00:01:34.749> cap<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.139> hold<00:01:35.349> that<00:01:35.469> in

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
the small spool cap to hold that in

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.889 
the small spool cap to hold that in
place<00:01:35.799> if<00:01:36.310> you<00:01:36.939> have<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.179> spool<00:01:37.569> that<00:01:37.719> is<00:01:37.869> a

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
place if you have a spool that is a

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.839 
place if you have a spool that is a
stack<00:01:38.319> thread<00:01:38.709> where<00:01:38.889> the<00:01:39.009> thread<00:01:39.249> lays<00:01:39.520> right

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:39.849 
stack thread where the thread lays right

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.249 
stack thread where the thread lays right
next<00:01:40.179> to<00:01:40.270> each<00:01:40.329> other<00:01:40.509> all<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.719> way<00:01:40.929> up<00:01:41.109> the

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
next to each other all the way up the

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.839 
next to each other all the way up the
spool<00:01:41.529> and<00:01:41.709> down<00:01:41.950> we're<00:01:42.429> going<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.579> put<00:01:42.700> that

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:42.849 
spool and down we're going to put that

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:44.999 
spool and down we're going to put that
on<00:01:42.969> the<00:01:43.090> vertical<00:01:43.539> spool<00:01:43.840> pin<00:01:43.899> it's<00:01:44.619> also<00:01:44.770> nice

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
on the vertical spool pin it's also nice

spool<00:01:48.909> will<00:01:49.119> sit<00:01:49.389> I'm<00:01:49.749> going<00:01:49.899> to<00:01:49.959> just<00:01:50.049> take

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
spool will sit I'm going to just take

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.730 
spool will sit I'm going to just take
that<00:01:50.259> off

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
that off

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.050

usually when you travel you don't want

usually when you travel you don't want
to<00:01:52.119> leave<00:01:52.270> that<00:01:52.419> on<00:01:52.599> because<00:01:52.810> it's<00:01:52.959> kind<00:01:53.139> of

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:53.169 
to leave that on because it's kind of

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:54.510 
to leave that on because it's kind of
going<00:01:53.319> to<00:01:53.409> be<00:01:53.529> sticking<00:01:53.799> up<00:01:54.009> and<00:01:54.189> out<00:01:54.279> of<00:01:54.429> the

we're<00:01:57.340> going<00:01:57.459> to<00:01:57.490> do<00:01:57.700> is<00:01:57.939> we're<00:01:58.359> going<00:01:58.389> to<00:01:58.599> come

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
we're going to do is we're going to come

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.629 
we're going to do is we're going to come
around<00:01:58.989> the<00:01:59.200> first<00:01:59.529> guide<00:01:59.770> on<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.069> back<00:02:00.279> part

here's<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.179> trick<00:02:01.419> to<00:02:01.539> remember<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.200> spool<00:02:02.560> of

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
here's a trick to remember the spool of

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.249 
here's a trick to remember the spool of
thread<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:04.060> thread<00:02:04.419> coming<00:02:04.810> off<00:02:04.959> of<00:02:04.989> it

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
thread and the thread coming off of it

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.649 
thread and the thread coming off of it
needs<00:02:05.439> to<00:02:05.619> always<00:02:06.039> come<00:02:06.340> at<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:06.609> straight<00:02:07.359> line

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
needs to always come at a straight line

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.230 
needs to always come at a straight line
if<00:02:08.200> it's<00:02:08.349> coming<00:02:08.530> from<00:02:08.739> this<00:02:08.920> pool<00:02:09.399> over<00:02:09.910> here

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
if it's coming from this pool over here

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.750 
if it's coming from this pool over here
to<00:02:10.450> where<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.690> bobbin<00:02:11.020> winder<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.760> little

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
to where the bobbin winder a little

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.460 
to where the bobbin winder a little
pre-tensioner<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.510> that's<00:02:14.080> going<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.290> be<00:02:14.350> at

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
pre-tensioner is that's going to be at

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.660 
pre-tensioner is that's going to be at
an<00:02:14.560> angle<00:02:14.680> will<00:02:15.010> kind<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.250> pull

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
an angle will kind of pull

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.850 
an angle will kind of pull
little<00:02:15.849> hard<00:02:16.060> against<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.510> spool<00:02:16.930> then<00:02:17.500> you

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
little hard against that spool then you

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.479 
little hard against that spool then you
have<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.160> little<00:02:19.150> picture<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.720> diagram<00:02:20.410> of<00:02:20.650> which

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
have a little picture a diagram of which

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.210 
have a little picture a diagram of which
way<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:21.880> go<00:02:22.150> around<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:22.750> pre-tensioner<00:02:23.620> now

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
way to go around this pre-tensioner now

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.100 
way to go around this pre-tensioner now
this<00:02:24.640> does<00:02:24.970> need<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.450> do<00:02:25.599> need<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.840> make<00:02:25.959> sure

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
this does need you do need to make sure

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.570 
this does need you do need to make sure
your<00:02:26.290> thread<00:02:26.530> actually<00:02:26.830> gets<00:02:27.250> underneath

this this is what it's going to make the

this this is what it's going to make the
bobbin<00:02:30.280> wind

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
bobbin wind

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.710

nice<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.780> tight<00:02:32.080> as<00:02:32.350> we<00:02:32.920> go<00:02:33.100> here<00:02:33.459> right<00:02:33.720> will

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
nice and tight as we go here right will

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.890 
nice and tight as we go here right will
give<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.870> nice<00:02:35.319> clean<00:02:35.620> cut<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.370> then<00:02:36.970> for<00:02:37.690> the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
give a nice clean cut and then for the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.420 
give a nice clean cut and then for the
bobbin<00:02:38.140> we're<00:02:38.590> going<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:38.800> take<00:02:38.980> our<00:02:39.130> thread

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
bobbin we're going to take our thread

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.809 
bobbin we're going to take our thread

of<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.060> holes<00:02:43.300> there<00:02:43.660> pull<00:02:44.350> about<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.800> five<00:02:45.280> six

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
of the holes there pull about a five six

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.550 
of the holes there pull about a five six
inches<00:02:45.819> on<00:02:46.180> there<00:02:46.420> go<00:02:46.930> ahead<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.230> put<00:02:47.349> it<00:02:47.470> on

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
inches on there go ahead and put it on

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.350 
inches on there go ahead and put it on
the<00:02:47.739> bobbin<00:02:48.100> winder<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.580> push<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.940> over<00:02:49.060> I

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
the bobbin winder and push it over I

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.540 
the bobbin winder and push it over I
usually<00:02:49.870> like<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.050> just<00:02:50.319> hold<00:02:50.530> my<00:02:50.739> threads<00:02:51.310> in

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
usually like to just hold my threads in

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.460 
usually like to just hold my threads in
my<00:02:51.670> hands<00:02:51.970> but<00:02:52.360> leave<00:02:52.510> yourself<00:02:52.720> about<00:02:52.959> three

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
my hands but leave yourself about three

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.559 
my hands but leave yourself about three
four<00:02:53.739> inches<00:02:53.769> across<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.489> top<00:02:54.819> here<00:02:54.850> then<00:02:55.450> go

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
four inches across the top here then go

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.110 
four inches across the top here then go
ahead<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.840> step<00:02:55.989> on<00:02:56.110> your<00:02:56.260> foot<00:02:56.410> control

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.490 

eventually<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.540> will<00:03:01.720> break<00:03:01.930> off<00:03:02.170> but

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
eventually this will break off but

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.440 
eventually this will break off but
sometimes<00:03:02.739> I'll<00:03:03.069> stop<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.670> actually<00:03:04.269> make

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
sometimes I'll stop and actually make

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.800 
sometimes I'll stop and actually make
sure<00:03:04.659> I<00:03:04.930> clip<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.950> tail<00:03:06.220> take<00:03:06.849> small<00:03:07.269> scissors

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
sure I clip the tail take small scissors

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.630 
sure I clip the tail take small scissors
and<00:03:08.019> clip<00:03:08.140> right<00:03:08.560> at<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.830> end<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:09.220> there's<00:03:09.400> not

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
and clip right at the end so there's not

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.720 
and clip right at the end so there's not
a<00:03:09.670> little<00:03:10.090> extra<00:03:10.480> stuff<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.349> thread<00:03:11.709> coming<00:03:12.580> up

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
a little extra stuff of thread coming up

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.610 
a little extra stuff of thread coming up
there<00:03:13.060> because<00:03:13.629> once<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.140> goes<00:03:14.260> into<00:03:14.440> the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
there because once it goes into the

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.050 
there because once it goes into the
bobbin<00:03:14.920> case<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.280> can<00:03:15.400> actually<00:03:15.580> interrupts

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
bobbin case that can actually interrupts

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.259 
bobbin case that can actually interrupts
how<00:03:16.239> it<00:03:16.450> actually<00:03:16.599> spins<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.670> sews<00:03:18.670> there<00:03:19.000> so

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
how it actually spins and sews there so

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.250 
how it actually spins and sews there so
we're<00:03:19.420> just<00:03:19.450> going<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.750> go<00:03:19.810> ahead<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.110> fill

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
we're just going to go ahead and fill

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.960 
we're just going to go ahead and fill
this<00:03:20.349> all<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.620> way<00:03:20.739> up<00:03:20.769> it'll<00:03:21.400> stop<00:03:21.610> when<00:03:21.640> it's

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
this all the way up it'll stop when it's

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.839 
this all the way up it'll stop when it's
full

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.089 

they<00:03:26.359> do<00:03:26.420> hold<00:03:26.749> quite<00:03:27.079> a<00:03:27.109> bit<00:03:27.319> of<00:03:27.469> thread<00:03:27.709> so

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
they do hold quite a bit of thread so

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.009 
they do hold quite a bit of thread so
it's<00:03:28.700> nice<00:03:28.939> always<00:03:29.359> go<00:03:29.569> ahead<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:29.930> make

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
it's nice always go ahead and make

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.920 
it's nice always go ahead and make
yourself<00:03:30.139> a<00:03:30.469> nice<00:03:30.620> full<00:03:30.889> bobbin<00:03:31.840> when<00:03:32.840> it

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
yourself a nice full bobbin when it

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:33.729 
yourself a nice full bobbin when it
stops<00:03:33.139> spinning

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
stops spinning

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.800 
stops spinning
you<00:03:33.859> can<00:03:34.069> let<00:03:34.280> up<00:03:34.400> on<00:03:34.549> your<00:03:34.700> foot<00:03:34.849> control<00:03:35.030> flip

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
you can let up on your foot control flip

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.899 
you can let up on your foot control flip
your<00:03:36.019> thread<00:03:36.319> slide<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.950> bobbin<00:03:37.129> back<00:03:37.489> and

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
your thread slide the bobbin back and

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.520 
your thread slide the bobbin back and
now<00:03:38.209> we're<00:03:38.389> ready<00:03:38.599> to<00:03:38.810> put<00:03:39.019> it<00:03:39.139> into<00:03:39.319> the

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
now we're ready to put it into the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.610 
now we're ready to put it into the
bobbin<00:03:39.709> case<00:03:39.950> here's<00:03:40.879> the<00:03:41.030> trick<00:03:41.450> for<00:03:41.749> putting

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
bobbin case here's the trick for putting

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.470 
bobbin case here's the trick for putting
it<00:03:42.769> in<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.040> bobbin<00:03:43.370> case<00:03:43.400> what<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.239> want<00:03:44.389> to

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
it in the bobbin case what you want to

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.990 
it in the bobbin case what you want to
do<00:03:44.599> is<00:03:44.750> look<00:03:44.989> for<00:03:45.049> the<00:03:45.769> bobbin<00:03:46.159> as<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.579> drop<00:03:46.819> it

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
do is look for the bobbin as you drop it

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.539 
do is look for the bobbin as you drop it
in<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.599> thread<00:03:47.870> needs<00:03:48.109> to<00:03:48.230> come<00:03:48.439> over<00:03:48.799> the

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
in the thread needs to come over the

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.369 
in the thread needs to come over the
right<00:03:49.939> side<00:03:50.329> of<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.629> bobbin<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.049> means<00:03:51.230> when

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
right side of the bobbin that means when

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.349 
right side of the bobbin that means when
you<00:03:51.469> pull<00:03:51.709> on<00:03:51.889> it<00:03:51.919> it<00:03:52.189> should<00:03:52.400> spin<00:03:52.849> clockwise

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
you pull on it it should spin clockwise

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.929 
you pull on it it should spin clockwise
you're<00:03:54.349> going<00:03:54.469> to<00:03:54.560> bring<00:03:54.709> it<00:03:54.859> right<00:03:55.129> up<00:03:55.189> to<00:03:55.579> the

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
you're going to bring it right up to the

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.580 
you're going to bring it right up to the
little<00:03:56.209> groove<00:03:56.510> that's<00:03:56.810> on<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.079> side<00:03:57.319> of<00:03:57.349> the

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
little groove that's on the side of the

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.229 
little groove that's on the side of the
bobbin<00:03:57.769> case<00:03:57.980> pull<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:58.519> straight<00:03:58.639> down<00:03:58.819> and

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
bobbin case pull it straight down and

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.509 
bobbin case pull it straight down and
then<00:03:59.810> over<00:04:00.319> I<00:04:00.469> usually<00:04:00.709> push<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.280> thread

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
then over I usually push the thread

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.179 
then over I usually push the thread
across<00:04:01.939> the<00:04:02.540> side<00:04:02.959> of<00:04:03.409> the<00:04:03.530> bobbin<00:04:03.889> case<00:04:03.919> so

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:04.189 
across the side of the bobbin case so

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:05.379 
across the side of the bobbin case so
I'm<00:04:04.250> not<00:04:04.370> kind<00:04:04.549> of<00:04:04.669> pulling<00:04:04.849> it<00:04:05.030> towards<00:04:05.269> me

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
I'm not kind of pulling it towards me

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.929 
I'm not kind of pulling it towards me
but<00:04:05.810> almost<00:04:06.049> guiding<00:04:06.799> it<00:04:06.949> along<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.430> side<00:04:07.639> and

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:07.939 
but almost guiding it along the side and

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.990 
but almost guiding it along the side and
then<00:04:08.359> down<00:04:08.659> into<00:04:09.019> there's<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.799> little<00:04:10.099> sea<00:04:10.489> area

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
then down into there's a little sea area

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.330 
then down into there's a little sea area
right<00:04:11.389> here<00:04:11.419> that<00:04:12.079> you<00:04:12.530> can<00:04:12.560> kind<00:04:12.919> of<00:04:13.040> the

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
right here that you can kind of the

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.039 
right here that you can kind of the
threads<00:04:13.699> going<00:04:13.879> to<00:04:13.969> sit<00:04:14.209> on<00:04:14.239> now<00:04:14.780> it<00:04:14.870> doesn't

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
threads going to sit on now it doesn't

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.870 
threads going to sit on now it doesn't
matter<00:04:15.290> which<00:04:15.650> side<00:04:15.680> this<00:04:16.220> actually<00:04:16.639> is<00:04:16.699> on

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
matter which side this actually is on

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.969 
matter which side this actually is on
but<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.419> finger<00:04:17.810> does<00:04:18.019> need<00:04:18.259> to<00:04:18.289> be<00:04:18.500> pointing

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
but the finger does need to be pointing

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.219 
but the finger does need to be pointing
straight<00:04:19.009> up<00:04:19.280> as<00:04:19.519> we<00:04:19.759> go<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:19.940> put<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:20.269> into<00:04:20.570> the

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
straight up as we go to put it into the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.920 
straight up as we go to put it into the
bobbin<00:04:21.650> area<00:04:21.889> become<00:04:22.820> left-handed<00:04:23.389> that's

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
bobbin area become left-handed that's

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.140 
bobbin area become left-handed that's
the<00:04:24.169> key<00:04:24.349> here<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.830> hold<00:04:25.400> this<00:04:25.580> latch<00:04:25.880> out

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
the key here you hold this latch out

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.050 
the key here you hold this latch out
with<00:04:26.360> your<00:04:26.509> left<00:04:26.810> index<00:04:27.050> finger<00:04:27.770> that<00:04:28.610> bobbins

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
with your left index finger that bobbins

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.240 
with your left index finger that bobbins
not<00:04:29.270> going<00:04:29.449> to<00:04:29.539> drop<00:04:29.690> out<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.259> that<00:04:30.740> means<00:04:30.979> that

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
not going to drop out so that means that

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.930 
not going to drop out so that means that
if<00:04:31.639> when<00:04:31.880> it's<00:04:32.030> let<00:04:32.210> go<00:04:32.389> it<00:04:32.659> will<00:04:33.139> come<00:04:33.380> out<00:04:33.409> so

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
if when it's let go it will come out so

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.070 
if when it's let go it will come out so
hold<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:35.090> there<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.479> then<00:04:35.659> this<00:04:35.780> will<00:04:35.960> be

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
hold it there and then this will be

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.570 
hold it there and then this will be
straight<00:04:36.349> up<00:04:36.380> it's<00:04:36.650> actually<00:04:36.949> easier<00:04:37.310> to<00:04:37.340> put

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
straight up it's actually easier to put

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.999 
straight up it's actually easier to put
it<00:04:37.699> into<00:04:38.150> your<00:04:38.240> machine<00:04:38.630> with<00:04:39.259> your<00:04:39.440> left<00:04:39.770> hand

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.950 
it into your machine with your left hand
leave<00:04:40.639> that<00:04:40.849> tail<00:04:41.000> hanging<00:04:41.270> out<00:04:41.449> the<00:04:41.690> side

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
leave that tail hanging out the side

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.330 
leave that tail hanging out the side
here<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.620> we're<00:04:42.740> going<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:42.889> go<00:04:43.009> ahead<00:04:43.190> and

use<00:05:43.290> that<00:05:43.500> needle<00:05:43.830> threader<00:05:44.130> not<00:05:44.940> all<00:05:45.180> models

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
use that needle threader not all models

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.080 
use that needle threader not all models
of<00:05:45.840> the<00:05:45.960> e10<00:05:46.470> series<00:05:46.980> has<00:05:47.370> this<00:05:47.670> I<00:05:47.880> just

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
of the e10 series has this I just

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.090 
of the e10 series has this I just
noticed<00:05:48.360> that<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.600> Box<00:05:48.840> said<00:05:49.410> now<00:05:49.650> equipped

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
noticed that the Box said now equipped

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.160 
noticed that the Box said now equipped
with<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.400> needle<00:05:50.520> threader<00:05:50.850> so<00:05:51.120> yay<00:05:51.480> what

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
with the needle threader so yay what

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.380 
with the needle threader so yay what
definitely<00:05:52.770> makes<00:05:52.950> it<00:05:53.040> a<00:05:53.100> lot<00:05:53.280> easier<00:05:53.880> to<00:05:54.270> get

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
definitely makes it a lot easier to get

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.750 
definitely makes it a lot easier to get
that<00:05:54.600> threaded<00:05:54.960> up<00:05:55.200> so<00:05:55.950> like<00:05:56.280> I<00:05:56.310> said<00:05:56.520> we'll<00:05:56.640> do

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
that threaded up so like I said we'll do

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.820 
that threaded up so like I said we'll do
a<00:05:56.790> separate<00:05:57.180> video<00:05:57.300> on<00:05:57.480> up<00:05:58.080> close<00:05:58.470> and<00:05:58.710> how<00:05:58.770> to

hand do one full stitch then when we

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.590 
hand do one full stitch then when we
talk<00:06:08.400> about<00:06:08.550> a<00:06:08.700> full<00:06:08.970> stitch<00:06:09.210> we're<00:06:09.360> talking

about the teacup lever coming all the
way<00:06:11.640> back<00:06:11.850> to<00:06:12.030> the<00:06:12.120> highest<00:06:12.360> position<00:06:12.660> you

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
way back to the highest position you

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.470 
way back to the highest position you
always<00:06:13.920> turn<00:06:14.160> the<00:06:14.280> hand<00:06:14.520> wheel<00:06:14.610> towards<00:06:15.240> you

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
always turn the hand wheel towards you

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.100 
always turn the hand wheel towards you
and<00:06:15.690> that<00:06:16.200> will<00:06:16.440> create<00:06:16.710> a<00:06:16.830> stitch<00:06:17.900> proper<00:06:18.900> and

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
and that will create a stitch proper and

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.520 
and that will create a stitch proper and
it<00:06:19.740> will<00:06:19.860> pull<00:06:20.130> up<00:06:20.370> the<00:06:20.670> thread<00:06:21.180> of<00:06:21.540> the<00:06:21.990> bobbin

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
it will pull up the thread of the bobbin

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.590 
it will pull up the thread of the bobbin
and<00:06:22.770> that<00:06:23.010> little<00:06:23.310> loop<00:06:23.520> take<00:06:24.120> both<00:06:24.360> these

and that little loop take both these

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.270 
and that little loop take both these
threads<00:06:24.960> now<00:06:25.200> and<00:06:25.500> put<00:06:25.680> them<00:06:25.800> underneath<00:06:26.130> the

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
threads now and put them underneath the

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.700 
threads now and put them underneath the
foot<00:06:26.670> and<00:06:26.820> to<00:06:27.180> the<00:06:27.300> back<00:06:27.510> of<00:06:27.690> the<00:06:27.750> machine<00:06:28.170> now
