have circle of to an outbreak and I need

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.570 
have circle of to an outbreak and I need
to<00:00:27.810> perhaps<00:00:28.200> clarify<00:00:28.980> what<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.189> said<00:00:29.400> yesterday

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
to perhaps clarify what I said yesterday

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.400 
to perhaps clarify what I said yesterday
outbreak<00:00:30.510> used<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.779> be<00:00:30.869> an<00:00:30.960> alliance<00:00:31.170> called

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
outbreak used to be an alliance called

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.410 
outbreak used to be an alliance called
kraut<00:00:31.859> break<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.519> I<00:00:32.730> thought<00:00:33.000> that's<00:00:33.150> because

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
kraut break and I thought that's because

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.210 
kraut break and I thought that's because
they<00:00:33.570> were<00:00:33.629> a<00:00:33.930> German<00:00:34.350> alliance<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:35.040> it

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
they were a German alliance but as it

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.610 
they were a German alliance but as it
turns<00:00:35.430> out<00:00:35.750> they<00:00:36.750> might<00:00:37.019> have<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.290> been<00:00:37.350> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
turns out they might have just been a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.170 
turns out they might have just been a
VOC<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.070> was<00:00:38.190> German<00:00:38.519> I'm<00:00:38.670> not<00:00:38.910> really<00:00:39.059> sure

of<00:02:02.790> two<00:02:03.000> team<00:02:03.659> gets<00:02:03.930> picked<00:02:04.200> one<00:02:04.409> by<00:02:04.590> one<00:02:04.829> I

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
of two team gets picked one by one I

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.709 
of two team gets picked one by one I
think<00:02:05.219> as<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> speed<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.880> thats<00:02:06.270> invitaron

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
think as a speed that thats invitaron

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.539 
think as a speed that thats invitaron
circle<00:02:07.140> two<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.439> town<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.799> really<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> be

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
circle two in town is really going to be

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.130 
circle two in town is really going to be
telling<00:02:08.880> us<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.269> flow<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.660> rest<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:10.079> this

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
telling us to the flow the rest of this

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.449 
telling us to the flow the rest of this
match<00:02:10.380> there<00:02:10.739> are<00:02:10.860> some<00:02:11.039> really<00:02:11.160> interesting

well so you can is both taking damage at

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.720 
well so you can is both taking damage at
the<00:02:15.480> moment<00:02:15.780> what<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.019> circle<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.579> cyclone<00:02:17.579> is

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
the moment what the circle to cyclone is

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.479 
the moment what the circle to cyclone is
going<00:02:18.030> into<00:02:18.209> our<00:02:18.360> minds<00:02:18.630> going<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.769> die<00:02:20.070> very

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
going into our minds going to die very

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.240 
going into our minds going to die very
quickly<00:02:20.670> I'm<00:02:21.419> not<00:02:21.780> quite<00:02:22.109> sure<00:02:22.139> why<00:02:22.590> they<00:02:22.799> swap

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
some range from these letters yeah it

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.509 
some range from these letters yeah it
looks<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:33.959> outbreak<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.830> where<00:02:35.220> they<00:02:35.340> want

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
outbreak sabers as well we see some

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.629 
outbreak sabers as well we see some
effects<00:03:40.200> there<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:40.799> don't<00:03:41.010> know<00:03:41.190> how<00:03:41.370> much

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
quite sure what the what was the

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.470

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.460 
think in fact that scimitar is probably

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.330 
think in fact that scimitar is probably
ripping<00:07:16.880> him<00:07:17.270> up<00:07:17.450> just<00:07:17.810> because<00:07:18.200> why<00:07:18.830> not<00:07:18.860> now

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340 
ripping him up just because why not now

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.220 
ripping him up just because why not now
