00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.049
 My name is better and I hate you 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.360
 Welcome to a new one 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.460
 free-to-play suggestions video with me 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.260
 on the channel those of you who 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.300
 does not know what this is about 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.369
 here you can either over the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.960
 comments or via the link in the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.460
 suggest video description games 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.800
 I'll be a bit more specific 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.119
 watch and get into videos like this 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.579
 I then just my first impression 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.649
 the games just tell you 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.420
 yes and as you can see it is a game where 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.670
 I thought hey can do it 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.520
 it will be nothing anyway 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.410
 go online a browser and what for 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.149
 I'll come up with that in a minute 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.559
 maybe a thing I'm a giant 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.420
 want peace when i read both the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.460
 mangas like anime that too 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.079
 whole stop on the stand of asia that 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.649
 Currently I'm just at the end of 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.570
 the domingo art or endres rosa and it 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.390
 is an ingenious series since 15 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.219
 years and I like the games too 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.870
 For example, at Warriors I have 3 for 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.600
 the ps4 already featured form 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.580
 presented it was coming out in august 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.740
 and i see such games like this 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.510
 not necessarily as worthy representatives 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.280
 but the attack is definitely on 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.530
 fan service so one piece is online 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.729
 a pure browserergames I'm not like that 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.350
 the fan of browser games 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.170
 because for me in the browser games 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.119
 Pastime but somewhere I mean mine 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.830
 time too important there I can others 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.990
 play games I do not remember 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.880
 just not a fan and this goes online 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.890
 already in the niche but I have to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.320
 Honestly it evolves 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.049
 the time but relatively interesting the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.939
 premise of the game click car fit 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.619
 click 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.899
 see totally automated battles 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.149
 click on Read a lot 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.600
 it's just that the game is you 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.860
 especially in the first 20 to 25 minutes 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.020
 pretend that you have fun with it 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.240
 but why only if her one piece 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.939
 fansite if this website 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.890
 and there are so many here 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.049
 characters of the series you know there is 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.909
 Raphael or is the brand that gave 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.009
 in la vie even then you still have 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.600
 very short and it starts 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.009
 away from the media , so to speak 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.929
 incident if you not ready 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.120
 be with one piece then I'm sorry 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.480
 now come spoiler and that is true 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.770
 that ace is captured by 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.440
 Blackberry is his team 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.550
 separated and then tried in these in 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.860
 this time probably more of his team 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.200
 his brother was isolated Yes to save 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.850
 who have seen the series know yes 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.620
 So what happens in the game since me 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.989
 in this setting just at the beginning though 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.000
 it has nothing to do with the series because 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.250
 There people walk around there at all 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.069
 not in the series were or in 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.209
 but the story has the social 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.830
 whole somehow so in such a pisser 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.780
 to pack the universe rhine and that has 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.160
 I personally liked the game very much 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.769
 It's just such a typical thing 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.220
 browser game from asia the esse 10 class 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.440
 out 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.090
 the characters are there you know them 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.860
 does not know if you have the license for it 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.510
 but they look really good too 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.790
 world takes you who knows moves 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.230
 you even fit the texts from the series 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.080
 and there are many known ones 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.190
 characterize but you are not one of them 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.780
 You can start at the beginning of three 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.610
 choose different characters like that 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.130
 typical anime types i have myself 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.630
 ultimately for the sniper or less 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.980
 decided to do that yes I thought 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.440
 fernkÃ¤mpfer but somehow it is synonymous 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.510
 a farmer and mirror stands 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.040
 mostly because you car pope 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.239
 means you only click on one 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.769
 quest and new character will become 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.209
 automatically to the next point of the 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.769
 quest we can also move ourselves 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.040
 But honestly, who does that? 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.230
 beautiful 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.609
 and then come fight in here 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.430
 Fights are structured that way 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.109
 the whole is a linear or a 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.359
 linear away from left to right left 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.430
 is your base with a pirate flag 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.750
 the ten life points are from the right 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.500
 come different all the time 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.450
 opponent and you have to actually 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.700
 try to prevent the opponents 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.769
 to get to your pirate flag 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.239
 and accordingly all opponents 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.260
 defeat before they get there 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.030
 You do not even click that way anymore 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.280
 uninteresting child a bit so after 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.410
 tower defense the problem is 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.239
 but that nothing have to do and 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.799
 the whole thing is going on and you can 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.510
 never just let go of the keyboard 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.640
 and your characters will become one 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.320
 automatically move and kill everything 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.620
 but I must confess I thought so 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.360
 after the first ten minutes 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.010
 yes not so boring you always have 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.980
 still this little one piece half in 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.690
 but then never really so 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.010
 but my thing comes sometime 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.659
 in fact, that you move 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.060
 must because the game is designed to 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.590
 You do not have to move here if you 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.630
 but you can with the mouse too 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.130
 click which opponent first 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.470
 to be targeted you can yours 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.060
 move character himself and later 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.650
 that even necessary comes over different 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.150
 you even have skills here yourself 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.830
 you can activate something in the browser 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.720
 games are not always given and 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.699
 I have to say where I am at the end of 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.110
 I already had this marin advantage 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.850
 actually make a little more and 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.340
 that was fun, but it remains 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.169
 but the game is not 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.190
 profound game I is me 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.720
 I think so now a few more days 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.699
 look and see if it maybe in the 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.380
 highlevel even more is there 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.210
 there is a lot behind it you can 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.710
 on the one hand to found a pirate crew for 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.229
 others might be the well-known characters 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.970
 from the series in the taverns to yours 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.590
 Cool, for example, I ran the whole 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.970
 time with zorro to robin through the 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.190
 You can control your character 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.330
 Expand Improve Learning New Skills 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.030
 and so on 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.130
 but it stays that way it is 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.930
 I am curious if there is still a browser game 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.690
 will offer more now with time though 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.860
 it's one of those dangerous ones 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.810
 I have to play browser games again 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.039
 to tell where ps fans are going 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.510
 probably a little fun with it 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.889
 I have to be the way I am 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.220
 say completely disappointed because I do not 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.590
 from that 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.419
 but it is this browser game type where 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.800
 everywhere what flashes where he everywhere what 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.050
 gets paid where we but at the same time 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.340
 everywhere can spend money and me 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.080
 please you if you play the game 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.340
 Look what I actually every one of 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.050
 somehow there's magma on it 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.639
 would recommend dennis from the browser 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.220
 games that I was allowed to test until now 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.660
 actually one of the best so much 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.070
 better than online for example what i do 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.889
 I think about nine months ago 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.180
 have tested but no money is in 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.970
 Let this game take you from the 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.710
 turn left not like to tempt 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.660
 but look at this you play 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.800
 quiet so half an hour so I have 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.970
 I believe for almost an hour in a row 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.410
 played someday on the jews 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.930
 look up where it actually 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.280
 played and had a relatively long time 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.690
 more or less fun I have to 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.710
 but I still have to confess in life 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.240
 youtube on another screen 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.860
 seen and stopped the game like this 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.070
 bit gambled and also 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.750
 I believe a video each other 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.100
 I usually think so much about that 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.570
 would actually play in ten 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.760
 I do not know if that point 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.230
 comes and unfortunately went from where 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.000
 I can not get any further or 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.830
 can not win anymore 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.630
 without money in the system I am very much 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.550
 I'm looking forward to any event 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.010
 on your comments and opinions on one 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.060
 piece online link to the game you will find 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.610
 in the video description you can 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.500
 click on go directly on go download of the 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.330
 if dennis browser game does not start 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.010
 download necessary look at you all the time 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.330
 Maybe it's something for you 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.880
 and write to me in the comments 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.680
 from the game so I think of everyone 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.930
 very excited about it and hope 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.560
