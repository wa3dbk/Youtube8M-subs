Britain like you say I don't know what
the<00:04:48.030> situation<00:04:48.210> is<00:04:48.600> around<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:48.990> world<00:04:49.020> of

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
the situation is around the world of

the situation is around the world of
this<00:04:49.500> sort<00:04:49.770> of<00:04:49.800> stuff<00:04:50.040> but<00:04:50.580> we<00:04:50.730> have<00:04:50.850> an

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
this sort of stuff but we have an

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.570 
this sort of stuff but we have an
incredible<00:04:51.660> network<00:04:52.050> I<00:04:52.440> mean<00:04:52.650> goodness<00:04:53.220> knows

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
incredible network I mean goodness knows

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.910 
incredible network I mean goodness knows
how<00:04:53.850> many<00:04:54.060> miles<00:04:54.330> with<00:04:54.690> of<00:04:54.930> public

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
how many miles with of public

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.310 
how many miles with of public
rights-of-way<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.820> those<00:04:57.540> are<00:04:57.750> marked<00:04:58.140> by

rights-of-way and those are marked by
these<00:04:58.380> little<00:04:58.890> yellow<00:04:59.070> arrows<00:04:59.550> so<00:05:00.240> you<00:05:00.300> can

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
these little yellow arrows so you can

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.690 
these little yellow arrows so you can
see<00:05:00.690> there<00:05:00.900> we've<00:05:01.080> got<00:05:01.110> two<00:05:01.590> which<00:05:02.010> represent

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
see there we've got two which represent

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.460 
see there we've got two which represent
the<00:05:02.760> shocks<00:05:03.030> your<00:05:03.180> way<00:05:03.360> which<00:05:03.990> are<00:05:04.140> pointing

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
the shocks your way which are pointing

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.260 
the shocks your way which are pointing
up<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:04.800> down<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.100> tow<00:05:05.250> path<00:05:05.520> that's<00:05:05.850> nice<00:05:06.030> and

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
up and down the tow path that's nice and

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.990 
up and down the tow path that's nice and
simple<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:07.170> then<00:05:07.380> this<00:05:07.800> one<00:05:08.040> here<00:05:08.340> is<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.700> more

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
simple and then this one here is a more

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.290 
simple and then this one here is a more
general<00:05:09.560> walking<00:05:10.560> route<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:11.100> that<00:05:11.130> is<00:05:12.120> why

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
general walking route and that is why

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.690 
general walking route and that is why
there<00:05:12.570> is<00:05:12.690> this<00:05:12.810> very<00:05:13.140> odd<00:05:13.380> style<00:05:13.860> here<00:05:14.280> you

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
there is this very odd style here you

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.760 
there is this very odd style here you
don't<00:05:14.820> see<00:05:14.970> many<00:05:15.240> of<00:05:15.390> these<00:05:15.660> about<00:05:16.260> rather

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
don't see many of these about rather

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.440 
don't see many of these about rather
than<00:05:16.950> the<00:05:17.220> ones<00:05:17.610> that<00:05:17.880> just<00:05:17.910> have<00:05:18.090> the<00:05:18.300> piece

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
than the ones that just have the piece

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.420 
than the ones that just have the piece
of<00:05:18.570> wood<00:05:18.720> going<00:05:19.110> across<00:05:19.290> as<00:05:19.650> a<00:05:19.710> step<00:05:20.070> up<00:05:20.250> and

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
of wood going across as a step up and

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.120 
of wood going across as a step up and
over<00:05:20.730> but<00:05:21.480> that<00:05:21.750> there<00:05:22.080> is<00:05:22.380> pointing<00:05:22.920> straight

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
over but that there is pointing straight

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.400 
over but that there is pointing straight
over<00:05:24.030> and<00:05:24.060> across<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.720> those<00:05:24.870> fields<00:05:25.350> and

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
over and across to those fields and

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.920 
over and across to those fields and
trees<00:05:25.680> there<00:05:26.070> so<00:05:26.580> you're<00:05:26.730> basically<00:05:27.030> a<00:05:27.420> free

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
trees there so you're basically a free

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.380 
trees there so you're basically a free
to<00:05:28.110> wander<00:05:28.530> across<00:05:28.880> obviously<00:05:29.880> don't<00:05:30.090> stray

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
to wander across obviously don't stray

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.270 
to wander across obviously don't stray
too<00:05:30.420> far<00:05:30.630> from<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.170> path<00:05:31.350> and<00:05:31.560> don't<00:05:31.950> get<00:05:32.190> up

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
too far from the path and don't get up

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.860 
too far from the path and don't get up
to<00:05:32.400> mischief<00:05:32.610> and<00:05:32.940> start<00:05:33.150> trying<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.420> camp<00:05:33.690> in

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
to mischief and start trying to camp in

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.330 
to mischief and start trying to camp in
the<00:05:33.930> middle<00:05:34.050> of<00:05:34.260> private<00:05:34.740> fields<00:05:35.130> and<00:05:35.250> that

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
the middle of private fields and that

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.280 
the middle of private fields and that
sort<00:05:35.640> of<00:05:35.670> thing<00:05:35.850> so<00:05:36.090> that's<00:05:36.480> definitely<00:05:36.900> not

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
sort of thing so that's definitely not

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.380 
sort of thing so that's definitely not
what<00:05:37.500> it's<00:05:37.650> all<00:05:37.800> about<00:05:37.830> but<00:05:38.760> we're<00:05:38.970> gonna<00:05:39.090> just

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
what it's all about but we're gonna just

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.120 
what it's all about but we're gonna just
hop<00:05:39.570> over<00:05:39.720> there<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:40.440> I'll<00:05:40.530> show<00:05:40.710> you<00:05:40.770> a<00:05:40.890> few

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
hop over there and I'll show you a few

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.980 
hop over there and I'll show you a few
more<00:05:41.280> things<00:05:41.550> like<00:05:41.730> this<00:05:41.970> that<00:05:42.570> let<00:05:42.840> you<00:05:42.960> know
