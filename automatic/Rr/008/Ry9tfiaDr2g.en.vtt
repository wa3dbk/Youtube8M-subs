adjust<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.200> roster<00:01:25.530> well<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.130> been

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
adjust the roster well I think it's been

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.880 
adjust the roster well I think it's been
it's<00:01:27.060> been<00:01:27.180> two<00:01:27.570> distinct<00:01:28.049> seasons<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.650> think

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
it's been two distinct seasons I think

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.370 
it's been two distinct seasons I think
you<00:01:28.979> know<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.460> look<00:01:29.700> at<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> start<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.259> was

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you know if you look at the start it was

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.380 
you know if you look at the start it was
a<00:01:31.409> very<00:01:31.650> promising<00:01:32.100> start<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> team<00:01:33.180> was

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
a very promising start and the team was

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.910 
a very promising start and the team was
hitting<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.720> all<00:01:33.869> eight<00:01:33.900> cylinders<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.770> we've

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
hitting on all eight cylinders and we've

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.280 
hitting on all eight cylinders and we've
struggled<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.369> bit<00:01:35.400> lately<00:01:35.780> we<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> figure

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
struggled a bit lately we have to figure

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.050 
struggled a bit lately we have to figure
out<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.860> wouldn't<00:01:38.430> throw<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> rock

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
out what that is I wouldn't throw a rock

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.940 
out what that is I wouldn't throw a rock
like<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.659> first<00:01:39.900> day<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.829> think

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
like that the first day you know I think

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.310 
like that the first day you know I think
you<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.400> point<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.880> games<00:01:42.150> where<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.200> could

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you can point to games where you could

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.929 
you can point to games where you could
say<00:01:43.530> maybe<00:01:43.710> our<00:01:43.950> systems<00:01:44.369> broke<00:01:44.700> down<00:01:44.909> a

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
say maybe our systems broke down a

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.490 
say maybe our systems broke down a
little<00:01:45.119> bit<00:01:45.360> or<00:01:45.540> defense<00:01:46.049> didn't<00:01:46.290> play<00:01:46.439> as

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
little bit or defense didn't play as

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.289 
little bit or defense didn't play as
well<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.860> goaltending<00:01:47.280> when<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.490> wasn't<00:01:48.060> what

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
well the goaltending when it wasn't what

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.850 
well the goaltending when it wasn't what
it<00:01:48.329> should<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.960> particular<00:01:49.170> night<00:01:49.680> but

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.319 
it should be that particular night but
to<00:01:49.920> throw<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> rock<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> first<00:01:51.149> day

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329
