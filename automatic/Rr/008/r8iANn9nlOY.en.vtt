00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.910
 antwerp after the first training 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.750
 what are your first impressions to be positive 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.520
 So 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.240
 first time you are going through on anything 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.920
 in terms of athletes that I said before I 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.600
 think this club only one first 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.539
 belonged in second class 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.429
 what does that do with a player like 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.199
 here on the first training and you arrive 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.480
 sees 300 here 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.039
 200 250 cannot add an exact number 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.840
 but that they come here 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.390
 look for an all racing training 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.920
 has one for when you see this you can 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.260
 I expect competition even more 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.760
 so as long as we do our thing and 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.559
 turn at the top and in front of it 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.120
 championship are going to give the feeling to 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.250
 the supporters that we do everything for them 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.859
 then I can 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.780
 then I expect to be packed here 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.660
 that that gives a good feeling for one 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.100
 football and tell something about yourself 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.839
 we of course know you from what 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.129
 to view and to do on the internet 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.559
 reading falls 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.879
 but we know it last year 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.640
 for example, have a very good season 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.900
 shot at at helmond sport 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.600
 indeed last year i have one 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.009
 excellent season that I have 19 times 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.750
 scored 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.229
 now that I have my goal here 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.150
 pick up 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.860
 but that is the case of the me 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.229
 mean dots first and foremost it is fc 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.909
 antwerpen who should promote it and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.650
 the trip did see me a lot of goals 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.330
 that I make about adult day making 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.979
 It is important that we are a first class 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.229
 are going to play football next year 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.180
 and tell something about yourself as 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.590
 as a soccer player type you are one 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.450
 attacking midfielder and one 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.470
 team type number 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.729
 I am number 10 years old , number 10 mine 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.950
 you are going to ask me just like that 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.500
 but my qualities say my game 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.860
 and deal with balls and mine 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.290
 position game to work there I am there 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.820
 I'm good at and it is targeted 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.979
 with me with my you need something now and then 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.560
 have patience me you can 80 85 minutes 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.420
 not on and grandma 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.240
 imball a cross or a village and smith 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.619
 enough so typing that I am sometimes 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.149
 Look, I'll get you gonna nail 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.130
 better by me or trance by 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.980
 me but if that's why I'm standing there 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.600
 sometimes also very early but 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.360
 you probably already have a first one 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.160
 view of what player center is at the moment 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.680
 is you have some other good ones 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.150
 see soccer player sire walking around 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.150
 I think for a first row thing that 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.760
 yet the earlier shooting something or lama 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.900
 not to say the first one first 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.090
 week is always looking cat from the tree 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.709
 then we see that it goes further 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.420
 to which players that have a base 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.420
 have a good basis
