00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
first of all if you've got a combi

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.200 
first of all if you've got a combi
boiler<00:00:31.399> tough<00:00:32.399> luck<00:00:32.669> really<00:00:34.309> you<00:00:35.309> might<00:00:36.090> as

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
boiler tough luck really you might as

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.760 
boiler tough luck really you might as
well<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.460> engineering<00:00:38.460> I'm<00:00:38.730> afraid

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
well just get a engineering I'm afraid

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.860 
well just get a engineering I'm afraid
that's<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.070> complex<00:00:41.520> inside<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.600> could<00:00:42.719> be

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
that's so complex inside it could be

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.840 
that's so complex inside it could be
many<00:00:43.079> things<00:00:43.190> okay<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.370> refers<00:00:44.820> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
many things okay so this refers to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.080 
many things okay so this refers to
really<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.649> domestic<00:00:46.649> heating<00:00:46.800> system<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:47.730> a

first most one the most one it uses is a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.609 
first most one the most one it uses is a
40<00:01:13.409> motorized<00:01:13.830> valve<00:01:14.450> if<00:01:15.450> you've<00:01:15.720> got<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
40 motorized valve if you've got a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.219 
40 motorized valve if you've got a
system<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.369> two<00:01:17.400> motorized<00:01:18.030> valves<00:01:18.570> which<00:01:19.080> a

system with two motorized valves which a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.039 
system with two motorized valves which a
lot<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.680> common<00:01:19.979> systems<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.869> you<00:01:21.869> may

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
lot of common systems do have you may

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.660 
lot of common systems do have you may
find<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.970> valve<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.270> controls<00:01:24.560> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
find that the valve that controls the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.710 
find that the valve that controls the
central<00:01:26.670> heat<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:29.310> fine<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.479> it's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
central heat you know is fine and it's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.469 
central heat you know is fine and it's
running<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> hot<00:01:31.680> water<00:01:31.979> one<00:01:32.310> has<00:01:33.270> gone

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
running but the hot water one has gone

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.929 
running but the hot water one has gone
down<00:01:33.799> and<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.070> check<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.610> by<00:01:35.880> it

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
down and you can check that by it

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.210 
down and you can check that by it
actually<00:01:36.780> there<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> little<00:01:37.470> leaver<00:01:37.860> you

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
actually there is a little leaver you

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.160 
actually there is a little leaver you

but over there and there's our boiler

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.170 
but over there and there's our boiler
and<00:01:49.409> there's<00:01:49.799> our<00:01:49.950> flow<00:01:50.250> going<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.030> ran

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
and there's our flow going up and ran

and there's our flow going up and ran
and<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.840> you've<00:01:51.990> got<00:01:52.079> two<00:01:52.350> motorized<00:01:52.770> valves

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
and if you've got two motorized valves

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.389 
and if you've got two motorized valves
like<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.700> um<00:01:54.560> well<00:01:55.560> they've<00:01:56.009> got<00:01:56.280> little

goes into the cylinder and goes around a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.350 
goes into the cylinder and goes around a
corner<00:02:03.479> comes<00:02:03.840> out

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
corner comes out

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.160 
corner comes out
and<00:02:04.690> it<00:02:05.320> goes<00:02:05.470> back<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.770> your<00:02:05.980> boiler<00:02:06.750> but<00:02:07.750> that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
and it goes back to your boiler but that

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.310 
and it goes back to your boiler but that
that<00:02:08.590> one<00:02:08.860> could<00:02:09.369> be<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.550> 41<00:02:10.180> and<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:10.930> can<00:02:11.080> tell

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
that one could be a 41 and you can tell

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.530 
that one could be a 41 and you can tell
by<00:02:11.530> pulling<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:11.920> lever<00:02:12.250> across<00:02:12.760> manually<00:02:13.360> if

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
by pulling that lever across manually if

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.390 
by pulling that lever across manually if
you<00:02:13.630> put<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:13.900> across<00:02:13.990> manually<00:02:14.740> in<00:02:14.890> your<00:02:15.010> opens

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
you put it across manually in your opens

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.550 
you put it across manually in your opens
up<00:02:15.610> you'll<00:02:16.540> find<00:02:16.810> you'll<00:02:16.960> be<00:02:17.050> able<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.230> get<00:02:17.350> hot

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
up you'll find you'll be able to get hot

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.100 
up you'll find you'll be able to get hot
water<00:02:17.590> again<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:19.300> means<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.660> isn't<00:02:19.810> working

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
water again it means it isn't working

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.170 
water again it means it isn't working
properly<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.580> could<00:02:21.820> well<00:02:21.970> be<00:02:22.030> the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
properly and it could well be the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.240 
properly and it could well be the
cylinder<00:02:22.690> stat<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.320> for<00:02:23.590> not<00:02:23.860> calling

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
cylinder stat and so for not calling

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.940 
cylinder stat and so for not calling
heat<00:02:24.490> for<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.870> could<00:02:26.080> be<00:02:26.230> even<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.650> stat

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
that valve there you can just get a head

that valve there you can just get a head
doing<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.320> for<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.560> right<00:02:38.680> model<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.160> replace

doing it for the right model and replace
it<00:02:39.730> fairly<00:02:40.180> easily<00:02:40.590> okay

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
it fairly easily okay

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.400 
it fairly easily okay
that's<00:02:42.340> genuinely<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.420> main<00:02:43.780> cause<00:02:44.170> if

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
that's genuinely the main cause if

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.800 
that's genuinely the main cause if
you've<00:02:44.590> got<00:02:44.830> motorized<00:02:45.520> batteries<00:02:46.120> generally

you've got motorized batteries generally
most<00:02:47.020> most<00:02:47.890> new<00:02:48.340> modern<00:02:48.730> systems<00:02:49.120> do<00:02:49.300> have<00:02:49.600> and

most most new modern systems do have and
that<00:02:50.230> can<00:02:50.440> be<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.740> problem<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:51.700> say<00:02:51.880> very

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
that can be the problem and I say very

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.500 
that can be the problem and I say very
rarely<00:02:52.540> again<00:02:53.140> may<00:02:53.560> be<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.160> step<00:02:54.510> okay

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
rarely again may be that the step okay

there's<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.150> more<00:02:58.330> modern<00:02:58.630> one<00:02:58.750> but<00:02:59.050> there<00:02:59.620> are

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
there's a more modern one but there are

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.420 
there's a more modern one but there are
some<00:03:00.040> systems<00:03:00.280> around<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:02.200> are<00:03:02.980> very<00:03:03.220> old

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
some systems around that are very old

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.250 
some systems around that are very old
and<00:03:03.910> if<00:03:04.209> you've<00:03:04.360> got<00:03:04.450> one<00:03:04.660> twenty<00:03:05.020> thirty

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
and if you've got one twenty thirty

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.840 
and if you've got one twenty thirty
years<00:03:05.320> old<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.920> doesn't<00:03:06.070> have<00:03:06.220> any<00:03:06.430> motorized

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
years old it doesn't have any motorized

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.100 
years old it doesn't have any motorized
valves<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.620> relies<00:03:08.950> on<00:03:09.010> gravity<00:03:09.459> to

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
valves and it relies on gravity to

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.440 
valves and it relies on gravity to
circulate<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.230> hot<00:03:11.380> water<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:13.000> if<00:03:13.209> you've<00:03:13.330> got

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
circulate the hot water so if you've got

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.240 
circulate the hot water so if you've got
this<00:03:13.600> type<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:13.900> system<00:03:14.380> this<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.709> what<00:03:14.890> can

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
this type of system this is what can

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.240 
this type of system this is what can
quite<00:03:15.610> commonly<00:03:16.030> happen<00:03:16.510> um<00:03:16.890> if<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.040> show<00:03:18.220> you

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
quite commonly happen um if I show you

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.680 
quite commonly happen um if I show you
this<00:03:18.370> drawing<00:03:19.320> you'll<00:03:20.320> see<00:03:20.620> here<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.690> here

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
this drawing you'll see here that here

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.140 
this drawing you'll see here that here
we've<00:03:22.840> got<00:03:22.930> our<00:03:22.989> boil<00:03:23.380> up<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.709> quite<00:03:24.400> often<00:03:24.580> in

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
we've got our boil up and quite often in

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.000 
we've got our boil up and quite often in
this<00:03:25.390> is<00:03:25.540> my<00:03:25.690> house<00:03:25.930> actually<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:26.620> is<00:03:26.769> this

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
this is my house actually this is this

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.840 
this is my house actually this is this
is<00:03:27.190> our<00:03:27.430> good<00:03:27.640> gravity<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.930> flow<00:03:29.140> goes<00:03:29.440> up

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
is our good gravity and the flow goes up

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.460 
is our good gravity and the flow goes up
and<00:03:30.850> it<00:03:31.150> goes<00:03:31.180> across<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.750> top<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.230> loft

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
and it goes across the top of the loft

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.400 
and it goes across the top of the loft
like<00:03:33.130> this<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.760> drops<00:03:34.000> down<00:03:34.290> into<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
like this and drops down into the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.490 
like this and drops down into the
cylinder<00:03:35.820> now<00:03:36.820> I<00:03:36.850> mean<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.300> can<00:03:37.840> go<00:03:38.110> up<00:03:38.320> and

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
cylinder now I mean it can go up and

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.170 
cylinder now I mean it can go up and
still<00:03:38.769> cut<00:03:39.040> across<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.550> not<00:03:39.670> have<00:03:39.820> too<00:03:40.000> much

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
still cut across and not have too much

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.330 
still cut across and not have too much
here<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.630> get<00:03:40.750> into<00:03:41.019> the<00:03:41.110> cylinder<00:03:41.530> there<00:03:41.709> into

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
here to get into the cylinder there into

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.949 
here to get into the cylinder there into
the<00:03:42.430> flow<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:42.880> then<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.180> oddity<00:03:43.570> to<00:03:43.600> return

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
the flow and then the oddity to return

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.630 
the flow and then the oddity to return
comes<00:03:44.260> down<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.620> goes<00:03:44.709> back<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.280> boiler

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
comes down and goes back to the boiler

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.729 
comes down and goes back to the boiler
but<00:03:46.600> what<00:03:46.870> can<00:03:47.110> happen<00:03:47.290> over<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.709> summer

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
but what can happen over the summer

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.759 
but what can happen over the summer
period<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:49.060> this<00:03:49.209> little<00:03:49.570> F<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.870> E<00:03:49.959> tank<00:03:50.350> in

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
period is this little F and E tank in

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.190 
period is this little F and E tank in
your<00:03:50.830> loft<00:03:51.250> space<00:03:51.550> I've<00:03:52.269> drawn<00:03:52.540> as<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.989> loft

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
your loft space I've drawn as the loft

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
your loft space I've drawn as the loft
space<00:03:53.350> um<00:03:54.390> that<00:03:55.390> bull<00:03:55.989> cocking<00:03:56.440> near<00:03:56.650> can<00:03:56.950> jam

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
space um that bull cocking near can jam

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.120 
space um that bull cocking near can jam
up<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:58.239> jams<00:03:58.600> up<00:03:58.870> over<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.530> summer<00:03:59.800> period

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
up that jams up over the summer period

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.500 
up that jams up over the summer period
because<00:04:00.519> it's<00:04:00.640> not<00:04:00.790> feeling<00:04:01.120> much<00:04:01.299> because

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
because it's not feeling much because

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.820 
because it's not feeling much because
you're<00:04:01.600> not<00:04:01.750> using<00:04:02.019> your<00:04:02.260> heat<00:04:02.440> or<00:04:02.680> anything

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
you're not using your heat or anything

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.430 
you're not using your heat or anything
so<00:04:03.160> that's<00:04:03.280> got<00:04:03.489> no<00:04:03.670> expansion<00:04:04.239> to<00:04:04.360> take<00:04:04.570> up<00:04:04.780> it

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
so that's got no expansion to take up it

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.590 
so that's got no expansion to take up it
can<00:04:05.680> stick<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.760> then<00:04:06.880> that<00:04:07.030> water<00:04:07.209> level

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
can stick and then that water level

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.110 
can stick and then that water level
drops<00:04:07.840> away<00:04:08.019> and<00:04:08.530> gradually<00:04:09.519> for<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.850> summer

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
drops away and gradually for the summer

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.870 
drops away and gradually for the summer
um<00:04:10.660> it<00:04:11.110> back<00:04:11.350> rates<00:04:11.590> away<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.340> your<00:04:12.550> boil<00:04:12.790> is

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
um it back rates away and your boil is

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.980 
um it back rates away and your boil is
still<00:04:13.060> probably<00:04:13.270> going<00:04:13.510> for<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.810> hot<00:04:13.959> water

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
still probably going for the hot water

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.550 
still probably going for the hot water
so<00:04:14.740> you<00:04:14.920> are<00:04:15.040> using<00:04:15.459> some<00:04:15.640> evaporate

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
so you are using some evaporate

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.560 
so you are using some evaporate
well<00:04:17.100> eventually<00:04:17.520> the<00:04:17.880> water<00:04:18.060> level<00:04:18.360> drops

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
well eventually the water level drops

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.960 
well eventually the water level drops
down<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:19.050> down<00:04:19.200> to<00:04:19.890> it<00:04:20.010> dropped<00:04:20.220> below<00:04:20.460> here

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
down and down to it dropped below here

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.960 
down and down to it dropped below here
and<00:04:21.270> in<00:04:21.690> here<00:04:21.990> is<00:04:22.620> in<00:04:22.860> allowed<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.310> enter<00:04:23.490> here

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
and in here is in allowed to enter here

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.630 
and in here is in allowed to enter here
and<00:04:24.900> once<00:04:25.080> you've<00:04:25.200> got<00:04:25.350> that<00:04:25.500> in<00:04:25.650> there<00:04:25.890> your

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
and once you've got that in there your

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.690 
and once you've got that in there your
whole<00:04:26.790> was<00:04:27.240> stopped<00:04:27.540> dead<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:29.010> you<00:04:29.550> may

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
whole was stopped dead and and you may

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.550 
whole was stopped dead and and you may
find<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.210> some<00:04:30.630> of<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.810> rats<00:04:31.020> are<00:04:31.170> still<00:04:31.320> go

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
find that some of the rats are still go

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.870 
find that some of the rats are still go
because<00:04:31.890> they're<00:04:32.070> on<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.220> bottom<00:04:32.580> level

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
because they're on a bottom level

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.550 
because they're on a bottom level
they're<00:04:33.060> lower<00:04:33.270> they're<00:04:33.630> on<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.870> on<00:04:34.260> the

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
they're lower they're on the on the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.830 
they're lower they're on the on the
floor<00:04:34.800> level<00:04:35.010> if<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:35.340> like<00:04:35.540> and<00:04:36.540> they<00:04:36.660> may

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
floor level if you like and they may

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.110 
floor level if you like and they may
still<00:04:37.170> keep<00:04:37.410> going<00:04:37.830> because<00:04:38.550> they've<00:04:38.820> got<00:04:38.940> war

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
still keep going because they've got war

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.730 
still keep going because they've got war
in<00:04:39.300> them<00:04:39.420> but<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.780> would<00:04:39.900> definitely<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:40.350> hot

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
in them but you would definitely a hot

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.100 
in them but you would definitely a hot
wall<00:04:40.920> of<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.340> of<00:04:41.520> grinding<00:04:41.940> halt<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.900> this

move<00:05:10.020> up<00:05:10.200> and<00:05:10.350> down<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:11.250> it<00:05:11.400> will<00:05:11.490> crack<00:05:11.880> and

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
move up and down and it will crack and

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.000 
move up and down and it will crack and
gradu<00:05:12.660> dog<00:05:12.900> will<00:05:13.140> start<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.500> pour<00:05:13.650> back<00:05:13.830> in

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
gradu dog will start to pour back in

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.330 
gradu dog will start to pour back in
again<00:05:14.220> make<00:05:14.880> sure<00:05:15.060> it<00:05:15.180> shuts<00:05:15.420> off<00:05:15.600> okay<00:05:15.810> and<00:05:16.340> if

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
again make sure it shuts off okay and if

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.550 
again make sure it shuts off okay and if
in<00:05:17.520> doubt<00:05:17.730> we'll<00:05:18.090> put<00:05:18.690> a<00:05:18.720> new<00:05:18.870> ball<00:05:19.080> valve<00:05:19.350> in

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
in doubt we'll put a new ball valve in

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.100 
in doubt we'll put a new ball valve in
there<00:05:19.710> not<00:05:19.890> much<00:05:20.130> money<00:05:20.430> anyway<00:05:20.840> if<00:05:21.840> you<00:05:21.990> wanna

there not much money anyway if you wanna

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.420 
there not much money anyway if you wanna
be<00:05:22.200> safe<00:05:22.440> than<00:05:22.620> sorry<00:05:22.650> and<00:05:22.980> it<00:05:23.190> might<00:05:23.310> happen

be safe than sorry and it might happen

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.490 
be safe than sorry and it might happen
again<00:05:23.640> in<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.090> future<00:05:24.330> be<00:05:25.080> near<00:05:25.230> the<00:05:25.320> ball

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
again in the future be near the ball

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.570 
again in the future be near the ball
valve<00:05:25.770> and<00:05:25.920> you<00:05:26.040> know<00:05:26.190> you've<00:05:26.370> got<00:05:26.400> that

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
valve and you know you've got that

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.650 
valve and you know you've got that
problem<00:05:26.940> sorry
