is air in the tire it will hold there
and<00:00:53.640> won't<00:00:53.879> escape<00:00:54.149> because<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.350> bunch<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
and won't escape because of a bunch of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.470 
and won't escape because of a bunch of
debris<00:00:56.280> that's<00:00:56.640> stuck<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.090> between<00:00:57.210> the

surface right here I only did this on
this<00:01:00.570> side<00:01:00.930> because<00:01:01.530> as<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.619> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619

other side of the tire it's still the
beads<00:01:08.820> still<00:01:09.390> seated<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.760> before<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:12.000> this

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
beads still seated so before you do this

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.149 
beads still seated so before you do this
you<00:01:12.360> want<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.600> check<00:01:12.930> both<00:01:13.350> sides<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> tire

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
both sides of the wheel and everything

I've got the ratchet strap on here now
force<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.280> tire<00:01:38.909> out<00:01:39.240> quite<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> bit<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.110> than

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
force the tire out quite a bit more than

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.550 
force the tire out quite a bit more than
it<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.650> up<00:01:41.579> against<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.270> beat<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.380> wheel

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560

it was up against the beat of the wheel
right<00:01:43.829> there<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:45.229> just<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.680> feeling

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
this isn't gonna work but uh we'll try

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
this isn't gonna work but uh we'll try
it<00:01:48.930> anyways<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:50.040> doesn't<00:01:50.310> work<00:01:50.399> we'll<00:01:50.700> go

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.550 
it anyways and it doesn't work we'll go
on<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> second<00:01:51.390> method<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:55.290> we've<00:01:55.409> got<00:01:55.530> a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
on to the second method so we've got a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.190 
on to the second method so we've got a
line<00:01:55.829> running<00:01:56.130> from<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.490> compressor<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.299> try

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
line running from the compressor to try

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.060 
line running from the compressor to try
to<00:01:58.259> pump<00:01:58.530> air<00:01:58.799> into<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.219> right<00:01:59.520> here<00:02:01.070> reason

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
to pump air into this right here reason

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.380 
to pump air into this right here reason
I'm<00:02:02.189> doing<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.700> because<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.360> a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
I'm doing this is because I have a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.200 
I'm doing this is because I have a
really<00:02:03.780> small<00:02:04.049> compressor<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.119> doesn't<00:02:06.119> put

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
really small compressor and doesn't put

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.359 
really small compressor and doesn't put
out<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.450> volume<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.810> need<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.140> pop<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.220> bead

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
out the volume I need to pop the bead

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.280 
out the volume I need to pop the bead
back<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.849> by<00:02:09.060> itself

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
back on by itself

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.690 
back on by itself
so<00:02:11.500> here<00:02:12.219> we<00:02:12.310> go<00:02:13.530> try<00:02:14.530> just<00:02:14.860> gonna<00:02:15.310> hold<00:02:15.519> down

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
so here we go try just gonna hold down

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.259 
so here we go try just gonna hold down
on<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.719> trigger<00:02:17.650> for<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.040> pretty<00:02:18.879> air<00:02:19.060> right

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
on the trigger for the pretty air right

on the trigger for the pretty air right
here<00:02:19.510> keep<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.409> air<00:02:20.500> constantly<00:02:21.010> flowing<00:02:21.280> in

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
here keep the air constantly flowing in

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.250 
here keep the air constantly flowing in
and<00:02:21.700> try<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:21.879> work<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.269> beat<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.689> back<00:02:22.900> so

fill it up to a pressure and put it back
on<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.160> tractor<00:03:27.220> I've<00:03:28.220> tried<00:03:28.520> this<00:03:28.700> method

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
on the tractor I've tried this method

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.100 
on the tractor I've tried this method
several<00:03:29.420> times<00:03:29.600> before<00:03:30.040> with<00:03:31.040> both<00:03:31.700> beads

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
several times before with both beads

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.220 
several times before with both beads
separated<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:34.420> hasn't<00:03:35.420> quite<00:03:35.780> worked<00:03:35.840> out

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
separated and hasn't quite worked out

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.960 
separated and hasn't quite worked out
for<00:03:36.440> me<00:03:36.470> so<00:03:36.800> I<00:03:36.830> wasn't<00:03:37.190> expecting<00:03:37.610> it<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.820> this

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
for me so I wasn't expecting it to this

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.410 
for me so I wasn't expecting it to this
time<00:03:38.300> but<00:03:38.690> uh<00:03:40.060> there<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.180> go<00:03:41.330> if<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.660> uh<00:03:43.420> you

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
time but uh there you go if you uh you

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.600 
time but uh there you go if you uh you
only<00:03:44.600> have<00:03:44.780> one<00:03:45.080> bead<00:03:45.290> that's<00:03:45.470> off<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:46.100> guess

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
only have one bead that's off I guess

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.060 
only have one bead that's off I guess
this<00:03:46.790> method<00:03:47.150> should<00:03:47.410> work<00:03:48.410> pretty<00:03:48.739> good<00:03:51.070> I'm

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
this method should work pretty good I'm

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.199 
this method should work pretty good I'm
not<00:03:52.160> even<00:03:52.459> going<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.610> tell<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:52.910> about<00:03:53.000> the

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
not even going to tell you about the

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.610 
not even going to tell you about the
other<00:03:53.360> method<00:03:53.780> because<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.080> don't<00:03:54.380> really

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
other method because I don't really

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.260 
other method because I don't really
recommend<00:03:54.830> it<00:03:55.510> all<00:03:56.510> I'll<00:03:56.750> say<00:03:57.050> is<00:03:57.080> uh

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
recommend it all I'll say is uh

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.770 
recommend it all I'll say is uh
you<00:03:59.270> can<00:03:59.390> look<00:03:59.540> it<00:03:59.660> up<00:03:59.750> on<00:03:59.930> YouTube<00:04:00.350> so
