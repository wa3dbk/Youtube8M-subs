 Hello hello my name is is dark and 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.139
 this is what is giving what to talk about 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.139
 on social networks 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.900
 in social networks a video circulates 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.720
 recorded in the streets of the center of 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.480
 Guadalajara where a pedestrian is observed 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.790
 that in a very particular way he tries 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.800
 educate motorists who 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.800
 obviously lack good culture 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.280
 the drivers that appear in the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.590
 recording they stop before the red light 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.420
 but does not respect the pedestrian lines 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.060
 where people must cross 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.650
 streets so the young man is planted 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.780
 in front of these and ask them to 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.640
 preventing step back continue 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.660
 circulating until they allow free 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.660
 transit through this area 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.150
 one of the motorists does not react 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.310
 in a very tolerant way it sounds 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.369
 insistently the horn so that this one 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.830
 move and let him pass and even you 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.930
 throws up the car however the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.930
 man endures and gets his job 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.710
 this action on the part of the drivers 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.750
 It is very common in the metropolitan area of 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.700
 guadalajara so constantly 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.920
 pedestrians must fight the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.080
 vehicles to cross the roads or 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.030
 flat out expect another red light 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.209
 get back on so you can go through 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.489
 for the right place and you how much
