00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.270
 hey ho people and welcome to 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.630

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.230
 I'll introduce you a skywalk today 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.259
 network before 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:31.890
 that means a server on the iris bell 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:37.290
 You can play and it works 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:40.160
 right away we are here 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.719
 on sky party 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.399
 that's the ip and I want that one 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.399
 server because I do not 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.480
 pretty great 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.100
 maybe even great together 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.230
 tasks in there 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.460
 In any case , there is a lot here 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.559
 to see 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.710
 that here is that born if that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.030
 new time you start there on the front 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.159
 island there's a little tutorial up 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.500
 Pentecost ends up here as far as I am concerned 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.090
 the White 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.869
 and then there are just different 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.409
 Command with those you almost there 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.299
 is where you want to aim at their coming 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.549
 I say 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:31.500
 We'll start with that right away 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:34.140
 first command and it is this one here 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.380
 now i have my own island 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.720
 as far as I know now I watch if I too 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.450
 You can find out here it is here 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.049
 now my completely own island 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:51.390
 this time as well from just everything you 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.630
 great for sky blog needs one 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.430
 bit of a wood 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.329
 sarah a little water stops him 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.090
 stones to regenerate a cactus no 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.490
 pig to eat there are flowers wheat 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.870
 oven crafting box and maybe yes 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.910
 something else in the box 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.270
 I'll check it out I do not know 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.870
 is necessary there is no further 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.550
 surprise and the food 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.530
 I watch you mal ne crate than what 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.500
 in there and the food would like to escape 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.860
 I hope that stays on the island but 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.140
 I think so is very nice 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.640
 I think I'm starting island here 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.540
 and then you can just go out there 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.920
 build things that you wish that 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.590
 you still imagine me at the same time 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.580
 a few really good sky blog 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.800
 islands 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.700
 I think it should be clear to everyone 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.850
 of you what glock is that means 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.900
 just as much as the game what for 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.020
 youtuber times played pvp i believe is 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.090
 that's just pvp in addition 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.580
 gave and this is just here 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.290
 mainly to build maybe 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.170
 yes sometime again the pvp 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.320
 aspect with inserted so now we look 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.320
 give us a few good islands 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.480
 okay we have to do it I do not believe it 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:28.640
 Enter exactly this in advance 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.840
 is for example a right one right 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.500
 Heavy sky blog island 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.570
 Of course she does not see now 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.220
 absolutely beautiful but I can 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.959
 quite imagine that they are very very 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.370
 we can be productive again 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.980
 go up that interests me now 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.040
 simply times where I believe I there monster 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.690
 I'm interested in driving something 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.100
 Here is quite a bit high I know 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.720
 not if you get up there but me 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.940
 think a shield that of course 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.730
 annoying I actually thought I had 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:09.030
 still so i actually thought i had 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.590
 another fly fashion from my god 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.080
 But that was not the case 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.120
 Okay, let's have a look again 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:23.250
 others to that is very much 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:32.030
 productive ok that does not exist but he is 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:32.030
 even then we are going to be now 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.520
 that even relatively big or the 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:53.750
 island is already quite big as well 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:55.280
 You see a champion as well as one 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.960
 Victim 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:03.030
 Here's where a medicine sits well now 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.760
 I want to show you and the job 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.100
 we just server there is a job there 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.830
 opens the start menu there you can 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.330
 stop just once at something it here 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.130
 with chance and cell 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.260
 I'll take a look at what's up 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:21.290
 So I hope that's what I think 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:24.630
 simple and very general 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.640
 Keep information here balance like that 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.180
 So in general , how much do you see? 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:35.070
 money you have here this can 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.690
 then here can sell in things and 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.850
 here you can buy 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:48.120
 this is again below each part 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:50.690
 the shop menu is pretty we do 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.690
 to drive 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.790
 ok the command is not there very much 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:05.170
 Interestingly interesting we do 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:09.510
 we go again we need to save 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:12.310
 wait a bit I think okay 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:18.700
 here there is again the 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:21.040
 information for the premium rank and 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.960
 yes, you can actually do the rest 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.680
 I would like to find out for myself, of course 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.970
 do not anticipate everything 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.990
 you know how to make an island 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.610
 you know how the shop works who 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:38.620
 actually needs for the beginning 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.910
 here not only the noise more for 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.650
 actually not at the beginning 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.720
 knowledge 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.210
 then I would be glad if you the 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:50.530
 like server imagination has let 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:56.610
 but a positive rating since the 1.8 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:56.610
 is lady and dungeons next video
