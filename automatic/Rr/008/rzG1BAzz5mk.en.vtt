to talk about is the racket hot so
should<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.210> racket<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.930> same<00:00:25.170> height<00:00:25.740> as

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
should the racket be the same height as

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.099 
should the racket be the same height as
a<00:00:26.010> ball<00:00:26.369> or<00:00:26.670> should<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.180> lower<00:00:27.630> than<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
a ball or should it be lower than the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.480 
a ball or should it be lower than the
ball<00:00:28.349> that's<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> question<00:00:29.279> we've<00:00:29.460> been

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
ball that's the question we've been

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.009 
ball that's the question we've been
asked<00:00:29.939> what<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.210> make<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.539> question

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
asked what do you make of that question

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.620 
asked what do you make of that question
alloys<00:00:31.470> yes<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.579> what<00:00:33.149> we're<00:00:33.300> talking<00:00:33.420> about

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
alloys yes so what we're talking about

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.020 
alloys yes so what we're talking about
here<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.040> racket<00:00:35.399> height<00:00:35.610> as

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
here is just the the racket height as

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.970 
here is just the the racket height as
you're<00:00:36.390> hitting<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.809> ball<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.260> if<00:00:37.559> you're

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
you're hitting the ball so if you're

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.260 
you're hitting the ball so if you're
going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.370> play<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.960> topspin<00:00:39.960> stroke<00:00:40.489> then<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
going to play a topspin stroke then the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.060 
going to play a topspin stroke then the
bat<00:00:42.780> needs<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> little<00:00:43.500> bit<00:00:43.649> below<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
bat needs to be a little bit below the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.430 
bat needs to be a little bit below the
ball<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.969> come<00:00:45.210> up<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> ball<00:00:46.230> that

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
ball so you can come up on the ball that

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.880 
ball so you can come up on the ball that
way<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:47.370> you're<00:00:47.820> playing<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.680> backspin<00:00:49.680> stroke

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
way if you're playing a backspin stroke

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.920 
way if you're playing a backspin stroke
then<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.520> start<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.879> little<00:00:51.030> bit<00:00:51.270> above

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
then you can start a little bit above

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.369 
then you can start a little bit above
the<00:00:51.989> ball<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.829> come<00:00:53.640> down<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.539> generate<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the ball and come down to generate the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.340 
the ball and come down to generate the
backspin<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.190> maybe<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> serve<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:58.109> what

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
backspin and maybe for a serve is what

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.340 
backspin and maybe for a serve is what
she<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.620> talking<00:00:58.920> about<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.960> best<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
she was talking about is so it's best to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.869 
she was talking about is so it's best to
just<00:01:01.440> start<00:01:01.859> either<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.520> little<00:01:02.760> bit

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
just start either just a little bit

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.299 
just start either just a little bit
above<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:04.080> ball<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.739> come<00:01:04.949> down<00:01:04.979> on

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
above the ball so you can come down on

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.730 
above the ball so you can come down on
it<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.760> way<00:01:05.909> or<00:01:06.150> behind<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.290> balls<00:01:07.500> here

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it that way or behind the balls here

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.609 
it that way or behind the balls here
come<00:01:07.979> flat<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.000> into<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> ball<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.260> way<00:01:10.439> as

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
come flat and into the ball that way as

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.969 
come flat and into the ball that way as
well<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:12.390> depends<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.200> type<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> spin

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
well so so depends on the type of spin

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.719 
well so so depends on the type of spin
that<00:01:14.130> you're<00:01:14.310> trying<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> produce<00:01:15.710> is<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:17.280> what

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
that you're trying to produce is is what

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.429 
that you're trying to produce is is what
you're<00:01:17.970> trying<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.540> aware<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.080> with<00:01:19.320> your

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
you're trying to aware you with your

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.530 
you're trying to aware you with your
racket<00:01:19.619> starts<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.520> relation<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> ball

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
racket starts in relation to the ball

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:32.180 
racket starts in relation to the ball
okay<00:01:22.909> very<00:01:23.909> good

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.190 

currently<00:01:32.610> answering<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.390> question<00:01:33.720> I'm

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
currently answering that question I'm

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.690 
currently answering that question I'm
just<00:01:34.260> looking<00:01:34.590> at<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> google<00:01:35.070> apps<00:01:35.250> feature

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
just looking at the google apps feature

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.010 
just looking at the google apps feature
here<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> little<00:01:36.420> feature<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.840> this

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
here so the little feature on this

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.310 
here so the little feature on this
Google<00:01:37.920> Hangouts<00:01:38.250> allows<00:01:38.670> where<00:01:38.940> you<00:01:39.090> can

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
Google Hangouts allows where you can

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.600 
Google Hangouts allows where you can
specify<00:01:40.320> which<00:01:40.770> question<00:01:41.220> you're<00:01:41.340> entering

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
so I was just a little bit distracted

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.430 
so I was just a little bit distracted

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
there okay that goes all right so

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.600 
there okay that goes all right so
another<00:01:47.310> question<00:01:47.730> we<00:01:47.850> have<00:01:47.880> Alice<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.750> about

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
another question we have Alice is about

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.720 
another question we have Alice is about
forehand<00:01:50.610> problem<00:01:51.480> and<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:53.070> question<00:01:53.190> is<00:01:53.550> I

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
forehand problem and the question is I

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.430 
forehand problem and the question is I
can't<00:01:54.150> get<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.420> ball<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> table<00:01:55.050> while

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
can't get the ball on the table while

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.230 
can't get the ball on the table while
playing<00:01:55.650> it<00:01:55.830> for<00:01:56.010> head<00:01:56.160> it<00:01:56.280> always<00:01:56.430> goes<00:01:56.940> long

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
playing it for head it always goes long

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.280 
playing it for head it always goes long
and<00:01:57.510> misses<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> table<00:01:58.620> what<00:01:59.130> should<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.700> do

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
and misses the table what should I do

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.830 
and misses the table what should I do
yeah<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.370> the<00:02:02.760> natural<00:02:03.270> cure<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
yeah so the the natural cure for the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.990 
yeah so the the natural cure for the
ball<00:02:04.050> was<00:02:04.230> going<00:02:04.440> long<00:02:04.830> is<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.640> put<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> little

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
ball was going long is to put a little

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.150 
ball was going long is to put a little
bit<00:02:06.180> more<00:02:06.240> topspin<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> ball<00:02:07.230> so<00:02:07.710> if

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
bit more topspin on the ball so if

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.280 
bit more topspin on the ball so if
you're<00:02:08.490> if<00:02:08.910> you're<00:02:09.450> hitting<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> ball<00:02:10.050> too

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
you're if you're hitting the ball too

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.280 
you're if you're hitting the ball too
flat<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:11.190> too<00:02:11.970> fast<00:02:12.330> then<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> balls<00:02:13.050> gonna

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
flat and too fast then the balls gonna

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.580 
flat and too fast then the balls gonna
tend<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.710> go<00:02:13.890> out<00:02:14.190> past<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.330> table<00:02:15.720> if<00:02:16.110> you

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
tend to go out past the table if you

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.020 
tend to go out past the table if you
start<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.980> put<00:02:17.160> just<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.430> little<00:02:17.460> bit<00:02:17.910> of

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
start to put just a little bit of

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.900 
start to put just a little bit of
topspin<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.660> ball<00:02:18.780> then<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:20.160> topspin<00:02:20.730> is

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
topspin on the ball then the topspin is

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.110 
topspin on the ball then the topspin is
going<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.390> drag<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.710> ball<00:02:22.860> down<00:02:23.280> onto<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
going to drag the ball down onto the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.540 
going to drag the ball down onto the
table<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.720> that's<00:02:24.900> probably<00:02:25.370> one<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
table so that's probably one of the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.310 
table so that's probably one of the
things<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.970> can<00:02:27.120> look<00:02:27.300> at<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:28.200> other

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
things that you can look at the other

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.500 
things that you can look at the other
thing<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.680> also<00:02:29.280> just<00:02:29.490> adjusting<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.300> angle

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
thing is also just adjusting the angle

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.190 
thing is also just adjusting the angle
of<00:02:30.720> your<00:02:30.750> bat<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.500> could<00:02:31.680> be<00:02:31.890> as<00:02:32.010> simple<00:02:32.250> as

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
of your bat so it could be as simple as

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.420 
of your bat so it could be as simple as
instead<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.290> your<00:02:34.410> back<00:02:34.560> being<00:02:34.830> at<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.250> angle

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
instead of your back being at that angle

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.240 
instead of your back being at that angle
just<00:02:35.760> turn<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.330> down<00:02:36.600> forward<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.500> fraction<00:02:38.100> and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
just turn it down forward a fraction and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.040 
just turn it down forward a fraction and
play<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.060> same<00:02:39.270> stroke<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.690> you're<00:02:39.840> playing

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
play the same stroke that you're playing

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.080 
play the same stroke that you're playing
at<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.230> moment<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.650> maybe<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.370> will<00:02:41.550> will

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
at the moment and maybe that will will

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.010 
at the moment and maybe that will will
cure<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.480> problem

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
cure the problem

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.630 
cure the problem
always<00:02:43.980> remember<00:02:44.310> though<00:02:44.400> with<00:02:44.520> your

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
always remember though with your

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.120 
always remember though with your
forehand<00:02:45.030> stroke<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.660> get<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.650> back<00:02:46.830> coming

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
forehand stroke to get that back coming

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.610 
forehand stroke to get that back coming
up<00:02:47.310> towards<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:48.420> eyebrow<00:02:50.209> okay<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:52.230> yes<00:02:52.470> a

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
up towards that eyebrow okay so yes a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.930 
up towards that eyebrow okay so yes a
really<00:02:52.830> topspin<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.610> key<00:02:54.200> yes

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
really topspin is the key yes

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.229 
really topspin is the key yes
okay<00:02:57.170> great<00:02:58.170> now<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:58.980> Hill<00:02:59.220> has<00:02:59.430> also<00:02:59.610> asked<00:03:00.150> us

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
okay great now so Hill has also asked us

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.170 
okay great now so Hill has also asked us
a<00:03:00.300> question<00:03:00.420> about<00:03:01.290> how<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.860> control<00:03:02.610> that's

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
a question about how to control that's

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.350 
a question about how to control that's
the<00:03:03.330> title<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:03.989> so<00:03:04.200> he's<00:03:04.860> gonna<00:03:05.100> back<00:03:05.459> with

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
the title of it so he's gonna back with

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.460 
the title of it so he's gonna back with
some<00:03:06.540> rubber<00:03:06.720> on<00:03:06.840> it

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
some rubber on it

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.610 
some rubber on it
finger<00:03:08.160> daanyik<00:03:08.760> copper<00:03:09.209> Jo<00:03:09.480> gold<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.350> some

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
finger daanyik copper Jo gold and some

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.890 
finger daanyik copper Jo gold and some
my<00:03:10.769> father<00:03:11.070> on<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.250> backend<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:12.360> he<00:03:12.450> can't

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
my father on the backend but he can't

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.590 
my father on the backend but he can't
control<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.800> ball<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.519> his<00:03:15.120> question<00:03:15.300> is

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
control the ball so his question is

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.190 
control the ball so his question is
should<00:03:16.110> he<00:03:16.290> change<00:03:16.530> his<00:03:16.709> bat<00:03:17.209> yeah<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:19.050> think

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
should he change his bat yeah I think

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.220 
should he change his bat yeah I think
he's<00:03:19.440> also<00:03:19.590> got<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.970> defensive<00:03:20.970> blade<00:03:21.810> as<00:03:22.019> well

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
he's also got a defensive blade as well

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.150 
he's also got a defensive blade as well
there<00:03:22.890> he<00:03:23.190> does<00:03:23.430> yes<00:03:23.760> it's<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.090> sonic<00:03:24.480> person

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
there he does yes it's a sonic person

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.420 
there he does yes it's a sonic person
exclusivo<00:03:26.160> fancies<00:03:26.700> yeah<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.709> this<00:03:28.890> is<00:03:29.310> a

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
exclusivo fancies yeah so this this is a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.220 
exclusivo fancies yeah so this this is a
problem<00:03:29.790> we<00:03:29.940> often<00:03:30.239> find<00:03:30.660> with<00:03:30.840> players<00:03:31.110> and

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
problem we often find with players and

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.290 
problem we often find with players and
it's<00:03:31.440> really<00:03:31.650> natural<00:03:31.920> when<00:03:32.550> we<00:03:32.700> start<00:03:33.120> to

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
it's really natural when we start to

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.100 
it's really natural when we start to
play<00:03:33.480> we<00:03:33.690> want<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.230> get<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.970> good<00:03:35.970> bat<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:36.720> it's

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
play we want to get a good bat and it's

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.380 
play we want to get a good bat and it's
getting<00:03:37.500> really<00:03:37.620> difficult<00:03:38.209> when<00:03:39.209> you're

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
getting really difficult when you're

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.720 
getting really difficult when you're
starting<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:40.019> work<00:03:40.230> out<00:03:40.470> what<00:03:41.100> is<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> good<00:03:41.520> bet

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
starting to work out what is a good bet

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.840 
starting to work out what is a good bet
I<00:03:41.910> mean<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.240> look<00:03:42.510> at<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.660> bat<00:03:42.960> that's<00:03:43.230> no<00:03:43.850> $200

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
I mean you look at a bat that's no $200

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.070 
I mean you look at a bat that's no $200
I<00:03:44.880> think<00:03:44.940> fantastic

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
I think fantastic

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.350 
I think fantastic
is<00:03:46.110> going<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.320> be<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.500> one<00:03:46.650> for<00:03:46.680> me<00:03:46.890> but<00:03:47.360> often

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
is going to be the one for me but often

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.580 
is going to be the one for me but often
when<00:03:48.540> you're<00:03:48.660> starting<00:03:48.990> it's<00:03:49.290> really

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
when you're starting it's really

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.540 
when you're starting it's really
important<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.160> start<00:03:50.370> with<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.870> lower<00:03:52.550> speed

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
important to start with a lower speed

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.090 
important to start with a lower speed
bat<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.240> a<00:03:54.300> bat<00:03:54.480> with<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.660> bit<00:03:54.840> more<00:03:54.870> control<00:03:55.590> so

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
bat and a bat with a bit more control so

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.600 
bat and a bat with a bit more control so
if<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.380> it<00:03:58.380> sounds<00:03:58.890> like<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.250> bat<00:03:59.430> that

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
if you it sounds like the bat that

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.370

hopefully as you progress that's bad

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.150 
hopefully as you progress that's bad
that<00:04:12.300> you<00:04:12.450> will<00:04:12.690> be<00:04:12.840> able<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.200> use<00:04:13.470> down<00:04:13.950> the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
that you will be able to use down the

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.090 
that you will be able to use down the
track<00:04:14.460> the<00:04:15.330> bat<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.660> we<00:04:15.840> recommend<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.890> start

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
track the bat that we recommend to start

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.949 
track the bat that we recommend to start
off<00:04:17.220> with<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.880> ping<00:04:18.209> skills<00:04:18.510> rook<00:04:18.780> which

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
off with is the ping skills rook which

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.760 
off with is the ping skills rook which
is<00:04:19.080> just<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.410> good<00:04:20.130> control<00:04:20.580> bat<00:04:20.850> but<00:04:21.299> it<00:04:21.420> has

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
is just a good control bat but it has

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.140 
is just a good control bat but it has
reasonable<00:04:22.770> quality<00:04:23.160> rubber<00:04:23.400> on<00:04:23.670> it<00:04:23.700> as<00:04:23.940> well

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
reasonable quality rubber on it as well

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.270 
reasonable quality rubber on it as well
so<00:04:24.420> you'd<00:04:24.930> still<00:04:25.170> want<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.380> have<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.560> bat<00:04:25.830> that

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
so you'd still want to have a bat that

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.300 
so you'd still want to have a bat that
you<00:04:27.120> can<00:04:27.300> get<00:04:27.480> a<00:04:27.510> bit<00:04:27.750> of<00:04:27.840> firm<00:04:28.200> grip<00:04:28.920> and<00:04:28.980> bit

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
you can get a bit of firm grip and bit

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.030 
you can get a bit of firm grip and bit
of<00:04:29.400> spin<00:04:29.700> on<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:30.000> ball<00:04:30.120> but<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:31.110> bet<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.830> you

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
of spin on the ball but the bet that you

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.040 
of spin on the ball but the bet that you
have<00:04:32.360> bought<00:04:33.360> for<00:04:33.540> yourself

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
have bought for yourself

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.920 
have bought for yourself
I<00:04:34.110> think<00:04:34.290> is<00:04:34.410> just<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.680> bit<00:04:34.800> too<00:04:34.950> fast<00:04:35.430> so<00:04:35.940> my

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
I think is just a bit too fast so my

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.290 
I think is just a bit too fast so my
advice<00:04:37.260> yep<00:04:37.650> probably<00:04:37.980> yeah<00:04:38.430> go<00:04:39.000> for<00:04:39.210> it

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
advice yep probably yeah go for it

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.450 
advice yep probably yeah go for it
something<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.720> little<00:04:39.930> bit<00:04:40.050> slower<00:04:40.470> just<00:04:41.310> a

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
something a little bit slower just a

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.630 
something a little bit slower just a
pre-made<00:04:41.940> bat<00:04:41.970> to<00:04:42.360> start<00:04:42.600> off<00:04:42.720> with<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:43.640> and

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
pre-made bat to start off with and and

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.180 
pre-made bat to start off with and and
put<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.030> other<00:04:45.150> one<00:04:45.330> away<00:04:45.450> till<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.500> get<00:04:46.980> a

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
put the other one away till you get a

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.840 
put the other one away till you get a
little<00:04:47.430> bit<00:04:47.520> better

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
little bit better

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.820 
little bit better
yeah<00:04:48.630> good<00:04:48.960> advice<00:04:49.260> so<00:04:49.470> it's<00:04:49.620> really

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
yeah good advice so it's really

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.930 
yeah good advice so it's really
important<00:04:50.280> isn't<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:50.700> you<00:04:50.730> get

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
important isn't it that you get

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.330 
important isn't it that you get
something<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:51.660> is<00:04:52.290> not<00:04:52.530> too<00:04:52.770> fast<00:04:53.040> so<00:04:53.310> that

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
something that is not too fast so that

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.280 
something that is not too fast so that
you<00:04:53.610> can<00:04:53.760> learn<00:04:53.910> to<00:04:54.150> play<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.480> full<00:04:54.810> stroke

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.040 
you can learn to play the full stroke
and<00:04:56.150> learn<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.330> hit<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.570> ball<00:04:57.750> consistently

and learn to hit the ball consistently
on<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.440> table<00:04:58.950> if<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.370> ball<00:04:59.580> is<00:04:59.730> coming<00:04:59.760> off

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
on the table if the ball is coming off

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.360 
on the table if the ball is coming off
too<00:05:00.419> fast<00:05:00.690> you're<00:05:01.500> gonna<00:05:01.650> compromise<00:05:02.010> your

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
too fast you're gonna compromise your

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.270 
too fast you're gonna compromise your
stroke<00:05:02.669> try<00:05:03.390> and<00:05:03.540> play<00:05:03.720> a<00:05:03.750> bit<00:05:03.900> shorter<00:05:04.560> we've
