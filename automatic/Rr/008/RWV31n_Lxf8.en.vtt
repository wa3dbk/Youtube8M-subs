00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
in this clip we're going to start with

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.020 
in this clip we're going to start with
the<00:00:01.709> basics<00:00:02.129> we're<00:00:02.250> going<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.460> do<00:00:02.580> back<00:00:02.790> flip

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
the basics we're going to do back flip

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.610 
the basics we're going to do back flip
and<00:00:03.179> reverse<00:00:03.449> this<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.110> two<00:00:04.259> flips<00:00:04.500> you

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
and reverse this is the two flips you

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.170 
and reverse this is the two flips you
want<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.859> learn<00:00:05.009> first

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
want to learn first

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.730 
want to learn first
there's<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.600> easiest<00:00:06.870> flip<00:00:07.140> so<00:00:07.379> first<00:00:07.649> I'm

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
there's the easiest flip so first I'm

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.990 
there's the easiest flip so first I'm
going<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.890> talk<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.130> you<00:00:08.189> about<00:00:08.280> toe<00:00:08.519> side<00:00:08.760> back

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
going to talk to you about toe side back

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.209 
going to talk to you about toe side back
flip<00:00:09.300> I'm<00:00:10.170> right<00:00:10.380> foot<00:00:10.559> forward<00:00:10.920> so<00:00:11.040> I'm<00:00:11.099> going

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
flip I'm right foot forward so I'm going

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.070 
flip I'm right foot forward so I'm going
to<00:00:11.280> start<00:00:11.460> on<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.639> driver<00:00:11.910> side<00:00:12.030> work<00:00:12.809> over

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
to start on the driver side work over

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.810 
to start on the driver side work over
the<00:00:13.200> passenger<00:00:13.559> side<00:00:13.830> so<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.460> first<00:00:14.670> thing

you're going to come in like this you're
going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> edge<00:00:47.640> progressively<00:00:48.539> start<00:00:49.260> slow

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
going to edge progressively start slow

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.290 
going to edge progressively start slow
build<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.160> part<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.520> want<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> start<00:00:50.969> too<00:00:51.090> hard

you're going to start slow build up to a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.040 
you're going to start slow build up to a
hard<00:00:55.110> cut<00:00:55.410> you're<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.129> go<00:00:56.280> hard<00:00:56.520> and

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
hard cut you're going to go hard and

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.470 
hard cut you're going to go hard and
when<00:00:58.050> you're<00:00:58.170> cutting<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.920> want<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> start

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
when you're cutting you want to start

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.910 
when you're cutting you want to start
forward<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> same<00:01:01.350> way<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> boat<00:01:01.770> is

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
forward going the same way the boat is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
forward going the same way the boat is
and<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.399> want<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.609> make<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.879> ski<00:01:03.180> go<00:01:03.359> all<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
way backwards it's like a tug-of-war of

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.760 
way backwards it's like a tug-of-war of
the<00:01:05.430> boat<00:01:05.610> boats<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.689> way<00:01:06.900> my<00:01:07.500> skis

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
going that way who's going to win the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.910 
going that way who's going to win the
boat<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.080> what<00:01:10.200> does<00:01:10.290> he<00:01:10.380> what<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.770> do

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
boat is and what does he what do you do

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.710 
boat is and what does he what do you do

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you do a flip just like that that's all

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.450 
you do a flip just like that that's all
you<00:01:12.840> got<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> think<00:01:13.200> about<00:01:13.439> right<00:01:13.590> there<00:01:13.770> so

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you got to think about right there so

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.249 
you got to think about right there so
when<00:01:14.700> when<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.150> get<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.600> when<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.960> get<00:01:16.080> the
