recommended<00:03:46.470> these<00:03:47.470> are<00:03:47.710> basically<00:03:48.370> the

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
recommended these are basically the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.710 
recommended these are basically the
different<00:03:49.080> speeds<00:03:50.080> get<00:03:50.740> new<00:03:50.920> recommendation

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
different speeds get new recommendation

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.260 
different speeds get new recommendation
so<00:03:52.720> they're<00:03:53.500> testing<00:03:54.070> my<00:03:54.220> internet<00:03:54.640> bandwidth

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
so they're testing my internet bandwidth

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.600 
so they're testing my internet bandwidth
and<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:56.290> will<00:03:56.410> tell<00:03:56.620> me<00:03:56.710> which<00:03:56.860> one<00:03:57.130> it's<00:03:57.400> going

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
and it will tell me which one it's going

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.940 
and it will tell me which one it's going

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
exactly how well it's going to be might

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.700 
exactly how well it's going to be might
be<00:04:01.810> still<00:04:02.320> 2.5<00:04:03.010> but<00:04:03.790> who<00:04:04.150> knows<00:04:04.420> other<00:04:05.380> than

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
be still 2.5 but who knows other than

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.980 
be still 2.5 but who knows other than
that<00:04:05.980> it's<00:04:06.340> pretty<00:04:06.610> flawless<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.600> can<00:04:07.750> really

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
that it's pretty flawless you can really

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.740 
that it's pretty flawless you can really
see<00:04:08.140> if<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.320> are<00:04:08.350> using<00:04:08.500> it<00:04:09.100> I<00:04:09.390> think<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.570> only

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
see if you are using it I think the only

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.460 
see if you are using it I think the only
bug<00:04:11.200> right<00:04:11.410> now<00:04:11.590> is<00:04:11.800> is<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.960> basically<00:04:13.960> you

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
bug right now is is that basically you

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.460 
bug right now is is that basically you
get<00:04:14.830> so<00:04:15.490> it<00:04:15.790> told<00:04:16.000> me<00:04:16.060> use<00:04:16.330> so<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.020> can<00:04:17.290> change

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
get so it told me use so you can change

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.640 
get so it told me use so you can change
the<00:04:17.709> speeds<00:04:18.010> so<00:04:19.560> that's<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:20.880> head<00:04:21.880> back<00:04:22.650> start

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
the speeds so that's it head back start

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.780 
the speeds so that's it head back start
broadcasts<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:28.060> that's<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:28.660> so<00:04:29.220> that<00:04:30.220> will<00:04:30.490> be

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
broadcasts and that's it so that will be

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.510 
broadcasts and that's it so that will be
how<00:04:31.510> everything<00:04:32.020> looks<00:04:32.230> and<00:04:32.590> one<00:04:33.100> last<00:04:33.340> thing
