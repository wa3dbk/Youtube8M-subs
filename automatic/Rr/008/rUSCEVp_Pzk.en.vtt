00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.850
 we came to lake baikal in order 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.860
 to break the speed record on ice on 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.099
 ordinary serial car nissan 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.099
 lives 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.760
 for us, these races are possible until the muscles 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.750
 symbolic character and we would be very 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.539
 I wanted them to be associated with no 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.189
 and Russian Russian history but baikal 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.189
 It seems to me a beautiful symbol of Russia 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.830
 constantly have to adjust 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.910
 driving the slightest pair of wind and car 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.100
 literally thrusts 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.960
 throughout the seven kilometers 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.960
 trails and fight with the elements 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.940
 seemingly 540 horsepower on ice 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.510
 this is absolutely excess power but 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.420
 down they are jeeter we have a very important one 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.610
 weighing it full it has arrived that's it and 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.740
 allows you to implement and huge 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.740
 torque and more power 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.110
 until 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.790
 never about Copacabana Lobanova shook
