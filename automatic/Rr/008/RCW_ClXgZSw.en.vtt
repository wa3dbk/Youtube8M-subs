Bobby TV aired with Millwood brown and
they<00:03:14.370> gave<00:03:14.670> us<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.939> results<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.420> other<00:03:15.599> day

they gave us the results the other day

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.179 
they gave us the results the other day
and<00:03:15.840> told<00:03:15.989> us<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.319> was<00:03:16.439> one<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.799> highest

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
and told us it was one of the highest

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.489 
and told us it was one of the highest
scoring<00:03:17.609> ads<00:03:17.969> that<00:03:18.180> they<00:03:18.450> had<00:03:18.569> ever<00:03:18.780> tested<00:03:19.049> in

scoring ads that they had ever tested in
South<00:03:20.189> Africa<00:03:20.639> so<00:03:20.909> so<00:03:21.629> we<00:03:21.749> think<00:03:21.900> that's

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
South Africa so so we think that's

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:39.259 
South Africa so so we think that's
pretty<00:03:22.379> cool<00:03:37.459> difficulty<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.909> I'm<00:03:39.090> betting

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
pretty cool difficulty and I'm betting

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.830 
pretty cool difficulty and I'm betting
on<00:03:39.689> my<00:03:39.870> Tonetta<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.950> never<00:03:41.370> say<00:03:41.760> anything<00:03:42.209> at
