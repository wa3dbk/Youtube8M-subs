00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
image experiment 2 was supposed to have

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.290 
image experiment 2 was supposed to have
a<00:02:11.080> Symbian<00:02:11.710> Easter<00:02:12.130> Egg<00:02:12.220> there<00:02:12.520> we've<00:02:12.940> seen<00:02:13.180> it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
a Symbian Easter Egg there we've seen it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.390 
a Symbian Easter Egg there we've seen it
in<00:02:13.390> one<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.930> trailers<00:02:14.260> but<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.010> wasn't

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
in one of the trailers but it wasn't

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.040 
in one of the trailers but it wasn't
there<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.970> reason<00:02:16.210> it<00:02:16.390> wasn't<00:02:16.570> there<00:02:16.840> is

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
there the reason it wasn't there is

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.990 
there the reason it wasn't there is
simply<00:02:17.380> because<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.710> was<00:02:17.890> too<00:02:18.010> early<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.790> now

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
simply because it was too early and now

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000 
simply because it was too early and now
it<00:02:19.120> makes<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.540> perfect<00:02:19.780> sense<00:02:20.320> that<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.770> same

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
it makes the perfect sense that the same

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.710 
it makes the perfect sense that the same
biet<00:02:21.220> will<00:02:21.430> arrive<00:02:21.730> in<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.390> amazing

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
biet will arrive in the amazing

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.360 
biet will arrive in the amazing
spider-man<00:02:23.020> 3<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.500> whole<00:02:23.680> story<00:02:24.070> will

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
spider-man 3 and the whole story will

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.790 
spider-man 3 and the whole story will
focus<00:02:24.400> around<00:02:24.960> Simba<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.230> then<00:02:26.590> we'll

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
focus around Simba and then we'll

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.590 
focus around Simba and then we'll
probably<00:02:27.010> get<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.490> venom<00:02:27.880> spin-off<00:02:28.240> film<00:02:28.450> as

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
probably get a venom spin-off film as

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.050 
probably get a venom spin-off film as
