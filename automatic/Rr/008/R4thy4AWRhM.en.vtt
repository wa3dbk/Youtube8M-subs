00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.660
 hey people in this video is about that 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.240
 theme the importance of power will 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.790
 Muscle structure there are two in principle 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.799
 fractions say a faction warcraft 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.020
 is the most important and the other 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.270
 faction does not say it that way 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.580
 correct how important it is to the muscle 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.289
 meet or understood like mine 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.180
 You certainly have mask connection as well 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.980
 that's why you have to stop that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.539
 the question is how important it is 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.609
 now really power for in muscles 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.140
 build up 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.750
 First of all, I have to say that you 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.910
 absolutely power so the weight you 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.320
 could currently push or lift 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.809
 can or bend or whatever 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.210
 could or cologne that actually 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.340
 nothing has to do with muscle structure so 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.590
 that is completely irrelevant because of the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.450
 absolute power depends on many 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.030
 Factors from which you do not train 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.309
 can be something like lever if one now 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.010
 but a very short arm has a monster 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.760
 big breast or how much fat on 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.190
 upper body 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.250
 then of course he pressed a lot 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.799
 lower rescue motion so recommend 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.720
 bmw does he then have to put that back 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.590
 the muscle is called the breast muscle 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.540
 has to spend much less energy around 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.850
 ever to move the load 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.500
 That's why you can even two people 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.270
 do not compare with each other 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.340
 the same on the band press 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.740
 because the other one may have monkey name 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.600
 they are three meters long and the force 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.700
 which then produce the chest muscle 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.590
 must be around the arms from the chest in 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.100
 to render the execution 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.020
 much higher is therefore absolutely powerful 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.329
 completely no matter another important 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.549
 Factors are where the muscles start 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.350
 So if you start the muscle around 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.420
 a few millimeters can shift that 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.829
 very, very big differences 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.540
 make absolutely in cup 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.680
 why should not even with other 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.080
 People compare what 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.090
 unless you are an athlete then 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.190
 of course it would have to be that again 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.050
 the sport already implies that one is 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.730
 compare with other words because it 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.190
 are people who have so long poor 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.510
 make practical red the as 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.360
 cross lifting that is a part 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.430
 repetition in their expensive courses arm 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.830
 Of course yes to travel two kilometers 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.929
 measures the weight that is of course that 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.790
 but the power of her body is the same 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.580
 Your body has to produce it 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.380
 Of course you have worse levers 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.570
 now comes the other side of the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.660
 medal the only reason why yours 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.500
 body muscles is just that you build 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.480
 increase you 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.250
 that means either shorter breaks 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.709
 makes or makes a rap more power 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.380
 use more or because he is a kilo 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.080
 more in an exercise progression is the 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.540
 only reason to build new body yourself 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.100
 So it builds muscles when you build 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.110
 always the same always makes the same 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.880
 same repetition numbers always that 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.410
 same weight then you will ever 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.780
 I do not change because of the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.760
 body just no reason has 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.340
 to adapt to the burden he has 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.110
 Already adjusted that means the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.480
 power in proportion to what they do 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.150
 have done before that's awesome 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.600
 important that is the crucial 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.870
 factor when muscle building goes like that 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.730
 so watch your progress 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.070
 That's why you look better 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.769
 Looks that you are stronger about it yes 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.769
 force that you look stronger but 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.720
 not on other people because just others 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.239
 people have other requirements 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.250
 can not say hey I have too 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.290
 I made it through more than the tree has 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.440
 a better breast or I can has that 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.790
 rat because knowledge offers as me yes because 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.500
 I might be better 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.930
 conditions or because he has better levers 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.760
 relationship and therefore less 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.780
 or has to do more with that 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.579
 to do the same 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.310
 So it's quite crucial 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.040
 but only in comparison with you 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.959
 even with no one else on 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.820
 this whole world i hope the video 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.380
 helped you further and we see 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.380
 us in the next video until later
