00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960 
didn't pay much attention to honestly
and<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.980> started<00:00:29.189> playing<00:00:29.429> around<00:00:29.519> with<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
and I started playing around with the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.479 
and I started playing around with the
idea<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.720> doing<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.500> didn't<00:00:32.040> even<00:00:32.130> try<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
idea of doing it and didn't even try the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.590 
idea of doing it and didn't even try the
zip<00:00:32.850> tie<00:00:33.059> honestly<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.960> went<00:00:34.530> straight<00:00:34.770> for

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
zip tie honestly I went straight for

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.500 
zip tie honestly I went straight for
making<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.870> converting<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.730> blade<00:00:39.090> here

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
making it and converting this blade here

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.549 
making it and converting this blade here
to<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.290> Emerson<00:00:40.680> Wave<00:00:40.890> style<00:00:42.530> from<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
to the Emerson Wave style from the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.700 
to the Emerson Wave style from the
get-go<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.730> what<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.420> see<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:46.530> this

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
get-go so what we see here just this

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.880 
get-go so what we see here just this
camera<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.190> lot<00:00:47.340> higher<00:00:47.579> than<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:48.000> I

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
camera is a lot higher than what I

camera is a lot higher than what I
usually<00:00:49.890> do<00:00:50.989> see<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.230> don't

that preparing it in the off hand so I'm
kind<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.720> repeating<00:04:02.110> myself<00:04:02.260> but<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.370> give

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
far as uh having it on my weak side so I

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.620

I<00:05:22.150> said<00:05:22.479> and<00:05:22.919> this<00:05:23.919> wave<00:05:24.159> mod<00:05:24.460> is<00:05:24.669> working<00:05:24.939> out

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
I said and this wave mod is working out

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.179 
I said and this wave mod is working out
really<00:05:25.300> good<00:05:25.509> for<00:05:25.569> me<00:05:25.930> I<00:05:26.110> didn't<00:05:26.800> take<00:05:26.949> too

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:27.189 
really good for me I didn't take too

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:29.730 
really good for me I didn't take too
much<00:05:27.339> metal<00:05:27.610> off<00:05:27.819> I'd<00:05:28.029> seen<00:05:28.270> a<00:05:28.300> couple<00:05:28.740> where

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
much metal off I'd seen a couple where

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.589 
much metal off I'd seen a couple where
they<00:05:29.860> got<00:05:30.069> into<00:05:30.339> the<00:05:30.430> hole<00:05:30.580> I<00:05:30.789> didn't<00:05:31.120> want<00:05:31.509> to

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
they got into the hole I didn't want to

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.659 
they got into the hole I didn't want to
do<00:05:31.689> that<00:05:31.719> I<00:05:31.870> wanted<00:05:32.199> to<00:05:32.289> still<00:05:32.529> have<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:33.490> hole

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
do that I wanted to still have the hole

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.029 
do that I wanted to still have the hole
as<00:05:33.909> a<00:05:33.969> regular<00:05:34.389> opening<00:05:34.750> option<00:05:35.139> and<00:05:35.319> I'm

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
as a regular opening option and I'm

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.950 
as a regular opening option and I'm
trying<00:05:36.610> to<00:05:36.669> make<00:05:36.759> it<00:05:36.909> comparable<00:05:37.270> as<00:05:37.629> I<00:05:37.750> could

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
trying to make it comparable as I could

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.019 
trying to make it comparable as I could
to<00:05:38.199> a<00:05:38.229> regular<00:05:38.589> wave<00:05:38.800> so<00:05:39.490> I<00:05:39.520> figured<00:05:39.939> this

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:40.029 
to a regular wave so I figured this

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:41.219 
to a regular wave so I figured this
would<00:05:40.150> be<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.300> perfect<00:05:40.509> platform<00:05:40.900> to

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
would be the perfect platform to

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.019 
would be the perfect platform to
experiment<00:05:41.830> on<00:05:41.919> a<00:05:42.189> little<00:05:42.580> bit<00:05:42.699> bigger<00:05:42.879> than

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:43.029 
experiment on a little bit bigger than

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:45.209 
experiment on a little bit bigger than
persistence<00:05:43.689> and<00:05:43.899> and<00:05:44.800> I<00:05:44.919> don't<00:05:45.069> have<00:05:45.189> a

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:45.219 
persistence and and I don't have a

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.159 
persistence and and I don't have a
persistence<00:05:45.729> yet<00:05:45.939> so<00:05:46.149> there's<00:05:46.960> another

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
persistence yet so there's another

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.889 
persistence yet so there's another
reason<00:05:47.409> why<00:05:47.589> not<00:05:47.649> the<00:05:47.830> mod<00:05:47.949> that<00:05:48.159> one<00:05:48.279> and<00:05:48.899> just

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:49.899 
reason why not the mod that one and just

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:51.240 
reason why not the mod that one and just
hope<00:05:50.020> we<00:05:50.110> can<00:05:50.169> play<00:05:50.379> around<00:05:50.469> with<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:50.979> try<00:05:51.219> and

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
hope we can play around with and try and

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.399 
hope we can play around with and try and
if<00:05:51.520> I<00:05:51.580> tore<00:05:51.789> it<00:05:51.879> up<00:05:51.969> okay<00:05:52.659> I<00:05:52.750> lost<00:05:52.960> thirty<00:05:53.199> bucks

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
if I tore it up okay I lost thirty bucks

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:55.260 
if I tore it up okay I lost thirty bucks
so<00:05:53.800> I<00:05:54.039> would<00:05:54.370> encourage<00:05:54.520> doing<00:05:54.969> this<00:05:55.060> on<00:05:55.240> your

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
so I would encourage doing this on your

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.360 
so I would encourage doing this on your
own<00:05:55.419> I<00:05:55.569> mean<00:05:55.810> zip<00:05:56.469> tie<00:05:56.649> might<00:05:56.889> work<00:05:57.069> out<00:05:57.189> you

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
own I mean zip tie might work out you

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.670 
own I mean zip tie might work out you
don't<00:05:57.430> have<00:05:57.580> to<00:05:57.639> remove<00:05:57.849> any<00:05:58.199> metal<00:05:59.199> stock<00:05:59.529> at

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
don't have to remove any metal stock at

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.689 
don't have to remove any metal stock at
all<00:05:59.770> but<00:05:59.979> I<00:06:00.009> want<00:06:00.189> something<00:06:00.430> a<00:06:00.460> little<00:06:00.490> bit

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
all but I want something a little bit

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.990 
all but I want something a little bit
more<00:06:00.759> permanent<00:06:01.089> also<00:06:01.930> something<00:06:02.199> that<00:06:02.469> would

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
more permanent also something that would

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.399 
more permanent also something that would
keep<00:06:04.000> down<00:06:04.240> nice<00:06:04.479> and<00:06:04.659> slim<00:06:04.930> still<00:06:05.199> while

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
keep down nice and slim still while

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:06.689 
keep down nice and slim still while
cutting<00:06:05.680> and<00:06:05.919> everything<00:06:06.219> like<00:06:06.370> that<00:06:06.430> if<00:06:06.639> I

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
cutting and everything like that if I

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.429 
cutting and everything like that if I
was<00:06:06.759> making<00:06:06.939> deep<00:06:07.300> cuts<00:06:07.599> through<00:06:07.870> something<00:06:08.259> I

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:08.439 
was making deep cuts through something I

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:09.959 
was making deep cuts through something I
don't<00:06:08.889> know<00:06:08.979> how<00:06:09.099> that<00:06:09.159> zip<00:06:09.490> tie<00:06:09.639> would<00:06:09.789> work

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:09.969 
don't know how that zip tie would work

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:11.879 
don't know how that zip tie would work
out<00:06:10.180> for<00:06:10.210> that<00:06:10.509> it<00:06:10.689> might<00:06:10.839> work<00:06:10.990> out<00:06:11.139> fine<00:06:11.500> but

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
out for that it might work out fine but

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:12.959 
out for that it might work out fine but
I<00:06:11.919> didn't<00:06:12.250> really<00:06:12.339> want<00:06:12.550> to<00:06:12.580> have<00:06:12.669> to<00:06:12.789> deal

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
I didn't really want to have to deal

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:16.829 
I didn't really want to have to deal
with<00:06:13.000> that<00:06:13.589> and<00:06:14.589> overall<00:06:15.370> works<00:06:16.270> out<00:06:16.479> good<00:06:16.659> I

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:16.839 
with that and overall works out good I

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:18.300 
with that and overall works out good I
do<00:06:16.899> still<00:06:17.229> want<00:06:17.319> to<00:06:17.469> say<00:06:17.620> that<00:06:17.830> if<00:06:17.919> you<00:06:18.069> are

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
do still want to say that if you are

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.709 
do still want to say that if you are
trying<00:06:18.699> to<00:06:18.759> take<00:06:18.879> it<00:06:19.029> out<00:06:19.120> of<00:06:19.149> your<00:06:19.240> pocket<00:06:19.629> and

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:19.719 
trying to take it out of your pocket and

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:21.059 
trying to take it out of your pocket and
don't<00:06:20.050> want<00:06:20.319> it<00:06:20.409> to<00:06:20.529> open

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
don't want it to open

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:22.709 
don't want it to open
you're<00:06:21.699> gonna<00:06:21.819> take<00:06:22.089> extra<00:06:22.389> care<00:06:22.569> in<00:06:22.689> that

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:22.719 
you're gonna take extra care in that

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:24.089 
you're gonna take extra care in that
because<00:06:23.080> usually<00:06:23.319> I'll<00:06:23.500> get<00:06:23.649> a<00:06:23.680> lot<00:06:23.830> of<00:06:23.949> half

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
because usually I'll get a lot of half

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.700 
because usually I'll get a lot of half
opens<00:06:24.610> or<00:06:24.909> you<00:06:25.599> know<00:06:25.689> all<00:06:25.990> the<00:06:26.110> way<00:06:26.229> almost

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
opens or you know all the way almost

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.230 
opens or you know all the way almost
locked<00:06:26.919> or<00:06:27.189> something<00:06:27.219> like<00:06:27.490> that<00:06:27.580> unless<00:06:28.029> I'm

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
locked or something like that unless I'm

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.579 
locked or something like that unless I'm
intentionally<00:06:28.779> trying<00:06:28.990> to<00:06:29.050> pull<00:06:29.259> it<00:06:29.349> out<00:06:29.439> when

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:29.589 
intentionally trying to pull it out when

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:31.409 
intentionally trying to pull it out when
I<00:06:29.620> try<00:06:29.860> to<00:06:29.889> pitch<00:06:30.189> low<00:06:30.370> pull<00:06:30.550> it<00:06:30.639> out<00:06:30.789> usually

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
I try to pitch low pull it out usually

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.719 
I try to pitch low pull it out usually
it<00:06:31.509> locks<00:06:31.719> up<00:06:31.899> firm<00:06:32.259> every<00:06:32.560> time<00:06:32.770> so<00:06:33.129> just

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
it locks up firm every time so just

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:35.730 
it locks up firm every time so just
something<00:06:33.909> to<00:06:34.029> think<00:06:34.120> about<00:06:34.270> and<00:06:34.930> just<00:06:35.680> a

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
something to think about and just a

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.320 
something to think about and just a
quick<00:06:35.889> mod<00:06:36.190> we<00:06:36.399> did<00:06:36.639> that<00:06:36.819> we<00:06:36.909> wanted<00:06:37.180> to<00:06:37.240> go

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
quick mod we did that we wanted to go

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.430 
quick mod we did that we wanted to go
ahead<00:06:37.449> and<00:06:37.629> share<00:06:37.750> with<00:06:37.870> you<00:06:37.990> guys<00:06:38.019> I
