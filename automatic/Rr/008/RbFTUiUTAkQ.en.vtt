the way I want
the<00:03:14.379> last<00:03:14.590> step<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:15.099> to<00:03:15.340> make<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.579> display<00:03:15.790> the

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
the last step is to make it display the

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.929 
the last step is to make it display the
webpage<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.689> user<00:03:16.870> enters<00:03:17.310> I'm<00:03:18.310> going<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.790> do

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
webpage the user enters I'm going to do

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:20.429 
webpage the user enters I'm going to do
this<00:03:19.120> by<00:03:19.420> telling<00:03:19.629> the<00:03:19.870> push-button

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
this by telling the push-button

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.319 
this by telling the push-button
that<00:03:20.739> when<00:03:20.890> it's<00:03:21.040> clicked<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:21.579> should<00:03:22.150> tell
