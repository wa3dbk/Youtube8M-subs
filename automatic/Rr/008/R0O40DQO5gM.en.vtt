00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.810
 ah 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.070
 and I am a responsibility at the same time 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.560
 but 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.960
 how is soccer we know the whole team 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.310
 knows that something we have to enjoy 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.640
 so totally happy to represent 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.640
 to the country 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.289
 I like this kind of challenges I know that 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.740
 I always have to be the example 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.390
 inside and outside the court have 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:50.300
 the leadership to take certain 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:52.720
 decisions and I hope to have enough 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.230
 maturity to make those decisions 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.520
 and I like to give security to the defense 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.620
 of ordering my colleagues and keeping 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.140
 keep him always like moral high 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.140
 towards the other they always come out to support them 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.710
 most of the players that have already 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.870
 concluded dream soccer 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.050
 they leave we leave the populations of 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.380
 neighborhood where there is a lot I do not know 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:26.079
 delinquency bad influence drug 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.390
 and this is something totally different but 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.440
 that is inserted right there 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.300
 when you realize you're going 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.130
 getting things you realize that it is 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.530
 a very good way to get ahead 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.570
 all footballers are examples for 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.930
 younger children like me I also had 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.030
 my referents when I was smaller 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.790
 but you do things you 're worried 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.910
 what others will say or feel about 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.530
 but if it is rich to feel reflected in 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.780
 maybe younger children in other 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.049
 people 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.860
 in football would be to get something 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.420
 important with my club murcia de chile 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.330
 in the selection that what comes to us 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.229
 now is to achieve a first place in the 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.410
 world and after that I would like to 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.960
 From Europe to achieve a balance 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.800
 in life 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.830
 it would be starting to be happy in the aspect 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.690
 family itself what we need most 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.370
 we football players time with everything 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.260
 it reclaims us the time when I came to 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.200
 see me when they came here so 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.240
 achieve a balance together scope 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.240
 ah 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.240
 ah 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.159
 I'm not close to church 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.010
 on Sundays but obviously my mother 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.010
 is what instills me since childhood
