00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:05.810 
this is a one of my passenger cars and

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.580 
this is a one of my passenger cars and
I'm<00:00:06.810> just<00:00:07.049> going<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:09.200> explain<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> little<00:00:10.380> bit

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
I'm just going to explain a little bit

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.459 
I'm just going to explain a little bit
how<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.800> built<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:11.280> truck<00:00:12.080> they're<00:00:13.080> very

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
how I built this truck they're very

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.790 
how I built this truck they're very
expensive<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.130> buy<00:00:14.490> I'm<00:00:14.790> already<00:00:15.630> done<00:00:16.080> and

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.420 

it's<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.490> way<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.090> did<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.539> wasn't<00:00:21.720> too<00:00:22.430> wasn't

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
it's the way I did it wasn't too wasn't

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.310 
it's the way I did it wasn't too wasn't
it<00:00:23.580> too<00:00:23.699> hard<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.090> do<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.960> might<00:00:25.140> help

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
it too hard to do and it might help

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.880 
it too hard to do and it might help
somebody<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.130> very<00:00:27.090> inexpensively<00:00:27.890> these

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
somebody and very inexpensively these

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.430 
somebody and very inexpensively these
wheels<00:00:29.340> are<00:00:31.009> I<00:00:32.270> think<00:00:33.270> they're<00:00:33.780> two<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.320> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
wheels are I think they're two and a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.350 
wheels are I think they're two and a
half<00:00:34.620> pound<00:00:34.950> weights<00:00:35.309> they're<00:00:35.730> about<00:00:35.969> four

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
half pound weights they're about four

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.959 
half pound weights they're about four
and<00:00:36.450> half<00:00:36.510> inches<00:00:36.989> diameter<00:00:37.790> before<00:00:38.790> they're

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and half inches diameter before they're

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.069 
and half inches diameter before they're
machine<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.570> got<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> machine<00:00:40.079> woof<00:00:40.379> and

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
machine you got a machine woof and

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.900 
machine you got a machine woof and
bearings<00:00:43.079> are<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.410> sleep<00:00:43.620> bearings<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
bearings are just sleep bearings and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.340 
bearings are just sleep bearings and
this<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.570> flat<00:00:45.840> stock<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:47.370> I've<00:00:47.520> used

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
this is just flat stock that I've used

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
this is just flat stock that I've used
and<00:00:49.350> there's<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.770> four<00:00:50.309> inch<00:00:50.550> piece<00:00:50.820> under

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
and there's a four inch piece under

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.510 
and there's a four inch piece under
there<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.989> goes<00:00:52.559> across<00:00:53.090> pivots<00:00:54.090> right<00:00:54.329> here

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
there that goes across pivots right here

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.680 
there that goes across pivots right here
and<00:00:56.960> these<00:00:57.960> Springs<00:00:58.590> our<00:00:59.010> valve<00:00:59.910> springs<00:01:00.449> off

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and these Springs our valve springs off

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.509 
and these Springs our valve springs off
from<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> car<00:01:01.199> big<00:01:02.100> v8<00:01:02.550> probably<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> 460<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.519> took

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
from a car big v8 probably a 460 I took

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.190 
from a car big v8 probably a 460 I took
them<00:01:05.640> off<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.150> don't<00:01:06.330> remember<00:01:06.570> what<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> heads

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
them off I don't remember what the heads

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.130 
them off I don't remember what the heads
were<00:01:07.939> but<00:01:08.939> that's<00:01:09.060> all<00:01:09.299> they<00:01:09.450> are<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.020> they're

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
were but that's all they are and they're

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.280 
were but that's all they are and they're
just<00:01:10.409> about<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.310> two<00:01:11.490> people<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.390> ride

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
just about right for two people to ride

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.609 
just about right for two people to ride
on<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.130> car<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.700> springs<00:01:15.500> handle<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
on in this car the springs handle it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.399 
on in this car the springs handle it
just<00:01:16.830> about<00:01:17.040> right<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.689> did<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.020> cut

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
just about right and all I did is cut

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.440 
just about right and all I did is cut
out<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> spring<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.640> burn<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.150> out<00:01:21.240> with

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
out for the spring here burn it out with

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.910 
out for the spring here burn it out with
a<00:01:21.479> torch<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.580> welded<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.759> piece<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> end

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
a torch and welded this piece on the end

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.179 
a torch and welded this piece on the end
the<00:01:25.920> spring<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.369> ride<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.920> right<00:01:28.920> here

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the spring to ride on and right here

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.710 
the spring to ride on and right here
stops<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.790> spring<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.650> this<00:01:31.650> piece<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.720> that

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
stops the spring and this piece is that

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.760 
stops the spring and this piece is that
big<00:01:34.320> four<00:01:34.650> inch<00:01:34.829> piece<00:01:35.070> there<00:01:35.400> that's<00:01:36.000> cut<00:01:36.299> out

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
big four inch piece there that's cut out

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.440 
big four inch piece there that's cut out
you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.400> I'm<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:39.090> strong<00:01:39.420> enough

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
you can see like I'm not strong enough

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.740 
you can see like I'm not strong enough
to<00:01:39.840> compress<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:41.270> that's<00:01:42.270> how<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.630> works

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
to compress it but that's how it works

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.390 
to compress it but that's how it works
like<00:01:43.140> that

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
like that

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.070 
like that
and<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:46.140> very<00:01:47.130> good<00:01:47.220> system<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.970> use<00:01:48.300> bigstock

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
and a very good system I use bigstock

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.650 
and a very good system I use bigstock
inch<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.160> 1/8<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.120> because<00:01:51.510> they've

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
inch and 1/8 you have to because they've

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.800 
inch and 1/8 you have to because they've
got<00:01:51.920> these<00:01:52.920> castings<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.850> big<00:01:54.150> holes<00:01:54.450> in

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
got these castings have big holes in

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.810 
got these castings have big holes in
them<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.260> you<00:01:55.560> got<00:01:55.800> to<00:01:55.920> bore<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> hole<00:01:56.460> first

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
them so you got to bore the hole first

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.270 
them so you got to bore the hole first
and<00:01:57.470> then<00:01:58.470> all<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.130> did<00:01:59.610> with<00:01:59.850> these<00:02:00.000> wheels<00:02:00.390> was

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
and then all I did with these wheels was

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.060 
and then all I did with these wheels was
before<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> machined<00:02:02.880> them<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.710> glued<00:02:04.710> them<00:02:04.860> onto

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
before I machined them I glued them onto

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.830 
before I machined them I glued them onto
the<00:02:05.340> shaft<00:02:05.700> turned<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> shaft<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:09.660> this

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the shaft turned the shaft and to this

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.620 
the shaft turned the shaft and to this
bore<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.590> machined<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.610> glued<00:02:12.360> them<00:02:12.450> on

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
bore that I machined and glued them on

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.170 
bore that I machined and glued them on
with<00:02:12.810> Loctite<00:02:13.260> 680<00:02:13.860> which<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.490> bearing<00:02:14.910> Moen

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
with Loctite 680 which is bearing Moen

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.810 
with Loctite 680 which is bearing Moen
and<00:02:15.450> I've<00:02:16.260> done<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.680> for<00:02:16.860> years<00:02:17.100> last<00:02:17.430> 20

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
and I've done that for years last 20

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.330 
and I've done that for years last 20
years<00:02:17.850> I've<00:02:18.270> made<00:02:18.510> them<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.840> way<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.350> that

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
years I've made them that way and that

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.580 
years I've made them that way and that
wheels<00:02:20.580> never<00:02:20.880> come<00:02:21.150> off<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.990> bearing<00:02:22.380> mount

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
wheels never come off that bearing mount

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.530 
wheels never come off that bearing mount
is<00:02:22.800> very<00:02:23.190> good<00:02:23.460> stuff<00:02:25.070> but<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.160> use<00:02:26.340> about<00:02:26.640> all

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
is very good stuff but I use about all

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.300 
is very good stuff but I use about all
whatever<00:02:27.930> stock<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:28.500> think<00:02:28.710> this<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.040> one<00:02:29.220> in

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
whatever stock I think this is one in

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.640 
whatever stock I think this is one in
1/8<00:02:29.640> whatever<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.840> come<00:02:31.080> up<00:02:31.200> with<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
1/8 whatever I can come up with it the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.890 
1/8 whatever I can come up with it the
steel<00:02:31.890> company<00:02:32.340> cheap<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:35.270> after<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.300> put<00:02:36.510> put

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
steel company cheap and after I put put

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.820 
steel company cheap and after I put put
the<00:02:37.020> wheels<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:38.760> also<00:02:39.630> put<00:02:40.110> centers<00:02:40.530> in

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
the wheels on I also put centers in

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.340 
the wheels on I also put centers in
there<00:02:41.100> in<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.760> axle<00:02:42.300> stock<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.170> put

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
there in this axle stock so I can put

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.180 
there in this axle stock so I can put
them<00:02:43.410> on<00:02:43.530> my<00:02:43.710> lathe<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.600> turn<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.900> wheels<00:02:46.590> to

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
them on my lathe and turn the wheels to

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.210 
them on my lathe and turn the wheels to
what<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.400> want<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:49.670> then<00:02:50.670> I've<00:02:50.820> got<00:02:51.030> my<00:02:51.060> axles

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
what I want and then I've got my axles

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.080 
what I want and then I've got my axles
anyway<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.610> for<00:02:54.300> this<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.600> turn<00:02:54.900> I've<00:02:55.890> tried

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
anyway and for this to turn I've tried

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.510 
anyway and for this to turn I've tried
friction<00:02:58.050> material<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.010> doesn't<00:02:59.370> work

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
friction material and it doesn't work

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.070 
friction material and it doesn't work
good<00:02:59.790> so<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.000> put<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.290> see<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.620> there<00:03:02.270> it's<00:03:03.270> a

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.880 

ball<00:03:07.080> bearing<00:03:07.610> here<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:10.080> i<00:03:10.260> weld<00:03:10.500> piece<00:03:10.739> of

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
ball bearing here and i weld piece of

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.449 
ball bearing here and i weld piece of
flat<00:03:11.100> stock<00:03:11.400> on<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.760> frame<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.420> car<00:03:12.690> and

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
flat stock on the frame on the car and

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.290 
flat stock on the frame on the car and
this<00:03:14.459> ball<00:03:14.700> bearing<00:03:14.940> rides<00:03:15.300> on<00:03:15.660> there<00:03:17.120> it's<00:03:18.120> a

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
this ball bearing rides on there it's a

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.040 
this ball bearing rides on there it's a
pretty<00:03:18.600> frictionless<00:03:19.459> way<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:21.500> do<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.680> and

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
pretty frictionless way to do it and

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.320 
pretty frictionless way to do it and
these<00:03:25.050> trucks<00:03:25.320> work<00:03:25.500> really<00:03:25.709> well<00:03:26.330> anyway

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
these trucks work really well anyway

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.560 
these trucks work really well anyway
this<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:28.110> little<00:03:28.260> video<00:03:28.620> on<00:03:29.330> how<00:03:30.330> I<00:03:30.360> did

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
this is just a little video on how I did

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.750 
this is just a little video on how I did
it<00:03:30.840> it's<00:03:30.989> an<00:03:31.140> inexpensive<00:03:31.620> way<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.040> do<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.519> and

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
it it's an inexpensive way to do it and

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.180 
it it's an inexpensive way to do it and
just<00:03:33.330> have<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.840> invest<00:03:34.140> in<00:03:34.320> some<00:03:34.350> flat<00:03:34.830> stock

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
just have to invest in some flat stock

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.120 
just have to invest in some flat stock
and<00:03:38.120> these<00:03:39.290> castings<00:03:40.290> if<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.650> try<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.890> buy

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
and these castings if you try to buy

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.290 
and these castings if you try to buy
these<00:03:41.810> commercially<00:03:42.810> are<00:03:42.930> quite<00:03:43.170> expensive

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
these commercially are quite expensive

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.990 
these commercially are quite expensive
for<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.390> wheels<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:48.170> using<00:03:49.550> weight<00:03:50.550> lifting

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
for the wheels and using weight lifting

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.729 
for the wheels and using weight lifting
weights<00:03:51.269> 2<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.320> 1/2<00:03:52.410> pound<00:03:52.829> errs<00:03:54.320> it's<00:03:55.320> pretty

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
weights 2 and 1/2 pound errs it's pretty

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.370 
weights 2 and 1/2 pound errs it's pretty
good<00:03:55.920> cast<00:03:56.190> iron<00:03:56.549> and

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
good cast iron and

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.110 
good cast iron and
is<00:03:57.440> good<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:57.920> makes<00:03:58.100> a<00:03:58.370> makes<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.940> good

is good and it makes a makes a good

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.430 
is good and it makes a makes a good
wheel<00:03:59.500> cast-iron<00:04:00.500> wheel<00:04:01.630> so<00:04:02.630> that's<00:04:02.870> it<00:04:03.140> just

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
wheel cast-iron wheel so that's it just

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.350 
wheel cast-iron wheel so that's it just
wanted<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.100> do<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:04.400> this<00:04:04.670> car<00:04:05.000> is<00:04:05.330> a

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
wanted to do that this car is a

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.470 
wanted to do that this car is a
two-person<00:04:06.080> car<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:10.240> carries<00:04:11.240> the<00:04:11.270> weight

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
two-person car and it carries the weight

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.760 
two-person car and it carries the weight
real<00:04:11.780> good<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:13.220> adults<00:04:13.550> and<00:04:15.580> that's<00:04:16.580> it<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:17.770> hope

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
real good to adults and that's it I hope

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.190 
real good to adults and that's it I hope
somebody<00:04:19.340> got<00:04:19.459> something<00:04:19.880> out<00:04:20.030> of<00:04:20.060> this<00:04:21.190> and
