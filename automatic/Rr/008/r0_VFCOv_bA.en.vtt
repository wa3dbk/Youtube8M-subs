00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
now we are ready to thread the machine

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.370 
now we are ready to thread the machine
like<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.120> did<00:01:06.270> before<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:06.930> time<00:01:07.170> we're

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
like we did before but this time we're

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.720 
like we did before but this time we're
only<00:01:07.500> threading<00:01:08.010> three<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.340> them<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.610> we'll

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
only threading three of them so we'll

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.610 
only threading three of them so we'll
start<00:01:09.030> with<00:01:09.180> our<00:01:09.210> green<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.720> here<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.560> is

the<00:01:10.890> upper<00:01:11.190> looper<00:01:12.410> put<00:01:13.410> it<00:01:13.530> through<00:01:15.710> down

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the upper looper put it through down

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:25.130 
the upper looper put it through down
follow<00:01:17.250> all<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:18.710> green<00:01:19.710> dots

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.750 

and<00:01:26.140> if<00:01:26.560> you<00:01:26.680> remember<00:01:26.890> we<00:01:27.160> thread<00:01:27.430> it<00:01:27.580> through

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
and if you remember we thread it through

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.819 
and if you remember we thread it through
this<00:01:27.970> top

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.640 

little<00:01:31.430> hole

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
little hole

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.950 
little hole
okay<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:34.760> I<00:01:34.790> got<00:01:34.970> my<00:01:35.090> three<00:01:35.240> my<00:01:35.570> green<00:01:35.810> one

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
through now we're going to do the blue

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.600 
through now we're going to do the blue
thread<00:01:37.910> which<00:01:38.180> is<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.630> lower<00:01:38.900> looper<00:01:39.610> go

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
thread which is the lower looper go

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.110 
thread which is the lower looper go
through<00:01:40.850> here<00:01:41.270> down<00:01:41.810> past<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.290> tension

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
through here down past the tension

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.980 
through here down past the tension
follow<00:01:44.120> it<00:01:44.390> all<00:01:45.140> along<00:01:45.650> all<00:01:45.890> of<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.690> blue<00:01:47.690> dots

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
follow it all along all of the blue dots

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.630 
follow it all along all of the blue dots
and<00:01:49.360> remember<00:01:50.360> through<00:01:50.690> here<00:01:50.960> we<00:01:51.490> fold<00:01:52.490> this

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
and remember through here we fold this

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:03.460 
and remember through here we fold this
out<00:01:54.670> hook<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.850> in

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.120 

and<00:02:03.920> then<00:02:04.340> thread<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.850> machine<00:02:05.180> here

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.430 

that's<00:02:08.820> our<00:02:08.940> first<00:02:09.150> two<00:02:09.330> threads<00:02:09.600> now<00:02:10.110> for<00:02:10.380> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
that's our first two threads now for the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.710 
that's our first two threads now for the
last<00:02:10.650> thread<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.160> our<00:02:11.460> red<00:02:11.820> one<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.570> going

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
last thread is our red one this is going

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.660 
last thread is our red one this is going
to<00:02:12.780> go<00:02:12.930> through<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> right<00:02:13.470> needle<00:02:13.710> just<00:02:14.490> like

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
to go through the right needle just like

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.260 
to go through the right needle just like
it<00:02:14.790> did<00:02:14.910> before

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
it did before

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.190 
it did before
so<00:02:15.930> go<00:02:16.140> here<00:02:16.940> down<00:02:17.940> through<00:02:20.570> and<00:02:21.570> thread

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
so go here down through and thread

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.670 
so go here down through and thread
through<00:02:22.350> like<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> regular<00:02:23.550> sewing<00:02:23.970> machine

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
through like a regular sewing machine

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.850 
through like a regular sewing machine
and<00:02:26.690> into<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.050> needle<00:02:30.380> okay<00:02:31.380> now<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.620> have<00:02:31.710> our

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
and into the needle okay now we have our

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.620 
and into the needle okay now we have our
three<00:02:32.220> threads<00:02:32.580> in<00:02:32.700> place<00:02:32.880> now<00:02:33.120> we<00:02:33.150> need<00:02:33.510> to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
three threads in place now we need to

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.200 
three threads in place now we need to

so we go ahead and close it up turn the
machine<00:03:17.250> on<00:03:18.710> now<00:03:19.710> that<00:03:19.950> we're<00:03:20.100> ready<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.370> start

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
machine on now that we're ready to start

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.640 
machine on now that we're ready to start
our<00:03:20.820> rolled<00:03:21.030> hem<00:03:21.360> we'll<00:03:21.810> pull<00:03:22.080> our<00:03:22.290> threads

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
our rolled hem we'll pull our threads

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.350 
our rolled hem we'll pull our threads
back<00:03:22.980> we<00:03:23.400> got<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:23.670> make<00:03:23.730> sure<00:03:23.790> they're<00:03:24.060> pulling

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
back we got to make sure they're pulling

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.010 
back we got to make sure they're pulling
backwards<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:25.080> we're<00:03:25.650> going<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.870> chain<00:03:27.870> it

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
backwards and we're going to chain it

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.350 
backwards and we're going to chain it
out<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.530> few<00:03:28.860> inches<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.370> just<00:03:29.580> hold<00:03:29.970> on<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.330> it

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
out a few inches you just hold on to it

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.630 
out a few inches you just hold on to it
and<00:03:30.750> make<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.350> go<00:03:31.500> once<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.160> have<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> little

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
and make it go once you have a little

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.810 
and make it go once you have a little
bit<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.300> tail<00:03:33.540> out<00:03:33.750> here<00:03:34.310> we're<00:03:35.310> ready<00:03:35.490> to

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
bit of a tail out here we're ready to

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:52.870 
bit of a tail out here we're ready to
thread<00:03:36.810> our<00:03:36.870> fabric<00:03:37.380> in<00:03:39.440> presser<00:03:40.440> foot<00:03:40.650> down

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.890 

all<00:03:53.880> right<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.180> that's<00:03:54.270> how<00:03:54.450> we<00:03:54.510> get<00:03:54.660> started

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
all right so that's how we get started

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.770 
all right so that's how we get started
