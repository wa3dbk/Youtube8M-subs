00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
slightly to the ground now we draw two

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.430 
slightly to the ground now we draw two
lines<00:00:37.640> which<00:00:38.300> are<00:00:38.539> the<00:00:38.660> same<00:00:38.899> length

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
lines which are the same length

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.150 
lines which are the same length
like<00:00:39.710> his<00:00:39.920> head<00:00:40.780> his<00:00:41.780> legs<00:00:42.079> are<00:00:42.320> also<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.920> same

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
like his head his legs are also the same

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.900 
like his head his legs are also the same
length<00:00:43.489> like<00:00:43.910> his<00:00:44.090> head<00:00:45.399> ensure<00:00:46.399> that<00:00:46.699> his

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
length like his head ensure that his

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.130 
length like his head ensure that his
legs<00:00:47.210> are<00:00:47.739> Murat<00:00:48.739> drawn<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.519> his<00:00:49.670> body<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:50.929> can

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
legs are Murat drawn to his body you can

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.860

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
shapes so you can keep the proportions

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.270
