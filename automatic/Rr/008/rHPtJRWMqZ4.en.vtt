opinion<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.330> know<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.660> lot<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.870> people<00:02:47.960> like<00:02:48.170> to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
opinion I know a lot of people like to

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.440 
opinion I know a lot of people like to
do<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.500> archer<00:02:48.830> bak<00:02:49.070> barb<00:02:49.580> strategy<00:02:50.120> but<00:02:50.390> I

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
do the archer bak barb strategy but I

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.170 
do the archer bak barb strategy but I
feel<00:02:50.780> like<00:02:50.930> if<00:02:51.520> most<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.640> their<00:02:52.790> stuff<00:02:52.880> is

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
feel like if most of their stuff is

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.600 
feel like if most of their stuff is
around<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.870> walls<00:02:54.470> there's<00:02:55.070> no<00:02:55.250> point<00:02:55.490> for

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
around the walls there's no point for

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.740 
around the walls there's no point for
Barb's<00:02:55.970> because<00:02:56.150> they're<00:02:56.270> just<00:02:56.390> gonna<00:02:56.570> hit

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
Barb's because they're just gonna hit

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.150 
Barb's because they're just gonna hit
the<00:02:56.810> wall<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.050> get<00:02:57.200> picked<00:02:57.380> off<00:02:57.500> by<00:02:57.680> defenses

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
the wall and get picked off by defenses

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.500 
the wall and get picked off by defenses
that's<00:02:58.340> why<00:02:58.459> i<00:02:58.489> like<00:02:58.640> my<00:02:58.730> archers<00:02:59.090> quite<00:02:59.270> a<00:02:59.330> bit

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
that's why i like my archers quite a bit

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.229 
that's why i like my archers quite a bit
and<00:02:59.800> and<00:03:00.800> that's<00:03:00.950> really<00:03:01.670> why<00:03:01.850> I<00:03:01.880> just<00:03:02.120> like

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
and and that's really why I just like

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.880 
and and that's really why I just like
all<00:03:02.420> two<00:03:02.810> hundred<00:03:02.930> archers<00:03:03.230> that's<00:03:03.620> my<00:03:03.770> new

farming<00:03:04.280> strategy<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:04.730> think<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:05.030> does

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
farming strategy and I think it does

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.030 
farming strategy and I think it does
really<00:03:05.450> really<00:03:05.780> well<00:03:05.959> I'm<00:03:06.200> saving<00:03:06.830> up<00:03:06.890> my

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
really really well I'm saving up my

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
really really well I'm saving up my
licks<00:03:07.310> or<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:07.520> train<00:03:07.790> with<00:03:08.000> some<00:03:08.180> giants<00:03:08.720> and

licks or to train with some giants and

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.370 
licks or to train with some giants and
debating<00:03:11.060> on<00:03:11.150> whether<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:11.420> want<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.720> do<00:03:11.840> Giants

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
and right here is a 900 k i'm pretty

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.980 
and right here is a 900 k i'm pretty
sure<00:03:50.209> this<00:03:50.330> is<00:03:50.390> around<00:03:50.660> 900<00:03:51.230> k<00:03:51.350> 460

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.800 
sure this is around 900 k 460
yeah<00:03:53.470> this<00:03:53.650> is<00:03:53.770> definitely<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:54.280> 900<00:03:55.150> k<00:03:55.270> raid<00:03:55.540> and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
yeah this is definitely a 900 k raid and

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.070 
yeah this is definitely a 900 k raid and
I<00:03:56.710> mean<00:03:57.340> I'm<00:03:57.670> just<00:03:58.090> using<00:03:58.240> arches<00:03:58.720> against<00:03:58.990> the

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
I mean I'm just using arches against the

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.110 
I mean I'm just using arches against the
space<00:03:59.320> if<00:03:59.530> I<00:03:59.680> had<00:03:59.830> hogs<00:04:00.070> that's<00:04:00.520> this<00:04:00.820> is<00:04:00.940> why<00:04:01.090> I

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
space if I had hogs that's this is why I

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.510 
space if I had hogs that's this is why I
want<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.420> use<00:04:01.510> hogs<00:04:01.780> for<00:04:02.740> big<00:04:03.040> grades<00:04:03.340> like

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
want to use hogs for big grades like

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.820 
want to use hogs for big grades like
this<00:04:03.790> I<00:04:03.970> mean<00:04:04.270> if<00:04:04.510> i<00:04:04.630> use<00:04:04.840> giants<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.650> stuff

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
this I mean if i use giants and stuff

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.230 
this I mean if i use giants and stuff
like<00:04:05.950> that<00:04:06.010> i<00:04:06.190> really<00:04:06.640> do<00:04:06.760> think<00:04:06.790> i<00:04:07.030> can<00:04:07.150> get

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
like that i really do think i can get

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.610 
like that i really do think i can get
them<00:04:07.360> but<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.630> don't<00:04:07.690> have<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.140> healing<00:04:08.410> spell

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
them but I don't have the healing spell

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.810 
them but I don't have the healing spell
so<00:04:08.770> I<00:04:08.800> think<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.130> Hogs<00:04:09.340> could<00:04:09.580> have<00:04:09.670> done<00:04:09.790> it

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
so I think the Hogs could have done it

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.870 
so I think the Hogs could have done it
fairly<00:04:10.180> simple<00:04:10.630> without<00:04:11.170> them<00:04:11.730> without<00:04:12.730> the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
fairly simple without them without the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.000 
fairly simple without them without the
heal<00:04:13.030> spells<00:04:13.270> against<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.720> space<00:04:13.960> but<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.530> very

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
heal spells against the space but a very

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.600 
heal spells against the space but a very
brush<00:04:15.550> town<00:04:15.850> hall<00:04:16.030> 9<00:04:16.860> same<00:04:17.860> division<00:04:18.190> as<00:04:18.400> me

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.610 
brush town hall 9 same division as me

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.090 
brush town hall 9 same division as me
and<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:18.940> mean<00:04:19.150> I<00:04:19.360> wish<00:04:20.050> I<00:04:20.260> wish<00:04:20.410> I<00:04:20.560> had<00:04:20.650> hogs<00:04:20.830> and

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
and I mean I wish I wish I had hogs and

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.080 
and I mean I wish I wish I had hogs and
I<00:04:21.160> think<00:04:21.400> this<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.610> what<00:04:21.700> i'm<00:04:21.790> going<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:21.940> do

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090
