forward<00:00:28.560> well<00:00:29.070> first<00:00:29.310> off<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.609> think<00:00:29.640> eight

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
forward well first off I think eight

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.060 
forward well first off I think eight
weight<00:00:30.119> classes<00:00:30.449> as<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> positive<00:00:31.199> right<00:00:31.769> we're

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
weight classes as a positive right we're

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.310 
weight classes as a positive right we're
going<00:00:32.430> we're<00:00:32.730> increasing<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:34.020> amount<00:00:34.290> of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
going we're increasing the amount of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.110

people that will get to wrestle at a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.330 
people that will get to wrestle at a
world<00:00:36.420> championship<00:00:36.840> level<00:00:37.260> will<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:37.860> growing

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
world championship level will be growing

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.780

the<00:00:38.489> pool<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.940> rustlers<00:00:39.329> worldwide<00:00:40.489> for<00:00:41.489> us<00:00:41.610> as

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the pool of rustlers worldwide for us as

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.280 
the pool of rustlers worldwide for us as
America<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.360> know<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.750> ten<00:00:42.930> college

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
America you know we have ten college

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.549 
America you know we have ten college
weights<00:00:43.530> which<00:00:43.739> feed<00:00:44.399> directly<00:00:44.879> into<00:00:45.329> our

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
weights which feed directly into our

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.930 
weights which feed directly into our
national<00:00:46.559> team<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.039> our<00:00:47.100> world<00:00:47.340> Olympic<00:00:47.730> team

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
national team and our world Olympic team

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.420 
national team and our world Olympic team
so<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.930> know<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.200> eighth<00:00:49.530> overall<00:00:50.100> is

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
so you know I think eighth overall is

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.400 
so you know I think eighth overall is
good<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:51.390> obviously<00:00:51.960> when<00:00:52.110> we<00:00:52.199> get<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
good you know obviously when we get to

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.990 
good you know obviously when we get to
the<00:00:52.440> Olympic<00:00:52.829> year<00:00:53.010> how<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.460> funnel<00:00:53.820> eight

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the Olympic year how do we funnel eight

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.959 
the Olympic year how do we funnel eight
down<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.719> six<00:00:55.020> will<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.949> challenge<00:00:56.730> but

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
down into six will be a challenge but

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.099 
down into six will be a challenge but
the<00:00:57.270> good<00:00:57.420> thing<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.600> we're<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> be

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the good thing is we're going to be

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.990 
the good thing is we're going to be
growing<00:00:58.320> our<00:00:58.559> pool<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:58.920> those<00:00:59.070> eight<00:00:59.280> how<00:00:59.940> do

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
growing our pool with those eight how do

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.520 
growing our pool with those eight how do
you<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> athletes<00:01:00.899> are<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.350> be

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
you think the athletes are going to be

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.740 
you think the athletes are going to be
excited<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> another<00:01:02.969> athlete<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.629> each

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
excited that another athlete in each

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.329 
excited that another athlete in each
style<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.650> an<00:01:04.769> opportunity<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
style is going to have an opportunity to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.830 
style is going to have an opportunity to
go<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> World<00:01:05.700> Championships<00:01:06.360> each<00:01:06.600> year

go the World Championships each year

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.380 
go the World Championships each year
well<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.500> yeah<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.189> think<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.909> think<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> guys

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
well I yeah I think so I think the guys

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
well I yeah I think so I think the guys
overall<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.530> think<00:01:10.950> there'll<00:01:11.189> be

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
overall like it I think there'll be

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.280 
overall like it I think there'll be
people<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.729> don't<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.390> i<00:01:12.540> think<00:01:12.600> our<00:01:12.930> 60

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
people that don't like it i think our 60

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.750 
people that don't like it i think our 60
kilos<00:01:13.650> aren't<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.159> happy<00:01:14.189> because

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
kilos aren't going to be happy because

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.999 
kilos aren't going to be happy because
essentially<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.570> weight<00:01:15.810> class<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.860> know

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
essentially that weight class you know

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.660 
essentially that weight class you know
has<00:01:17.430> been<00:01:17.759> eliminated<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.049> olympic<00:01:19.439> games

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
has been eliminated at the olympic games

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.740 
has been eliminated at the olympic games
so<00:01:20.670> they'll<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> start<00:01:21.330> making<00:01:21.479> some

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
so they'll have to start making some

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.289 
so they'll have to start making some
movement<00:01:22.170> up<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.470> down<00:01:22.580> of<00:01:23.580> course<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.119> world

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
movement up and down of course the world

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.609 
movement up and down of course the world
championship<00:01:24.900> they'll<00:01:25.049> still<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.290> able<00:01:25.470> to

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
championship they'll still be able to

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.960 
championship they'll still be able to
compete<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.189> they'll<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.640> find<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.939> way

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
compete and they'll have to find a way

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.960 
compete and they'll have to find a way
to<00:01:27.090> go<00:01:27.210> up<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.479> down<00:01:27.600> after<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.939> yeah<00:01:29.939> I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
to go up and down after that but yeah I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.640 
to go up and down after that but yeah I
think<00:01:30.150> that's<00:01:30.390> where<00:01:30.509> we're<00:01:30.659> at<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.110> let's

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
think that's where we're at so let's

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.940 
think that's where we're at so let's
talk<00:01:31.829> about<00:01:31.890> some<00:01:32.220> rules<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.729> mean<00:01:32.909> obviously

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
talk about some rules I mean obviously

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.289 
talk about some rules I mean obviously
there<00:01:34.950> was<00:01:35.070> some<00:01:35.250> dramatic<00:01:35.430> changes<00:01:35.759> from

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
there was some dramatic changes from

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.330 
there was some dramatic changes from
that<00:01:36.509> last<00:01:36.750> year's<00:01:37.140> rules<00:01:37.590> which<00:01:37.920> were

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that last year's rules which were

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.660 
that last year's rules which were
obviously<00:01:39.180> an<00:01:39.329> improvement<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:40.549> just<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
obviously an improvement but just a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.090 
obviously an improvement but just a
couple<00:01:41.850> 10-point<00:01:42.509> technical<00:01:43.409> fall<00:01:43.619> for<00:01:43.890> free

couple 10-point technical fall for free

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.850 
couple 10-point technical fall for free
stuff<00:01:44.310> yeah<00:01:45.030> TenPoint<00:01:45.689> technical<00:01:46.229> fall<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
stuff yeah TenPoint technical fall the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.249 
stuff yeah TenPoint technical fall the
bottom<00:01:47.159> line<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.700> gary<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> rules

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
bottom line to gary is that the rules

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.789 
bottom line to gary is that the rules
are<00:01:49.439> simpler<00:01:50.130> they're<00:01:50.549> better<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.649> in<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
are simpler they're better and in the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.289 
are simpler they're better and in the
last<00:01:53.040> time<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> changed<00:01:53.640> them<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.030> now<00:01:54.119> this

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
last time you changed them and now this

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.510 
last time you changed them and now this
time<00:01:54.570> we've<00:01:54.810> eliminated<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.740> lot<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.340> little

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
time we've eliminated a lot of little

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.700 
time we've eliminated a lot of little
nuance<00:01:56.909> rules<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.540> three<00:01:57.750> point<00:01:58.079> moves<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.590> a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
match a five-point move into match those

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.590 
match a five-point move into match those
are<00:02:01.140> gone<00:02:01.350> now<00:02:01.939> TenPoint<00:02:02.939> technical<00:02:03.420> fall<00:02:03.570> I

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
are gone now TenPoint technical fall I

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.179 
are gone now TenPoint technical fall I
think<00:02:03.899> everybody<00:02:04.259> was<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.500> agreement<00:02:04.680> we<00:02:05.040> need

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
think everybody was in agreement we need

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.809 
think everybody was in agreement we need
to<00:02:05.340> raise<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.759> up<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:06.030> little<00:02:06.210> bit<00:02:06.420> we<00:02:06.689> did<00:02:07.819> we

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
to raise that up a little bit we did we

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.710 
to raise that up a little bit we did we
eliminated<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.390> five<00:02:09.739> count<00:02:10.739> hold<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.910> par

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
eliminated the five count hold on par

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.590 
eliminated the five count hold on par
Terre<00:02:12.989> when<00:02:13.349> you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
Terre when you

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.760 
Terre when you
so<00:02:13.690> on<00:02:13.840> their<00:02:13.960> back<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.350> get<00:02:14.470> an<00:02:14.590> additional

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
so on their back to get an additional

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.550 
so on their back to get an additional
point<00:02:15.220> again<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.060> think<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.690> just<00:02:16.720> simplifies

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
point again I think it just simplifies

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.350 
point again I think it just simplifies
the<00:02:17.590> rules<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.400> people<00:02:18.850> understand

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
the rules so that people understand

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.560 
the rules so that people understand
there's<00:02:19.600> not<00:02:19.810> 8<00:02:20.400> 12<00:02:21.400> different<00:02:21.760> ways<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.210> score

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
there's not 8 12 different ways to score

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.640 
there's not 8 12 different ways to score
there<00:02:22.870> are<00:02:22.960> three<00:02:23.230> or<00:02:23.320> four<00:02:23.530> or<00:02:23.620> five

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
there are three or four or five

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.800 
there are three or four or five
different<00:02:23.980> ways<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.610> score<00:02:24.970> instead<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.570> nine

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
different ways to score instead of nine

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.780 
different ways to score instead of nine
ways<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.200> win<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.590> match<00:02:26.860> now<00:02:27.280> we're<00:02:27.520> down<00:02:27.730> to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
ways to win a match now we're down to

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.510 
ways to win a match now we're down to
two<00:02:28.450> or<00:02:28.600> three<00:02:28.840> ways<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.050> win<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.410> match<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
two or three ways to win a match so the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.950 
two or three ways to win a match so the
more<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.730> can<00:02:30.940> simplify<00:02:31.270> I<00:02:31.420> think<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.780> better

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
more we can simplify I think the better

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.150 
more we can simplify I think the better
and<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.170> think<00:02:32.380> these<00:02:32.470> are<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.710> ones<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.010> we

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
and I think these are the ones that we

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.770 
and I think these are the ones that we
needed<00:02:33.340> obviously<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.090> other<00:02:34.210> one<00:02:34.390> too<00:02:34.600> that

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
needed obviously the other one too that

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.850 
needed obviously the other one too that
people<00:02:35.080> are<00:02:35.170> talking<00:02:35.200> about<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.740> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
people are talking about is the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.920 
people are talking about is the
four-point<00:02:36.370> throw<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.360> reason<00:02:37.660> we<00:02:37.750> did<00:02:37.900> that

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
four-point throw the reason we did that

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.410 
four-point throw the reason we did that
was<00:02:38.440> because<00:02:38.740> of<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.430> two-point<00:02:39.850> takedown<00:02:40.240> we

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
was because of the two-point takedown we

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.760 
was because of the two-point takedown we
felt<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:40.720> we<00:02:40.870> needed<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.260> increase<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
felt that we needed to increase the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.170 
felt that we needed to increase the
value<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.220> throw<00:02:42.400> because<00:02:42.760> we<00:02:42.910> increase

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
value of the throw because we increase

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.600 
value of the throw because we increase
the<00:02:43.210> value<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.900> takedown<00:02:44.370> relative<00:02:45.370> to

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
the value of the takedown relative to

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.970 
the value of the takedown relative to
the<00:02:45.700> push<00:02:45.880> out<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.660> that<00:02:46.960> makes<00:02:47.500> sense<00:02:47.800> to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
the push out so that makes sense to

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.010 
the push out so that makes sense to
people<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.580> throw<00:02:48.820> should<00:02:49.060> be<00:02:49.180> worth<00:02:49.330> more<00:02:49.630> we

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
people the throw should be worth more we

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.110 
people the throw should be worth more we
agree<00:02:50.290> which<00:02:50.590> should<00:02:50.770> be<00:02:50.890> worth<00:02:51.100> more<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:52.090> I

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
agree which should be worth more so I

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.330 
agree which should be worth more so I
think<00:02:52.420> overall<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.380> rules<00:02:53.590> are<00:02:53.740> simpler<00:02:54.100> and

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
think overall the rules are simpler and

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.210 
think overall the rules are simpler and
the<00:02:54.370> scoring<00:02:55.180> system<00:02:55.390> makes<00:02:56.200> more<00:02:56.470> sense<00:02:56.710> so

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
the scoring system makes more sense so

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.980 
the scoring system makes more sense so
will<00:02:57.430> we<00:02:57.580> see<00:02:57.790> more<00:02:57.970> points<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.570> when<00:02:58.660> we<00:02:58.780> see

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
will we see more points and when we see

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.290 
will we see more points and when we see
more<00:02:59.140> action<00:02:59.380> with<00:03:00.160> these<00:03:00.340> changes<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:00.970> think

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
more action with these changes I think

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.910 
more action with these changes I think
so<00:03:01.480> how<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.840> know<00:03:02.080> we<00:03:02.350> saw<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.590> at<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.770> World

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
so how you know we saw it at the World

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.350 
so how you know we saw it at the World
Championship<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.460> lot<00:03:03.670> more<00:03:03.820> scoring<00:03:04.150> of

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
Championship a lot more scoring of

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.030 
Championship a lot more scoring of
course<00:03:04.540> like<00:03:04.810> anything<00:03:05.320> we<00:03:05.500> put<00:03:05.530> new<00:03:05.800> rules

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
course like anything we put new rules

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.560 
course like anything we put new rules
and<00:03:06.340> there's<00:03:06.520> a<00:03:06.610> lot<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.760> scoring<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.360> then<00:03:07.450> as

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
and there's a lot of scoring and then as

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.180 
and there's a lot of scoring and then as
people<00:03:07.720> adapt<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.380> rules<00:03:08.620> scoring

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
people adapt to the rules scoring

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.340 
people adapt to the rules scoring
decreases<00:03:09.910> but<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.510> don't<00:03:10.720> see<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.900> decreasing

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
decreases but I don't see a decreasing

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.020 
decreases but I don't see a decreasing
by<00:03:11.710> a<00:03:11.740> lot<00:03:12.010> because<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.610> think<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:12.880> have<00:03:13.000> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
by a lot because I think you have the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.730 
by a lot because I think you have the
right<00:03:13.270> incentives<00:03:13.810> in<00:03:13.900> place<00:03:13.930> by<00:03:14.680> the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
right incentives in place by the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.410 
right incentives in place by the
technical<00:03:15.250> fall<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.640> hustle<00:03:15.940> gets<00:03:16.180> ten

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
technical fall the hustle gets ten

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.200 
technical fall the hustle gets ten
points<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.930> get<00:03:17.020> off<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.290> mat<00:03:17.470> quicker

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
points to get off the mat quicker

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.460 
points to get off the mat quicker
obviously<00:03:19.210> the<00:03:19.390> takedown<00:03:19.840> being<00:03:20.110> more<00:03:20.320> than

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
obviously the takedown being more than

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.560 
obviously the takedown being more than
the<00:03:20.560> push<00:03:20.740> out<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.580> know<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:21.850> inherently<00:03:22.330> is

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
the push out you know that inherently is

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.560 
the push out you know that inherently is
going<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.780> create<00:03:23.020> more<00:03:23.200> scoring<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:25.300> I<00:03:25.330> think

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
going to create more scoring so I think

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.330 
going to create more scoring so I think
we're<00:03:25.690> going<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.900> see<00:03:25.930> more<00:03:26.140> scoring<00:03:26.410> yes<00:03:26.620> so

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
we're going to see more scoring yes so

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.880 
we're going to see more scoring yes so
we've<00:03:28.180> got<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.450> one-day<00:03:28.810> format<00:03:29.260> still<00:03:29.590> but<00:03:29.800> an

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
we've got a one-day format still but an

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.190 
we've got a one-day format still but an
earlier<00:03:30.220> start<00:03:30.640> there<00:03:31.270> had<00:03:31.450> been<00:03:31.630> discussion

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
earlier start there had been discussion

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.740 
earlier start there had been discussion
about<00:03:32.260> 2day<00:03:32.710> format<00:03:33.160> yeah<00:03:33.850> yeah<00:03:34.240> and<00:03:34.510> 30

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
about 2day format yeah yeah and 30

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.570 
about 2day format yeah yeah and 30
minutes<00:03:35.140> between<00:03:35.320> matches<00:03:35.710> yeah<00:03:36.160> in<00:03:36.340> 30

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
minutes between matches yeah in 30

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.580 
minutes between matches yeah in 30
minutes<00:03:36.820> recovery<00:03:37.330> which<00:03:37.480> i<00:03:37.600> think<00:03:37.660> is<00:03:37.840> good<00:03:38.110> I

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
minutes recovery which i think is good I

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.460 
minutes recovery which i think is good I
think<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.880> week<00:03:40.480> if<00:03:40.750> we<00:03:40.840> can<00:03:40.990> try<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.230> wrestle

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
think that week if we can try to wrestle

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.990 
think that week if we can try to wrestle
those<00:03:41.680> quarterfinal<00:03:42.250> matches<00:03:42.430> at<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.790> same

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
those quarterfinal matches at the same

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.430 
those quarterfinal matches at the same
time<00:03:43.240> to<00:03:43.480> give<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.720> equal<00:03:44.140> amount<00:03:44.320> of

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
time to give the equal amount of

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.380 
time to give the equal amount of
recovery<00:03:44.830> heading<00:03:45.130> into<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.430> semi-finals<00:03:45.790> I

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
recovery heading into the semi-finals I

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.150 
recovery heading into the semi-finals I
think<00:03:46.960> that's<00:03:47.110> important<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.710> 30<00:03:47.890> minute

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
think that's important the 30 minute

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.970 
think that's important the 30 minute
break<00:03:48.190> will<00:03:48.490> certainly<00:03:48.760> help<00:03:49.680> they've<00:03:50.680> talked

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
break will certainly help they've talked

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.680 
break will certainly help they've talked
about<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.280> two<00:03:51.430> day<00:03:51.550> format<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.300> essentially

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
about the two day format and essentially

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.390 
about the two day format and essentially
what<00:03:52.720> they're<00:03:52.960> trying<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.350> say<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:53.770> we're

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
what they're trying to say is we're

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.970 
what they're trying to say is we're
going<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:54.970> two-day<00:03:55.330> format<00:03:55.840> but<00:03:56.320> before<00:03:56.500> we

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
going to a two-day format but before we

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.910 
going to a two-day format but before we
do<00:03:57.310> it<00:03:57.550> we<00:03:58.150> need<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.600> know<00:03:58.810> what<00:03:59.770> the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
do it we need to know what the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.860 
do it we need to know what the
boundaries<00:04:00.340> are<00:04:00.610> how<00:04:00.850> many<00:04:00.910> matches<00:04:01.480> per<00:04:01.690> hour

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
boundaries are how many matches per hour

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.410 
boundaries are how many matches per hour
how<00:04:02.320> many<00:04:02.500> entries<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.820> know<00:04:03.910> what<00:04:04.090> time<00:04:04.270> the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
how many entries you know what time the

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.880 
how many entries you know what time the

morning first session start and a 4pm
second<00:04:10.510> session<00:04:10.720> start<00:04:11.080> so<00:04:11.560> they<00:04:11.680> just<00:04:11.860> need

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
second session start so they just need

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.280 
second session start so they just need
to<00:04:12.130> work<00:04:12.310> out<00:04:12.460> the<00:04:12.700> math<00:04:12.880> of<00:04:13.210> repechage<00:04:13.600> now

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
to work out the math of repechage now

to a finalist now semifinals so they

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.690 
to a finalist now semifinals so they
need<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.610> work<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:25.000> math<00:04:25.210> out

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
need to work the math out

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.550 
need to work the math out
