00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.840
 this 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.599
 I brought from the North Caucasus 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.510
 I donâ€™t know the name but I can 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.400
 assure that it is insanely tasty meat to us 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.699
 will need quite a lot i have 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.330
 almost two kilos and as you see here 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.810
 she's such a ribs and flesh here 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.560
 separate and further we still take from 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.230
 of vegetables 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.440
 I will take two half bulbs 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.050
 eggplant carrots such a big one 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.890
 bell pepper a little cauliflower 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.989
 tomato bay leaf as spice 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.210
 parstechka well, naturally, salt and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.579
 I will definitely be a spice 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.730
 use the hop-suneli seasoning 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.530
 also i will take here so many potatoes 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.170
 I get it here 5 of these 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.960
 here is something about 500 500 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.659
 gram well and proceed to cooking 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.869
 I also want to clarify a small piece of meat 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.390
 and vegetables should be 50 to 50 that's if 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.909
 you take about two take so two 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.270
 kilograms of meat then you should about 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.700
 be as much and vegetables and vegetables you 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.710
 can vary depending on your 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.140
 taste if you don't like eggplant 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.150
 take more potatoes or 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.070
 replace and eggplant on zucchini a lot 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.189
 the original recipe is like there 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.380
 it was eggplant that was it 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.049
 here is a small note but do not proceed 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.479
 we cut the meat so the meat is cut here 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.350
 here are the pieces they should be enough 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.750
 large 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.570
 also as you can see i saved from me 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.030
 It turned out 4 ribs I love very much 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.950
 braised ribs and so I don't 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.189
 I will not use a typesetter 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.770
 use it in this dish then I 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.170
 removed all the tendons that i didn't 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.869
 liked but naturally less 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.299
 in winter, clean the carrot fat and cut it 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.909
 such thin circles and onions 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.660
 cut into such squares 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.500
 sweet pepper cut into straws but with 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.170
 eggplant here is a small nuance 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.390
 floor eggplant but I cleaned on and 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.660
 soulmate aubergine and I 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.959
 left with the skin we need it for 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.150
 order to give eggplant 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.239
 it is precisely this inherent to him 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.720
 in our dish is ready to cut a picture 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.350
 into slices shred parsley and color 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.660
 cabbage 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.420
 mine and disassemble on such here 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.840
 inflorescences since i use young 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.140
 potatoes I just wash it thoroughly and 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.440
 I will not take the skin just before 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.959
 how will I put the potatoes in the meat I 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.760
 Naturally cut it on here such 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.519
 quarters well, in general, you yourself are all 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.709
 will see of course you can use it 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.359
 old potatoes but naturally need 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.910
 clean it before putting it into the dish 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:08.150
 for cooking this dish i will 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.890
 to use such a god 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.769
 we will need such a deep pan 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.530
 with non - stick coating 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.810
 so how will we roast meat 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.630
 directly where we will and 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.000
 keep cooking our dish and so 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.970
 warming up this frying pan or 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.430
 saucepan well what do you take I'll add 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.150
 quite a bit of olive oil and I will 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.150
 to lay 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:38.730
 meat butter is already in the pan 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.340
 not at first I put hints at the bottom 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:50.290
 preservation 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:56.780
 tag on the first will fry on 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:04:00.290
 and then I see that myasco is starting to be 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.750
 golden one side we are now in front 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.930
 how to turn it over there I will add gas 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:11.510
 onion carrot and terry and overturn 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:17.330
 the next stage is sent to the meat 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:20.030
 cauliflower is not water and oil is big 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:23.150
 add them enough link 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.910
 I'm vegetable again to get up at the village 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.550
 own juice and send our 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.030
 eggplants up I want to see is hungry 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.330
 it is better not to cook the dish because 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:38.260
 roast pork like smell so that 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.140
 probably start running around a bit more 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:45.740
 absolutely not cooked now and in 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.800
 this way we close all the lid and 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.250
 waiting for when eggplant cabbage will give juice and 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.290
 we will continue to stew 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.770
 cabbage began to fry believing and 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.510
 swapped the nation and this is us 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.670
 suggests that the most 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.670
 add sweet peppers and tomatoes 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:13.600
 send 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:13.600
 and tomatoes now we are building beans 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.980
 then mix it again with a lid 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.500
 and we will continue to put out a doll 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.860
 mixed in the shower all over low heat 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.590
 I will tell you all the exact time scale 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.650
 on the eye as soon as the flight of the Christmas tree to me 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.680
 helps as soon as tomatoes and peppers 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.180
 become light it will be the time 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.120
 add potatoes 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.840
 It took about 20 minutes maybe a little 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.690
 more 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.120
 and the vegetables we became absolutely soft 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.580
 so fragrant and now I will 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.620
 add potatoes cut he look 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.020
 like that 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.750
 in large pieces I shook and there 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.210
 eyes and as I said potatoes 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.750
 young so I won't even be him 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.540
 clean 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.710
 In general, all and now this is laid here 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.610
 so here on top of meat and vegetables 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.760
 I'll add a little bit now 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:15.660
 filtered water now you will see 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.470
 I'll show you quite a bit 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.620
 how much 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.260
 and add seasoning hops-suneli I 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.470
 sprinkled seasoning somewhere added in 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.230
 Well literally schepotochku this account does not 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:31.650
 Now I mix everything like this 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:36.410
 way that the potatoes were somewhere below 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.410
 and add water 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:45.540
 such a quantity as soon as we have it 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:50.010
 saw quite a bit and stop 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:52.380
 pour now i add parsley here 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.120
 here's certainly great it would be if 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.250
 drop out this dish with cilantro but 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.980
 France unfortunately cilantro I do not have 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.080
 therefore I add only parsley 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.960
 look how incredible it is 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.930
 beauty now I close the lid and 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.360
 leave stews here in this form 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.670
 somewhere two three three I will interfere 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.340
 so that the potatoes are drained well before 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:17.190
 get ready to see what kind of 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.220
 beauty and most importantly delicious there we have 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:23.370
 It turned out this dish I love and 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.420
 often use as a main hot 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.480
 dish 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:30.180

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.260
 he has a lot of meat she is nourishing she 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.620
 aromatic 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:37.020
 there are a lot of vegetables in it and as you see 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.500
 almost everything is preparing in its own 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.930
 juice 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.390
