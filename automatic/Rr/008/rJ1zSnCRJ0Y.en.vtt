00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
this position so I didn't want to move

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.870 
this position so I didn't want to move
them<00:01:40.799> because<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.070> kinda<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.520> position

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
them because I kinda like this position

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.530 
them because I kinda like this position
for<00:01:41.970> my<00:01:42.060> paddles

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
for my paddles

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.660 
for my paddles
they're<00:01:42.960> stowed<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.439> there<00:01:43.799> out<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> way

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
they're stowed in there out of the way

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.359 
they're stowed in there out of the way
and<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.380> kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.799> leaves<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:47.159> one

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
and so that kind of leaves use one

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.249 
and so that kind of leaves use one
choice<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.909> I'd<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.270> run<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.540> over<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
choice and I'd have to run it over the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.060 
choice and I'd have to run it over the
edge<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.420> what<00:01:51.420> I've<00:01:51.540> got<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.770> I've

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
edge so what I've got going on is I've

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.780 
edge so what I've got going on is I've
mounted<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:54.530> pump<00:01:55.530> already<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.070> it's

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
mounted this pump already and it's

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.730 
mounted this pump already and it's
mounted<00:01:57.270> basically<00:01:57.990> just<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.380> plate

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
mounted basically just to this plate

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.810 
mounted basically just to this plate
right<00:01:58.920> here<00:01:59.360> take<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.390> apart<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
right here take it apart and it is a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.910 
right here take it apart and it is a
quick<00:02:03.329> detach<00:02:03.960> system<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:04.950> me<00:02:05.189> go<00:02:06.920> basically

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
quick detach system so me go basically

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.469 
quick detach system so me go basically
two<00:02:08.280> screws<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.789> third<00:02:08.970> screw<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.300> already

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
two screws the third screw is already

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.080 
two screws the third screw is already
off<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.810> base<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.379> we're<00:02:11.069> not<00:02:11.160> gonna<00:02:11.340> mess

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.710 
off the base so we're not gonna mess
with<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.319> just<00:02:13.319> like<00:02:13.440> that

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
and it's got plenty of clearance for

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.730 
and it's got plenty of clearance for
everything<00:02:18.710> put<00:02:19.710> things<00:02:19.890> back<00:02:20.070> in<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:22.230> locks

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
everything put things back in the locks

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.130 
everything put things back in the locks
right<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.730> got<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.960> going<00:02:25.110> to

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
right in so I got that going to going to

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.690 
right in so I got that going to going to
wash<00:02:25.290> out<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.500> boat<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> little<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.640> a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
wash out the boat it's a little it's a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.360 
wash out the boat it's a little it's a
little<00:02:26.730> dirty<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:28.860> does<00:02:28.980> sit<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
little dirty and it does sit on the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.180 
little dirty and it does sit on the
floor<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.970> boat<00:02:30.210> way<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.930> have<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.320> it's<00:02:31.920> really

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
floor the boat way I have it it's really

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.100 
floor the boat way I have it it's really
messy<00:02:32.400> right<00:02:32.580> now<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:32.810> most<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.990> weights

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
messy right now but most of the weights

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.660 
messy right now but most of the weights
towards<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.530> back<00:02:34.710> so<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.980> back<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.310> going<00:02:35.610> to

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
towards the back so the back is going to

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.040 
towards the back so the back is going to
be<00:02:35.730> asking<00:02:36.030> heavy<00:02:36.300> when<00:02:36.630> it's<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.900> water

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
be asking heavy when it's in the water

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.070 
be asking heavy when it's in the water
and<00:02:38.000> we<00:02:39.000> also<00:02:39.150> got<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.450> battery<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.900> back

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
and we also got the battery in the back

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.210 
and we also got the battery in the back
used<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.190> be<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.370> front<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:44.010> kind<00:02:44.190> of

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
used to be the front so just kind of

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.800 
used to be the front so just kind of
look<00:02:44.370> at<00:02:44.460> it<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.670> way<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.820> have<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.030> rigged<00:02:45.630> up

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
look at it the way I have it rigged up

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.810 
look at it the way I have it rigged up
it's<00:02:46.530> going<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.740> pump<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.160> way<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.670> it's

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
it's going to pump this way and it's

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.790 
it's going to pump this way and it's
just<00:02:47.970> going<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.210> come<00:02:48.420> out<00:02:48.590> just<00:02:49.590> going<00:02:49.740> to

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
just going to come out just going to

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.320 
just going to come out just going to
basically<00:02:50.310> shoot<00:02:50.580> out<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.820> back

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
basically shoot out the back

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.170 
basically shoot out the back
don't<00:02:52.020> worry<00:02:52.200> about<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.470> motor<00:02:52.970> or<00:02:53.970> any

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
don't worry about the motor or any

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.110 
don't worry about the motor or any
engine<00:02:54.480> it's<00:02:54.750> fine<00:02:54.960> and<00:02:55.170> then<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.160> got<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:59.120> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
engine it's fine and then I got the the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.470 
engine it's fine and then I got the the
transom<00:03:00.630> light<00:03:01.820> holders<00:03:02.820> basically<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.360> same

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
transom light holders basically the same

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.690 
transom light holders basically the same
thing<00:03:03.690> as<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.980> this<00:03:04.980> piece<00:03:05.190> right<00:03:05.310> here<00:03:05.370> but

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
thing as this this piece right here but

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.130 
thing as this this piece right here but
I<00:03:05.730> just<00:03:05.910> have<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.060> piece<00:03:06.420> one<00:03:06.690> holding<00:03:07.020> it

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
I just have to piece one holding it

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.940 
I just have to piece one holding it
right<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.410> top

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
right on top

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.430 
right on top
one<00:03:08.460> holding<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.880> right<00:03:09.000> on<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.270> bottom<00:03:09.440> right

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
one holding it right on the bottom right

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.060 
one holding it right on the bottom right
there<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:12.150> that's<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.140> mean<00:03:13.170> that's<00:03:13.890> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
there and that's it I mean that's the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.530 
there and that's it I mean that's the
whole<00:03:14.220> installation<00:03:14.520> of<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.970> hardware<00:03:15.360> side

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
whole installation of the hardware side

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.240 
whole installation of the hardware side
on<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.140> electrical<00:03:16.530> side<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:17.550> plan<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.330> uh

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
on the electrical side and plan to uh

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.370 
on the electrical side and plan to uh
since<00:03:20.250> John<00:03:20.550> boats<00:03:20.760> are<00:03:20.880> not<00:03:21.030> really<00:03:21.360> built<00:03:22.140> to

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
since John boats are not really built to

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.940 
since John boats are not really built to
hide<00:03:22.650> any<00:03:22.860> wires<00:03:24.650> first<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:25.830> was<00:03:25.920> thinking

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
hide any wires first I was thinking

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.860 
hide any wires first I was thinking
running<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.460> back<00:03:26.610> this<00:03:26.820> way<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.240> it<00:03:27.540> sneaking

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
running it back this way and it sneaking

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.860 
running it back this way and it sneaking
it<00:03:27.990> along<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.320> bottom<00:03:28.640> but<00:03:29.640> nice<00:03:30.270> box<00:03:30.570> which

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
it along the bottom but nice box which

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.890 
it along the bottom but nice box which
is<00:03:31.050> actually<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.710> this<00:03:32.070> area<00:03:32.480> as<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.570> can<00:03:33.630> see

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
is actually a this area as you can see

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.830 
is actually a this area as you can see
this<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.290> my<00:03:34.470> switches<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.240> I<00:03:36.240> do<00:03:36.480> want<00:03:36.780> to

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
this is my switches and I do want to

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.040 
this is my switches and I do want to
make<00:03:36.960> it<00:03:37.250> clutter<00:03:38.250> free<00:03:38.610> as<00:03:38.730> possible<00:03:38.960> so<00:03:39.960> what

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
make it clutter free as possible so what

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.030 
make it clutter free as possible so what
I'm<00:03:40.110> going<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.260> do<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.500> I'm<00:03:40.620> actually<00:03:40.680> going<00:03:40.980> to

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.510 
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to
run<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.430> with<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.940> hose<00:03:42.200> just<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.380> cable<00:03:44.160> tie<00:03:44.459> it

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
run it with the hose just a cable tie it

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.430 
run it with the hose just a cable tie it
all<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.880> up<00:03:45.000> let's<00:03:45.690> make<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:45.990> around<00:03:46.200> this<00:03:46.380> way

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
all the up let's make it around this way

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.610 
all the up let's make it around this way
somehow<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.630> snake<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.780> back<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.170> way<00:03:49.410> and

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
somehow and snake it back this way and

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.850 
somehow and snake it back this way and
follow<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.250> back<00:03:50.930> through<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.200> which<00:03:52.709> is

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
follow it back through this which is

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.090 
follow it back through this which is
what<00:03:53.250> I'm<00:03:53.370> already<00:03:53.550> using<00:03:54.060> for<00:03:54.240> uh<00:03:54.950> wiring<00:03:55.950> and

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
what I'm already using for uh wiring and

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.010 
what I'm already using for uh wiring and
it's<00:03:56.940> think<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.240> back<00:03:57.360> that<00:03:57.570> way<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:57.930> know

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
it's think it back that way you know

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.100 
it's think it back that way you know
make<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.350> over<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.740> my<00:03:58.920> OH<00:03:58.970> switches<00:04:00.110> that's

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
make it over to my OH switches that's

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.780 
make it over to my OH switches that's
going<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.320> be<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.440> game<00:04:01.590> plan<00:04:04.459> okay<00:04:05.459> so<00:04:05.520> what

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
going to be a game plan okay so what

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.210 
going to be a game plan okay so what
I've<00:04:05.910> done<00:04:06.180> is<00:04:06.240> I<00:04:06.570> hold<00:04:07.200> my<00:04:07.410> control<00:04:07.800> panel<00:04:07.830> out

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
I've done is I hold my control panel out

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.970 
I've done is I hold my control panel out
I've<00:04:09.060> wired<00:04:09.330> it<00:04:09.540> up<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.840> third<00:04:10.050> switch<00:04:10.500> and

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
I've wired it up to the third switch and

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.630 
I've wired it up to the third switch and
then<00:04:11.430> power<00:04:12.180> goes<00:04:12.450> out<00:04:12.600> comes<00:04:12.990> back<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.380> this

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
then power goes out comes back to this

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.610 
then power goes out comes back to this
negative<00:04:14.640> bus<00:04:15.150> right<00:04:15.390> here<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:16.109> goes<00:04:16.140> back

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
negative bus right here and it goes back

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.890 
negative bus right here and it goes back
to<00:04:16.770> the<00:04:16.830> battery<00:04:17.010> but<00:04:17.970> it's<00:04:18.570> how<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:18.690> have<00:04:18.870> a

comes in side the seat here and it comes
out<00:04:45.350> a<00:04:45.590> wire<00:04:45.860> actually<00:04:46.070> comes<00:04:46.340> out<00:04:46.490> right<00:04:46.580> here

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
out a wire actually comes out right here

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.810 
out a wire actually comes out right here
and<00:04:47.660> actually<00:04:47.840> snakes<00:04:48.410> in<00:04:48.740> around<00:04:49.220> here<00:04:49.640> and

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
and actually snakes in around here and

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
out here and finally it tracks width of

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.990 
out here and finally it tracks width of
the<00:05:00.140> hose<00:05:00.350> so<00:05:00.740> you<00:05:00.830> can<00:05:00.980> see<00:05:01.190> it's<00:05:01.460> right<00:05:01.580> here
