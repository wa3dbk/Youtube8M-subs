this was the right item to purchase for

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.520 
this was the right item to purchase for
me<00:01:16.790> one<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.000> main<00:01:18.180> concerns<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:18.840> my<00:01:19.229> skin

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
me one of the main concerns was my skin

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.800 
me one of the main concerns was my skin
color<00:01:19.770> as<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.700> tell<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.970> am<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.330> little<00:01:21.600> bit

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
color as you can tell I am a little bit

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.020 
color as you can tell I am a little bit
darker<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:23.070> was<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> main<00:01:23.610> concern

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
darker and that was the main concern

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.440 
darker and that was the main concern
because<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.570> doesn't<00:01:24.840> work<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.140> our<00:01:25.350> dark<00:01:25.979> skin

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
because it doesn't work on our dark skin

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.749 
because it doesn't work on our dark skin
it<00:01:27.450> could<00:01:27.600> actually<00:01:27.780> damage<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.650> skin<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
it could actually damage the skin if you

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.740 
it could actually damage the skin if you
use<00:01:29.970> dark<00:01:30.329> skin<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.250> asked<00:01:32.820> them<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.240> test<00:01:33.479> me

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
use dark skin so I asked them to test me

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.090 
use dark skin so I asked them to test me
and<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:34.110> they<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.619> take<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.829> little

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
and what they do is they take a little

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.960 
and what they do is they take a little
petra<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.970> they<00:01:36.540> put<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.020> your<00:01:37.140> skin<00:01:37.320> and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
petra and they put it on your skin and

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.969

gotta let me do a little test patch and

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.180 
gotta let me do a little test patch and
when<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.810> mean<00:02:43.049> my<00:02:43.140> test<00:02:43.410> patch<00:02:43.680> was<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.160> I

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
when I mean my test patch was that I

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.210 
when I mean my test patch was that I
shaved<00:02:44.579> a<00:02:44.700> little<00:02:44.819> area<00:02:45.750> right<00:02:45.810> here<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.500> tested

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
shaved a little area right here I tested

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.849 
shaved a little area right here I tested
it<00:02:47.280> first<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.090> was<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:49.049> was<00:02:49.109> rest<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:49.799> I

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
it first and it was it was rest so I

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.099 
it first and it was it was rest so I
thought<00:02:50.069> okay<00:02:50.400> right<00:02:50.940> here<00:02:51.180> address<00:02:51.660> it's<00:02:52.019> not

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
thought okay right here address it's not

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.509 
thought okay right here address it's not
going<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.379> pass<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.769> won't<00:02:52.920> be<00:02:53.010> able<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.250> do<00:02:53.370> it

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
going to pass I won't be able to do it

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.059 
going to pass I won't be able to do it
so<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.120> shaved<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.569> little<00:02:54.690> square<00:02:55.049> off<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.590> I

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
so I shaved a little square off and I

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.830 
so I shaved a little square off and I
went<00:02:56.250> again<00:02:56.489> pressed<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.359> it<00:02:57.480> was<00:02:57.629> great

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
went again pressed it and it was great

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.470 
went again pressed it and it was great
what<00:02:58.290> happens<00:02:58.799> is<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.099> when<00:02:59.489> they<00:02:59.970> tested<00:03:00.359> it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
what happens is that when they tested it

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.470 
what happens is that when they tested it
the<00:03:01.049> hair<00:03:01.319> was<00:03:01.349> on<00:03:01.739> top<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.069> my<00:03:02.310> skin<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.000> that

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
the hair was on top of my skin and that

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.289 
the hair was on top of my skin and that
caused<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.530> detect<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.579> darker<00:03:06.060> shade<00:03:06.090> of

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
caused it to detect a darker shade of

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.629 
caused it to detect a darker shade of
skin<00:03:06.569> so<00:03:07.109> it<00:03:07.139> wasn't<00:03:07.799> necessarily<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.489> I

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
skin so it wasn't necessarily that I

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.059 
skin so it wasn't necessarily that I
failed<00:03:09.389> it<00:03:09.959> was<00:03:10.139> just<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.470> all<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.769> hairs

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
failed it was just that all the hairs

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.960 
failed it was just that all the hairs
really<00:03:11.519> cost<00:03:11.940> dark<00:03:12.450> area<00:03:13.260> on<00:03:13.680> my<00:03:13.859> arm<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:14.430> when

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
really cost dark area on my arm and when

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.849 
really cost dark area on my arm and when
tested<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.780> really<00:03:16.049> was<00:03:16.200> darker<00:03:16.590> than<00:03:16.620> it

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
tested it really was darker than it

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.770
