00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.590
 for heart muscle preservation in a diet 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.660
 should be calories instead of every day 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.080
 save one day the week almost 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.730
 because then you have two days on those 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.500
 is again and then they are 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.060
 Glykogenspeicher should follow again 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.490
 you do not sacrifice performance in training 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.320
 suffer power in things 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.530
 or performance in training I give you 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.360
 quite right it is quite an alternative 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.340
 just like a song one day fixed or 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.170
 maybe only to be done there is yes 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.570
 it stop it or so these are these 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.190
 programs that are there the more I do 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.289
 but I have to say honestly in 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.760
 last days weeks what is now 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.760
 It was always apologetic 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.460
 the more I meet in the last 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.550
 and weeks and months with the topics 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.439
 glycogen aces have explained 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.299
 with the theme of nolito genesis 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.909
 I have to explain to you 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.799
 I honestly say that this 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.270
 rey did not necessarily say like I say 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.960
 give them that now that rey summed them up 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:26.070
 not the optimum for ours 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.350
 Muscle preserving the human body has 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.479
 these processes for example 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.840
 especially now in the case it is 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.090
 the bells are made in the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.500
 biochemical theory in the night to 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.100
 example is already increased 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:46.530
 that means this is almost straight 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.610
 This glycogen acse is a process of 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.409
 is in my opinion 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.189
 and at least of the biochemical 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.219
 theory ago so dangerous for the muscle 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.820
 I do not necessarily get that 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.670
 would challenge 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.930
 To be honest, there is security 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.640
 now again quite a lot of me 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.040
 contradict and internet a firm 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.869
 fans we will be there too 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.090
 do not disagree kapek loading fans 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.880
 because they at least eat something 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.590
 other 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:19.220
 I would not do it 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.030
 I would not drive a one day 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.990
 or do that 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.360
 no i would not be completely honest with me 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.120
 Do not think that's the best for you 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.400
 our muscle is pure from the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.400
 theory fro the gluco neo enjoy
