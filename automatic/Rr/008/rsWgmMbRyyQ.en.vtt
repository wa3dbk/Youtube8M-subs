good<00:00:14.460> morning<00:00:14.700> everyone<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.900> question<00:00:16.500> of

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
good morning everyone the question of

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.349 
good morning everyone the question of
why<00:00:16.859> some<00:00:17.310> people<00:00:17.460> are<00:00:17.670> kinder<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.300> more

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
why some people are kinder and more

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.450 
why some people are kinder and more
trustworthy<00:00:18.900> than<00:00:19.140> others<00:00:19.560> has<00:00:19.859> perplexed

trustworthy than others has perplexed

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.480 
trustworthy than others has perplexed

biological and social sciences has begun

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.019 
biological and social sciences has begun
to<00:00:27.960> suggest<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.529> part<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.039> answer<00:00:29.220> lies

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
to suggest that part of the answer lies

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.049 
to suggest that part of the answer lies
at<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.240> neurobiology<00:00:31.430> oxytocin<00:00:32.430> which<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
at the neurobiology oxytocin which is a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.940 
at the neurobiology oxytocin which is a
chemical<00:00:33.510> messenger<00:00:33.930> created<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> brain

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
chemical messenger created in the brain

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.650 
chemical messenger created in the brain
has<00:00:35.489> been<00:00:35.670> especially<00:00:35.910> linked<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.570> this

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
has been especially linked to this

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.810 
has been especially linked to this
question<00:00:37.140> because<00:00:37.590> research<00:00:38.219> has<00:00:38.250> begun<00:00:38.670> to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
question because research has begun to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.330 
question because research has begun to
show<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.239> higher<00:00:39.450> levels<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.930> oxytocin

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
show that higher levels of oxytocin

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.369 
show that higher levels of oxytocin
actually<00:00:41.340> promote<00:00:41.610> greater<00:00:41.820> trust<00:00:42.379> empathy

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
actually promote greater trust empathy

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.220 
actually promote greater trust empathy
generosity<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.460> sacrifice<00:00:45.300> amongst<00:00:45.629> people

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
generosity and sacrifice amongst people

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.340 
generosity and sacrifice amongst people
now<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> way<00:00:46.950> oxytocin<00:00:47.430> works<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.960> it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
now the way oxytocin works is that it

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.139 
now the way oxytocin works is that it
relies<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:50.039> these<00:00:50.250> receptor<00:00:50.700> sites<00:00:50.910> within

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
relies on these receptor sites within

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.299 
relies on these receptor sites within
the<00:00:51.270> brain<00:00:51.510> now<00:00:52.289> given<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.739> critical<00:00:53.160> role

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the brain now given this critical role

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.490 
the brain now given this critical role
of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> receptors<00:00:54.059> some<00:00:54.750> researchers<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
of the receptors some researchers in the

five seven six a very cold name can have
two<00:01:25.439> things<00:01:25.650> out<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.369> could<00:01:26.520> have

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
two things out of it you could have

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.990 
two things out of it you could have
either<00:01:26.880> G<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.659> an<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.799> all<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.310> two<00:01:29.729> copies

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.759 
the way we tested this hypothesis well
you<00:02:08.539> brought<00:02:08.720> people<00:02:08.959> into<00:02:09.200> our<00:02:09.379> lab<00:02:09.560> for

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
you brought people into our lab for

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.229 
you brought people into our lab for
romantic<00:02:10.220> couples<00:02:10.489> and<00:02:10.670> we<00:02:10.789> asked<00:02:11.000> them<00:02:11.209> to

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
romantic couples and we asked them to

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.750 
romantic couples and we asked them to
engage<00:02:11.480> in<00:02:11.660> conversations<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.769> suffering<00:02:13.250> so

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
engage in conversations of suffering so

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.550 
engage in conversations of suffering so
here<00:02:14.000> we<00:02:14.150> have<00:02:14.269> each<00:02:14.480> person<00:02:14.750> listening<00:02:15.349> to

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
here we have each person listening to

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.289 
here we have each person listening to
their<00:02:16.010> partner<00:02:16.400> talk<00:02:16.580> about<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:16.849> time<00:02:17.150> of

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
their partner talk about a time of

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.759 
their partner talk about a time of
personal<00:02:17.599> suffering<00:02:18.080> we<00:02:18.200> reason<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:18.620> would

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
personal suffering we reason this would

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.860 
personal suffering we reason this would
be<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.860> perfect<00:02:19.400> milieu<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.299> see<00:02:20.540> whether

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
be a perfect milieu to see whether

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.530 
be a perfect milieu to see whether
people<00:02:21.230> act<00:02:21.799> kindly<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.580> trustworthy<00:02:23.360> and

people act kindly and trustworthy and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.110 
people act kindly and trustworthy and
compassionately<00:02:24.260> or<00:02:24.410> not<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.519> then<00:02:25.730> we<00:02:25.879> took

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
compassionately or not so then we took

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.869 
compassionately or not so then we took
these<00:02:26.330> videos<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.049> we<00:02:27.410> isolated<00:02:27.920> 20<00:02:28.400> second

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
these videos and we isolated 20 second

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.000 
these videos and we isolated 20 second
chunks<00:02:29.239> we<00:02:29.629> took<00:02:29.780> out<00:02:29.959> all<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.440> sound<00:02:30.709> and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
chunks we took out all of the sound and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.580 
chunks we took out all of the sound and
we<00:02:31.519> showed<00:02:31.730> only<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.390> person<00:02:32.750> listening<00:02:32.989> and

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.869 
then we brought in 120 new people and we
showed<00:02:36.110> them<00:02:36.260> these<00:02:36.410> 23<00:02:37.010> videos<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.519> we<00:02:37.579> asked

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
showed them these 23 videos and we asked

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.030 
showed them these 23 videos and we asked
how<00:02:38.390> trustworthy<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.260> compassionate<00:02:39.829> and

how trustworthy and compassionate and
kind<00:02:40.310> are<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.030> people<00:02:41.269> in<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.450> videos<00:02:41.780> we

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
kind are the people in the videos we

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.319 
kind are the people in the videos we
told<00:02:42.590> them<00:02:42.709> nothing<00:02:43.040> about<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.579> contacts<00:02:44.000> and

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
remarkable was the people in the videos

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.330 
remarkable was the people in the videos
who<00:02:52.040> had<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.549> Gees<00:02:52.910> on<00:02:53.269> this<00:02:54.340> oxytocin

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
who had to Gees on this oxytocin

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.220 
who had to Gees on this oxytocin
receptor<00:02:55.730> gene<00:02:55.940> were<00:02:56.390> rated<00:02:56.780> as<00:02:56.930> more

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
receptor gene were rated as more

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.869 
receptor gene were rated as more
pro-social<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:58.010> trustworthy<00:02:58.489> than<00:02:58.609> people

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
pro-social and trustworthy than people

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.259 
pro-social and trustworthy than people
who<00:02:59.060> had<00:02:59.660> the<00:03:00.379> eighth<00:03:00.640> one<00:03:01.640> its<00:03:01.790> copies<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.209> the

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
who had the eighth one its copies of the

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.869 
who had the eighth one its copies of the
a<00:03:02.299> now<00:03:03.260> furthermore<00:03:03.859> all<00:03:04.190> these<00:03:04.459> differences

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
a now furthermore all these differences

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.809 
a now furthermore all these differences
were<00:03:05.060> explained<00:03:05.660> by<00:03:06.260> behaviors<00:03:06.890> in<00:03:07.430> terms<00:03:07.459> of

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
were explained by behaviors in terms of

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.849 
were explained by behaviors in terms of
head<00:03:08.000> nods<00:03:08.209> eye<00:03:08.480> contact<00:03:09.079> and<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:09.470> on<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.709> so

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
head nods eye contact and so on and so

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.559 
head nods eye contact and so on and so
forth<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.280> so<00:03:10.340> what<00:03:10.940> we<00:03:11.060> show<00:03:11.299> is<00:03:11.540> that

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
forth and so what we show is that

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.750 
forth and so what we show is that
people's<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:12.410> tuitions<00:03:12.799> is<00:03:12.980> remarkable<00:03:13.670> in

people's and tuitions is remarkable in

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.220 
people's and tuitions is remarkable in
its<00:03:13.849> ability<00:03:14.329> to<00:03:14.359> detect<00:03:14.630> genetic

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
its ability to detect genetic

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.410 
its ability to detect genetic
differences<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.799> genes<00:03:16.549> are<00:03:16.880> easily

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
differences and genes are easily

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.620 
differences and genes are easily
expressed<00:03:17.840> thank<00:03:18.230> you<00:03:18.319> very<00:03:18.440> much
