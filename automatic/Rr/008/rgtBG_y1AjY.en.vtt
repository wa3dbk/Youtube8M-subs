00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
really cold you with her so this is the

really cold you with her so this is the
outcome<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.970> I<00:01:37.240> don't<00:01:37.479> actually<00:01:37.720> think<00:01:37.960> it's

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
outcome and I don't actually think it's

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.380 
outcome and I don't actually think it's
particularly<00:01:40.060> made<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.509> any<00:01:40.720> lighter

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
particularly made it any lighter

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.790 
particularly made it any lighter
although<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.569> does<00:01:43.780> what<00:01:43.960> really<00:01:44.350> well<00:01:44.500> as<00:01:44.770> a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
although it does what really well as a

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.550 
although it does what really well as a
deep<00:01:45.039> conditioner<00:01:45.539> it's<00:01:46.539> kind<00:01:46.929> of<00:01:47.080> like<00:01:47.200> you

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
deep conditioner it's kind of like you

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.899 
deep conditioner it's kind of like you
know<00:01:47.590> when<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:47.950> die<00:01:48.100> your<00:01:48.280> hair<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.759> get

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
know when you die your hair and you get

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.180 
know when you die your hair and you get
that<00:01:48.940> little<00:01:49.319> pack<00:01:50.319> of<00:01:50.350> conditioner<00:01:51.009> in<00:01:51.159> the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
that little pack of conditioner in the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.630 
that little pack of conditioner in the
box<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:52.630> kind<00:01:52.960> of<00:01:53.020> reminded<00:01:53.470> me<00:01:53.530> of<00:01:53.860> that<00:01:54.130> as<00:01:54.429> in

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
box it kind of reminded me of that as in

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.260 
box it kind of reminded me of that as in
the<00:01:54.759> consistency<00:01:56.520> when<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.640> smell<00:01:57.909> as<00:01:58.090> well

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
the consistency when the smell as well

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.779 
the consistency when the smell as well
but<00:01:58.630> no<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.710> felt<00:01:59.920> really<00:02:00.100> nice<00:02:00.340> as<00:02:00.580> I<00:02:00.700> was

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
but no it felt really nice as I was

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.529 
but no it felt really nice as I was
washing<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.149> up<00:02:01.299> and<00:02:03.149> my<00:02:04.149> hair's<00:02:04.390> pretty

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
washing it up and my hair's pretty

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.300 
washing it up and my hair's pretty
damaged<00:02:04.929> anyway<00:02:05.229> obviously<00:02:05.530> because<00:02:06.100> of<00:02:06.220> all

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
damaged anyway obviously because of all

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.279 
damaged anyway obviously because of all
the<00:02:06.399> bleaching<00:02:06.610> but<00:02:07.569> you<00:02:07.780> know<00:02:07.899> what<00:02:07.929> it

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
the bleaching but you know what it

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.250 
the bleaching but you know what it
actually<00:02:08.410> feels<00:02:08.709> really<00:02:08.860> soft<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:10.049> I<00:02:13.260> think

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
actually feels really soft and I think

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.259 
actually feels really soft and I think
maybe<00:02:14.709> if<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.160> could<00:02:15.489> purchase<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:16.090> for<00:02:16.739> Red's<00:02:17.739> I

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
maybe if I could purchase it for Red's I

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.509 
maybe if I could purchase it for Red's I
might<00:02:19.269> do<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.450> because<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:20.190> makes<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.370> feel

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
might do that because it makes it feel

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.870 
might do that because it makes it feel
really<00:02:21.820> nice

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.660
