00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
because i don't have an algae eater

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.160 
because i don't have an algae eater
anymore<00:00:27.260> there's<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.349> lot<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.789> mom<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.210> garbage

in<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.710> tank<00:00:32.690> my<00:00:33.690> plants<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.260> gone<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.680> crap

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
in this tank my plants have gone to crap

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.319 
in this tank my plants have gone to crap
because<00:00:36.020> there's<00:00:37.020> nobody<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.530> clean<00:00:37.770> them<00:00:38.329> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329

I think I found the culprit of the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.090 
I think I found the culprit of the
bacteria<00:00:45.480> or<00:00:45.660> whatever<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.200> fungus<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.950> you

lot and the I don't know how the coolies
can<00:03:19.280> handle<00:03:19.610> it<00:03:19.670> because<00:03:19.790> it's<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.180> scale<00:03:20.450> this

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600
