the<00:01:55.829> leader<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> group<00:01:56.670> they<00:01:57.180> grow<00:01:57.450> very

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the leader of the group they grow very

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.870 
the leader of the group they grow very
quickly<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.950> grow<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> bunch<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.729> them

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
quickly so you can grow a bunch of them

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.120 
quickly so you can grow a bunch of them
as<00:02:00.060> quickly<00:02:00.990> as<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.229> need<00:02:01.500> them<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.799> replace

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
as quickly as you need them and replace

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.490 
as quickly as you need them and replace
the<00:02:02.340> ones<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.790> die<00:02:03.030> they<00:02:03.540> tend<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.049> panic

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the ones that die they tend not to panic

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.830 
the ones that die they tend not to panic
which<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.430> kind<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:05.969> important<00:02:06.420> when<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.659> have

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
which is kind of important when you have

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.300 
which is kind of important when you have
something<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.439> captivity<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.069> you're

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
something in captivity that you're

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.600 
something in captivity that you're
saying<00:02:08.489> breed<00:02:08.789> breed<00:02:09.149> here's<00:02:09.840> some<00:02:10.020> food<00:02:10.229> and

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
saying breed breed here's some food and

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.979 
saying breed breed here's some food and
probably<00:02:11.610> most<00:02:11.730> important<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.239> all<00:02:12.360> they<00:02:12.900> have

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
probably most important of all they have

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.210 
probably most important of all they have
a

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
a

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.190 
a

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
this position which means they won't

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.020 
this position which means they won't
attack<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.740> every<00:02:15.950> time<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.250> go<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.790> take

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
attack you every time you go in to take

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.760 
attack you every time you go in to take
them<00:02:17.240> their<00:02:17.420> food<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:17.810> put<00:02:18.080> all<00:02:18.200> these<00:02:18.440> six

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
them their food you put all these six

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.190 
them their food you put all these six
factors<00:02:19.190> together<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.450> have<00:02:20.630> yourself<00:02:20.780> a

factors together and you have yourself a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
aggressive and that really means that

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.180 
aggressive and that really means that
you<00:02:41.270> can't<00:02:41.780> domesticate<00:02:42.440> them<00:02:42.590> easily<00:02:42.800> but

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
you can't domesticate them easily but

you can't domesticate them easily but
you<00:02:43.220> can't<00:02:43.520> blame<00:02:43.790> zebras<00:02:44.420> for<00:02:44.690> their<00:02:44.870> stripes

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610

see<00:02:46.640> zebras<00:02:47.390> evolved<00:02:47.900> on<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.200> African<00:02:48.709> plain

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
see zebras evolved on the African plain

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.460 
see zebras evolved on the African plain
and<00:02:49.340> they<00:02:49.640> evolved<00:02:50.120> as<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.300> food<00:02:50.900> source<00:02:51.170> for

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
and they evolved as a food source for

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.350 
and they evolved as a food source for
lions<00:02:51.890> he<00:02:52.340> was<00:02:52.520> don't<00:02:52.670> want<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.000> be<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.120> food

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
lions he was don't want to be a food

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.360 
lions he was don't want to be a food
source<00:02:53.570> for<00:02:53.690> lions<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:54.620> since<00:02:54.950> they<00:02:55.070> have<00:02:55.220> to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
source for lions so since they have to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.699 
source for lions so since they have to
fend<00:02:55.610> off<00:02:55.760> these<00:02:56.060> apex<00:02:56.540> predators<00:02:57.110> on<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.320> daily

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
fend off these apex predators on a daily

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:58.900 
fend off these apex predators on a daily
basis<00:02:58.070> they've<00:02:58.490> learned<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.760> be<00:02:58.880> very

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
basis they've learned to be very

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.510 
basis they've learned to be very
aggressive<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.290> kick<00:03:00.590> really<00:03:01.130> really

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
aggressive and to kick really really

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.240 
aggressive and to kick really really
hard<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:01.970> fact<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.720> zebra<00:03:03.200> can<00:03:03.380> kick<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.620> lion<00:03:04.040> to

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
hard in fact a zebra can kick a lion to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.830 
hard in fact a zebra can kick a lion to
death<00:03:04.490> so<00:03:04.700> just<00:03:04.940> think<00:03:05.180> about<00:03:05.300> what<00:03:05.630> it<00:03:05.660> could

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
death so just think about what it could

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.960 
death so just think about what it could
do<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.170> human<00:03:06.230> head<00:03:06.830> they<00:03:07.490> also<00:03:07.640> have<00:03:07.940> a

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
do to a human head they also have a

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.030 
do to a human head they also have a
really<00:03:08.270> nasty<00:03:08.510> habit<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.170> biting<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.860> not

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
really nasty habit of biting and not

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.400 
really nasty habit of biting and not
letting<00:03:10.400> go<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:11.209> put<00:03:11.420> all<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.660> together<00:03:11.870> if

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
letting go you put all that together if

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.560 
letting go you put all that together if
you<00:03:12.620> go<00:03:12.740> to<00:03:12.800> take<00:03:13.070> a<00:03:13.100> zebra<00:03:13.610> its<00:03:13.820> food<00:03:14.120> while

you go to take a zebra its food while

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.030 
you go to take a zebra its food while
you're<00:03:14.660> trying<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.959> domesticate<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.650> you're

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
you're trying to domesticate it you're

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.340 
you're trying to domesticate it you're
in<00:03:16.190> for<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.430> big<00:03:16.670> surprise<00:03:16.910> all<00:03:17.630> of<00:03:17.690> this<00:03:18.050> about

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
in for a big surprise all of this about

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.530 
in for a big surprise all of this about
their<00:03:18.530> disposition<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.489> tendency<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.330> panic

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
their disposition and tendency to panic

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.750 
their disposition and tendency to panic
frankly<00:03:21.110> it's<00:03:21.440> not<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.739> mention<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:22.280> they

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
frankly it's not to mention that they

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.690 
frankly it's not to mention that they
are<00:03:22.790> too<00:03:23.269> small<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.690> ride<00:03:24.280> zebras<00:03:25.280> backs

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
are too small to ride zebras backs

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.880 
are too small to ride zebras backs
aren't<00:03:26.180> involved<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.780> allow<00:03:27.050> a<00:03:27.080> human<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.709> ride

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
aren't involved to allow a human to ride

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.190 
aren't involved to allow a human to ride
along<00:03:28.190> or<00:03:28.430> carry<00:03:28.790> even<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.180> lot<00:03:29.330> of<00:03:29.480> cargo<00:03:29.720> and

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
along or carry even a lot of cargo and

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.110 
along or carry even a lot of cargo and
you<00:03:30.290> can't<00:03:30.560> properly<00:03:30.860> saddle<00:03:31.519> them<00:03:31.640> so<00:03:31.940> really

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
you can't properly saddle them so really

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.420 
you can't properly saddle them so really
even<00:03:32.510> if<00:03:32.750> zebras<00:03:33.170> were<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.500> nicest<00:03:33.769> animal<00:03:34.370> on
