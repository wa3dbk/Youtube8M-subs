 They want to sell a golden album 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.600
 I need a job in a fixed workplace now. 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.970

 You know that we have included 6,000 songs on 4 albums. 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.680
 How to do it? 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.830
 Hard plug and double-sided recording 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.430
 Then shorten the song! 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.720

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.730
 An Irish narrative about African hunters is called "I killed him in Kenya" 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.250
 many years ago--- 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.540

 A hippo happens to pass by 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.230
 Reflected in my eyes --- 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.680
 I killed him in Kenya... 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.700
 Nonsense --- *Note 4 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.200

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.280
 Nonsense --- 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.900
 Once there was an elephant 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.320
 I just killed him like this... 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:44.000
 I don't know how it ran into my pajamas---*Note 5 (one of the jokes of American comedian Grucho) 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.100
 If it is not him --- 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.550
 If not him---if he is not dead--- 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.670
 It may be me --- 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.980
 It may be me --- maybe it is me --- 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.280
 I killed him in Kenya... 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.630
