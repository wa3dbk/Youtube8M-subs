 getting a much more interesting frame 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.510
 neutral light filter reduces 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.730
 the amount of light entering the lens 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.350

 sensitivity close the diaphragm for 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.960
 return a neutral filter you can 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.910
 get a very interesting frame when 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.460
 even on busy streets will not be due 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.870
 moving people car and more 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.670

 idea of ​​the possibilities of modern 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.860
 optics and choose for their future 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:58.450
 masterpieces the right arsenal 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.450
