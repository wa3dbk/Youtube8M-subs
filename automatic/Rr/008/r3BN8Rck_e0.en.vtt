00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
but see I never would have ever imagined

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.950 
but see I never would have ever imagined
something<00:05:45.820> like<00:05:46.060> that<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.480> stage<00:05:46.690> went<00:05:46.870> up

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
something like that the stage went up

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.660 
something like that the stage went up
overnight<00:05:47.200> so<00:05:47.920> the<00:05:48.070> kids<00:05:48.250> were<00:05:48.370> already<00:05:48.490> gone

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
overnight so the kids were already gone

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.800 
overnight so the kids were already gone
for<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.030> day

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
for the day

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.590 
for the day
the<00:05:50.230> stage<00:05:50.500> positioning<00:05:51.190> if<00:05:52.120> I<00:05:52.240> could<00:05:52.389> show

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
the stage positioning if I could show

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.710 
the stage positioning if I could show
you<00:05:52.630> is<00:05:53.500> behind<00:05:54.280> Lancer<00:05:54.850> arena<00:05:55.240> you<00:05:55.510> see<00:05:55.630> the

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
you is behind Lancer arena you see the

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.990 
you is behind Lancer arena you see the
track<00:05:55.960> there<00:05:56.230> and<00:05:56.620> behind<00:05:57.490> it<00:05:57.639> there<00:05:57.790> in<00:05:57.910> that

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
track there and behind it there in that

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.629 
track there and behind it there in that
sort<00:05:58.540> of<00:05:58.570> little<00:05:58.720> area<00:05:59.320> I<00:05:59.590> think<00:06:00.040> the<00:06:00.220> location

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
sort of little area I think the location

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.460 
sort of little area I think the location
where<00:06:01.270> we're<00:06:01.389> gonna<00:06:01.450> play<00:06:01.720> is<00:06:01.780> it's<00:06:02.169> gonna<00:06:02.290> be

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
where we're gonna play is it's gonna be

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.500 
where we're gonna play is it's gonna be

old<00:06:04.750> gym<00:06:05.730> and<00:06:07.139> I<00:06:08.139> think<00:06:08.440> it's<00:06:08.530> gonna

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
old gym and I think it's gonna

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.780
