look at this wheel bearing it's a dead

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.070 
look at this wheel bearing it's a dead
easy<00:00:06.420> job<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:07.799> let's<00:00:07.919> get<00:00:08.130> stuck<00:00:08.340> into<00:00:08.550> it<00:00:09.080> okay

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that knot off then we'll be able to pull

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.869 
that knot off then we'll be able to pull
the<00:00:48.899> whole<00:00:49.079> hub<00:00:49.469> out<00:00:52.070> as<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.309> begin<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.699> pull

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the whole hub out as we begin to pull

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.270 
the whole hub out as we begin to pull
the<00:00:53.969> wheel<00:00:54.180> off<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.980> at<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the wheel off you can see that at a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.569 
the wheel off you can see that at a
wheel<00:00:57.059> bearing<00:00:57.480> coming<00:00:57.840> out<00:00:57.989> there<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> I'll

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
wheel bearing coming out there so I'll

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.649 
wheel bearing coming out there so I'll
just<00:00:59.789> get<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:02.329> so<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.500> stub<00:01:04.860> axle

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
just get that so this is the stub axle

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.620 
just get that so this is the stub axle
there's<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.280> inner<00:01:08.280> bearing<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.540> seal

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
there's the inner bearing and the seal

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.270 
there's the inner bearing and the seal
so<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.930> looking<00:01:13.200> at<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.560> bearing<00:01:13.950> even

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
so just looking at that bearing even

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.980 
so just looking at that bearing even
that<00:01:14.430> pitting<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.000> each<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.390> those<00:01:15.509> rollers

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that pitting on each of those rollers

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.350 
that pitting on each of those rollers
it's<00:01:16.200> enough<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.400> change<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.000> worst<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it's enough to to change it but worst of

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.520 
it's enough to to change it but worst of
all<00:01:18.509> even<00:01:18.900> look<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:20.750> one<00:01:21.750> smashed

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
all even look at that one smashed

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.210 
all even look at that one smashed
smashed<00:01:22.920> gone<00:01:25.549> okay<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.240> now<00:01:27.770> what<00:01:28.770> type<00:01:29.189> of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
smashed gone okay so now what type of

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.819 
smashed gone okay so now what type of
bearing<00:01:29.850> was<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:31.110> type<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> bearing<00:01:31.650> do

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
bearing was that what type of bearing do

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.190 
bearing was that what type of bearing do
we<00:01:31.920> need<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> shop<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.939> buy<00:01:33.200> well

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
we need to go to the shop and buy well

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.060 
we need to go to the shop and buy well
one<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.770> ways<00:01:34.920> they<00:01:35.420> determine<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:37.070> the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
one of the ways they determine it is the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.010 
one of the ways they determine it is the
axle<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.630> look<00:01:39.780> at<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.049> axle<00:01:41.840> it's<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
axle and if we look at this axle it's a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.590 
axle and if we look at this axle it's a
45<00:01:43.829> mil<00:01:44.450> square<00:01:45.450> axle<00:01:46.610> some<00:01:47.610> are<00:01:47.729> 39<00:01:48.270> mill

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
45 mil square axle some are 39 mill

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.370 
45 mil square axle some are 39 mill
round<00:01:49.220> there<00:01:50.220> are<00:01:50.340> different<00:01:50.700> sizes<00:01:51.380> right

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
round there are different sizes right

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.260 
round there are different sizes right
now<00:01:52.439> here's<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.799> tough<00:01:53.009> little<00:01:53.130> job<00:01:53.490> we've<00:01:54.149> got

used a block of wood first to knock it
down<00:02:25.970> first<00:02:26.629> and<00:02:26.959> then<00:02:27.830> it's<00:02:28.010> in<00:02:28.310> very<00:02:28.700> tight

all the way down in have these new
bearings<00:02:46.220> they've<00:02:46.880> got<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.180> be<00:02:47.269> packed<00:02:47.569> with

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
bearings they've got to be packed with

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.589 
bearings they've got to be packed with
grease<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.530> really<00:02:49.099> shoved<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.209> so<00:02:50.450> it's

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
grease and really shoved in so it's

right in through those holes getting
right<00:02:53.030> through<00:02:53.060> both<00:02:53.540> sides<00:02:53.930> this<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.799> dirty

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
right through both sides this is a dirty

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.339 
right through both sides this is a dirty
job<00:02:55.310> have<00:02:55.880> plenty<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.239> rags<00:02:56.540> on<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:57.019> so<00:02:57.170> now<00:02:57.319> we

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
job have plenty of rags on it so now we

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.539 
job have plenty of rags on it so now we
have<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:58.299> inner<00:02:59.299> bearing<00:02:59.690> on<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:01.250> seal

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
have the inner bearing on and the seal

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.229 
have the inner bearing on and the seal
on<00:03:02.349> there<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:04.400> we'll<00:03:04.610> put<00:03:04.819> a<00:03:04.850> bit<00:03:05.000> extra

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
grease on and put the hub with the wheel

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.440 
grease on and put the hub with the wheel
on<00:03:08.630> now<00:03:09.519> so<00:03:10.519> finally<00:03:10.940> they've<00:03:11.060> got<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.329> all

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
back together the nuts on the pins

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.530 
back together the nuts on the pins
through<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.200> hole<00:03:15.670> dabbed<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.790> bit<00:03:16.940> of<00:03:17.030> more

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
through the hole dabbed a bit of more
