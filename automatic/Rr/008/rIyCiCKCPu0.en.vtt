00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
into itself which is really really sweet

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.420 
into itself which is really really sweet
absolutely<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.829> back<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.250> blade

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
absolutely like it so back to the blade

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.660 
absolutely like it so back to the blade
real<00:01:56.700> quick<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.689> hollow<00:01:57.899> ground<00:01:58.640> with<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
real quick it's a hollow ground with a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.889 
real quick it's a hollow ground with a
clip<00:02:00.030> point<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.540> believe<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:02.540> little<00:02:03.540> shiny

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
clip point I believe a little shiny

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.690 
clip point I believe a little shiny
there<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> think<00:02:05.100> that's<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.280> same<00:02:05.520> one

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
there but I think that's the same one

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.570 
there but I think that's the same one
they<00:02:05.850> use<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.619> Recon<00:02:07.619> one<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.489> they

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
they use on the Recon one so if they

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.760 
they use on the Recon one so if they
would<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.729> make<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> recall<00:02:09.509> one<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:10.590> this

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
would just make the recall one with this

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.800 
would just make the recall one with this
finish<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.400> I'd<00:02:11.819> already<00:02:12.180> have<00:02:12.480> one<00:02:12.690> of

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
finish on it I'd already have one of

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.140 
finish on it I'd already have one of
those

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150

all not at all and it feels good in the
hand<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:21.400> really<00:03:21.579> really<00:03:21.879> does<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:23.430> for

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
hand to it really really does so for

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.430 
hand to it really really does so for
thirty<00:03:24.699> bucks<00:03:24.819> you<00:03:25.440> can't<00:03:26.440> beat<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.910> it's<00:03:27.910> a

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
thirty bucks you can't beat it it's a

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.879 
thirty bucks you can't beat it it's a
what<00:03:29.440> was<00:03:29.620> it<00:03:29.859> off<00:03:30.639> eight<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.680> stainless<00:03:32.680> I

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
what was it off eight a stainless I

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.970 
what was it off eight a stainless I
believe<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.549> wasn't<00:03:33.849> right<00:03:33.970> on<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:35.709> blades

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
believe it wasn't right on it the blades

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.089 
believe it wasn't right on it the blades
four<00:03:36.280> inches<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:38.079> handles<00:03:38.560> four<00:03:38.919> and

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
four inches the handles four and

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.759 
four inches the handles four and
three-quarter<00:03:39.699> so<00:03:40.000> if<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.209> do<00:03:40.389> the<00:03:40.510> math<00:03:40.769> it's

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
three-quarter so if you do the math it's

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.339 
three-quarter so if you do the math it's
eight<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.159> three-quarter<00:03:42.669> inches<00:03:43.169> so<00:03:44.169> it's

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
eight and three-quarter inches so it's

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.379 
eight and three-quarter inches so it's
not<00:03:44.500> bad<00:03:44.739> it's<00:03:45.220> really<00:03:45.489> really<00:03:45.849> a<00:03:45.879> nice<00:03:46.090> sized

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
not bad it's really really a nice sized

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.750 
not bad it's really really a nice sized
knife<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:47.769> I<00:03:47.859> think<00:03:48.129> the<00:03:48.280> weight<00:03:48.430> on<00:03:48.609> its

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
knife and I think the weight on its

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.659 
knife and I think the weight on its
around<00:03:48.970> four<00:03:49.239> ounces<00:03:49.690> something<00:03:50.019> like<00:03:50.139> a

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
around four ounces something like a

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.490 
around four ounces something like a
thickness<00:03:51.669> is<00:03:52.060> three<00:03:52.479> millimeters<00:03:53.139> four

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
thickness is three millimeters four

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.289 
thickness is three millimeters four
millimeters<00:03:54.099> three-and-a-half<00:03:54.729> something

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
millimeters three-and-a-half something

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.360 
millimeters three-and-a-half something
like<00:03:55.419> that<00:03:55.599> Thun<00:03:55.949> really<00:03:56.949> don't<00:03:57.099> know<00:03:57.220> i<00:03:57.250> just

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370
