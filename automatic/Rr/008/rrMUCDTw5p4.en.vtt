00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
then I go to patterns so it's going to

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.420 
then I go to patterns so it's going to
be<00:01:31.590> solid<00:01:32.100> black<00:01:32.460> pattern<00:01:33.060> black<00:01:33.450> gray<00:01:34.439> solid

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
be solid black pattern black gray solid

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.450 
be solid black pattern black gray solid

white<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.000> etc<00:01:39.270> all<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> way<00:01:39.869> down<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:41.130> I

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
white and etc all the way down and I

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.010 
white and etc all the way down and I
just<00:01:41.610> found<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.060> little<00:01:42.090> easier<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:42.990> that

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
just found it a little easier to do that

just found it a little easier to do that
again<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:43.979> ganization<00:01:44.570> reasons<00:01:45.570> it's

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
again just for ganization reasons it's

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.690 
again just for ganization reasons it's
just<00:01:46.110> easier<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.649> me<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> find<00:01:47.159> my<00:01:47.280> clothes<00:01:47.490> if
