00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
about these this is actually just a

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.050 
about these this is actually just a
glazed<00:04:13.530> porcelain<00:04:13.920> tile<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:14.910> has<00:04:15.030> a

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
on a 12 x 12 sheet and so you'd get a

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.399 
on a 12 x 12 sheet and so you'd get a
good<00:04:20.970> majority<00:04:21.359> of<00:04:21.570> this<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.019> so<00:04:22.109> something

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
good majority of this and so something

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:23.570 
good majority of this and so something
like<00:04:22.560> this<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:23.039> where<00:04:23.190> there's<00:04:23.340> a<00:04:23.430> lot<00:04:23.550> of

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
like this to where there's a lot of

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.089 
like this to where there's a lot of
color<00:04:23.880> may<00:04:24.659> be<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.870> little<00:04:25.110> overwhelming<00:04:25.680> for

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
color may be a little overwhelming for

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.120 
color may be a little overwhelming for
people

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
people

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.710 
people
a<00:04:27.160> full<00:04:27.580> backsplash<00:04:28.090> so<00:04:28.330> this<00:04:28.480> would<00:04:28.600> be<00:04:28.690> a

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
a full backsplash so this would be a

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.120 
a full backsplash so this would be a
perfect<00:04:28.900> example<00:04:29.170> of<00:04:29.590> something<00:04:29.830> that<00:04:29.980> you

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.170 
that again this is just a 12 x 12 sheet
of<00:04:46.540> glass<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.230> this<00:04:47.710> is<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.890> this<00:04:48.790> is<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:48.970> good

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
of glass and this is a this is a good

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.460 
of glass and this is a this is a good
one<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:49.360> kind<00:04:49.630> of<00:04:49.690> point<00:04:49.870> out<00:04:50.020> because<00:04:50.320> this

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
one to kind of point out because this

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.560 
one to kind of point out because this
particular<00:04:50.770> glass<00:04:51.130> is<00:04:51.340> a<00:04:51.400> lot<00:04:51.700> thinner<00:04:52.030> than

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
particular glass is a lot thinner than

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.270 
particular glass is a lot thinner than
the<00:04:52.750> sum<00:04:52.930> of<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.170> other<00:04:53.200> glasses<00:04:53.710> that<00:04:54.100> we

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
the sum of the other glasses that we

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.520 
the sum of the other glasses that we
have<00:04:54.490> and<00:04:54.790> so<00:04:55.420> if<00:04:55.600> you<00:04:55.630> do<00:04:55.960> decide<00:04:56.110> to

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
have and so if you do decide to

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.860 
have and so if you do decide to
incorporate<00:04:57.130> that<00:04:57.580> with<00:04:57.640> a<00:04:58.240> different<00:04:58.720> type

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
incorporate that with a different type

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.720 
incorporate that with a different type
of<00:04:58.900> tile<00:04:59.290> you<00:04:59.950> really<00:05:00.250> just<00:05:00.280> have<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.580> make

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
of tile you really just have to make

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.430 
of tile you really just have to make
sure<00:05:00.790> that<00:05:01.450> either<00:05:01.600> the<00:05:01.870> heights<00:05:02.110> are

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
sure that either the heights are

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.880 
sure that either the heights are
somewhat<00:05:02.740> consistent<00:05:03.070> or<00:05:03.460> your<00:05:03.970> installer<00:05:04.420> is

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
somewhat consistent or your installer is

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.650 
somewhat consistent or your installer is
talented<00:05:05.890> enough<00:05:06.010> where<00:05:06.430> they<00:05:06.580> can<00:05:06.880> build<00:05:07.420> up

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
talented enough where they can build up

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.200 
talented enough where they can build up
that<00:05:07.690> thinner<00:05:08.290> tile<00:05:08.650> to<00:05:09.010> make<00:05:09.220> it<00:05:09.370> meets<00:05:09.730> the

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
that thinner tile to make it meets the

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.660 
that thinner tile to make it meets the
larger<00:05:10.570> tile<00:05:10.810> it's<00:05:11.740> just<00:05:12.040> really<00:05:12.220> cool<00:05:12.460> I'm

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
larger tile it's just really cool I'm

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.160 
larger tile it's just really cool I'm
actually<00:05:12.700> we're<00:05:13.480> talking<00:05:13.690> about<00:05:13.810> back

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
actually we're talking about back

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.450 
actually we're talking about back
classes<00:05:14.440> in<00:05:14.620> the<00:05:14.680> kitchen<00:05:15.010> but<00:05:15.100> I<00:05:15.190> could<00:05:15.340> see

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
classes in the kitchen but I could see

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.830 
classes in the kitchen but I could see
that<00:05:15.580> in<00:05:15.730> a<00:05:15.790> bathroom<00:05:16.180> or<00:05:16.480> something<00:05:16.540> like

that look at these talk about really

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.760 
that look at these talk about really
funky<00:05:19.210> and<00:05:19.420> cool<00:05:19.600> because<00:05:20.080> people<00:05:20.410> are<00:05:20.530> doing

mentioned to about the you know doing
something<00:05:26.860> in<00:05:27.010> the<00:05:27.250> bathroom<00:05:27.790> a<00:05:28.360> lot<00:05:28.750> of<00:05:28.900> times

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
something in the bathroom a lot of times

something in the bathroom a lot of times
you<00:05:29.320> know<00:05:29.440> this<00:05:29.590> is<00:05:29.710> a<00:05:29.740> great<00:05:29.950> example<00:05:30.100> we

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
you know this is a great example we

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.580 
you know this is a great example we
might<00:05:30.820> take<00:05:31.150> this<00:05:31.420> and<00:05:31.750> cut<00:05:32.110> up<00:05:32.230> the<00:05:32.350> sheets

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
might take this and cut up the sheets

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.020 
might take this and cut up the sheets
and<00:05:32.740> instead<00:05:33.070> of<00:05:33.100> having<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.640> regular

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
and instead of having the regular

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.350 
and instead of having the regular
backsplash<00:05:35.070> from<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.790> countertop

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
backsplash from the the countertop

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.300 
backsplash from the the countertop
company<00:05:37.810> we<00:05:38.320> might<00:05:38.500> just<00:05:38.650> do<00:05:38.800> like<00:05:38.920> a<00:05:38.980> small

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
company we might just do like a small

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.010 
company we might just do like a small
strip<00:05:39.610> of<00:05:39.730> that<00:05:39.880> and<00:05:40.120> then<00:05:40.240> it<00:05:40.540> just<00:05:40.570> really

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
strip of that and then it just really

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.440 
strip of that and then it just really
kind<00:05:41.230> of<00:05:41.320> makes<00:05:41.530> a<00:05:41.700> you<00:05:42.700> know<00:05:42.760> uninteresting

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
kind of makes a you know uninteresting

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.420 
kind of makes a you know uninteresting
bathroom<00:05:43.960> just<00:05:44.110> a<00:05:44.200> little<00:05:44.380> bit<00:05:44.530> more<00:05:44.710> fun<00:05:44.950> yeah

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
bathroom just a little bit more fun yeah

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.110 
bathroom just a little bit more fun yeah
this<00:05:45.940> is<00:05:46.120> so<00:05:46.420> so<00:05:46.690> cool<00:05:46.930> now<00:05:47.290> what<00:05:47.530> are<00:05:47.620> these

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
this is so so cool now what are these

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.350 
this is so so cool now what are these
now<00:05:49.120> this<00:05:49.420> again<00:05:50.290> is<00:05:50.530> glass<00:05:50.860> now<00:05:51.640> some<00:05:52.090> of<00:05:52.240> the

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
now this again is glass now some of the

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.840 
now this again is glass now some of the
newer<00:05:52.780> trends<00:05:53.290> that<00:05:53.320> are<00:05:53.440> coming<00:05:53.830> out<00:05:53.950> if<00:05:54.700> you

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
newer trends that are coming out if you

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.800 
newer trends that are coming out if you
especially<00:05:55.000> if<00:05:55.240> you<00:05:55.300> want<00:05:55.450> to<00:05:55.540> get<00:05:55.660> more

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
especially if you want to get more

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.990 
especially if you want to get more
contemporary<00:05:56.350> you're<00:05:56.770> getting<00:05:57.100> more<00:05:57.460> of<00:05:57.760> the

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
contemporary you're getting more of the

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.820 
contemporary you're getting more of the
lineal<00:05:58.480> look<00:05:58.870> instead<00:05:59.290> of<00:05:59.440> more<00:05:59.680> of<00:05:59.710> the

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
lineal look instead of more of the

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.090 
lineal look instead of more of the
squares<00:06:00.840> and<00:06:01.840> so<00:06:02.140> this<00:06:02.380> one<00:06:02.590> here<00:06:02.830> is<00:06:02.860> just

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
squares and so this one here is just

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.190 
squares and so this one here is just
showing<00:06:03.250> again<00:06:03.670> this<00:06:03.970> comes<00:06:04.300> on<00:06:04.510> a<00:06:04.570> mess<00:06:04.960> sheet

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
showing again this comes on a mess sheet

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.110 
showing again this comes on a mess sheet
so<00:06:05.410> insulation<00:06:06.010> is<00:06:06.160> really<00:06:06.490> a<00:06:06.520> breeze<00:06:06.790> and

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
so insulation is really a breeze and

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.040 
so insulation is really a breeze and
also<00:06:07.420> less<00:06:08.350> waste<00:06:08.920> with<00:06:09.220> it<00:06:09.400> as<00:06:09.520> well<00:06:10.050> but

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
also less waste with it as well but

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.260 
also less waste with it as well but
actually<00:06:11.560> this<00:06:11.710> comes<00:06:12.010> on<00:06:12.280> a<00:06:12.580> sheet<00:06:12.940> and<00:06:13.150> then

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
actually this comes on a sheet and then

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.730 
actually this comes on a sheet and then
you<00:06:13.450> just<00:06:13.660> have<00:06:13.690> you<00:06:14.140> know<00:06:14.230> the<00:06:14.350> different

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
you just have you know the different

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
you just have you know the different
sizes<00:06:15.250> of<00:06:15.670> the<00:06:16.600> different<00:06:16.960> glass<00:06:17.470> pieces<00:06:17.800> but

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
sizes of the different glass pieces but

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.860 
sizes of the different glass pieces but
then<00:06:18.880> they<00:06:18.970> also<00:06:19.000> show<00:06:19.420> them<00:06:19.540> where<00:06:19.660> you<00:06:19.750> can

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
then they also show them where you can

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.840 
then they also show them where you can
just<00:06:20.020> buy<00:06:20.140> the<00:06:20.200> pieces<00:06:20.890> by<00:06:21.010> themselves<00:06:21.520> and

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
just buy the pieces by themselves and

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.850 
just buy the pieces by themselves and
actually<00:06:22.660> a<00:06:22.690> really<00:06:23.110> big<00:06:23.380> trend<00:06:23.680> especially

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
actually a really big trend especially

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.670 
actually a really big trend especially
if<00:06:24.130> you<00:06:24.190> want<00:06:24.340> to<00:06:24.370> get<00:06:24.520> really<00:06:24.760> contemporary

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
if you want to get really contemporary

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
pieces instead of doing them you know

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.820 
pieces instead of doing them you know
traditionally<00:06:31.630> traditionally<00:06:31.990> we've<00:06:32.590> seen

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
again more traditional this is something

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.340 
again more traditional this is something
I<00:06:48.150> could<00:06:48.300> totally<00:06:48.390> see<00:06:48.690> in<00:06:48.780> my<00:06:48.900> kitchen<00:06:49.110> right

here yes this is a split stack stone
again<00:06:53.130> and<00:06:53.370> this<00:06:53.910> is<00:06:54.030> something<00:06:54.180> that<00:06:54.420> you<00:06:54.720> put

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
again and this is something that you put

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.690 
again and this is something that you put
on<00:06:54.960> the<00:06:55.260> on<00:06:55.590> the<00:06:55.650> wall<00:06:55.980> and<00:06:56.160> the<00:06:56.250> biggest

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700 
on the on the wall and the biggest

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.490 
on the on the wall and the biggest
question<00:06:57.090> I<00:06:57.210> have<00:06:57.420> with<00:06:57.540> people<00:06:57.660> because<00:06:58.050> it

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
question I have with people because it

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.280 
question I have with people because it
has<00:06:58.740> so<00:06:59.040> much<00:06:59.190> texture<00:06:59.670> to<00:07:00.000> it<00:07:00.030> is<00:07:00.330> how<00:07:01.050> am<00:07:01.230> I

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.290 
has so much texture to it is how am I

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.520 
has so much texture to it is how am I
ever<00:07:01.320> going<00:07:01.590> to<00:07:01.680> clean<00:07:01.920> that<00:07:01.950> right<00:07:03.260> and<00:07:04.260> so

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
ever going to clean that right and so

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.590 
ever going to clean that right and so
really<00:07:05.010> you<00:07:05.370> want<00:07:05.580> to<00:07:05.670> put<00:07:05.790> a<00:07:05.820> sealer<00:07:06.150> on<00:07:06.270> it

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
really you want to put a sealer on it

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.890 
really you want to put a sealer on it
but<00:07:07.440> stone<00:07:07.710> is<00:07:07.980> still<00:07:08.310> porous<00:07:08.760> and<00:07:09.000> so<00:07:09.300> you

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 
but stone is still porous and so you

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.720 
but stone is still porous and so you
know<00:07:09.990> to<00:07:10.080> a<00:07:10.290> certain<00:07:10.620> extent<00:07:10.950> if<00:07:11.190> you<00:07:11.400> were<00:07:11.550> to

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:11.730 
know to a certain extent if you were to

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.700 
know to a certain extent if you were to
splatter<00:07:12.030> you<00:07:12.570> know<00:07:12.660> tomato<00:07:13.110> sauce<00:07:13.440> or

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
splatter you know tomato sauce or

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.770 
splatter you know tomato sauce or
something<00:07:14.010> on<00:07:14.100> there<00:07:14.340> you<00:07:14.790> may<00:07:15.030> have<00:07:15.300> you<00:07:15.750> know

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 
something on there you may have you know

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.720 
something on there you may have you know
might<00:07:16.410> something<00:07:16.740> happen<00:07:17.370> with<00:07:17.460> it<00:07:17.520> because

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:17.730 
might something happen with it because

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.520 
might something happen with it because
this<00:07:18.000> is<00:07:18.150> has<00:07:18.360> a<00:07:18.390> lot<00:07:18.630> of<00:07:18.660> texture<00:07:19.050> to<00:07:19.170> it<00:07:19.200> so<00:07:19.410> it

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.530 
this is has a lot of texture to it so it

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.840 
this is has a lot of texture to it so it
is<00:07:19.620> a<00:07:19.650> little<00:07:19.800> bit<00:07:20.010> more<00:07:20.160> difficult<00:07:20.370> to<00:07:20.700> keep

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:20.850 
is a little bit more difficult to keep

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.300 
is a little bit more difficult to keep
clean<00:07:20.910> but<00:07:21.840> also<00:07:22.020> in<00:07:22.290> the<00:07:22.380> same<00:07:22.560> respect<00:07:22.830> I

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
clean but also in the same respect I

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.820 
clean but also in the same respect I
mean<00:07:23.940> it<00:07:24.030> has<00:07:24.240> so<00:07:24.270> much<00:07:24.810> going<00:07:24.870> on<00:07:25.350> with<00:07:25.590> it<00:07:25.800> and

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:25.830 
mean it has so much going on with it and

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.220 
mean it has so much going on with it and
it<00:07:26.160> has<00:07:26.310> such<00:07:26.580> a<00:07:26.610> range<00:07:26.940> of<00:07:27.090> color<00:07:27.360> that<00:07:27.870> you

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.230 
it has such a range of color that you

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.290 
it has such a range of color that you
know<00:07:28.890> if<00:07:29.070> it<00:07:29.190> does<00:07:29.340> get<00:07:29.520> a<00:07:29.580> little<00:07:29.730> dirty<00:07:29.970> it

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.300 
know if it does get a little dirty it

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.770 
know if it does get a little dirty it
kind<00:07:30.570> of<00:07:30.690> like<00:07:30.840> it<00:07:31.050> almost<00:07:31.230> adds<00:07:31.590> severe<00:07:32.010> Tina

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:32.780 
kind of like it almost adds severe Tina

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.690 
kind of like it almost adds severe Tina
