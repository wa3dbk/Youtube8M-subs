00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
well for me it was the yips in the

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.050 
well for me it was the yips in the
spaceship<00:04:47.190> because<00:04:48.190> there's<00:04:48.430> such<00:04:48.669> there<00:04:49.030> are

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
spaceship because there's such there are

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.300 
spaceship because there's such there are
space<00:04:49.630> creatures<00:04:50.290> and<00:04:50.590> even<00:04:50.860> though<00:04:51.009> they're

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
space creatures and even though they're

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.140 
space creatures and even though they're
they're<00:04:52.030> not<00:04:52.330> big<00:04:53.139> main<00:04:53.500> major<00:04:53.889> characters<00:04:54.639> it

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
they're not big main major characters it

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.090 
they're not big main major characters it
was<00:04:55.270> just<00:04:55.539> so<00:04:55.750> fun<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.259> put<00:04:56.470> them<00:04:56.650> in<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.919> ride

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100
