00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.330
 I am someone who likes to drive cars where 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.389
 you do not see so often on the road 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.099
 individually adapted 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.549
 I also like that car 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.549
 is loud 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.260
 and sports mostly sports cars of course 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:28.869
 go with plenty ps such for gas 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:33.970
 my very first car was one 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.510
 opel astra opel astra pretty much 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:41.710
 long ago 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:44.050
 currently i have a few cars i am 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.730
 so a bit car-crazy and therefore 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.230
 Supplement believes it has been in the 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.629
 Hamlet there are always new to it 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.909
 In any case, I'm definitely new car 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.119
 The bentley is now pulling extremely hard 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:00.309
 well when I looked up one now 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:04.530
 I really liked it 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.530
 and clearly 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.149
 with us in the team have some 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.100
 Cars form from level 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.140
 so I'm I'm by 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.369
 teammates to get there 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.750
 it always has any wishes 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.610
 seen something where you said yes 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.700
 So I could imagine that 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.049
 car would come into question yes so me 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.049
 I'm already superior so I have 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:34.520

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.110

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.600

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.219

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.840

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.709
