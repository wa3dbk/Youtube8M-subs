00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
think Apple could have probably went for

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.549 
think Apple could have probably went for
a<00:00:57.420> bigger<00:00:57.600> battery<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.109> had<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> little<00:00:58.469> bit

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
a bigger battery and had a little bit

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.110 
a bigger battery and had a little bit
more<00:00:58.710> weight<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.789> they<00:00:59.940> were<00:01:00.000> just

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
more weight to it but they were just

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.549 
more weight to it but they were just
pushing<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.719> limits<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.109> wanted<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.440> make

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
pushing the limits and I wanted to make

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.830 
pushing the limits and I wanted to make
the<00:01:01.710> phone<00:01:01.920> thinner<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:03.359> give<00:01:03.600> them<00:01:03.629> credit

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the phone thinner and I give them credit

for<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.229> besides<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.549> fact<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.939> there's<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
for that besides the fact that there's a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.700

the<00:02:45.609> icons<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.329> pop<00:02:46.390> landscape<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.319> know<00:02:47.379> some

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
the icons that pop landscape I know some

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.559 
the icons that pop landscape I know some
people<00:02:47.650> have<00:02:47.950> said<00:02:48.099> that<00:02:48.220> they<00:02:48.340> don't<00:02:48.579> I<00:02:48.819> kind

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
people have said that they don't I kind

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.750 
people have said that they don't I kind
of<00:02:49.629> like<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:50.019> it<00:02:50.260> allows<00:02:50.920> me<00:02:51.159> not<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.430> have<00:02:51.579> to

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
of like that it allows me not to have to

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.539 
of like that it allows me not to have to
really<00:02:52.030> use<00:02:52.209> an<00:02:52.599> iPad<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:54.159> that's<00:02:54.280> all

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
really use an iPad and and that's all

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.920 
really use an iPad and and that's all
that's<00:02:54.639> why<00:02:54.849> the<00:02:54.909> six<00:02:55.299> plus<00:02:55.480> gets<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.810> edge

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
that's why the six plus gets the edge

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.000 
that's why the six plus gets the edge
for<00:02:56.260> me<00:02:56.379> there<00:02:57.750> but<00:02:58.750> for<00:02:58.959> design<00:02:59.349> though<00:02:59.769> I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010
