flower and some people call it a water
lily<00:00:31.140> hour<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:32.040> top<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.510> has<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
lily hour on top and then it has the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.530 
lily hour on top and then it has the
lily<00:00:34.440> pad<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.920> bottom<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.329> did

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
lily pad on the bottom and I just did

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.060 
lily pad on the bottom and I just did
this<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.930> here<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.290> it's<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.559> two<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.770> them

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
this one here and it's just two of them

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.970 
this one here and it's just two of them
back-to-back<00:00:41.870> square<00:00:42.870> sheet<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.230> paper<00:00:45.980> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
back-to-back square sheet of paper and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.029 
back-to-back square sheet of paper and
you<00:00:47.160> fold<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.640> half<00:00:48.410> okay<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.710> fold<00:00:49.920> it

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
you fold it in half okay so you fold it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.340 
you fold it in half okay so you fold it
in<00:00:50.190> half<00:00:50.219> both<00:00:50.670> ways<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.030> unfold<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.020> have

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
in half both ways and unfold so you have

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
in half both ways and unfold so you have
the<00:00:53.160> center<00:00:53.520> x<00:00:55.070> orthocenter<00:00:56.070> cross<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.910> you

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the center x orthocenter cross and you

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.689 
the center x orthocenter cross and you
know<00:00:58.199> exactly<00:00:58.770> where<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> center<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
know exactly where the center of the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.709 
know exactly where the center of the
paper<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:01.489> then<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.609> take<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.300> corners

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
paper is then you take all the corners

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.570 
paper is then you take all the corners
and<00:01:03.930> hold<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> center<00:01:07.130> all<00:01:08.130> four

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
and hold it to the center all four

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:17.120 
and hold it to the center all four
corners

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.640 

then<00:01:18.130> you<00:01:18.400> want<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.030> again<00:01:19.630> fold<00:01:20.140> all<00:01:20.380> four

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
then you want to again fold all four

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.890 
then you want to again fold all four
corners<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.250> center<00:01:21.370> you<00:01:21.940> fold<00:01:22.450> all<00:01:22.750> the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
corners to the center you fold all the

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.590 
corners to the center you fold all the
corners<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.740> center<00:01:23.830> again<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:25.360> want<00:01:25.450> to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
corners to the center again you want to

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.980 
corners to the center again you want to
be<00:01:25.780> somewhat<00:01:26.290> precise<00:01:26.680> so<00:01:26.980> that<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.720> doesn't

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
be somewhat precise so that it doesn't

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.740 
be somewhat precise so that it doesn't
tear<00:01:29.440> at<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.950> end<00:01:30.100> you<00:01:30.640> want<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:30.970> fold<00:01:31.270> this

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
tear at the end you want to fold this

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:42.540 
tear at the end you want to fold this
corner<00:01:31.810> into<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.590> center<00:01:33.040> one<00:01:33.340> last<00:01:33.640> time<00:01:41.550> so

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
corner into the center one last time so

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.280 
corner into the center one last time so
when<00:01:42.730> you<00:01:42.820> do<00:01:43.000> things<00:01:43.210> like<00:01:43.480> this<00:01:43.540> it's<00:01:44.050> not

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
when you do things like this it's not

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.900 
when you do things like this it's not
going<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.620> perfectly<00:01:45.070> match<00:01:45.370> up<00:01:45.640> in<00:01:45.790> the

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
going to perfectly match up in the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.300 
going to perfectly match up in the
center<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:46.990> it's<00:01:47.200> more<00:01:47.470> important<00:01:48.010> that<00:01:48.130> you

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
center so it's more important that you

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.340 
center so it's more important that you
have<00:01:48.640> all<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.300> points<00:01:50.070> line<00:01:51.070> it<00:01:51.400> lined<00:01:51.850> up

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
have all the points line it lined up

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.370 
have all the points line it lined up
like<00:01:53.350> instead<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:53.970> having<00:01:54.970> these<00:01:55.420> two<00:01:55.780> sides

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
like instead of having these two sides

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.560 
like instead of having these two sides
touching<00:01:56.820> they're<00:01:57.820> not<00:01:58.030> going<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.330> touch

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
touching they're not going to touch

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.810 
touching they're not going to touch
every<00:01:58.960> just<00:01:59.170> because<00:01:59.350> it's<00:01:59.500> too<00:01:59.619> thick<00:01:59.920> it's

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
every just because it's too thick it's

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.120 
every just because it's too thick it's
more<00:02:01.060> important<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.600> have<00:02:01.780> them<00:02:02.110> parallel<00:02:02.560> so

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
more important to have them parallel so

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.740 
more important to have them parallel so
the<00:02:03.340> lines<00:02:03.580> that<00:02:03.820> you<00:02:03.850> made<00:02:04.090> in<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.300> beginning

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
the lines that you made in the beginning

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.960 
the lines that you made in the beginning
should<00:02:05.440> always<00:02:05.830> be<00:02:06.070> pointing<00:02:06.520> towards<00:02:06.820> the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
should always be pointing towards the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
should always be pointing towards the
center<00:02:08.340> all<00:02:09.340> right<00:02:09.580> then<00:02:10.300> you<00:02:10.420> flip<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.810> over

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
center all right then you flip it over

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.150 
center all right then you flip it over
and<00:02:11.910> one<00:02:12.910> last<00:02:13.209> time<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:14.260> take<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.680> corners

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
and one last time you take the corners

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.180 
and one last time you take the corners
and<00:02:15.760> bring<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.480> center<00:02:16.690> so<00:02:17.680> now<00:02:17.860> this

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
and bring it to the center so now this

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.240 
and bring it to the center so now this
time<00:02:18.489> you<00:02:18.640> have<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:20.260> if<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.739> observe<00:02:20.890> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
time you have so if you just observe the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.110 
time you have so if you just observe the
paper<00:02:21.459> as<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.850> is<00:02:21.970> now<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.920> have<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.700> corners

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
paper as it is now you have the corners

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.650 
paper as it is now you have the corners
in<00:02:25.300> once<00:02:25.890> twice<00:02:27.030> three<00:02:28.030> times<00:02:29.610> right<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.030> then

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
in once twice three times right and then

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.060 
in once twice three times right and then
on<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:31.930> side<00:02:31.989> you're<00:02:32.440> going<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.709> fold<00:02:32.860> the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
on this side you're going to fold the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.130 
on this side you're going to fold the
corners<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:34.239> opposite<00:02:34.810> way<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.870> this

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
corners in the opposite way so this

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.170 
corners in the opposite way so this
paper<00:02:38.440> actually<00:02:38.680> gets<00:02:39.100> kind<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.459> tortured<00:02:39.910> as

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
paper actually gets kind of tortured as

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.090 
paper actually gets kind of tortured as
you<00:02:40.330> do<00:02:40.480> this<00:02:40.630> project<00:02:40.900> it's<00:02:41.739> going<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:41.950> be

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
you do this project it's going to be

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.270 
you do this project it's going to be
wrinkly<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.760> just<00:02:43.120> have<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.300> deal<00:02:43.540> with<00:02:43.780> that

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
wrinkly you just have to deal with that

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.229 
wrinkly you just have to deal with that
okay<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.340> now<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.390> fun<00:02:46.750> part<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:49.060> is

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
okay so now this is the fun part this is

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.060 
okay so now this is the fun part this is
the<00:02:49.390> part<00:02:49.600> where<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:49.959> could<00:02:50.230> have<00:02:50.500> some<00:02:50.800> tears

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
the part where you could have some tears

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.729 
the part where you could have some tears
but<00:02:51.580> that's<00:02:51.820> okay<00:02:52.239> like<00:02:52.900> this<00:02:53.110> flower<00:02:53.290> here

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
but that's okay like this flower here

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.590 
but that's okay like this flower here
has<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.190> couple<00:02:54.640> of<00:02:54.760> tears<00:02:54.970> in<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.269> but<00:02:55.450> it's

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
has a couple of tears in it but it's

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.540 
has a couple of tears in it but it's
harder<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:55.930> tell<00:02:56.290> once<00:02:56.980> it's<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.250> finished

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
harder to tell once it's a finished

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.390 
harder to tell once it's a finished
product<00:02:58.350> okay<00:02:59.350> so<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.650> put<00:02:59.980> your<00:03:00.130> thumb<00:03:00.370> in

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
product okay so you put your thumb in

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.979 
product okay so you put your thumb in
the<00:03:00.670> center<00:03:01.090> here<00:03:02.820> okay<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:04.000> let's<00:03:04.330> let's

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
the center here okay and let's let's

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.890 
the center here okay and let's let's
observe<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.650> paper<00:03:05.890> again<00:03:06.160> so<00:03:06.970> on<00:03:07.300> one<00:03:07.600> side

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
observe the paper again so on one side

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.259 
observe the paper again so on one side
you<00:03:07.930> have<00:03:09.840> one<00:03:10.840> layer<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.519> thick<00:03:12.790> points

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
you have one layer of the thick points

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.390 
you have one layer of the thick points
coming<00:03:13.510> into<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.989> center<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.650> then<00:03:15.220> it's

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
coming into the center and then it's

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.090 
coming into the center and then it's
just<00:03:15.640> flat<00:03:15.880> I'm<00:03:16.200> after<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.350> one<00:03:17.530> layer<00:03:17.739> on

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
just flat I'm after that one layer on

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.430 
just flat I'm after that one layer on
the<00:03:18.760> other<00:03:18.940> side<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:19.900> have<00:03:20.940> three<00:03:21.940> layers

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
the other side you have three layers

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.250 
the other side you have three layers
coming<00:03:24.220> into<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.580> center<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.870> want<00:03:26.200> to

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
coming into the center so you want to

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.660 
coming into the center so you want to
work<00:03:26.410> on<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.680> side<00:03:26.920> where<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.190> just<00:03:27.370> have<00:03:27.550> the

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
work on the side where you just have the

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.720 
work on the side where you just have the
one<00:03:27.820> layer<00:03:28.060> coming<00:03:28.540> into<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.900> center<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:30.640> you

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
one layer coming into the center so you

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.940 
one layer coming into the center so you
put<00:03:30.910> your<00:03:31.090> thumbs<00:03:31.330> in<00:03:31.480> there<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.990> corners<00:03:32.590> and

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
put your thumbs in there the corners and

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.240 
put your thumbs in there the corners and
you<00:03:33.700> fold<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:34.180> in<00:03:34.360> just<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.840> little<00:03:35.020> bit<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.860> I

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
you fold it in just a little bit and I

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.370 
you fold it in just a little bit and I
wouldn't<00:03:36.550> really<00:03:36.670> call<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.270> fold<00:03:37.570> as<00:03:37.870> much

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
wouldn't really call it a fold as much

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.770 
wouldn't really call it a fold as much
as<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.560> bend<00:03:38.980> so<00:03:39.760> you<00:03:39.880> want<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.090> kind<00:03:40.240> of<00:03:40.420> curve

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
as a bend so you want to kind of curve

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.550 
as a bend so you want to kind of curve
it<00:03:40.960> in<00:03:41.140> like<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:43.080> it's<00:03:44.080> not<00:03:44.230> going<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.470> go

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
it in like that and it's not going to go

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.500 
it in like that and it's not going to go
all<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.830> way<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.220> center<00:03:45.580> it's<00:03:46.300> going<00:03:46.450> to

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
all the way to the center it's going to

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.860 
all the way to the center it's going to
go<00:03:46.660> like<00:03:46.840> that<00:03:47.680> much<00:03:48.360> like<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.510> center<00:03:49.780> is

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
go like that much like the center is

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.700 
go like that much like the center is
here<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:51.880> doesn't<00:03:52.150> go<00:03:52.210> all<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.480> way<00:03:52.710> then

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
here so it doesn't go all the way then

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.530 
here so it doesn't go all the way then
you<00:03:53.890> take<00:03:54.160> your<00:03:54.370> thumb<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:55.000> hold<00:03:55.330> it

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
you take your thumb and you hold it

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.010 
you take your thumb and you hold it
there<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:57.580> then<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:58.210> take<00:03:58.420> your<00:03:58.480> other<00:03:58.870> hand

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
there and then you take your other hand

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.380 
there and then you take your other hand
and<00:03:59.530> you<00:03:59.680> reach<00:03:59.890> underneath<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:01.030> underneath

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
and you reach underneath so underneath

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.580 
and you reach underneath so underneath
you're<00:04:01.750> going<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:01.960> pick<00:04:02.140> up<00:04:04.080> like<00:04:05.080> that<00:04:05.320> edge

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
you're going to pick up like that edge

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.140 
you're going to pick up like that edge
is<00:04:05.620> going<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.040> come<00:04:06.220> out<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.580> little<00:04:06.820> corner

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
is going to come out the little corner

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.090 
is going to come out the little corner
out<00:04:07.330> there<00:04:07.570> it's<00:04:07.840> going<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.020> come<00:04:08.170> out<00:04:08.230> so

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
out there it's going to come out so

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.740 
out there it's going to come out so
there<00:04:09.340> it's<00:04:09.490> flush<00:04:09.760> against<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.120> paper<00:04:10.450> one

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
there it's flush against the paper one

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.840 
there it's flush against the paper one
your<00:04:10.900> papers<00:04:11.260> flat<00:04:11.500> then<00:04:12.220> when<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.490> crave<00:04:12.700> it

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.289 
your papers flat then when you crave it
in<00:04:13.320> that<00:04:14.320> paper<00:04:14.590> is<00:04:14.770> going<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:14.950> come<00:04:15.160> out<00:04:15.299> then

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
in that paper is going to come out then

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.090 
in that paper is going to come out then
you<00:04:16.480> want<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.780> so<00:04:17.500> you<00:04:17.560> want<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.890> grab<00:04:18.070> that

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.480 
towards your other thumb and while
you're<00:04:26.080> doing<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.830> want<00:04:27.010> to<00:04:27.070> take<00:04:27.250> this

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
you're doing that you want to take this

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.110 
you're doing that you want to take this
thumb<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.710> push<00:04:29.710> in<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.040> sides<00:04:30.520> of<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.880> paper

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
thumb and push in the sides of the paper

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.740 
thumb and push in the sides of the paper
here<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:33.340> that<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.760> kind<00:04:33.940> of<00:04:34.120> get<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.330> curve<00:04:34.720> to

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
here so that you kind of get a curve to

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:43.219 
here so that you kind of get a curve to
this<00:04:35.260> pedal

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.480 

like<00:04:44.229> that<00:04:45.090> so<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.539> kind<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:46.900> have<00:04:47.050> to

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
like that so you kind of have to

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.920 
like that so you kind of have to
manipulate<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:49.000> paper<00:04:49.240> more<00:04:49.599> than<00:04:49.810> you

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
manipulate the paper more than you

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.219 
manipulate the paper more than you
wouldn't<00:04:50.289> in<00:04:50.789> other<00:04:51.789> projects<00:04:52.389> that<00:04:52.599> I<00:04:52.629> that<00:04:53.199> I

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
wouldn't in other projects that I that I

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.719 
wouldn't in other projects that I that I
shown<00:04:54.389> and<00:04:55.389> then<00:04:55.569> you<00:04:55.689> take<00:04:55.930> this<00:04:56.229> and<00:04:56.650> just

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
shown and then you take this and just

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.459 
shown and then you take this and just
curve<00:04:57.729> it<00:04:57.849> out<00:04:57.969> like<00:04:58.150> that<00:04:58.330> and<00:04:58.569> that's<00:04:59.379> a

00:04:59.459 --> 00:04:59.469 
curve it out like that and that's a

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.809 
curve it out like that and that's a
pedal<00:04:59.770> that's<00:05:00.759> one<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.240> petals<00:05:01.569> as<00:05:01.810> the

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
pedal that's one of the petals as the

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.270 
pedal that's one of the petals as the
filly<00:05:03.819> the<00:05:04.509> water<00:05:04.719> lily<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:05.710> then<00:05:05.889> you<00:05:06.009> do<00:05:06.129> that

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
filly the water lily so then you do that

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.179 
filly the water lily so then you do that
on<00:05:06.310> all<00:05:06.520> four<00:05:06.819> sides<00:05:06.849> and<00:05:07.889> some<00:05:08.889> of<00:05:09.009> them<00:05:09.129> are

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:09.189 
on all four sides and some of them are

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:11.879 
on all four sides and some of them are
going<00:05:09.340> to<00:05:09.400> be<00:05:09.490> easier<00:05:09.969> than<00:05:10.120> others<00:05:10.740> but<00:05:11.740> as

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
going to be easier than others but as

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.890 
going to be easier than others but as
long<00:05:12.039> as<00:05:12.189> you<00:05:12.280> just<00:05:12.490> manipulate<00:05:12.759> the<00:05:13.330> paper<00:05:13.569> so

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
long as you just manipulate the paper so

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.619 
long as you just manipulate the paper so
that<00:05:13.930> it<00:05:14.169> makes<00:05:14.349> that<00:05:15.960> that<00:05:16.960> petal<00:05:17.919> it's<00:05:18.789> not

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:19.629 
that it makes that that petal it's not

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:21.839 
that it makes that that petal it's not
going<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.139> rip<00:05:20.349> and<00:05:20.560> it's<00:05:20.710> too<00:05:20.919> and<00:05:21.310> it's<00:05:21.639> not

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
going to rip and it's too and it's not

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.879 
going to rip and it's too and it's not
too<00:05:22.060> hard<00:05:22.330> so<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.229> paper<00:05:23.469> is<00:05:23.650> pretty

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
too hard so the paper is pretty

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.909 
too hard so the paper is pretty
resilient<00:05:24.449> so<00:05:25.449> if<00:05:25.719> you<00:05:25.900> work<00:05:26.319> with<00:05:26.529> the<00:05:26.680> paper

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
resilient so if you work with the paper

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.769 
resilient so if you work with the paper
and<00:05:27.310> make<00:05:27.460> sure<00:05:27.669> you<00:05:27.849> don't<00:05:28.060> try<00:05:28.240> to<00:05:28.300> bend<00:05:28.599> it

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:28.779 
and make sure you don't try to bend it

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:33.119 
and make sure you don't try to bend it
in<00:05:29.379> a<00:05:29.620> way<00:05:29.740> it<00:05:29.919> doesn't<00:05:30.099> want<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:30.520> bend<00:05:32.129> then

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
in a way it doesn't want to bend then

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.499 
in a way it doesn't want to bend then
you're<00:05:33.279> not<00:05:33.310> going<00:05:33.580> to<00:05:33.699> rip<00:05:33.819> it<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.150> like<00:05:34.360> I

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
you're not going to rip it and like I

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.300 
you're not going to rip it and like I
said<00:05:34.569> even<00:05:34.960> if<00:05:35.199> you<00:05:35.349> do<00:05:35.500> rip<00:05:35.680> it<00:05:35.860> it's<00:05:36.009> hard<00:05:36.189> to

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
said even if you do rip it it's hard to

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.909 
said even if you do rip it it's hard to
tell<00:05:36.490> in<00:05:36.669> the<00:05:36.789> end<00:05:36.819> product<00:05:37.210> and<00:05:38.020> now<00:05:38.560> you<00:05:38.620> need

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
tell in the end product and now you need

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.510 
tell in the end product and now you need
the<00:05:39.129> four<00:05:39.430> in<00:05:39.699> between<00:05:40.090> all<00:05:40.300> of<00:05:40.330> those<00:05:41.490> so<00:05:42.490> you

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
the four in between all of those so you

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.559 
the four in between all of those so you
want<00:05:43.020> if<00:05:44.020> you<00:05:44.169> look<00:05:44.349> at<00:05:44.469> the<00:05:44.590> bottom<00:05:44.919> you<00:05:45.069> have

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569 
want if you look at the bottom you have

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:49.409 
want if you look at the bottom you have
you<00:05:46.569> still<00:05:46.870> have<00:05:47.139> another<00:05:47.770> layer<00:05:48.129> here<00:05:48.849> with

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
you still have another layer here with

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.930 
you still have another layer here with
petals<00:05:49.810> so<00:05:50.620> you<00:05:50.680> do<00:05:50.889> the<00:05:50.919> same<00:05:51.250> thing<00:05:51.550> it's<00:05:51.849> a

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
petals so you do the same thing it's a

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.100 
petals so you do the same thing it's a
little<00:05:52.060> bit<00:05:52.210> different<00:05:52.690> because<00:05:52.750> you<00:05:52.930> don't

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
little bit different because you don't

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.430 
little bit different because you don't
have<00:05:53.169> any<00:05:53.289> corners<00:05:53.860> to<00:05:54.250> flip<00:05:55.150> up<00:05:55.330> anymore<00:05:55.629> so

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
have any corners to flip up anymore so

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.700 
have any corners to flip up anymore so
you<00:05:56.529> just<00:05:56.680> put<00:05:56.740> your<00:05:56.979> thumb<00:05:57.190> here<00:05:57.520> on<00:05:57.789> the<00:05:57.969> edge

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
you just put your thumb here on the edge

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.029 
you just put your thumb here on the edge
get<00:05:59.710> the<00:05:59.860> paper<00:06:00.039> from<00:06:00.279> underneath<00:06:00.639> and<00:06:01.180> pull

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
get the paper from underneath and pull

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.450 
get the paper from underneath and pull
it<00:06:03.039> up<00:06:04.169> and<00:06:05.169> I'll<00:06:05.710> show<00:06:05.889> you<00:06:05.919> from<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:06.250> other

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
it up and I'll show you from the other

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.540 
it up and I'll show you from the other
side

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.630 

so<00:06:10.420> it's<00:06:10.660> just<00:06:10.990> that<00:06:11.260> flat<00:06:11.530> edge<00:06:11.740> and<00:06:12.070> then

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
so it's just that flat edge and then

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.240 
so it's just that flat edge and then
you'll<00:06:12.820> have<00:06:12.940> some<00:06:13.210> resistance<00:06:13.780> here<00:06:14.200> if<00:06:14.380> you

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
you'll have some resistance here if you

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.830 
you'll have some resistance here if you
have<00:06:15.400> your<00:06:15.550> thumb<00:06:15.820> in<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.120> right<00:06:16.300> place<00:06:16.510> over

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
have your thumb in the right place over

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.440 
have your thumb in the right place over
here<00:06:17.370> then<00:06:18.370> you<00:06:18.490> just<00:06:18.700> push<00:06:18.880> with<00:06:19.060> your<00:06:19.090> thumb

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
here then you just push with your thumb

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.190 
here then you just push with your thumb
and<00:06:19.720> pull<00:06:20.410> it<00:06:20.440> up<00:06:20.680> slowly<00:06:21.390> this<00:06:22.390> is<00:06:22.660> the<00:06:22.960> point

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
and pull it up slowly this is the point

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.140 
and pull it up slowly this is the point
where<00:06:23.380> you<00:06:23.650> will<00:06:23.830> get<00:06:24.010> the<00:06:24.190> most<00:06:24.400> rips<00:06:24.700> like

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
where you will get the most rips like

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.170 
where you will get the most rips like
right<00:06:25.390> there<00:06:25.540> you<00:06:25.750> have<00:06:25.900> a<00:06:25.930> rip<00:06:27.000> if<00:06:28.000> that's

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
right there you have a rip if that's

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.670 
right there you have a rip if that's
okay<00:06:28.420> it'll<00:06:28.660> be<00:06:28.720> covered<00:06:29.080> up<00:06:29.170> by<00:06:29.320> the<00:06:29.350> next

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
okay it'll be covered up by the next

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.730 
okay it'll be covered up by the next
layer<00:06:30.480> okay<00:06:31.480> and<00:06:31.630> then<00:06:31.720> the<00:06:31.840> last<00:06:32.020> one<00:06:32.290> you

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
layer okay and then the last one you

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.610 
layer okay and then the last one you
just<00:06:33.010> want<00:06:33.280> to<00:06:33.370> take<00:06:33.760> this<00:06:34.000> last<00:06:34.330> layer<00:06:34.690> so

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
just want to take this last layer so

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.830 
just want to take this last layer so
this<00:06:35.830> is<00:06:36.010> one<00:06:36.610> more<00:06:36.820> layer<00:06:37.090> and<00:06:37.360> then<00:06:37.480> you<00:06:37.660> just

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
this is one more layer and then you just

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.390 
this is one more layer and then you just
have<00:06:37.990> a<00:06:38.020> flat<00:06:38.320> piece<00:06:38.500> of<00:06:38.560> paper<00:06:38.830> under<00:06:39.040> there

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
have a flat piece of paper under there

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.850 
have a flat piece of paper under there
and<00:06:39.550> then<00:06:40.390> you<00:06:40.510> just<00:06:40.660> hold<00:06:40.870> it<00:06:40.990> out<00:06:41.140> well<00:06:41.770> you

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
and then you just hold it out well you

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.520 
and then you just hold it out well you
don't<00:06:42.040> have<00:06:42.070> to<00:06:42.190> pull<00:06:42.430> it<00:06:42.460> out<00:06:42.670> that<00:06:43.030> much<00:06:43.530> you

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
don't have to pull it out that much you

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.930 
don't have to pull it out that much you
kind<00:06:44.770> of<00:06:44.860> just<00:06:45.040> pull<00:06:45.250> it<00:06:45.370> until<00:06:45.460> you<00:06:45.760> feel

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
kind of just pull it until you feel

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.490 
kind of just pull it until you feel
resistance<00:06:46.150> and<00:06:46.900> then<00:06:47.050> you<00:06:47.140> can<00:06:47.290> leave<00:06:47.470> it

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
resistance and then you can leave it

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:54.090 
resistance and then you can leave it
flat<00:06:49.020> right<00:06:50.020> there<00:06:50.380> see<00:06:52.260> and<00:06:53.260> then<00:06:53.770> you<00:06:53.920> just

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
flat right there see and then you just
