 fit repeat insert will keep 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.080
 alignment with other vehicles 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.020
 and spacing and that however that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.909
 everything is perfect 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.950
 every passage of the motorized parade is 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.250
 analyzed by retail 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.990
 average speed of 14.7 km alignment 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.220
 vehicles and especially the clicks 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.030
 troops in front of the platform 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.119
 presidential 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.240
 nothing is left to chance how to 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.280
 good pot this morning you are awake awake 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.590
 we're going to go on it what does not work 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.149
 it is not 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.640
 the alignments in the rows there you 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.960
 have regressed whereas yesterday you had me 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.100
 show that you are and you are 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.100
 largely able to do it 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.640
 it was beautiful on the first repeats this 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.229
 profession the best there is no longer there 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.009
 and this is especially true at the moment 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.200
 of the burst 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.090
 you really have to keep this 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.030
 alignment until the last moment 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.950
 until the red line continues on 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.920
 do not anticipate and that's anyway 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.720
 what we will remember from the parade because 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.380
 the cameras only sees this location 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.370
 the authorities only see that while 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.489
 repetitions follow each other 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.299
 fatigue begins to be felt 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.489
 but a bad for a good 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:24.549
 July 14th will be a moment 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.410
 unforgettable for all yesterday the first 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.450
 Basel rehearsal lasted all afternoon 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.120
 and it's true that it's still 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.950
 tiring so at night we do not big 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.810
 we are going to sleep we are resting the fact 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.650
 to repeat that so it gives us a 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.160
 before taste actually and I really have to 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.200
 say 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.239
 the appointment is made for the day j 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.530
 more rehearsals but a parade 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.530
 unique on the most beautiful avenue
