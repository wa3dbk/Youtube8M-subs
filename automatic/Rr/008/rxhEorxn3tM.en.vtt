 these two files unzip 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.390
 depending on our type of system 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.700
 that we have in my case 64 bits should 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.100
 right click on extract here I will leave 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.210
 this little file of the double click of 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.900
 denis track 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.710
 mark these pita 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.190
 and it would be great now we would go to the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.190
 toolbar 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.830
 let's see click here 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.350
 this little icon will appear 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.930
 we double click and here we would have all 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.300
 the good effects explains them the first 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.490
 briefly share these effects only 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.020
 they apply when we have 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.480
 open several windows good in this 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.980
 case I'll show you this effect let's 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.760
 to mark this effect will load us 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.040
 this little bar 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.230
 I once loaded we can appreciate the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.209
 next effect at the time of having a 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.980
 back window if we press click on 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.560
 the back window the window that 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.680
 it was in front it becomes transparent 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.090
 sometimes you manage to minimize ok very well 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.470
 will open another window because you 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.130
 can better appreciate the effect as 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.349
 can see this would be here it becomes 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.630
 transparent the window to undo 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.420
 this effect all that the only thing 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.250
 we have to do is click here 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.349
 loading the small bar and sedesa 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.180
 it will be the effect very well intendente 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.290
 environment we have the effects but that 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.110
 He left them for you to taste them 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.209
 well we go to the next part these 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.489
 effects are mainly given when you 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.010
 move the windows I will pass to try this 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.700
 effect 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.960
 this effect gives us a jelly style 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.180
 in the windows as you can see 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.250
 it's an excellent effect and if we mark 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.740
 these pita here would be like a 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.440
 complement for this effect that would be 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.510
 the little stars at the moment of 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.570
 move the window another of the effects 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.290
 great that it would be this from here to 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.260
 moment to put the window on the edge of the 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.500
 desk 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.329
 we pass to the other side as they can 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.620
 see and if we do it from this side 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.620
 the same thing also happens 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.480
 very well we will leave as it was 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.680
 windows 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.730
 and we will leave by default uncheck this 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.500
 and we will move on to the following effects 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.599
 I recommend that you try the 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.299
 effects that are also really good 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:08.170
 well the next part the third and 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:11.690
 last would be the effects at the time of 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.800
 minimize and maximize windows good 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.290
 in this case let's try this here 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.810
 we hope they charge 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.160
 and the moment we minimize 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.700
 the window will give us a small 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.690
 effect 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.690
 how could they see 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.390
 good to give a small period until 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:38.630
 the system regularizes the effect 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.760
 very well I will show you another effect that 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.020
 it would be this here aurora 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.020
 and we let them carry 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.410
 and as you could appreciate it is a 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.850
 excellent effect also for saleh 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.830
 show them this effect here that 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.530
 I also consider it very good and 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.800
 we will mark this complement for the 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.430
 cursor 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.430
 what if 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.990
 and how could you appreciate this 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.440
 course now the time to close the 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.440
 window 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.410
 it gives us a small cloud if it is 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.670
 okay 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.310
