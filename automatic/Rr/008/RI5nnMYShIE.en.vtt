00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.879
 Hello everyone and welcome to this mine 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.870
 last video of the super play of super 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.150
 mario galaxy 2 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.700
 as usual I want to finish the esprit 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.250
 reviewing four 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.680
 aspects of the gameplay music game la 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.329
 story and multiplayer and assigning a 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.619
 vote each aspect 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.809
 finally a final grade of the game 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.820
 will result more or less from the average of the 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:30.149
 four votes given previously 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.149
 good vision 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.050
 the gameplay is well done though 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.250
 obviously very similar to that of 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.780
 galaxy 1 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.600
 the controls are the same but they are well 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.130
 made in coffee which way you notice 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.590
 which I personally find 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.390
 very uncomfortable they knew anyway 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.790
 differentiate yourself from the previous game 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.230
 of the series by inserting some novelties such as 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.300
 for example the green stars that 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.670
 lengthen the light is life of the game without 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.290
 too much stew they added too 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.360
 some characters like the monkey 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.910
 loathe even though for ever sincerely 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.800
 they could not even put it on mark and they are 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.600
 personal things and have changed the 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.070
 galaxy selection system that 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.380
 despite being simpler than that of 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.749
 race psi however one remains in my opinion 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.880
 is an effective method have been added 

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:14.530
 new and many interesting upgrades 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.840
 fats that have revived the variety of 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.539
 this game is quite different 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.039
 from the predecessor in this respect and 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.200
 they also added eyes to everyone 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.539
 its related upgrade profiles 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.039
 let's not forget the final vote that 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.039
 from gameplay and nine and a half 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.659
 as for the music I don't have 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.460
 a lot to say except this game 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.899
 to the most beautiful music in my opinion 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.570
 all video games 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.970
 I know that now will might seem 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.159
 exaggerated however this music game beats 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.590
 any situation that never tires e 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.060
 which get attached quickly and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.679
 battle battle music 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.909
 final against base for example is 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.770
 fantastic 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.899
 the vote that from the music and maybe 10 a 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.770
 you will seem exaggerated but in my opinion for 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.770
 this game is not 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.170
 history is not much compared 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.000
 care of galaxy 1 however travel anyway 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.799
 to present on a spaceship with the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.330
 mario face up to the 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.580
 galaxy where to challenge bowser in one 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.500
 epic battle and the satisfaction of 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.110
 save pitcher meet rosalinda 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.090
 in the end it is a fantastic thing to 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.530
 story from a 9 because I was a little disappointed 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.530
 and you could do a little better 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.739
 I know 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.280
 multiplayer consists of having a 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.720
 2 remote control works like one 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.640
 glitter that can help you 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.080
 collect astro splinters to block 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.880
 enemies and little else 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.070
 the concept is more or less the same as 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.870
 race xvi 1 could do in my opinion is a 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.690
 more ast multiplayer as super core 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.090
 mario 3d world but it probably is 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.760
 it was better this way no one knows we should 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:03:04.000
 having tried it in multiplayer then do 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:06.250
 an eight and a half the final vote that gives 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.900
 this game and nine and a half I know it's a 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.430
 little more than the arithmetic mean though 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.920
 I think this game really deserves 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.750
 so I recommend it especially if 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.670
 you didn't play the first one but even though 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.160
 you played there you can take it 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.959
 same to a great longevity and is a 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.670
 great adventure game 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.440
 now it's your turn to tell me what in the comments 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.060
 think about this game if you are 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.010
 agree with me what rating you would have 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.770
 given and everything related to this 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.610
 game that you want to say hello and to 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.610
 next the ex play
