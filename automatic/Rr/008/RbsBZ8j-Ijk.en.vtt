00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.189
 you will relax one of the species 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.619
 parking other books along the curb 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:26.710
 check in on the curb most alexander physics 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:30.400
 Movement shirli will come parks which 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.169
 caring along the curb on the curb 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.820
 such parking is used only then 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.190
 when we have no opportunity to rejoice 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:41.230
 parking in reverse along the curb 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.269
 create care we will say more 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.519
 safe manners may not quite 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.949
 initially easy and clear but at the same 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.659
 time is an easier way if 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.519
 learn to 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.680
 forward we only park 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.879
 when we do not have the opportunity to admire 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.479
 in reverse 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.940
 those who do not have a low profile rubber 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:02.379
 high ground clearance is better 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.080
 do very carefully 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.909
 if not avoid it at all so 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.530
 start driving up with you 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.380
 parking u should we turn 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.270
 right about then from hard standing 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.630
 be careful of catching 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.390
 body words installed bumper which 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.550
 could just have passed even the opposite 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.680
 very slowly 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.150
 first on the chewing wheels 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.660
 jump a little bit to the right so we 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.930
 cleaned up 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.220
 do not tread rubber profiles charge 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.220
 So slow 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.650
 instead of not gas and almost immediately 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.720
 we look at the mirrors of the right one 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.220
 must go lower in order to 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.020
 see our two rear wheel is located 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.340
 before 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.450
 emitting for curbs is also very slow 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.689
 descended leveling the walls along the curb 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.210
 enable reverse gear straighten steering 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.340
 level car front rear 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:03.459
 dizao4 cars, that's all 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:05.530
 today we mastered parking in front 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.060
 exit stop at the border not horrible 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.569
 high ground clearance and low presses on 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.580
 rubber 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.590
 shared in yourself caution was with you 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.040
