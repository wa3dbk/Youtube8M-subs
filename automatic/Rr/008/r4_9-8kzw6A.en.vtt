00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello people, welcome to the channel. 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.000
 skate portal My name is louis and today 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.780
 I'm going to teach a very cool work 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.580
 taxes such as the tax consists of a 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.799
 complete turn around country brings with 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:27.420
 skate and now I'll do the step by step 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:29.460
 how the first step is performed is 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.349
 train well from behind because if you ever 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.610
 tried this maneuver before your father should 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.420
 less accustomed to this 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.670
 movement 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.440
 so train off the skateboard by hand 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.239
 to push the skate point if there is 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.239
 while it makes a circular motion 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.310
 after that only on having to train 11 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.330
 next huck is almost the same as the 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.400
 last exercise 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.080
 but I see you use the hand if you put 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.080
 the front foot below 12 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.740
 if you feel ease that the new 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.380
 tax has people doing 180graus 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.640
 defect is not required but will also 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.640
 help get the next one 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.210
 made 180 12 hulk taxes 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.260
 after you have performed exercises 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.440
 previous 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.790
 It will be time to make the next US 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.770
 Let's start by training that neither the 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:50.680
 other off-the- skate exercises for 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:54.030
 Acquire the foot because you felt 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.030
 safe try on skateboard 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.860
 pet back well filled I have not 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.550
 take care of the sheik a little to 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.630
 outside and the front foot does not do anything alone 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.630
 Get around the place. 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.940
 you can train in possession or stop the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.940
 because it was easier for you 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.780
 I was very demanding and requires a lot of patience 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.610
 You can rest assured that you live here. 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.610
 So good luck and good workouts. 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.150

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.260
 very old possession previous 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.260
