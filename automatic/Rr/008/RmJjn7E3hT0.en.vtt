00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
um let's say let's climb up here see if

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.570 
um let's say let's climb up here see if
we<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.650> find<00:01:07.830> somewhere<00:01:08.100> where<00:01:08.280> since<00:01:08.490> we

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
we can find somewhere where since we

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.580 
we can find somewhere where since we
didn't<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.090> grid<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.570> his<00:01:09.930> start<00:01:10.320> let's

damn<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.959> man<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:53.620> if<00:02:53.860> let's<00:02:54.280> say<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.550> earn<00:02:54.940> a

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
damn it man but if let's say I earn a

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.410 
damn it man but if let's say I earn a
$1.00<00:02:56.739> per<00:02:57.160> thousand<00:02:57.640> views<00:02:57.670> yes<00:02:58.150> that's

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
$1.00 per thousand views yes that's

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.229 
$1.00 per thousand views yes that's
easier<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.930> make<00:03:00.330> $1.00<00:03:01.380> 4000<00:03:02.380> views<00:03:03.239> at

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
easier to make $1.00 4000 views at

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.270 
easier to make $1.00 4000 views at
machinima<00:03:04.930> or<00:03:05.050> someone<00:03:05.500> now<00:03:05.680> for<00:03:06.160> example

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
machinima or someone now for example

machinima or some other channel they

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.370 
machinima or some other channel they
would<00:03:09.489> they<00:03:10.180> would<00:03:10.270> pay<00:03:10.480> me<00:03:10.600> half<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:11.080> for

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
would they would pay me half of that for

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.199 
would they would pay me half of that for
example<00:03:11.850> with<00:03:12.850> age<00:03:13.060> of<00:03:13.239> gaming<00:03:13.630> they<00:03:15.000> they<00:03:16.000> pay

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
example with age of gaming they they pay

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.330 
example with age of gaming they they pay
let's<00:03:16.540> say<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.780> earn<00:03:17.019> $2<00:03:17.739> machinima<00:03:18.220> would

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
let's say I earn $2 machinima would

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.800 
let's say I earn $2 machinima would
still<00:03:18.610> pay<00:03:18.760> me<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.090> $1<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.750> take<00:03:19.930> half<00:03:20.140> of<00:03:20.320> it

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
still pay me the $1 and take half of it

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.140 
still pay me the $1 and take half of it
with<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.930> age<00:03:23.049> of<00:03:23.200> gaming<00:03:23.590> they<00:03:23.799> they<00:03:24.400> give

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
with the age of gaming they they give

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.030 
with the age of gaming they they give
you<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.450> two<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.959> then<00:03:26.200> they<00:03:26.380> take<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.620> really

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
you the two and then they take a really

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.840 
you the two and then they take a really
small<00:03:27.340> share<00:03:27.640> of<00:03:27.670> is<00:03:27.880> like<00:03:28.090> 90%<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:29.850> that

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
small share of is like 90% so that

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.880 
small share of is like 90% so that
that's<00:03:31.150> awesome<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:31.900> let's<00:03:32.380> say<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.620> do
