00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.360 

I<00:01:40.550> just<00:01:41.550> had<00:01:41.730> a<00:01:41.760> to<00:01:42.720> squib<00:01:43.080> loads<00:01:43.830> in<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.130> row<00:01:46.370> I'm

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
I just had a to squib loads in a row I'm

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.520 
I just had a to squib loads in a row I'm
using<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.880> new<00:01:48.030> progressive<00:01:48.270> loader<00:01:48.900> as<00:01:49.170> you've

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
using a new progressive loader as you've

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.120 
using a new progressive loader as you've
probably<00:01:49.560> seen<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.220> some<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.490> my<00:01:50.580> videos<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
probably seen on some of my videos and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.900 
probably seen on some of my videos and
evidently<00:01:53.130> I've<00:01:53.310> found<00:01:53.460> something<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.880> I

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
evidently I've found something that I

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.780 
evidently I've found something that I
need<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.090> address<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:55.440> powder<00:01:55.680> throwers<00:01:56.550> not

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
need to address the powder throwers not

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
need to address the powder throwers not
always<00:01:57.210> throwing<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.230> charge<00:01:58.640> because<00:01:59.810> there's

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
always throwing a charge because there's

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.020 
always throwing a charge because there's
been<00:02:01.020> two<00:02:01.310> rounds<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.490> think<00:02:02.820> both<00:02:03.000> of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
been two rounds that I think both of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.440 
been two rounds that I think both of
them<00:02:03.210> are<00:02:03.330> actually<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.720> camera<00:02:05.300> where<00:02:06.300> this

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
them are actually on camera where this

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.980 
them are actually on camera where this
was<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:06.900> squib<00:02:07.170> load<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:08.340> first<00:02:08.580> one<00:02:08.899> like<00:02:09.899> to

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
was a squib load the first one like to

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.180 
was a squib load the first one like to
say<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.229> both<00:02:10.350> sound<00:02:10.619> different<00:02:11.009> for<00:02:11.100> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
say that both sound different for the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.330 
say that both sound different for the
first<00:02:11.370> one<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:12.600> bullet<00:02:12.870> did<00:02:13.080> evacuate<00:02:13.680> barrel

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
first one the bullet did evacuate barrel

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.710 
first one the bullet did evacuate barrel
the<00:02:14.490> barrel<00:02:14.520> was<00:02:14.850> just<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.150> little<00:02:15.240> dirty<00:02:15.450> from

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
the barrel was just a little dirty from

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.320 
the barrel was just a little dirty from
the<00:02:15.750> unburned<00:02:16.170> powder<00:02:16.350> but<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.250> one<00:02:17.490> I'm

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
the unburned powder but this one I'm

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.820 
the unburned powder but this one I'm
going<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.570> step<00:02:19.050> over<00:02:19.170> here<00:02:19.440> behind<00:02:19.620> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
going to step over here behind the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.340 
going to step over here behind the
camera<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.370> can<00:02:20.400> see<00:02:20.730> here<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.930> should<00:02:22.170> be

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
camera so I can see here you should be

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.960 
camera so I can see here you should be
able<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.650> see<00:02:22.830> daylight<00:02:23.220> through<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.610> barrel

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
able to see daylight through that barrel

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.770 
able to see daylight through that barrel
with<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.540> chamber<00:02:24.840> open<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:26.270> they<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
with the chamber open and they the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.770 
with the chamber open and they the
bullet<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.260> actually<00:02:28.709> stuck<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.370> barrel

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
bullet is actually stuck in the barrel

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.870 
bullet is actually stuck in the barrel
as<00:02:30.780> something<00:02:31.140> that's<00:02:31.200> very<00:02:31.290> important<00:02:31.920> if

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
as something that's very important if

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.110

hear your firearm do anything different

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.580 
hear your firearm do anything different
feel<00:02:44.070> different<00:02:44.550> sound<00:02:45.360> different<00:02:45.810> do<00:02:46.410> not

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
feel different sound different do not

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.699 
feel different sound different do not
fire<00:02:46.800> another<00:02:46.950> round<00:02:47.070> check<00:02:47.760> for<00:02:48.060> squib<00:02:48.360> load

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
fire another round check for squib load

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.640 
fire another round check for squib load
because<00:02:49.709> if<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.310> would<00:02:50.459> fire<00:02:50.700> another<00:02:51.000> round

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
because if I would fire another round

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.600 
because if I would fire another round
actually<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.769> didn't<00:02:53.010> chamber<00:02:53.370> another<00:02:53.489> round

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
actually it didn't chamber another round

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.310 
actually it didn't chamber another round
cuz<00:02:53.910> there<00:02:54.030> was<00:02:54.090> enough<00:02:54.330> power<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.750> act<00:02:55.019> fake

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
cuz there was enough power to act fake

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.280 
cuz there was enough power to act fake
slide<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.940> had<00:02:57.180> there<00:02:57.360> been<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:57.930> fired

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
slide but had there been and I fired

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.810 
slide but had there been and I fired
under<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.769> round<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.430> could<00:02:59.670> have<00:02:59.760> been

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
under the round it could have been

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.030 
under the round it could have been
detrimental
