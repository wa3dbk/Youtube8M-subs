there's<00:02:50.120> very<00:02:50.450> few<00:02:50.720> people<00:02:50.930> see<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.440> whole

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
there's very few people see the whole

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.610 
there's very few people see the whole
rainbow<00:02:51.920> spectrum<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:53.900> may<00:02:54.079> just<00:02:54.110> have

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
rainbow spectrum and you may just have

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.590 
rainbow spectrum and you may just have
like<00:02:55.130> snippets<00:02:55.940> through<00:02:56.150> your<00:02:56.269> life<00:02:56.390> or

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
you'll see this rainbow spectrum but

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.530 
you'll see this rainbow spectrum but
more<00:02:58.640> often<00:02:58.880> than<00:02:59.030> not<00:02:59.060> it's<00:02:59.390> just<00:02:59.630> that<00:02:59.810> clear

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540

just<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.590> little<00:03:32.800> bit<00:03:33.450> yeah<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.480> little<00:03:35.440> bit<00:03:35.530> and

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
just a little bit yeah a little bit and

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.590 
just a little bit yeah a little bit and
this<00:03:36.370> is<00:03:36.550> not<00:03:36.700> something<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:37.390> think

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
this is not something that you think

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.690 
this is not something that you think
about<00:03:37.750> because<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.470> thing<00:03:38.680> we<00:03:38.860> do<00:03:39.160> is<00:03:39.580> the

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
about because the thing we do is the

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.130 
about because the thing we do is the
thing<00:03:39.880> that<00:03:40.000> we've<00:03:40.150> been<00:03:40.300> hypnotized<00:03:40.840> into

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
thing that we've been hypnotized into

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.490 
thing that we've been hypnotized into
doing<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:42.130> being<00:03:43.090> told<00:03:43.450> oh<00:03:43.750> this<00:03:43.990> is<00:03:44.110> my<00:03:44.290> eyes

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
doing is being told oh this is my eyes

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.190 
doing is being told oh this is my eyes
playing<00:03:44.950> tricks<00:03:45.070> on<00:03:45.490> me<00:03:45.550> all<00:03:46.210> right<00:03:46.390> you've

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
playing tricks on me all right you've

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.930 
playing tricks on me all right you've
got<00:03:47.320> to<00:03:47.410> switch<00:03:47.920> your<00:03:48.130> mind<00:03:48.310> up<00:03:48.490> a<00:03:48.550> bit<00:03:48.700> so<00:03:48.880> you

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
got to switch your mind up a bit so you

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.430 
got to switch your mind up a bit so you
don't<00:03:49.180> think<00:03:49.450> this<00:03:49.540> is<00:03:49.600> my<00:03:49.720> eyes<00:03:50.020> playing

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
don't think this is my eyes playing

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.080 
don't think this is my eyes playing
tricks<00:03:50.560> on<00:03:50.950> me<00:03:51.010> okay

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
tricks on me okay

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.170 
tricks on me okay
so<00:03:52.990> just<00:03:53.680> take<00:03:54.100> three<00:03:54.400> nice<00:03:54.610> deep<00:03:54.940> breaths

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
so just take three nice deep breaths

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:03.589 
so just take three nice deep breaths
does<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:55.510> help<00:03:55.720> still<00:03:56.050> a<00:03:56.080> mind

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.050 

now<00:04:04.109> I<00:04:04.140> just<00:04:04.349> have<00:04:04.499> a<00:04:04.530> hand<00:04:05.249> down<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.849> just

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
now I just have a hand down and just

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:14.119 
now I just have a hand down and just
have<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.269> look<00:04:06.420> again<00:04:12.709> that's<00:04:13.709> right

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
have a look again that's right

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.500 
have a look again that's right
it<00:04:14.249> just<00:04:14.459> means<00:04:14.579> you're<00:04:14.790> using<00:04:14.819> inline<00:04:15.209> the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
it just means you're using inline the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.449 
it just means you're using inline the
bit<00:04:15.659> too<00:04:15.810> much<00:04:15.930> other<00:04:16.169> than<00:04:16.289> my<00:04:16.530> hand<00:04:16.769> let's

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
bit too much other than my hand let's

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.839 
bit too much other than my hand let's
push<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.699> bit<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.060> Jerry<00:04:19.579> hands<00:04:20.579> are<00:04:20.669> very<00:04:20.699> cold

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
push a bit and Jerry hands are very cold

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.490 
push a bit and Jerry hands are very cold
too<00:04:21.359> which<00:04:21.539> doesn't<00:04:21.930> help<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.109> means<00:04:22.349> it's

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
too which doesn't help that means it's

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.309 
too which doesn't help that means it's
low<00:04:22.650> energy

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:25.319 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:30.749 

okay<00:04:26.759> the<00:04:27.759> meditation<00:04:28.330> technique<00:04:29.759> now

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
okay the meditation technique now

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.219 
okay the meditation technique now
there's<00:04:31.030> two<00:04:31.300> ways<00:04:31.330> we<00:04:31.719> can<00:04:31.840> do<00:04:31.990> it<00:04:32.020> because

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
there's two ways we can do it because

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.089 
there's two ways we can do it because
we're<00:04:32.650> in<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:33.219> group<00:04:33.639> here<00:04:34.259> I'll<00:04:35.259> spare<00:04:35.710> you<00:04:35.889> one

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
we're in a group here I'll spare you one

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.820 
we're in a group here I'll spare you one
off<00:04:36.789> anyone<00:04:37.270> but<00:04:37.389> have<00:04:37.689> you<00:04:37.779> all<00:04:37.960> done<00:04:37.990> or

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
off anyone but have you all done or

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.100 
off anyone but have you all done or
heard<00:04:39.069> of<00:04:39.219> the<00:04:39.370> technique<00:04:39.759> where<00:04:39.969> you<00:04:40.150> a<00:04:40.449> group

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
heard of the technique where you a group

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.899 
heard of the technique where you a group
of<00:04:41.229> people<00:04:41.409> stands<00:04:41.770> around<00:04:42.039> somebody<00:04:42.430> raises

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909 
of people stands around somebody raises

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.909 
of people stands around somebody raises
the<00:04:43.029> energy<00:04:43.060> breathes<00:04:43.779> in<00:04:43.990> synchronization

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
the energy breathes in synchronization

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.950 
the energy breathes in synchronization
and<00:04:45.490> then<00:04:45.669> if<00:04:45.759> the<00:04:45.879> person<00:04:46.060> it's<00:04:46.449> a<00:04:46.539> person<00:04:46.870> up

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
and then if the person it's a person up

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.649 
and then if the person it's a person up
by<00:04:47.080> putting<00:04:47.349> two<00:04:47.529> fingers<00:04:47.919> under<00:04:48.249> their<00:04:48.400> knees

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.370 

basically<00:04:52.659> all<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:52.990> is

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
basically all that is

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.130 
basically all that is
I<00:04:54.440> mean<00:04:55.100> people<00:04:56.000> who<00:04:56.150> move<00:04:56.330> furniture<00:04:56.900> for<00:04:57.080> a

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
I mean people who move furniture for a

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.100 
I mean people who move furniture for a
living<00:04:57.170> know<00:04:57.920> how<00:04:58.160> to<00:04:58.220> do<00:04:58.490> this<00:04:58.670> anyway<00:04:59.240> it's

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
living know how to do this anyway it's

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.930 
living know how to do this anyway it's
it's<00:05:00.500> a<00:05:00.620> technique<00:05:01.010> they<00:05:01.190> use<00:05:01.400> to<00:05:01.640> be<00:05:01.700> able<00:05:01.790> to

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
it's a technique they use to be able to

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.490 
it's a technique they use to be able to
pick<00:05:02.120> up<00:05:02.240> wardrobes<00:05:02.810> and<00:05:02.930> put<00:05:03.140> them<00:05:03.290> in<00:05:03.410> the

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
pick up wardrobes and put them in the

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.330 
pick up wardrobes and put them in the
backs<00:05:03.680> of<00:05:03.890> trucks<00:05:04.070> they<00:05:05.000> breathe<00:05:05.300> together

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.980 

what<00:05:11.340> you're<00:05:11.520> basically<00:05:12.030> doing<00:05:12.240> by<00:05:12.540> using

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
what you're basically doing by using

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.220 
what you're basically doing by using
these<00:05:13.350> techniques<00:05:13.860> is<00:05:14.250> changing<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.600> gravity

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
these techniques is changing the gravity

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.590 
these techniques is changing the gravity
of<00:05:16.500> something<00:05:17.070> so<00:05:17.550> we<00:05:17.670> measure<00:05:17.940> specific

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
of something so we measure specific

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.150 
of something so we measure specific
gravity<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.170> actually<00:05:19.350> have<00:05:19.680> a<00:05:19.710> technique

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
gravity and I actually have a technique

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160 
gravity and I actually have a technique
where<00:05:20.430> I<00:05:20.670> take<00:05:21.030> people<00:05:21.390> into<00:05:21.510> a<00:05:21.630> swimming<00:05:21.990> pool

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
where I take people into a swimming pool

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.900 
where I take people into a swimming pool
which<00:05:22.380> is<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.650> easiest<00:05:22.980> way<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.220> learn<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:23.730> I

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
which is the easiest way to learn it I

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.240 
which is the easiest way to learn it I
want<00:05:24.690> to<00:05:24.750> get<00:05:24.840> them<00:05:24.960> to<00:05:25.080> do<00:05:25.200> is<00:05:25.320> float<00:05:25.620> you<00:05:26.010> find

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
want to get them to do is float you find

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.860 
want to get them to do is float you find
out<00:05:26.400> your<00:05:26.520> own<00:05:26.640> natural<00:05:26.880> floating<00:05:27.540> levels

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
out your own natural floating levels

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.480 
out your own natural floating levels
some<00:05:28.170> people's<00:05:28.530> natural<00:05:28.710> floating<00:05:29.280> liver

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
some people's natural floating liver

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.220 
some people's natural floating liver
isn't<00:05:29.820> really<00:05:30.150> an<00:05:30.330> inch<00:05:30.510> under<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:30.990> water

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
isn't really an inch under the water

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.080 
isn't really an inch under the water
okay<00:05:32.220> as<00:05:32.370> long<00:05:32.490> as<00:05:32.550> you<00:05:32.700> can<00:05:32.820> keep<00:05:32.940> putting

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
okay as long as you can keep putting

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.080 
okay as long as you can keep putting
your<00:05:33.300> head<00:05:33.390> up<00:05:33.510> breathing<00:05:34.880> from<00:05:35.880> whatever

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
your head up breathing from whatever

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.670 
your head up breathing from whatever
that<00:05:36.420> natural<00:05:36.870> flow<00:05:36.990> through<00:05:37.260> level<00:05:37.560> is

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
that natural flow through level is

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.160 
that natural flow through level is
without<00:05:38.190> holding<00:05:38.730> the<00:05:38.760> breath<00:05:39.030> I'm<00:05:39.690> adjusting

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
without holding the breath I'm adjusting

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.570 
without holding the breath I'm adjusting
your<00:05:40.500> breathing<00:05:40.830> because<00:05:41.130> if<00:05:41.250> you<00:05:41.340> adjust

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
your breathing because if you adjust

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.970 
your breathing because if you adjust
your<00:05:41.670> breathing<00:05:42.210> it's<00:05:42.960> simply<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:43.500> amount<00:05:43.800> of

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
your breathing it's simply the amount of

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.960 
your breathing it's simply the amount of
air<00:05:44.220> in<00:05:44.430> your<00:05:44.520> lungs<00:05:44.580> very<00:05:46.370> so<00:05:47.370> just<00:05:47.580> hold<00:05:47.820> your

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
air in your lungs very so just hold your

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.210 
air in your lungs very so just hold your
breath<00:05:48.030> at<00:05:48.360> a<00:05:48.420> particular<00:05:48.750> level<00:05:49.140> and<00:05:50.100> then

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
breath at a particular level and then

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.440 
breath at a particular level and then
I'll<00:05:50.340> show<00:05:50.490> you<00:05:50.520> a<00:05:50.640> meditation<00:05:51.090> technique

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
I'll show you a meditation technique

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.600 
I'll show you a meditation technique
whereby<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:52.590> will<00:05:52.620> lower<00:05:52.950> yourself<00:05:53.400> in<00:05:53.520> the

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
whereby you will lower yourself in the

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.690 
whereby you will lower yourself in the
water<00:05:53.850> and<00:05:54.090> racism<00:05:54.980> is<00:05:55.980> the<00:05:56.160> technique<00:05:56.670> that

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
water and racism is the technique that

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.580 
water and racism is the technique that
the<00:05:56.970> Tibetans<00:05:57.510> use<00:05:57.720> when<00:05:58.290> you<00:05:58.380> hear<00:05:58.560> about

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
the Tibetans use when you hear about

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.860 
the Tibetans use when you hear about
them<00:05:58.980> traveling<00:05:59.850> across<00:06:00.090> vast<00:06:00.660> distances

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
them traveling across vast distances

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.100 
them traveling across vast distances
very<00:06:01.470> quickly<00:06:02.010> actually<00:06:03.000> lighten<00:06:03.690> themselves

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
very quickly actually lighten themselves

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.159 
very quickly actually lighten themselves
they<00:06:04.260> can<00:06:04.470> move<00:06:04.620> quickly

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.459 

how<00:06:08.770> the<00:06:09.029> rocks<00:06:10.029> remove<00:06:10.419> these<00:06:10.629> island<00:06:11.259> or<00:06:11.379> the

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:11.469 
how the rocks remove these island or the

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.110 
how the rocks remove these island or the
rocks<00:06:11.680> to<00:06:11.800> move<00:06:11.979> to<00:06:12.129> the<00:06:12.219> standing<00:06:12.639> circles

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
rocks to move to the standing circles

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.480 
rocks to move to the standing circles
right<00:06:13.569> I<00:06:13.810> just<00:06:13.840> changed<00:06:14.529> the<00:06:14.710> gravity<00:06:15.310> for<00:06:15.460> a

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
right I just changed the gravity for a

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.389 
right I just changed the gravity for a
specific<00:06:15.699> period<00:06:16.300> of<00:06:16.330> time
