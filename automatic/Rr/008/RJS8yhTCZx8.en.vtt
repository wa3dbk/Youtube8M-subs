some more attacks from this war so as
you<00:03:37.350> can<00:03:37.440> see<00:03:37.590> we<00:03:37.680> got<00:03:37.830> 16<00:03:38.130> one<00:03:38.910> wins<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.810> that

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
you can see we got 16 one wins and that

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.960 
you can see we got 16 one wins and that
clan<00:03:40.650> had<00:03:40.890> 163<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:45.510> now<00:03:45.930> they<00:03:46.110> got<00:03:46.290> 164<00:03:47.100> was<00:03:47.940> a

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
clan had 163 so now they got 164 was a

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.120 
clan had 163 so now they got 164 was a
really<00:03:48.330> tough<00:03:48.540> one<00:03:48.810> they<00:03:48.990> had<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.440> tunnel<00:03:49.890> 10

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
really tough one they had the tunnel 10

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.130 
really tough one they had the tunnel 10
advantage<00:03:50.370> they<00:03:51.000> had<00:03:51.180> two<00:03:51.480> more<00:03:51.750> town<00:03:52.020> hotels

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
advantage they had two more town hotels

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.230 
advantage they had two more town hotels
so<00:03:55.140> two<00:03:55.620> more<00:03:55.830> tunnel<00:03:56.190> tents<00:03:56.430> in<00:03:56.610> such<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:56.880> work

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
so two more tunnel tents in such a work

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.290 
so two more tunnel tents in such a work
it's<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.810> very<00:03:58.740> huge<00:03:59.040> difference<00:03:59.610> they<00:03:59.880> they

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
it's a very huge difference they they

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.650 
it's a very huge difference they they
allow<00:04:00.750> themselves<00:04:00.990> to<00:04:01.350> attack<00:04:02.450> town<00:04:03.450> hall<00:04:03.600> 9

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
allow themselves to attack town hall 9

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.190 
allow themselves to attack town hall 9
suite<00:04:04.110> on<00:04:04.470> all<00:04:04.650> tense<00:04:04.890> so<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:06.690> that<00:04:06.990> was

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
suite on all tense so that that was

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.040 
suite on all tense so that that was
basically<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.830> reason<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.840> we<00:04:09.840> lost

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
basically the reason that we lost

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.800 
basically the reason that we lost
unfortunately<00:04:10.350> but<00:04:11.340> that's<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.300> game<00:04:12.540> that's

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
unfortunately but that's the game that's

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.909 
unfortunately but that's the game that's
the<00:04:13.530> matchups<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:15.320> we'll<00:04:16.320> see<00:04:16.590> each<00:04:16.650> other<00:04:16.770> in

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
the matchups so we'll see each other in

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.800 
the matchups so we'll see each other in
the<00:04:17.040> next<00:04:17.310> video<00:04:17.580> stay<00:04:17.820> tuned<00:04:18.060> for<00:04:18.359> that<00:04:18.390> worry

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
the next video stay tuned for that worry

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.890 
the next video stay tuned for that worry
