00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
as well but you know it's pretty easy to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.180 
as well but you know it's pretty easy to
tell<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.400> difference<00:01:07.670> between<00:01:07.760> them<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:09.190> let

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
tell the difference between them and let

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.440 
tell the difference between them and let
me<00:01:10.310> spit<00:01:10.520> them<00:01:10.640> back<00:01:10.670> real<00:01:10.940> quick

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450
