00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.219
 hello maybach hello what are we 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.089
 will do today 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.890
 then we will make the tunic isadora 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.949
 it's a very easy model it's 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.140
 consisting of a front and turkey so the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.269
 front and back are made up of two 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.230
 different materials 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:30.800
 the bottom of the sleeve and all towards the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.350
 Side seam takes two steps 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.360
 she leaves a floating pan and she is 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.129
 ended down by a slot that is 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.329
 opened 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:44.600
 here we have a plain silk satin and we have 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.820
 printed cotton voile 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.149
 so we chose to put the satin 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.899
 silk in front and that you can choose 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:57.870
 we provide net all the way around the diviner and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.230
 all around the back for this part 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.719
 under the sleeve and the left side 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.590
 floating first made a small 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.220
 hem by turning twice half 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.580
 centimeter 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.170
 same thing for the neckline that we are going 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.020
 prepare by making a little hem of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.990
 twice half a centimeter so for 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.299
 all that we have to build on our model 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.420
 it corresponds to this neck seam 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.200
 and at the side seam here we have so 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.829
 built this couture have built so 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.110
 the neckline and the other side so we 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.540
 ensures if he is everywhere because this 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.820
 fabric is fraying enormously we would have 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.799
 could not overcast the bottom who is going to have 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.020
 a hem and the cuffs 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.490
 who will also have a relay but 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.520
 we preferred on net because 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 it just goes awry when you build 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.020
 we can notch a little bit for that 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.420
 turns because otherwise it's going to piss 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.719
 so we make toddlers very notch 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.390
 close together for pole seams 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.070
 we will make English seams 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.320
 so unlike the usual one we are 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.899
 in law against place we will put 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.789
 wrong side upside down so there for the 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.039
 sleeve we see we did a culture 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.140
 English so it does not fray 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.830
 not inside 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.310
 the frame was topstitched under the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.600
 arm folded to half a centimeter and 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.050
 another half centimeter 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:32.490
 when we did both seam side and 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:34.740
 the neckline we go back so we go back there 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.600
 I left the red frame to son 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.880
 we can see well but otherwise it's better 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.620
 to remove the frame wire before you 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.489
 ironing for the 'dow' sends the bonus 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.830
 is actually the same thing 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.390
 a frame and whoopi stitching to mite 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.370
 present we will sew the poles 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.810
 like the two very fine discussions 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.530
 we chose to make a seam 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.500
 English 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.170
 so instead of putting the tissues 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.330
 place against place we put them in 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.040
 against against Antwerp so it must be well 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.670
 check the voice as those in green and 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.050
 for both tissues 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.739
 so they are good against 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.250
 antwerp I was helped is paint down 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.700
 two sleeves at the neckline in the middle and then 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.640
 then to the distributed pins then 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.370
 at this point, but not bad to pin 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.820
 and we can stitch directly to 0.5 of 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.480
 board either if we are not too sure we 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.579
 builds to 0.5 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.670
 then we'll go back 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.140
 other culture at 0.5 0.6 to have this 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.829
 first culture almost in al 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.110
 English so we built ni and then we 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.060
 piqued our English culture in 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.090
 taking another culture already made to 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.720
 inside so there the two cultures 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.200
 are doing English seam and there is 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.459
 has more than one meal yes it's there 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.489
 begins to take shape 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:04.709
 chicken is from the bottom we already return to 5 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:08.430
 we go back and then we will return 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:11.190
 once again we had gone back to 1.5 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.420
 we went back now we prepare well 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.070
 because it's a moving fabric 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.590
 a lot of satin so you have to 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.620
 really well prepared we put a 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.710
 pin to the edge a pin to another 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.050
 board we pulled a little bit to take 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.680
 a marker in the middle we fixed the 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.410
 first 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.350
 that's the first pin in 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.360
 middle of the garment and then we have 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.699
 spread them out and speak each time in 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.530
 pulling well because otherwise it's godly 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.570
 and it's not going to go into the in the 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.190
 shutter so what we did also we 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.039
 it is that we have stripped a little bit 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.389
 edge to have a nice angle because 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.370
 as the angle is a little bit acute 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.100
 not to risk having a piece 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.870
 of fabric that comes out we've already won a 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.449
 little bit and then we shot two 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.479
 time so we did the same thing for 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.940
 the back in printed veil and now 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.160
 you will do your stitching for 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.520
 to release to sew our relay 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.849
 we'll go down first and then 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.699
 we will continue with a rib in 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.310
 according to the frame we have already done and that 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:17.190
 so we will do it with the green wire 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.500
 dark for the back it will include the wire 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.039
 clear for the front we did both 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.870
 at the relay of the front and the back and so we 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.940
 agrees they are disassociated 1 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.949
 they are floating then of the same 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.220
 way we're going to do the olÃ© debate of 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:31.849
 handle 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.159
 you started to prepare them offered 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:37.860
 by returning once of 1.5 that's it 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:40.260
 yes and then again returning one 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.050
 time by putting the fabric well in the 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.210
 always hollow and there the same way 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.130
 you are going to make a stitch on the edge 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.000
 so when we said we were doing 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:53.550
 first the neckline and after sewing 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.680
 poles and arm it's because 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.409
 as we chose to make a culture 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.300
 English which is a little bit thick 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.610
 could not have entered their 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.949
 little back of neck for the same 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.860
 model in another fabric we could have 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.360
 choose the other solution so salt 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.970
 did our students 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.970
 it remains open of the report one fixes the 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.159
 in front and back together with 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:21.120
 pins by keeping well alongside one 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:22.169
 put the pattern on the fabric there we have the 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.470
 line that must be reproduced 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.210
 so to make this line where we go 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.639
 sew they could determine it 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.620
 we could have done it at the beginning before 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.030
 to have sewn but this trait would 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.860
 left right away because she created 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.080
 his mark not and on these tissues there one 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.530
 can not put neutral felt 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:43.909
 we will position ourselves at 4 of the bar there is a 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:47.759
 centimeter of the side the boss will reopen 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:49.949
 the fabric is here we have our relay 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:52.080
 the value of looney tunes all the 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:54.509
 handle and the guard relay when we have 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.889
 positioned like that we have shoulders a 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:58.800
 little everywhere to fix two 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:00.599
 sides we will return then my memory 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.580
 we had scored our two points we are going 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:02.939
 take them back to the beginning of the line you 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.759
 pose 

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:07.139
 he is full, he raises the paper 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:09.569
 our point scored we will do the same 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:11.400
 for the duo point here now we 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:13.469
 return flat our paper we have 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.289
 fixed therefore taking into account the schedules 

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:16.800
 and then we'll do the trick with the 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:18.810
 roulette 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.940
 here we have been a little while following well 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.750
 our very it's the same for the front 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:29.190
 the back so we have to do it once 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:31.529
 then we will remove the paper so there 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.669
 we have our two pins for the 

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:34.800
 beginning and end 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:36.689
 and then if we get closer we see 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.669
 little roulette wheels so we're going 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:41.219
 strengthen this line that barely 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:43.289
 visible with a chalk reference the 

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:45.060
 Japanese cribs that are thin or 

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:46.650
 more with the satin that might pull 

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.979
 difficult so you have to see a needle 

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.529
 9 

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:53.629
 so here we did this sewing and we 

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:53.629
 report the other side the same
