don't<00:01:05.189> think<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.549> killable<00:01:06.060> though<00:01:06.210> which

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
don't think it's killable though which

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:15.289 
don't think it's killable though which
is<00:01:06.510> kind<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.020> minus<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:09.860> um<00:01:11.210> I<00:01:13.939> guess<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.119> can

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
is kind of minus but um I guess we can

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.999 
is kind of minus but um I guess we can
compare<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.110> another<00:01:16.380> cut<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.369> um<00:01:17.759> I

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
compare it to another cut like that um I

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:30.800 
compare it to another cut like that um I
know<00:01:22.970> MA<00:01:24.710> George<00:01:26.240> okay<00:01:27.240> fine<00:01:27.479> month<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:30.210> so

know MA George okay fine month and so
yeah<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:32.479> think<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:34.110> quite<00:01:34.259> nice<00:01:34.530> actually<00:01:34.829> it
