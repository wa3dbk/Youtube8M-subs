 Preciamente that each one make a short film that they wrote 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.359
 that was mine two or three but four first 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.470
 and lately we have managed to get and more 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.490
 the idea is that the other five that are missing can not finish 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.650
 i came out in prose 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.160
 the idea the headquarters for robbery in half an hour 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.150
 per hundred after the workshop they did not give several techniques about things that 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.300
 we could use on the non-film techniques 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.530
 and in the end that what came out 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.460

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.340
 susan meyer snow bound in the frame 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.770
 dd this story the waning quarter fontana the plot 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.060
 because this alliance because it is in asia 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.890
 how to immerse yourself in the mind of a boyfriend for my son 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.830
 the town knows what it does for love 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.280
 we are capable of any amount of madness either doing it or thinking the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.580
 then to me I think about vitoria as it had to be a story 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.990
 short make a short story near a boyfriend 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.259
 what has so many feelings mixed either by resentment for paranoia 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.690
 being with his girlfriend noticing with his girlfriend 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.040
 At the moment we have not felt mixed with the ce of the 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.300
 feeling of what it is 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.590
 the real 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.549
 it seems dream 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.160
 and today that the year seems real 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
 Ricardo Noir where you love this love for cinema 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.290
 without it, love for the cinema 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.680
 from small I like the movies of profit that of quito if it grants a 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.150
 Someone's camera the claw turned to monitoring chiquititas 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.170
 but the love of the southern cinema that definitely of this workshop in part 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.380
 that he did van zyl association and charges of cinematography and the embassy spain 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.369
 there was that I was woken up because I started to know techniques I started to 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.310
 know 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.890
 of what can be done 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.030
 it's not like you and a good movie is made but they tell you how 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.640
 a film is made as you can record it as you can affirm that you have 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.190
 what to do how to direct the actors 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.719
 that means early 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.930
 which means that the person lives something that in a closed plane that 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.229
 means that I give an open plan the meaning to the camera movements 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:17.459
 all that 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.249
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.399
 wake up entity percent 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.449
 It's as simple as looking to make music and not know how to play an instrument and 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:25.079
 suddenly teaches you to play guitar 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.289
 I already the claw and 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.189
 for pure river for whatever it is for love to start to take songs 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.539
 and like now the cinema the position that has now 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.539
 the cinema and nicaragua how much valuation 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.340
 it's hard to look 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.420
 because although it is true there is no cinematographic between italy and china 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.429
 we need to always pray everywhere or in Nicaragua 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:49.449
 In Nicaragua, therefore, you need, but sincerely, the invitation to 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.349
 Nicaraguans much better than the one that had other countries 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.930
 what it is that if you need power 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.720
 cinecita a lot of support there are no state funds so there are no talents and 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.780
 recharge a lot 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.390
 the talent and especially talent of people who do not know they have the 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.620
 talent but when you put them to work in something cinema it behaves like 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.759
 this 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:08.559
 the country people who for example like photography 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:12.439
 but not necessarily engaged only put a short film of these and 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.409
 start to wake up from the photographer inside you start over there 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.239
 pp lights is to talk about colors 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.019
 ii feel there may be a lot of people with an enthusiasm that 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.069
 there is definitely no space can and space has not allowed the 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.289
 people will be developed by how 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:26.229
 like every 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.109
 future project 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.699
 personal or 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:35.859
 the order elections in general celarg made history since they do not lack box 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.419
 is stopping the person behind 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.439
 foto efe in the cinema sas what are your projects 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:42.340
 while 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.479
 I want to me I would like to study cinema 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:48.519
 I'm seeing at what moment you can do that because Nicaragua does not exist 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:49.929
 schools and the cinema 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:53.189
 then taking where can you create without at what time 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.399
 and keep recording the importance of all this will remain short and ibiza 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:04:00.119
 but short or long European musical ear be anything that will have 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:01.849
 show with image and sound 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.299
 doing that was what I want to do right now I'm working on the 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.039
 short film rené white in others 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.999
 that your boy that you interviewed here two weeks ago 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:10.099
 i 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.680
 to the thread of this issue avoiding 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.959
 because I'm also a publisher 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.909
 I like that was then I like to get into the work of other friends 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:20.209
 support them with eternal popular what jesus salazar 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.640
 then this one 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.849
 I love going out 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.189
 I love being kinetic is it flew time with many iniesta colleagues 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:30.719
 Nicaraguan is incoherent despite the fact that for now it is approved, he remembers 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:31.699
 I wish you soon 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.680
 you'll see a lot of source fought an excellent sound a lot come down to the mayor's office 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.360
 I do not know if he can not help with the sound 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.650
 and they also lent or kind and fought with all the enthusiasm the world of love 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.120
 to the cinema if threshold 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.560
 if I have the time then I have the possibility amoled valered and suddenly there is 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.590
 other friends the photographer the actors also suddenly lend themselves to that 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.080
 kind of things and we like it because we had a great time you can not imagine 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.069
 the feeling so pleasant denver the story develop in front of all 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.020
 aerial 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.830
 in matching 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.849
 and unparalleled set to me what really wakes me up maps treats 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.710
 of caracas we can not ignore is that the quarter musical waning zulia 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.729
 the only song c 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.759
 the song is called waning quarter casually 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.960
 i did describe to the salt version at the beginning the short 'champion 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.159
 comment 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.999
 and the end of the version that was made of a partner called 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:20.240
 eighth month because he already did it with a fix 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.050
 quite more complex than raul martín then it occurs to me that the 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.270
 Contribute the prison pending breastfeeding or participating in a prize in 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.460
 gravel cash sings 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.830
 in 2006 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.729
 in 2007 at the beginning of 2007 he won the first place 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.419
 it's a very humble song 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.139
 but also very very deep emotional process could be 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.789
 say that the person is porq does not export pulse 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.819
 but anyone who listened to him could think that someone made him cut himself 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:44.419
 points 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.939
 ricardo message that you will want to walk halo
