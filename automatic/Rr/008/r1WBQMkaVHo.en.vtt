October<00:00:27.390> 13th<00:00:27.900> yeah<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.710> moon<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.099> Aquarius

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
October 13th yeah that moon in Aquarius

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.260 
October 13th yeah that moon in Aquarius
really<00:00:30.029> does<00:00:30.380> encourage<00:00:31.380> us<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.820> something

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
really does encourage us to do something

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.540 
really does encourage us to do something
out<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.870> box<00:00:33.899> but<00:00:34.649> sometimes<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.370> get

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
out of the box but sometimes we get

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.610 
out of the box but sometimes we get
mixed<00:00:35.940> up<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.270> think<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.660> Aquarius<00:00:37.260> as<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
mixed up we think of Aquarius as the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.010 
mixed up we think of Aquarius as the
sign<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.489> which<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.760> unpredictable<00:00:39.540> and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
sign of that which is unpredictable and

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.590 
sign of that which is unpredictable and
futuristic<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.520> fixed<00:00:41.940> sign<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
futuristic but it's a fixed sign and I

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.799 
futuristic but it's a fixed sign and I
think<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.140> get<00:00:43.379> locked<00:00:43.800> into<00:00:44.809> into

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
think we can get locked into into

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.200 
think we can get locked into into
immobility<00:00:46.200> or<00:00:46.800> into<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.280> not<00:00:47.460> expressing

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
immobility or into it not expressing

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.389 
immobility or into it not expressing
ourselves<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:49.050> certainly<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.680> case<00:00:50.039> today

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
ourselves that's certainly a case today

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.569 
ourselves that's certainly a case today
as<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.030> moon<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.719> Aquarius<00:00:52.620> forms<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.190> square<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
as the moon in Aquarius forms a square a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.470 
as the moon in Aquarius forms a square a
tense<00:00:54.000> right<00:00:54.270> angle<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.199> verbal<00:00:55.620> mercury<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
tense right angle to verbal mercury and

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.240 
tense right angle to verbal mercury and
restrictive<00:00:57.480> Saturn<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.260> while<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.739> can

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
restrictive Saturn and while that can

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.020 
restrictive Saturn and while that can
block<00:00:59.870> communications<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.379> also<00:01:02.030> punishes

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
block communications it also punishes

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.420 
block communications it also punishes
those<00:01:03.239> who<00:01:03.300> produces<00:01:04.049> rapid<00:01:04.530> consequences

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
those who produces rapid consequences

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.600 
those who produces rapid consequences
for<00:01:05.880> speaking<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:07.049> cautiously<00:01:07.950> right<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> i

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
for speaking on cautiously right and i

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
for speaking on cautiously right and i
think<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> rapid<00:01:09.270> consequences<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
think the rapid consequences is what the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.469 
think the rapid consequences is what the
important<00:01:11.220> thing<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.670> i<00:01:11.880> mean<00:01:12.030> look

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
important thing here is i mean look

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.750 
important thing here is i mean look
Saturn<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.110> Mercury<00:01:13.229> are<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.979> Scorpio<00:01:14.460> that's

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
Saturn and Mercury are in Scorpio that's

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.270 
Saturn and Mercury are in Scorpio that's
a<00:01:14.880> fixed<00:01:15.180> sign<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.960> moon<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.350> Aquarius<00:01:16.950> that's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
a fixed sign the moon in Aquarius that's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.399 
a fixed sign the moon in Aquarius that's
a<00:01:17.460> fixed<00:01:17.759> sign<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.240> neither<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.259> is

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
a fixed sign and neither one of them is

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.440 
a fixed sign and neither one of them is
going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> give<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.220> even<00:01:20.909> though<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> moon

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
going to give and even though the moon

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.780 
going to give and even though the moon
is<00:01:21.720> close<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.350> home<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.890> our<00:01:23.040> body<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.610> how

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
is close to home it's our body it's how

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.350 
is close to home it's our body it's how
it's<00:01:24.210> how<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.450> feel<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.200> how<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.380> respond<00:01:26.360> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
it's how we feel it's how we respond it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.870 
it's how we feel it's how we respond it
doesn't<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.140> can't<00:01:28.439> hold<00:01:28.710> its<00:01:29.070> power<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
doesn't it can't hold its power that

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.480 
doesn't it can't hold its power that
can't<00:01:30.420> hold<00:01:30.659> its<00:01:30.900> position<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.920> Saturn<00:01:32.310> and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
can't hold its position to Saturn and

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.550 
can't hold its position to Saturn and
Mercury<00:01:32.610> they<00:01:33.090> outlasted<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> think

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
Mercury they outlasted and so I think

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.039 
Mercury they outlasted and so I think
ultimately<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.509> careful<00:01:36.720> about

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
ultimately we have to be careful about

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.569 
ultimately we have to be careful about
what<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.210> express<00:01:39.210> about<00:01:40.049> our<00:01:40.259> feelings

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
what we express about our feelings

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.219 
what we express about our feelings
because<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:41.790> we<00:01:42.060> overexpress<00:01:42.869> or<00:01:43.079> say

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
because if we overexpress or say

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.410 
because if we overexpress or say
something<00:01:43.290> wrong<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.220> think<00:01:44.850> reality<00:01:45.030> will

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
something wrong I think reality will

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.810 
something wrong I think reality will
come<00:01:45.659> down<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.020> us<00:01:46.049> pretty<00:01:46.350> quickly<00:01:46.680> yet<00:01:47.610> on

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
come down on us pretty quickly yet on

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.090 
come down on us pretty quickly yet on
another<00:01:48.360> level<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.259> Aquarius<00:01:49.770> moon

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
another level of that Aquarius moon

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.319 
another level of that Aquarius moon
stimulates<00:01:50.820> some<00:01:51.380> originality<00:01:53.329> investing

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
stimulates some originality investing

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.719 
stimulates some originality investing
the<00:01:54.659> time<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:55.740> effort<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.670> the

concentration to fill in the details

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.990
