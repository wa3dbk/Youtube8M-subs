stated as five percent comparing our arm

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.190

so<00:02:32.250> we<00:02:32.370> see<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.550> 17<00:02:33.120> point<00:02:33.390> 0<00:02:33.510> 2<00:02:33.570> percent<00:02:34.110> is

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
so we see that 17 point 0 2 percent is

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.900 
so we see that 17 point 0 2 percent is
more<00:02:34.380> than<00:02:34.500> five<00:02:34.740> percent<00:02:35.070> so<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:35.850> not

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
more than five percent so it's not

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.240 
more than five percent so it's not
