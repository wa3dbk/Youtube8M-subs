comes with it so huge props the studio
for<00:01:29.649> that<00:01:30.299> then<00:01:31.299> this<00:01:31.539> you<00:01:32.289> can<00:01:32.409> see<00:01:32.560> the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
for that then this you can see the

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.499 
for that then this you can see the
connector<00:01:33.189> right<00:01:33.280> here<00:01:33.340> you<00:01:33.579> go<00:01:33.820> down<00:01:34.060> in<00:01:34.240> here

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
connector right here you go down in here

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.749 
connector right here you go down in here
looks<00:01:34.869> like<00:01:35.020> this<00:01:35.229> part<00:01:35.680> goes<00:01:35.829> in<00:01:36.009> first<00:01:36.219> and

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
looks like this part goes in first and

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.319 
looks like this part goes in first and
then<00:01:37.030> it<00:01:37.149> pops<00:01:37.329> down<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.850> actually<00:01:39.939> in<00:01:40.210> there

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
then it pops down it's actually in there

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.630 
then it pops down it's actually in there
pretty<00:01:40.420> good<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.869> then<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.109> pull<00:01:44.289> it<00:01:44.380> out

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
pretty good and then the pull it out

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.300 
pretty good and then the pull it out
just<00:01:45.929> push<00:01:46.929> that<00:01:47.109> forward<00:01:48.840> put<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:49.929> back<00:01:50.049> in

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
just push that forward put it back in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.060 
just push that forward put it back in
and<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:52.630> so<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.049> can<00:01:53.200> take<00:01:53.409> this<00:01:53.590> out<00:01:53.829> and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
and that so you can take this out and

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.889 
and that so you can take this out and
put<00:01:54.159> a<00:01:54.429> different<00:01:54.640> one<00:01:54.939> in<00:01:55.119> that<00:01:55.539> will<00:01:55.659> charge

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
put a different one in that will charge

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.389 
put a different one in that will charge
a<00:01:55.990> different<00:01:56.289> type<00:01:56.439> of<00:01:56.469> battery<00:01:56.740> this<00:01:57.100> one<00:01:57.280> is

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
a different type of battery this one is

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.940 
a different type of battery this one is
specifically<00:01:57.969> designed<00:01:58.090> for<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:58.689> LTE<00:01:59.170> Galaxy

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
specifically designed for the LTE Galaxy

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.849 
specifically designed for the LTE Galaxy
Nexus<00:02:00.329> speaking<00:02:01.329> of<00:02:01.450> LTE<00:02:01.780> I<00:02:02.140> actually<00:02:02.380> got

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
Nexus speaking of LTE I actually got

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.669 
Nexus speaking of LTE I actually got
thirty<00:02:03.310> three<00:02:03.640> megabytes<00:02:03.939> down<00:02:04.539> and<00:02:04.899> ten<00:02:05.409> up

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
thirty three megabytes down and ten up

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.550 
thirty three megabytes down and ten up
on<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.460> sprint<00:02:06.759> galaxy<00:02:06.969> SL<00:02:07.359> to<00:02:07.840> eat<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.259> very

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
on the sprint galaxy SL to eat and very

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.130 
on the sprint galaxy SL to eat and very
soon<00:02:08.830> I<00:02:09.039> will<00:02:09.100> do<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.399> video<00:02:09.580> comparing<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.539> LTE

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
soon I will do a video comparing the LTE

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.880 
soon I will do a video comparing the LTE
speeds<00:02:11.740> of<00:02:12.100> both<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.910> Galaxy<00:02:13.510> Nexus<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:14.200> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
speeds of both the Galaxy Nexus and the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.370 
speeds of both the Galaxy Nexus and the
evo<00:02:15.190> 4g<00:02:15.430> LTE<00:02:15.760> in<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.300> same<00:02:16.480> video<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:17.200> see

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
evo 4g LTE in the same video to see

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.500 
evo 4g LTE in the same video to see
which<00:02:17.590> one<00:02:17.620> picks<00:02:18.220> up<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.460> LTE<00:02:18.760> better<00:02:19.180> and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
which one picks up the LTE better and

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.110 
which one picks up the LTE better and
