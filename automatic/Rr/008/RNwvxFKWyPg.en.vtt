00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
probably think oh this isn't really much

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.649 
probably think oh this isn't really much
of<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.280> big<00:01:14.490> deal<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> take<00:01:15.479> into

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
of a big deal we have to take into

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.539

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
consideration that the graphics are

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.859 
consideration that the graphics are
going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.820> much<00:01:18.090> worse<00:01:18.390> than<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> old

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869

see<00:01:32.880> no<00:01:33.119> recall<00:01:33.600> whatsoever<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.409> ball<00:01:34.650> 27

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
see no recall whatsoever on the ball 27

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.160 
see no recall whatsoever on the ball 27
and<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> next<00:01:36.270> generation<00:01:36.689> consoles<00:01:37.049> we

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
and on the next generation consoles we

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.310 
and on the next generation consoles we
see<00:01:37.460> quite<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.520> bit<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.820> recall<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> bow<00:01:39.720> 27

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
see quite a bit of recall on the bow 27

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.319 
see quite a bit of recall on the bow 27
itself<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:41.130> course<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.549> reason<00:01:41.729> behind<00:01:42.000> this

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
itself of course the reason behind this

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.210 
itself of course the reason behind this
is<00:01:42.390> because<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.590> game<00:01:43.740> was<00:01:43.770> actually

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
is because the game was actually

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.550 
is because the game was actually
produced<00:01:44.579> from<00:01:45.090> Activision<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> Xbox<00:01:46.380> one

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
produced from Activision on the Xbox one

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.710 
produced from Activision on the Xbox one
and<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.130> PlayStation<00:01:47.670> 4<00:01:47.880> along<00:01:48.119> with<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> PC

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
and the PlayStation 4 along with a PC

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.109 
and the PlayStation 4 along with a PC
but<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> older<00:01:49.950> generation<00:01:50.520> consoles<00:01:50.939> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
but on the older generation consoles it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.969 
but on the older generation consoles it
was<00:01:51.270> actually<00:01:51.600> published<00:01:51.780> by<00:01:52.710> moonlight

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
was actually published by moonlight

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.260 
was actually published by moonlight

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
studio so they're the people who

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.149 
studio so they're the people who
actually<00:01:54.540> allow<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.960> guys<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.290> play<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
older generation closer without them I

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.870 
older generation closer without them I
don't<00:01:58.439> think<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:58.770> would<00:01:58.829> have<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.100> advanced

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
don't think we would have a advanced

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.609 
don't think we would have a advanced
warfare<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> old<00:02:00.659> generation<00:02:00.960> consoles

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
warfare on the old generation consoles

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.020 
warfare on the old generation consoles
but<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.219> did<00:02:02.430> say<00:02:02.579> we're<00:02:02.729> going<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.909> have

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
but like you did say we're going to have

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.429 
but like you did say we're going to have
limitations<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.899> old<00:02:04.110> generation

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
limitations on the old generation

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.440 
limitations on the old generation
consoles<00:02:04.979> it's<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.549> really<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.820> problem<00:02:06.060> for

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
consoles it's not really a problem for

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.880 
consoles it's not really a problem for
me<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.719> maybe<00:02:07.049> for<00:02:07.170> some<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.680> guys<00:02:07.829> you

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
me but maybe for some of you guys you

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.770 
me but maybe for some of you guys you
can't<00:02:08.250> really<00:02:08.399> afford<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.759> upgrade<00:02:08.940> yet<00:02:09.390> but

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
