 Just the rage of the guys but I did not meet one 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.440
 a lot of people and who intends to 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.880
 never beat trombone ever beat 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.260

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.959
 that sticker even knows the boss 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.239
 even then you start with green belt 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.239
 blue face serro that hit 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.300

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.670
 of a protocol such as silva and rafael 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.250
 Too complicated to walk with sticker 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.810
 choice or only two non 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.610

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.430
 balance truck will receive the 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.069
 caring sticker set up a truck that 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.319
 got into the truck the driver said that 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.050
 It seems that what to say so to see 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.769
 that you end up being so never hit 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.290
 Standing there you pick up the green and hit 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.170
 something hits the other beat 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.320
 alone and already goes through 11 azzurra is a 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.170
 the most qualified car a little to this 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.049
 ends up getting in the truck a couple of three 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.690
 already passes a higher level takes a sticker 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.269
 red 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.500
 I do not know, sorry, I think the card 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.209
 taking my face I do not think so 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.209
 has nothing to do even because the 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.680
 important there to do that then it is me 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.959
 criticize saying that I'm doing 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.420
 sucking field on my butt composing the 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.980
 fucking or fucking is not like that 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.680
 catch me 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.570
 from there to get on the sticker even though 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.630
 800 units landing clays having Milton 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:13.239
 45 truck from there you pick up there and cbn 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:16.419
 origin of al is what to talk but it is is very 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:20.919
 It's very complicated, you have to get in. 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.599
 in the queue to make the protocol here is equal to 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.680
 a kind your book the operators if of a 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.020
 protocol 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.370
 There you go, they'll give you a sticker. 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.580
 simple 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:35.139
 a priest if you really have notion of 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.389
 thing that means to be a dbm 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.810
 hence no deviation old is the basics 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.669
 simple little blue whale there if it evolves 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.229
 How are you doing? 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.130
 truck had a more performance 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:51.370
 set red black until you reach the 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:56.050
 warming sticker the most qualified of 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.660
 everyone who only plays at night and is not 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.630
 It was not in these boys that she spoke 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.270
 is putting at the head of the people 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.889
 thing and after that problem but I think 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.020
 I'm not going anymore because it's very 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.400
 complicated have to go in there not 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.630
 reservation 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.400
 there in the araraquara and make a file 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.210
 fill out a registration for the guy going 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.250
 do the adhesive protocol do not avoid us 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.199
 your background is so good to have 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.150
 something is going on so you give a 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.970
 simple sticker ne 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.470
 there you take the blue whiting was great 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.720
 character only passing by red band 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.270
 black strip until you take the deviation 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.120
 qualified then was what to explain me 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.039
 whats a deal stickers 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.169
 You're not the band I thought it was. 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:48.729
 a band with this is a group a group 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:51.220
 Taking truck then is that sc 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.010
 works by cornell still looks at whether 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.240
 it's picking up is equal to the character's range 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.010
 red band 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.750
 As you go upstairs 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.590
 You'll get the most stickers. 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.280
 qualified 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:07.050
 then when it is already well Ninjago - 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.190
 cervical ninja even say it is 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.289
 rupturing the mouth once as it is of the 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.500
 people's units will not have a 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.810
 unit and have to maintain the standard it 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:23.620
 It has to be the same if not you already 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:26.410
 ripped off stickers and already one understands 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:30.820
 This business is very bureaucratic. 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:37.930
 I think I should leave and nothing at all to fall. 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:39.670
 in the same very complicated person thing 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.570
 for what we want 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:45.830
 it's kind of a lot of print so yeah 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:49.300
 trying to get into these groups yes but 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:53.660
 it's not very easy it's very closed thing 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.790
 and Sabina ep galley band only 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.040
 municia me information because staff 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.150
 happening in the comments of the videos in 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.400
 internet and talk that is more or less 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.200
 that's how it works 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:10.460
 I think it's a bit the car jungle 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:12.830
 stickers that one day suddenly gave a 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.680
 crazy and get a sticker and already 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:24.070
 I even got a red black 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:27.500
 with a unit but what is what 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:30.560
 What qualifies what turned heads? 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.860
 forward not the good hour since in the 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.860
 century
