helmet fights the fight suit helmet and

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.260 
helmet fights the fight suit helmet and
it<00:01:23.009> looks<00:01:23.159> pretty<00:01:23.340> cool<00:01:23.549> especially<00:01:23.909> with

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it looks pretty cool especially with

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.789

those<00:01:24.420> yellow<00:01:24.780> eyes<00:01:24.810> sticking<00:01:25.350> out<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.740> I

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
those yellow eyes sticking out and I

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.219 
those yellow eyes sticking out and I
think<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.880> pretty<00:01:27.060> funny<00:01:27.390> overall<00:01:27.900> I'm

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
think it's just pretty funny overall I'm

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.109 
think it's just pretty funny overall I'm
gonna<00:01:28.439> go<00:01:28.590> ahead<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.070> back<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.790> wear<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
gonna go ahead and go back in and wear a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.609 
gonna go ahead and go back in and wear a
different<00:01:30.420> mask<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> purple<00:01:31.470> one

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
different mask it's like a purple one

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.140 
different mask it's like a purple one
and<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.369> thought<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.790> looked<00:01:32.939> pretty

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and I thought that one looked pretty
