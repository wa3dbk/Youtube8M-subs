00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.710 
an opinion on this player we're not
going<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:51.150> have<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.390> move<00:01:51.509> on

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
going there we think we have to move on

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.260 
going there we think we have to move on
but<00:01:52.049> there<00:01:52.830> was<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> feeling<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.520> maybe<00:01:54.060> he

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
but there was a feeling that maybe he

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.149 
but there was a feeling that maybe he
did<00:01:54.450> want<00:01:54.600> boss<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.290> maybe<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.040> were

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
did want boss and maybe you were

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.770 
did want boss and maybe you were
surprised<00:01:56.580> when<00:01:57.000> he<00:01:57.060> went<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.450> Raiders

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
surprised when he went to the Raiders

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.690 
surprised when he went to the Raiders
all<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.110> did<00:01:58.320> want<00:01:58.530> Smith<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.159> G<00:01:59.369> was<00:01:59.549> he

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
all you did want Smith and G was he

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.420 
all you did want Smith and G was he
coming<00:01:59.970> back<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.960> was<00:02:01.170> he<00:02:01.320> did<00:02:01.890> get<00:02:02.130> maybe

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
coming back and was he did get maybe

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.270 
coming back and was he did get maybe
miss<00:02:02.850> Reed<00:02:03.210> Smith's<00:02:03.659> intentions<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.650> there

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
miss Reed Smith's intentions and there

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.539 
miss Reed Smith's intentions and there
was<00:02:05.520> maybe<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.450> lack<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.189> decisiveness<00:02:08.189> on

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
was maybe a lack of decisiveness on

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.639 
was maybe a lack of decisiveness on
these<00:02:08.939> particular<00:02:09.239> players<00:02:10.049> was<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.530> the

these particular players was that the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.620

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
case that's not the case at all the case

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.870 
case that's not the case at all the case
is<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:12.959> we<00:02:13.890> know<00:02:14.010> our<00:02:14.160> players<00:02:14.400> better<00:02:14.670> than
