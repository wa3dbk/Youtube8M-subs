00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
one of the best VP of squads I've ever

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.260 
one of the best VP of squads I've ever
seen<00:00:34.860> actually<00:00:35.809> surely<00:00:37.040> storage<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.760> read<00:00:38.969> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
seen actually surely storage to read and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.470 
seen actually surely storage to read and
I<00:00:39.390> think<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.780> classic<00:00:40.469> defense<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:41.480> Mangala

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
I think a classic defense with Mangala

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.630 
I think a classic defense with Mangala

Hadji<00:04:33.520> doesn't<00:04:33.940> have<00:04:34.030> this<00:04:34.150> place<00:04:34.390> to<00:04:34.540> finish

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
Hadji doesn't have this place to finish

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.430 
Hadji doesn't have this place to finish
but<00:04:35.110> he<00:04:35.350> passes<00:04:35.950> for<00:04:36.280> theory<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:37.030> it's<00:04:37.570> 3-0<00:04:38.260> as

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
but he passes for theory and it's 3-0 as

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.730 
but he passes for theory and it's 3-0 as
I<00:04:38.560> said<00:04:38.830> all<00:04:39.400> it<00:04:39.670> took<00:04:39.940> was<00:04:40.240> one<00:04:40.630> for<00:04:41.230> school<00:04:41.500> in

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
I said all it took was one for school in

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.340 
I said all it took was one for school in
order<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:42.460> open<00:04:43.060> my<00:04:43.300> opponents<00:04:43.810> defense<00:04:44.140> in

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
order to open my opponents defense in

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.030 
order to open my opponents defense in
this<00:04:44.500> game<00:04:44.590> now<00:04:45.280> Hadji<00:04:46.060> on<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.840> skill<00:04:47.380> moves

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
this game now Hadji on the skill moves

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.610 
this game now Hadji on the skill moves
free<00:04:48.400> just<00:04:48.670> look<00:04:48.940> at<00:04:49.090> that<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:49.930> stop<00:04:50.230> and<00:04:50.440> turn

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
free just look at that the stop and turn

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.180 
free just look at that the stop and turn
we<00:04:50.920> go<00:04:51.160> with<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.670> roulette<00:04:52.030> now<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.920> I<00:04:53.920> think

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
we go with the roulette now and I think

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.460 
we go with the roulette now and I think
maybe<00:04:54.850> it<00:04:55.090> was<00:04:55.300> a<00:04:55.360> penalty<00:04:55.750> over<00:04:56.200> there

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
maybe it was a penalty over there

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.090 
maybe it was a penalty over there
because<00:04:56.890> usually<00:04:57.160> Hadji<00:04:57.820> doesn't<00:04:58.510> do<00:04:58.720> those

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
because usually Hadji doesn't do those

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.700 
because usually Hadji doesn't do those
slide<00:05:00.100> shots<00:05:00.700> but<00:05:01.690> there<00:05:01.900> we<00:05:02.020> go<00:05:02.170> again<00:05:02.320> Hadji

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
slide shots but there we go again Hadji

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.800 
slide shots but there we go again Hadji
with<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.160> roulette<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.580> heel<00:05:04.030> to<00:05:04.210> heel<00:05:04.240> flick

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
with the roulette the heel to heel flick

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.680 
with the roulette the heel to heel flick
and<00:05:05.140> the<00:05:05.530> fourth<00:05:05.890> goal<00:05:06.220> of<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.820> game<00:05:07.000> he's

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
and the fourth goal of the game he's

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.080 
and the fourth goal of the game he's
third<00:05:08.110> in<00:05:08.650> the<00:05:08.860> game<00:05:09.040> which<00:05:09.280> means<00:05:09.310> that<00:05:09.820> we

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
third in the game which means that we

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.900 
third in the game which means that we
are<00:05:10.330> going<00:05:10.630> to<00:05:10.810> open<00:05:11.380> two<00:05:11.560> bonus<00:05:12.010> packs<00:05:12.280> one

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
are going to open two bonus packs one

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.330 
are going to open two bonus packs one
because<00:05:13.240> we've<00:05:13.900> got<00:05:14.290> more<00:05:14.320> than<00:05:14.770> three<00:05:15.010> goals

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
because we've got more than three goals

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.750 
because we've got more than three goals
scored<00:05:16.270> in<00:05:16.810> this<00:05:17.020> game<00:05:17.350> and<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:18.130> other<00:05:18.220> one<00:05:18.520> is

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
scored in this game and the other one is

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.850 
scored in this game and the other one is
because<00:05:19.180> Hadji<00:05:19.690> scored<00:05:20.050> three<00:05:20.350> of<00:05:20.470> them<00:05:20.620> now

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
because Hadji scored three of them now

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.790 
because Hadji scored three of them now
look<00:05:21.280> at<00:05:21.490> that<00:05:21.760> head<00:05:22.630> over<00:05:22.840> there<00:05:23.230> maybe<00:05:23.470> we

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
look at that head over there maybe we

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.590 
look at that head over there maybe we
could<00:05:23.980> have<00:05:24.070> managed<00:05:24.490> to<00:05:24.580> score<00:05:25.210> five<00:05:25.570> goals

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
could have managed to score five goals

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.860 
could have managed to score five goals
but<00:05:26.200> still<00:05:26.920> winning<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.550> game<00:05:27.760> with<00:05:28.120> four<00:05:28.510> zero

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
but still winning a game with four zero

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.890 
but still winning a game with four zero
