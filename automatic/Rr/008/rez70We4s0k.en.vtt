00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
for my rifle and you can see for 15.2

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.240 
for my rifle and you can see for 15.2
and<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:27.900> see<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:28.320> difference<00:05:29.360> just<00:05:30.360> away

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
and you see the difference just away

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.510 
and you see the difference just away
1/10<00:05:32.250> of<00:05:32.400> a<00:05:32.520> grain<00:05:32.790> from<00:05:33.120> each<00:05:33.270> other<00:05:33.480> so<00:05:34.520> with

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
1/10 of a grain from each other so with

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.380 
1/10 of a grain from each other so with
this<00:05:35.790> it<00:05:36.150> should<00:05:36.419> be<00:05:37.190> on<00:05:38.190> paper<00:05:38.430> consistently

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
this it should be on paper consistently

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.659 
this it should be on paper consistently
close<00:05:40.290> together<00:05:40.650> if<00:05:40.830> I'm<00:05:41.010> holding<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.520> rifle

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
close together if I'm holding the rifle

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.870 
close together if I'm holding the rifle
correctly<00:05:42.270> and<00:05:42.510> my<00:05:43.440> breathing<00:05:44.340> in<00:05:44.550> and

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
correctly and my breathing in and

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.159 
correctly and my breathing in and
trigger<00:05:45.660> control<00:05:46.340> these<00:05:47.340> should<00:05:47.820> you<00:05:48.180> know<00:05:48.330> be

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
trigger control these should you know be

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.600 
trigger control these should you know be
real<00:05:49.350> close<00:05:49.530> to<00:05:49.740> each<00:05:49.830> other<00:05:50.330> and<00:05:52.610> hopefully

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
real close to each other and hopefully

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.790
