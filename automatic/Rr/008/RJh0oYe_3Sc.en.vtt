actually ever saw on the Amiga and my

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.730 
actually ever saw on the Amiga and my
first<00:01:24.590> impressions<00:01:25.160> what<00:01:25.400> was<00:01:25.790> this<00:01:25.970> rubbish

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
first impressions what was this rubbish

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.010 
first impressions what was this rubbish
I<00:01:28.540> had<00:01:29.540> expected<00:01:29.930> graphically<00:01:32.020> something

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
I had expected graphically something

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.550 
I had expected graphically something
different<00:01:35.470> but<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:38.750> grows<00:01:39.050> on<00:01:39.080> you

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
different but it grows on you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.310 
different but it grows on you
well<00:01:40.040> it<00:01:40.160> grew<00:01:40.340> on<00:01:40.370> me<00:01:40.640> anyway

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:02:01.280 

though<00:01:48.320> I've<00:01:48.530> never<00:01:48.710> been<00:01:48.979> good<00:01:49.159> at<00:01:49.220> it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.770 

probably<00:02:02.160> I<00:02:02.190> think<00:02:02.310> because<00:02:02.760> I<00:02:02.850> never<00:02:02.910> oh<00:02:03.360> god

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
probably I think because I never oh god

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.540 
probably I think because I never oh god
I<00:02:03.960> never<00:02:04.050> actually<00:02:04.350> spent<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.980> much<00:02:05.160> time<00:02:05.400> on

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550
