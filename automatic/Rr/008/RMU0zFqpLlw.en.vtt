00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.130
 the picture quality 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:21.610
 Canon uses the ixus 135 as well 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.619
 at the ixus 140 to a 1/2 3 inches 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.490
 big ccd sensor with a resolution 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:30.419
 from 15 to 9 megapixel this sensitivity 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.500
 can be between iso 100 to iso 1600 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.510
 adjusted according to the needs 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.850
 will be stored in the pictures 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.310
 jpeg format at iso 100 is the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.160
 the camera image quality acceptable in 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.750
 iso 200 retains the detail 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.629
 also acceptable but one 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.010
 downtrend can be seen 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.270
 at least at iso 400 is the 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.870
 Image noises then no longer 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.730
 overlook 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.379
 More and more details are going through the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.500
 robber knight smoothed the picture quality 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.320
 not much of a shot with iso 800 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.590
 or iso 1600 are then only strong 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.780
 restricted or no longer usable 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.930
 At night is at the canon 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.180
 ixus 135 a similar picture recognizable 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.090
 also here destroyed noise filter 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.940
 higher iso values ​​many details only 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.890
 with iso 100 or 200 pictures taken 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.869
 should be used because here is the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.520
 image quality while not on a good 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.550
 but still on an acceptable 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.740
 Level moves above it affect the pictures 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.010
 very mushy which is why an iso value of 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.750
 over 400 should be better avoided 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.450
 for an entry-level camera which is a 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.250
 acceptable result compared to 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.479
 predecessor could be the picture quality but 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.479
 even better 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.479
 an interactive comparison of here 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.290
 you can find the picture sections shown here 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.850
 the camera point de 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.409
 This further away 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.509
 now you have the possibility the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.290
 shown image sections interactively too 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.330
 to compare 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.430
 here you can compare the cameras 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.259
 specify if available an objective 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.150
 choose and the pictures in different 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.460
 compare situations 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.590
 These include the daylight conditions 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.050
 night or lightning the image format jpeg 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.520
 or if available as well as the iso 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.380
 sensitivity 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.270
 in addition to different camera models 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.590
 You can also do a certain 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.569
 model with different 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.340
 compare settings 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.969
 In this example we show the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.969
 Cutouts of a camera at iso 800 iso 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.969
 6400 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.620
 in the second comparison we present the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.620
 Recordings by day and night
