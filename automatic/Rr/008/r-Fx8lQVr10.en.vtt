00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
comparison test I've got another YouTube

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.370 
comparison test I've got another YouTube
video<00:00:05.819> up<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:07.189> TaylorMade<00:00:08.189> exhaust<00:00:09.380> on

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
video up of the TaylorMade exhaust on

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.810 
video up of the TaylorMade exhaust on
this<00:00:10.559> bike<00:00:10.800> but<00:00:11.790> one<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.540> my<00:00:12.630> buddies<00:00:12.900> just<00:00:13.139> got

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
this bike but one of my buddies just got

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.050 
this bike but one of my buddies just got
brand<00:00:14.820> new<00:00:15.859> 2012<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.250> course<00:00:17.490> as<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.760> can<00:00:17.789> see

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
brand new 2012 of course as you can see

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.320 
brand new 2012 of course as you can see
CBR<00:00:18.960> 1007<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.930> i<00:00:22.580> thought<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.730> was<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.939> really

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
CBR 1007 and i thought this was a really

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.269 
CBR 1007 and i thought this was a really
good<00:00:24.510> opportunity<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.170> really<00:00:25.560> show<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
good opportunity to really show the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.080 
good opportunity to really show the
differences<00:00:26.760> between<00:00:26.939> stock<00:00:27.510> sound<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:29.090> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
differences between stock sound and the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.370 
differences between stock sound and the
TaylorMade<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:33.630> only<00:00:33.809> difference<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.320> in

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
TaylorMade so the only difference is in

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.459 
TaylorMade so the only difference is in
these<00:00:34.500> bikes<00:00:34.800> performance<00:00:35.579> wise<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.469> of

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
these bikes performance wise is of

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.190 
these bikes performance wise is of
course<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.700> one's<00:00:38.940> completely<00:00:39.329> stock<00:00:39.809> has

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
course this one's completely stock has

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.319 
course this one's completely stock has
not<00:00:40.410> been<00:00:40.620> broken<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.129> yet<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.460> got<00:00:41.579> maybe<00:00:41.850> 50

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
not been broken in yet it's got maybe 50

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.720 

both<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.970> revs<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.810> only<00:02:19.380> revved<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:19.920> up<00:02:20.070> to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
both of the revs I only revved it up to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.110 
both of the revs I only revved it up to
about<00:02:21.150> 6,000<00:02:21.870> rpms<00:02:22.380> on<00:02:22.650> both<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.250> them<00:02:23.370> like<00:02:23.940> I

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
about 6,000 rpms on both of them like I

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.960 
about 6,000 rpms on both of them like I
said<00:02:24.180> because<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.740> one<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.190> not<00:02:26.490> been<00:02:26.820> broken

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
said because this one is not been broken

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.240 
said because this one is not been broken
in<00:02:27.240> yet<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.020> didn't<00:02:28.530> want<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.710> really<00:02:28.950> rev<00:02:29.160> it

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
in yet so I didn't want to really rev it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.750 
in yet so I didn't want to really rev it
up<00:02:29.340> too<00:02:29.550> high<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:30.420> was<00:02:30.900> about<00:02:31.110> 6,000<00:02:32.040> at<00:02:32.610> the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
up too high it was about 6,000 at the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.490 
up too high it was about 6,000 at the
max<00:02:33.000> whenever<00:02:33.390> i<00:02:33.450> revved<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:33.990> this<00:02:34.080> one<00:02:34.260> and

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
max whenever i revved it on this one and

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.700 
max whenever i revved it on this one and
same<00:02:34.950> on<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.460> one<00:02:36.170> maybe<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.380> future<00:02:37.680> I

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
same on this one maybe in the future I

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.380 
same on this one maybe in the future I
can<00:02:37.920> get<00:02:38.040> another<00:02:38.250> video<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.850> revving<00:02:39.150> them<00:02:39.300> up

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
can get another video of revving them up

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.380 
can get another video of revving them up
to<00:02:39.570> about<00:02:39.750> twelve<00:02:40.020> thousand<00:02:40.790> rpms<00:02:41.790> once<00:02:42.180> this

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
to about twelve thousand rpms once this

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.120 
to about twelve thousand rpms once this
one<00:02:42.540> here<00:02:42.750> gets<00:02:42.870> broken<00:02:43.200> say<00:02:43.800> can<00:02:44.010> hear

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
one here gets broken say can hear

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.050 
one here gets broken say can hear
another<00:02:44.310> sound<00:02:44.550> difference<00:02:45.000> there<00:02:45.870> but<00:02:47.060> maybe

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
another sound difference there but maybe

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.390 
another sound difference there but maybe
that<00:02:48.240> I<00:02:48.690> don't<00:02:49.140> know<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:49.860> know<00:02:49.920> whenever<00:02:50.340> I

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
that I don't know just I know whenever I
