your appear the peers draw the theta
from<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.120> Cedars<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.650> want<00:02:39.130> less<00:02:39.940> peers

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
from the Cedars so you want less peers

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.440 
from the Cedars so you want less peers
and<00:02:40.750> more<00:02:41.170> Cedars<00:02:41.650> for<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.070> fast<00:02:42.340> download<00:02:42.910> this

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
and more Cedars for a fast download this

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.900 
and more Cedars for a fast download this
is<00:02:43.660> because<00:02:44.020> if<00:02:44.200> you've<00:02:44.350> got<00:02:44.380> 200<00:02:45.280> peers<00:02:45.520> and

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
is because if you've got 200 peers and

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.380 
is because if you've got 200 peers and
ten<00:02:46.630> seeds<00:02:47.040> then<00:02:48.040> 200<00:02:48.640> peers<00:02:48.850> are<00:02:49.000> all<00:02:49.180> going

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
ten seeds then 200 peers are all going

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.850 
ten seeds then 200 peers are all going
to<00:02:49.450> be<00:02:49.510> drawing<00:02:49.750> data<00:02:50.080> from<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.590> little

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
to be drawing data from the little

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.680 
to be drawing data from the little
amount<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.250> seeds<00:02:51.460> at<00:02:51.640> one<00:02:51.850> time<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.540> you're

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
amount of seeds at one time so you're

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.270 
amount of seeds at one time so you're
going<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:52.930> get<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.080> tiny<00:02:53.350> bit<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:53.770> data<00:02:53.950> reach

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
going to get a tiny bit of data reach

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.860 
going to get a tiny bit of data reach
it's<00:02:54.820> going<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.090> break<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:55.480> down<00:02:55.510> you're<00:02:55.780> going

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
it's going to break it down you're going

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.930 
it's going to break it down you're going
to<00:02:55.930> get<00:02:56.050> a<00:02:56.080> percentage<00:02:56.590> each<00:02:56.890> okay<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:57.760> if

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
to get a percentage each okay so if

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.260 
to get a percentage each okay so if
you've<00:02:58.120> got<00:02:58.360> more<00:02:58.690> seeds<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.530> less<00:02:59.740> peers

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
you've got more seeds and less peers

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.580 
you've got more seeds and less peers
you're<00:03:01.270> gonna<00:03:01.390> get<00:03:01.540> more<00:03:01.750> percentage<00:03:02.320> of<00:03:02.470> data

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
you're gonna get more percentage of data

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.320 
you're gonna get more percentage of data
so<00:03:03.010> you're<00:03:03.100> gonna<00:03:03.190> get<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.430> faster<00:03:03.910> download

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
so you're gonna get a faster download

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.270 
so you're gonna get a faster download
speeds<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:04.930> won't<00:03:05.650> have<00:03:05.770> to<00:03:05.920> wait<00:03:06.070> ages

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
speeds and you won't have to wait ages

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.520 
speeds and you won't have to wait ages

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
have not got enough seeds okay so now

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.130 
have not got enough seeds okay so now
you<00:03:15.220> remember<00:03:15.490> that<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:16.480> can't<00:03:16.810> go<00:03:16.990> wrong

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
always get higher seeds and less peers

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.080 
always get higher seeds and less peers
now<00:03:20.320> I'll<00:03:20.530> shut<00:03:20.740> out<00:03:20.860> of<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.820> was<00:03:21.940> just
