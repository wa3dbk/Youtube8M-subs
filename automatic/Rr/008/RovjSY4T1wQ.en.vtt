00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.460
 how i heard you are sick that you have this video card 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.310
 mike has a hard time catching cool and she wants to get rid of it 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.700
 refuse 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.839
 I have it here for you 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:11.389
 I hoped to be sufficient first of all 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.769
 well in the beginning is just very difficult to be good at baker 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.279
 give it time 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.650
 And don't give up the money, it will come naturally 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.460
 he sounds pretty obvious but it really is such 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.350
 second 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.400
 never know the four positions when an agreement is taught here by 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.109
 julia 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.409
 see very often 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.550
 after they get the students 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.050
 run their own fingers to study ethical estimates and therefore deviate 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.890
 learn from thorn oh well 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.090
 the positions 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.740
 shorten the answer 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.860
 the entire travel finger pointing in this case freestanding so catchy 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.560
 I often have the animals 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.400
 so grab it 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.470
 dcm 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.570
 after reading those rules obviously not a certain fingering for nothing 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.210
 In this case it is a lot harder for offenders to get out 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.920
 to another agreement 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.920
 to pack and when I do 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.430
 then we know about a next year 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.590
 the agreement 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.790
 where can I but can imagine 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.120
 not only when taking over 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.920
 so don't get rid of it 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.820
 of the fingers and toes per day agreement jan is taught what is consciously doing 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.060
 with the conscious race that chosen precisely because you make it easier 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.800
 when dealing with other agreements 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.800
 use your index finger as the focus point if your focus points is one 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.970
 much easier to implement agreements from that capacity 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.370
 also not so that your first rows have ten fingers 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.289
 think about whether you want to win 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.679
 9 Always focus those changes on and you'll find that is faster too 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.600
 master the overlapping of the chords 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 that should study in give a porter 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.219
 that is about that 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.429
 for the eo disease comes that way in mess 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.949
 what happens all this is the motivation 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.439
 In doing so, we think it is possible to see those changes that are most common 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.739
 Of course you can automatically notice the earth 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.539
 it's a record 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.899
 I am not your index finger then focus if your winner then it rises 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.549
 he agreed, then he can't help it 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.459
 so forefinger 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.519
 according to their regret for me could be from and so too 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.759
 for example, talk about and talk for the often chords 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.859
 let them via twitter of the agreement that you want to go grab something for the next 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:52.909
 month 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.879
 could be supplier 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.849
 nxp four-quart measure draw comes first count 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.849
 always more powerful than nine months 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.319
 the cetera 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.470
 then you can 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.300
 submitted the following agreement between the fourth quarter and this now 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.070
 is the team the next month you can already have to be met suppose there 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.529
 however, there is no agreement 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.529
 9 4 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.939
 reflection and if you look closely then you see that I am 4 it's already after that 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.749
 in that fallen snow 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:43.219
 but then you also save time and all that for your brands 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.699
 that you also packaging you faster and better jac orie photo 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.169
 those are people who offer via I hope you enjoy what goes on with the 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.649
 battle check also conquer tips on ladies roads from computable and for 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:08.480
 now i would say 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.069
 good luck
