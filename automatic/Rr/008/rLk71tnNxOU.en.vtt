00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.359 

ten

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.920 

I<00:01:59.399> mean<00:02:00.030> he<00:02:00.119> could<00:02:00.270> go<00:02:00.390> into<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> black<00:02:00.899> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
I mean he could go into the black and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.350 
I mean he could go into the black and
red<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.250> rare<00:02:02.820> near<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> pink

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
spots slightly in the way that's why I

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.300

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.580

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
does it pass the pink maybe it just

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:43.710 
does it pass the pink maybe it just
creeps<00:04:23.900> by<00:04:24.140> it<00:04:24.200> does<00:04:26.290> super

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.480 

oh<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:44.380> yellow<00:04:44.530> is<00:04:44.710> not<00:04:44.860> going<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.100> go<00:04:45.190> in<00:04:45.340> is

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
oh the yellow is not going to go in is

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.360 
oh the yellow is not going to go in is
it<00:04:45.640> surely<00:04:46.260> what<00:04:47.260> it's<00:04:47.740> great<00:04:47.980> to<00:04:48.100> see<00:04:48.280> him

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
it surely what it's great to see him

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.070 
it surely what it's great to see him
make<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.790> break<00:04:49.090> like<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:49.510> Willie<00:04:49.720> because

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
make a break like that Willie because

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.110 
make a break like that Willie because
the<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.920> balls<00:04:51.190> were<00:04:51.370> very<00:04:51.580> awkwardly<00:04:51.940> placed

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
the the balls were very awkwardly placed

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.670 
the the balls were very awkwardly placed
and<00:04:52.450> I<00:04:52.510> think<00:04:52.690> he<00:04:52.750> likes<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:53.080> challenge<00:04:53.500> when

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.950 
and I think he likes a challenge when
they're<00:04:53.800> like<00:04:53.950> that<00:04:57.540> did<00:04:58.540> make<00:04:58.750> it<00:04:58.780> a

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.620 
they're like that did make it a
challenge<00:04:59.320> at<00:04:59.500> me<00:04:59.620> he<00:05:00.400> force<00:05:00.730> himself<00:05:00.970> to<00:05:01.330> make

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
challenge at me he force himself to make

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.230 
challenge at me he force himself to make
it<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:01.840> challenge<00:05:02.260> as<00:05:02.860> a<00:05:02.980> brilliant<00:05:03.250> break<00:05:03.640> one
