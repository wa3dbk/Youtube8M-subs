defensive check yeah I think there's

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.589 
defensive check yeah I think there's
still<00:04:56.130> a<00:04:56.190> chance<00:04:56.250> that<00:04:56.639> we<00:04:56.849> could<00:04:57.000> win<00:04:57.270> through

and contested war zone could help us
with<00:05:01.139> that<00:05:01.169> I<00:05:01.380> mean<00:05:01.699> if<00:05:02.699> I<00:05:02.820> just<00:05:03.210> don't<00:05:03.360> like

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
with that I mean if I just don't like

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:04.909 
with that I mean if I just don't like
it's<00:05:03.599> I<00:05:03.750> just<00:05:03.960> don't<00:05:04.080> like<00:05:04.169> to<00:05:04.289> test<00:05:04.470> before<00:05:04.740> so

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
it's I just don't like to test before so

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.860 
it's I just don't like to test before so
yeah<00:05:05.220> I<00:05:05.430> agree<00:05:05.699> it's<00:05:06.060> kind<00:05:06.300> of<00:05:06.360> an<00:05:06.509> awkward

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870

cards<00:05:07.320> offense<00:05:07.530> but<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:07.740> think<00:05:07.770> we'd<00:05:07.979> only

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
cards offense but I think we'd only

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.040 
cards offense but I think we'd only
really<00:05:08.400> sideboard<00:05:08.759> that<00:05:08.880> out<00:05:09.060> against<00:05:09.389> Ivan

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
really sideboard that out against Ivan
