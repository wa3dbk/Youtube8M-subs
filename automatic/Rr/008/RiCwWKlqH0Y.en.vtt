 stay watching this video the first thing that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.500
 we are going to use it is going to be a test 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.420
 we are going to apply it to our eye 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.460
 it is so that the colors look more 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.040
 intense and our makeup last us 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.920
 more time 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.080
 Now we are going to use a liquid base 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.180
 or corrector and we will apply it too 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.800
 in all our eye and this is for 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.800
 neutralize the colors 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.699
 now with some loose powder or 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:56.309
 translucent we are going to apply it in everything 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.649
 our eye to seal our prebase 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.649
 and our liquid base or concealer 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.780
 Now let's choose a pretty shade 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.140
 clear and bright can be in color 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.970
 pearl or white I prefer pearl and good 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.640
 your illuminator can also serve you 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.610
 let's put it right in the lacrimal 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.580
 in the form of c in the middle of the eyelid 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.680
 mobile that connects with the lacrimal and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.260
 under the eyebrow this is going to give you a lot 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.100
 more luminosity and that your look looks 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.100
 more awake 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.820
 Now let's choose a brown shadow 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.710
 mate and with a brush to blur 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.100
 let's apply it in all our 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.590
 bone of the eye from where it starts up 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.789
 where it ends and we are going to blur 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.250
 fairly good 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.640
 this is to create more depth in your 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.640
 look 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.370

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.700
 outside of our eye since what 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.280

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.580
 to the center of our mobile eyelid 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.160
 and blur we have pretty good we are going to 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.980
 apply also on the bottom of 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.940
 our eyelashes a very subtle line 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.940
 To the center 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.630

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.090
 brush as thin as you can go to 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.069
 Apply the shadow as pegadito 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.349

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.930
 up and also in the bottom 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.930

 tabs and apply your favorite mascara 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.630
