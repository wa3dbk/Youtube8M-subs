00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.500
 hall I want to introduce 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.360
 lolll which gathers the purchases of the month of 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.070
 May and at least June 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.660
 there are two three things that I have you 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.019
 not put in this hall because very 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.989
 Sincerely this a bit to nothing style I 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.210
 purchased 3 basic tank top hm 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.000
 well, we do not care a bit 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.510
 so I'll start with a little bit of 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.210
 bottle 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.710
 I bought the blue dr range from 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.100
 mulato who is as if if to my left 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.980
 there you have the self quietly time 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.870
 in the middle is the organic shampoo 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.690
 blue it's pretty purple for the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.680
 singing 30 blue house but funds 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.910
 so it's top 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.789
 and to my right daniel care the care 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:12.070
 cream went to match took the 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:15.159
 pencil tonight so here we go 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.690
 very much what I wear on the lips that 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.080
 we do not necessarily realize 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.660
 and then to go with one that I took 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:28.600
 logically it's logically wave 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.979
 wine house publicly so that's it 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.550
 surprised because I'm a little scared 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.670
 in a sense it's a satin and I have a 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.070
 little bit because it thank you 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.020
 satin and actually frankly would 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.479
 that he is matt 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.509
 so nonstop and the one I'm wearing 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.090
 also today so I find that the 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.410
 rule is pretty good and then that 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.030
 was really a long time since I 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.410
 wanted this powder 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.110
 because he would not go live finish the 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.360
 Mineral powder of styling finish 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.610
 light and I love her a lot she has a little 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.050
 powder anyway but I like 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.390
 many by cons I imagined a little 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.160
 more bulging so I do not know if it's 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.110
 me who also imagined she was 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.180
 really more bulging before I got caught 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.820
 masks in fact of the derma mark 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.160
 this summer spa about 2 euros we go 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.110
 say the bag so I took the mask 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.160
 of rest it is for the regeneration of 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.720
 the skin like those here after I took the 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.030
 self mask is for a skin 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.450
 dehydrated game little dehydrated intake 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.090
 nevertheless and after I took the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.980
 good feeling of happiness is a sense 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.900
 purifying and firming for a complexion 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.660

 a neckline removed in front of the back 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.620
 in fact it is totally dominated in the 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.900
 little thongs actually cross each other in 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.419
