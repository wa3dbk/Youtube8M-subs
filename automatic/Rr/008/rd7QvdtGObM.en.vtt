00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
glare is just all automatically

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.760

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
eliminated you don't see the window you

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.749 
eliminated you don't see the window you
just<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> little<00:01:23.400> bit<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.549> light

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
just see a little bit of light

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.820 
just see a little bit of light
refraction<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:25.110> that's<00:01:25.290> what's<00:01:25.470> really<00:01:25.619> cool

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
refraction and that's what's really cool

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.580 
refraction and that's what's really cool
about<00:01:25.890> an<00:01:26.130> anti<00:01:26.430> glare<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.350> don't

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
about an anti glare is that you don't

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.960 
you can really just ignore and it's just
light<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.430> that's<00:01:38.610> going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
light so that's going to be the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.399 
light so that's going to be the
difference<00:01:39.240> between<00:01:39.270> an<00:01:39.509> anti<00:01:39.840> glare<00:01:40.049> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
difference between an anti glare and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.140 
difference between an anti glare and
just<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.070> normal<00:01:41.280> screen<00:01:41.490> protector<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:41.970> this

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
just a normal screen protector like this

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.179 
just a normal screen protector like this
but<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> anti-glare<00:01:43.229> does<00:01:43.500> give<00:01:43.710> your<00:01:43.829> iPad<00:01:44.159> a

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
but the anti-glare does give your iPad a

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.679 
but the anti-glare does give your iPad a
whole<00:01:44.520> new<00:01:44.670> field<00:01:44.970> gives<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.390> whole<00:01:45.540> new

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
whole new field gives it a whole new

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.719 
whole new field gives it a whole new
texture<00:01:46.079> makes<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.799> screen<00:01:47.070> much<00:01:47.310> smoother

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
texture makes the screen much smoother

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.100 
texture makes the screen much smoother
it<00:01:47.850> makes<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.180> finger<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.509> glide<00:01:48.960> across

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
it makes your finger just glide across

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.620 
it makes your finger just glide across
it<00:01:49.470> really<00:01:49.710> cool<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.790> feels<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.420> just

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
it really cool it just feels it's I just

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.969 
it really cool it just feels it's I just
really<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> feel<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.409> an<00:01:52.560> anti-glare

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
really like the feel of an anti-glare

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.380 
really like the feel of an anti-glare
screen<00:01:53.070> protector<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.759> what<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.119> more

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
screen protector that's what I like more

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.120 
screen protector that's what I like more
over<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.409> look<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.729> light

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
over the look of it and the light

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.660 
over the look of it and the light
distraction<00:01:59.130> all<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.460> don't<00:01:59.610> really

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
distraction all that you don't really

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.940 
distraction all that you don't really
had<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.149> though<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> light<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.290> shapes

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
had see though all the light of a shapes

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.499 
had see though all the light of a shapes
and<00:02:02.159> stuff<00:02:02.280> coming<00:02:02.610> from<00:02:02.700> reflections<00:02:03.270> that's

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and stuff coming from reflections that's

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.999 
and stuff coming from reflections that's
a<00:02:03.600> really<00:02:03.780> cool<00:02:03.899> thing<00:02:04.020> about<00:02:04.140> anti<00:02:04.439> glare<00:02:04.590> but

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
a really cool thing about anti glare but

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.530 
a really cool thing about anti glare but
I<00:02:05.100> really<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> feel<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.299> anti

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
I really just like the feel of the anti

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.359 
I really just like the feel of the anti
glare<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.930> their<00:02:07.409> price<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.950> same<00:02:08.129> thing

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
glare and their price of the same thing

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.589 
glare and their price of the same thing
so<00:02:08.580> at<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.789> end<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.030> video<00:02:09.119> figure<00:02:09.539> out

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
so at the end of this video figure out

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.729 
so at the end of this video figure out
the<00:02:09.720> price<00:02:09.959> but<00:02:10.140> they<00:02:10.229> are<00:02:10.319> priced<00:02:10.560> at<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
the price but they are priced at the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.230 
the price but they are priced at the
same<00:02:10.979> price<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.760> definitely<00:02:12.330> go

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
same price so you can definitely go

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.090 
same price so you can definitely go
whichever<00:02:13.510> one<00:02:13.570> you're<00:02:13.690> going<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.900> like<00:02:14.100> but

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100
