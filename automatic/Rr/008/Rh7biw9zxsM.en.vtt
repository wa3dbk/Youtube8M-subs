00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
not necessarily spacesuits that mean

not necessarily spacesuits that mean
they<00:00:51.629> look<00:00:51.809> protective<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:53.149> they<00:00:54.149> didn't

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
they look protective but they didn't

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.660 
they look protective but they didn't
look<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.020> bulky<00:00:55.620> things<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.579> know

look like the bulky things that you know
are<00:00:56.850> statues<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:58.620> they<00:00:58.829> came<00:00:59.070> over<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
are statues but they came over the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.569 
are statues but they came over the
horizon<00:00:59.640> walking<00:01:00.420> towards<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.579> Viking

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
horizon walking towards the Viking

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.679 
horizon walking towards the Viking
Explorer<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:04.549> our<00:01:05.549> vision<00:01:05.880> got<00:01:06.210> cut<00:01:06.420> off<00:01:06.510> I

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
Explorer and our vision got cut off I

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.760 
Explorer and our vision got cut off I
didn't<00:01:06.900> see<00:01:07.020> what<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:07.229> did<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.470> there

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
didn't see what they did with there

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.539 
didn't see what they did with there
anything<00:01:08.040> else

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
anything else

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.200 
anything else
they<00:01:08.850> were<00:01:08.909> probably<00:01:09.150> making<00:01:09.450> repairs<00:01:11.210> that's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
they were probably making repairs that's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.700 
they were probably making repairs that's
why<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> wonder<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:12.990> were<00:01:13.049> our<00:01:13.320> guys<00:01:13.500> are

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
why I wonder if they were our guys are

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.990 
why I wonder if they were our guys are
not<00:01:13.830> good<00:01:14.010> no<00:01:14.570> it's<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.750> war<00:01:16.040> bird<00:01:17.040> Dino<00:01:17.729> acai

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
not good no it's a war bird Dino acai

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.940 
not good no it's a war bird Dino acai
suits<00:01:18.420> they<00:01:18.750> wore<00:01:19.020> well<00:01:19.560> they<00:01:19.650> wouldn't<00:01:19.799> have

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
suits they wore well they wouldn't have

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.890 
suits they wore well they wouldn't have
to<00:01:20.070> wear<00:01:20.189> very<00:01:20.250> much<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.970> mean<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> atmosphere

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
to wear very much I mean the atmosphere

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.499 
to wear very much I mean the atmosphere
is<00:01:22.400> there's<00:01:23.400> enough<00:01:23.610> atmosphere<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.330> walk

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
is there's enough atmosphere to walk

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.570 
is there's enough atmosphere to walk
around<00:01:24.689> without<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.320> spacesuit<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.979> Mars<00:01:26.220> same

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
around without a spacesuit on Mars same

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.789 
around without a spacesuit on Mars same
as<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.869> moon<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.380> mean<00:01:28.619> there's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
as there is on the moon I mean there's

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
as there is on the moon I mean there's
not<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.520> about<00:01:29.700> 15,000<00:01:30.509> feet<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.840> earth

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
not it's like about 15,000 feet on earth

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.679 
not it's like about 15,000 feet on earth
now<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.549> go<00:01:32.700> through<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> 24<00:01:33.540> hour

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
now you can go through a 24 hour

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.160 
now you can go through a 24 hour
acclimatization<00:01:35.360> program<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> moon<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
acclimatization program on the moon and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.390 
acclimatization program on the moon and
you<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.439> walk<00:01:37.590> around<00:01:38.270> without<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.479> spacesuit

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
you can walk around without a spacesuit

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.649 
you can walk around without a spacesuit
same<00:01:41.400> thing<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.700> Mars<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.360> don't<00:01:42.509> need<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
same thing on Mars you don't need a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.649 
same thing on Mars you don't need a
space<00:01:42.979> if<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.189> had<00:01:44.399> one<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.790> was<00:01:44.939> dis<00:01:45.149> minimal

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
space if they had one it was dis minimal

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.719 
space if they had one it was dis minimal
did<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.710> any<00:01:46.890> other<00:01:47.009> witnesses<00:01:47.189> there

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
did you have any other witnesses there

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.899 
did you have any other witnesses there
while<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.119> saw<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.600> well<00:01:49.110> there's<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.350> better

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
while you saw this well there's a better

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.760 
while you saw this well there's a better
well<00:01:50.909> out<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.509> workers<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.500> probably

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
well out of the workers is probably

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.859 
well out of the workers is probably
about<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.979> half<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.310> dozen<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.729> us<00:01:53.850> uh<00:01:53.909> because<00:01:54.600> we

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
about a half a dozen of us uh because we

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.010 
about a half a dozen of us uh because we
were<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:56.640> see<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.969> typical<00:01:57.390> NASA<00:01:57.600> things

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
were you see the typical NASA things

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.899 
were you see the typical NASA things
we've<00:01:58.170> got<00:01:58.350> all<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> monitors<00:01:59.100> oh<00:01:59.250> yeah<00:01:59.520> yeah

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
we've got all the monitors oh yeah yeah

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.280 
we've got all the monitors oh yeah yeah
so<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.270> had<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> few<00:02:00.810> people<00:02:01.110> out<00:02:01.229> there

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
so you had a few people out there

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.050 
so you had a few people out there
