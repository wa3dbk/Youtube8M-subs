00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello everyone on meshuggah and today 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.830
 we have again the Japanese tiger on this 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.080
 once took us straight to the very 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.130
 pancake just look how beautiful and 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.830
 at the sight for sore eyes 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.660
 cinema at us this time most-most cutting 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.310
 top of the list here are also fours in battle 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.260
 present therefore there will be right here 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.180
 unrestrained Naguib right there you can 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.960
 see what you have to face 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.660
 rolling this shnyaga but etc. 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.820
 dj clan doses general read 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.430
 not about to peep it well, as I probably 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.140
 much wrong shorter well you yourself 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.120
 read seen and you do not want 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.010
 comment in general score and what 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.590
 here will be really interesting well 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.050
 First, let me show you a little 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.090
 analysis of the setup on the tiger that's how you yourself 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.640
 feel with classmates well in 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.879
 First, I see that among the strands there is apt-2 to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.160
 85 t-150 and in principle the first and the last 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.110
 it just is not what is on the flank of bands I 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.660
 I will go especially since he is in the Arctic 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.969
 done in such a way that to tank from 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.590
 there it is rather heavy there is no such catch 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.870
 opponents are likely to just come out 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.270
 a little further away and they would plant you higher 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.520
 straight into the board not really straining and and on 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.070
 this all your tanking board will go 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.049
 ashes and alpha among boys are much higher 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.240
 our therefore shoot with them on 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.520
 short distances and not comme il faut 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.610
 so she crawled over Russian. 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.439
 review 370 onigiri optics all this in general 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.409
 the idea is to give birth very well 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.720
 so I got out hung and a little bit 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.030
 saw apt-85 was counting a balcony 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.890
 dedicate but also so well throw 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.509
 mom and trying to roll back site here you 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.909
 can see a little bit useless 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.400
 kids pieces some kind of covenanter and 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.159
 which even can't really break through but 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.200
 plus the tiger is that it is a huge motive 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.909
 Makhina I can these babies simply 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.450
 move you don't even notice that someone 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.920
 I will move there but not so nice when 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.960
 important points occupy some kind of semi 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.570
 useless tank that will punch 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.549
 Can't really 605 damage done to us 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.110
 just humiliated the guy on here put 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.939
 it makes no sense at all because below 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.189
 There is nothing to catch here such as vagrants 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.829
 this apt-85 is generally small in the random and 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.979
 so I move closer to the field here 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.780
 is u have a tractor hi t-150 one with 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.560
 who I did not want forehead to shoot all 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.020
 he took and came to me 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.819
 We throw of the cheek tower know very well what 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.660
 then the cardboard guy here sees something oh 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.790
 there are opponents 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.160
 the boys quarrel I pour took and just 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.840
 left I conceived with him a positioning 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.780
 shoot out so rolled back 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.110
 the guy took just left as a Sakhalin 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.550
 boys I'm shorter i am right 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.590
 this little colin ander is trying 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.599
 accounting bite she even turns out 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.709
 new account a little face his trust 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.690
 otgreb zasvechivayu here su-85 and humpback 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.849
 this m3 lee chest just be quiet 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.830
 pick it up without moving away can be seen there 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.010
 the edge of my body seems to me they 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.720
 I was n’t even lit up because 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.580
 370 meters and I especially nobody here 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.769
 St. X-ray does not order me 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.230
 blind guys well in general just 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.690
 I use my pluses then 150 understood 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.610
 that something is wrong but left learned from 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.739
 of course just a woman caught them in my 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.540
 here it becomes clear that this 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.209
 exactly the winning bout we almost 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.250
 already march to the base goes huge 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.200
 advantage over the trunks and here it is necessary 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.239
 straight grab damage so I figure 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.940
 right across the field so that at least something else 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.209
 shoot a piece of some intrigue here 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.579
 sticks out and damn you say it is hare 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.980
 new gun 038 tenth level great 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.989
 general and speed of subscale 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.150
 also cool that is fast rest 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.980
 very fly for their level because this 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.470
 besides, are there some kind of roofing 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.630
 a conspiracy guy i don't know what 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.720
 I moved in for only a second 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.720
 provtykal and naturally did not get into it 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.019
 but also no longer the possibility of a shot even 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.239
 not 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.519
 and no su-100 kills there 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.109
 someone 4 thing I moved there 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.750
 at the beginning of the fight I understand that she is somewhere here 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.150
 near and here it is lit but not a fact 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.549
 that I lit not pale drying you I already 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.600
 I do not miss a shot right in the carcass 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.209
 softly at all 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.430
 and the first shell of his here 2 well half a body 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.100
 all anticipation must be taken all the same 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.760
 Su-100 is not at all roofing and much 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.519
 simpler 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.950
 kill here was a blunder but it is rather 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.480
 not my fault but just a little shell 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.480
 above left and here I start to catch 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.010
 apf-1 I won't see him anyway 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.810
 it was worth it to pass me the second time already 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.239
 did not break though about 1 normal such 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.720
 cannon 30 stably even sevens 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.789
 punch 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.210
 but it doesn’t pierce me 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.010
 this 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.440
 shavermu or rather how there barbecue grill to 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.020
 Manual there 200 breakdown on top gun 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.990
 I 'm not cursing the pipe behind them 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.940
 Mother's card is shaken up 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.500
 I put a pimple on the map and for which I 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.600
 I almost got rid of it 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.850
 finally lit up this sarah is not his 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.440
 here I am according to the third Newton's law 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.050
 returning him all he has to me here 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.700
 caused well and basically everything remains 10 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.590
 seconds base capture trying to drive 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.960
 more can apt-1 pick it up here 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.940
 cromwell to cook again some 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.710
 obsession again i'm not getting into it 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.080
 could have long been dead and the family is not 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.440
 smeared and here you are the last to suffer 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.250
 a la and dude all the same here I have not blundered 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.800
 2 now ended up putting as much as three 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.750
 thousands of damage with pennies some 508 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.370
 even highlight the main caliber medal and 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.540
 again the mark of class master 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.280
 clean 1199 but because 1200 roughly speaking 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.000
 It also turned out to be as good as 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.850
 fourteen thousand 284 generally straight ears 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.800
 Direct account and -10 200 without prem 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.110
 account but everything is always in general well 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.150
 what I think based on this trilogy 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.430
 which came out on a tiger can be folded 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.040
 the impression is that in principle the tank is not 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.960
 so bad especially if you 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.650
 immediately throw out the idea of ​​faking it or 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.150
 something like that is not for pharma immediately no 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.090
 In principle, it is possible not to 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.669
 tell them that it would be really tank 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.290
 weaker than regular in all respects 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.240
 start comparing your to 360 and zen as 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.150
 I have already said there in all respects 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.340
 tiger is a little bit worse a little bit worse dpm 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.270
 slightly worse accuracy inside 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.090
 hundredths as if to 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.440
 dpm is generally 40 units full this 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.530
 just about anything at all 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.020
 and the rest is no worse than the board 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.090
 excellent 80 millimeters in a circle if 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.580
 be able to use them really 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.490
 good armor she drags a good vein 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.919
 review smartest just forget new 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.990
 you about armor-piercing shells include them 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.009
 there is a party even when on occasion 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.719
 Use mostly sabers 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.150
 or it seems the machine you like 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:27.779
 whether he will like the masses exactly 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:30.479
 No, in the first games, not everyone likes 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:32.849
 although the tiger is the most beautiful tank 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.770
 This thing she requires more such know 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:38.039
 peculiar approach than tiger itself 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:40.770
 so the circle of admirers is in japanese 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:43.439
 the tiger will be much narrower but does it become 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.449
 it’s worse the car itself is gone and it’s not 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:46.050
 enjoy straightening my arms 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:48.240
 and 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.490
 overcoming myself I like it very much 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.139
 again, many thanks to the subscriber 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.339
 beaver statuses dude you better not 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.830
 thank you so much 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:57.599
 listen well and here about the Japanese tyazhy 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.279
 to be honest, even they probably don’t download 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:01.919
 I will be here but the Japanese tiger me for sure 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:02.699
 will always be in the hangar and I roll it out 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:05.219
 I will be regular 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:07.529
 On this probably all such mini 

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:10.020
 the Japanese epopey ended with you was neither 

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:12.649
 step learn zen and see you soon 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.649
 happily
