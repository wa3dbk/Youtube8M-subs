00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
feel like the coach is the way they used

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.170 
feel like the coach is the way they used
in<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.380> spring<00:04:18.680> that<00:04:18.889> they<00:04:19.130> were<00:04:19.579> planning<00:04:20.030> on

felt like they were which is part of the

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.629 
felt like they were which is part of the
reason<00:04:24.590> I<00:04:24.800> feel<00:04:24.949> like<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.190> kind<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.430> forgot

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
reason I feel like I kind of forgot

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.120 
reason I feel like I kind of forgot

Illinois so it's been about a year a
little<00:04:44.240> every<00:04:44.479> year<00:04:46.660> are<00:04:47.660> you<00:04:47.780> thinking<00:04:48.139> even

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
little every year are you thinking even

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.650 
little every year are you thinking even
then<00:04:48.919> about<00:04:49.370> maybe<00:04:49.700> trying<00:04:49.880> to<00:04:50.030> pack<00:04:50.240> closer

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
then about maybe trying to pack closer

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.129 
then about maybe trying to pack closer
if<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:50.840> could<00:04:51.310> well<00:04:52.310> at<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.669> time<00:04:52.700> I<00:04:53.360> really

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
if you could well at the time I really

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:55.960 
if you could well at the time I really
that<00:04:54.650> summer<00:04:54.950> we<00:04:55.190> really<00:04:55.460> we're<00:04:55.789> still

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
that summer we really we're still

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.390 
that summer we really we're still
learning<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.479> lot<00:04:56.660> about<00:04:56.720> how<00:04:57.680> serious<00:04:58.190> it<00:04:58.370> was

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
learning a lot about how serious it was

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.860 
learning a lot about how serious it was
and<00:04:58.940> what<00:04:59.840> exactly<00:04:59.960> it<00:05:00.410> was<00:05:00.440> and<00:05:01.870> treatments

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
and what exactly it was and treatments

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.350 
and what exactly it was and treatments
and<00:05:03.080> you<00:05:03.979> know<00:05:04.099> what<00:05:04.400> what<00:05:04.940> was<00:05:05.090> really<00:05:05.180> going

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
and you know what what was really going

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.879 
and you know what what was really going
to<00:05:05.450> happen<00:05:05.510> because<00:05:05.810> we<00:05:06.050> all<00:05:06.229> really<00:05:06.650> didn't

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
to happen because we all really didn't

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.520 
to happen because we all really didn't
know<00:05:07.010> and<00:05:07.370> so<00:05:07.910> that's<00:05:08.510> also<00:05:08.870> more<00:05:09.080> focused<00:05:09.410> on

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
know and so that's also more focused on

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.190 
know and so that's also more focused on
that<00:05:09.680> throughout<00:05:09.950> the<00:05:10.099> summer<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:10.580> then

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
that throughout the summer and then

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.960 
that throughout the summer and then
obviously<00:05:12.200> it's<00:05:12.979> hard<00:05:13.250> to<00:05:13.340> transfer<00:05:13.760> in<00:05:13.910> the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
obviously it's hard to transfer in the

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.620 
obviously it's hard to transfer in the
summer<00:05:14.210> so<00:05:15.669> just<00:05:16.669> you<00:05:16.970> know<00:05:17.090> played

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
summer so just you know played

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.670 
summer so just you know played
throughout<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:17.990> year<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:18.530> and<00:05:19.430> so<00:05:20.150> I<00:05:20.180> think

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
throughout the year and and so I think

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.410 
throughout the year and and so I think
it<00:05:21.680> was<00:05:21.770> a<00:05:21.830> good<00:05:22.010> time<00:05:22.190> from<00:05:22.340> their<00:05:22.490> transfer

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
it was a good time from their transfer

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.660 
it was a good time from their transfer
this<00:05:24.020> is<00:05:24.200> she<00:05:24.950> really<00:05:25.100> last<00:05:27.040> last<00:05:28.040> season<00:05:28.460> she

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
this is she really last last season she

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.850 
this is she really last last season she
was<00:05:28.790> really<00:05:28.970> healthy<00:05:29.870> enough<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.140> travel<00:05:30.530> and

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
was really healthy enough to travel and

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.760 
was really healthy enough to travel and
come<00:05:30.980> see<00:05:31.130> me<00:05:31.160> play<00:05:31.400> Illinois<00:05:31.790> and<00:05:32.320> I<00:05:33.320> said
