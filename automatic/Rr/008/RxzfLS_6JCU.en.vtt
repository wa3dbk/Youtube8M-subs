this you can put it in the salad easily
later<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:42.140> these<00:00:43.140> veins<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.670> come

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
later on these veins in here that come

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.850 
later on these veins in here that come
up<00:00:45.090> they<00:00:45.539> get<00:00:45.719> real<00:00:45.899> tough<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.350> stringy<00:00:46.620> and

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.380 
to the flour that you already have but
um<00:03:38.800> one<00:03:39.250> thing<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.519> I<00:03:39.670> thought<00:03:39.940> was<00:03:40.120> kind<00:03:40.330> of

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
um one thing that I thought was kind of

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.059 
um one thing that I thought was kind of
interesting<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.019> I<00:03:41.410> really<00:03:41.620> don't<00:03:41.769> know<00:03:41.890> how

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
interesting and I really don't know how

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.979 
interesting and I really don't know how
you'd<00:03:42.310> really<00:03:42.550> say<00:03:42.700> this<00:03:42.849> but<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.120> says<00:03:43.360> that

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
you'd really say this but it says that

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.530 
you'd really say this but it says that
the<00:03:44.140> infusion<00:03:44.700> if<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:45.849> take<00:03:46.060> those<00:03:46.209> leaves

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
the infusion if you take those leaves

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.240 
the infusion if you take those leaves
and<00:03:46.810> mash<00:03:46.959> them<00:03:47.170> up<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.500> stuff<00:03:47.680> like<00:03:47.800> that<00:03:48.040> if

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
and mash them up and stuff like that if

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.710 
and mash them up and stuff like that if
you<00:03:48.400> get<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.670> juice<00:03:48.849> out<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.150> there<00:03:49.269> the

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
you get the juice out of there the

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.660 
you get the juice out of there the
infusion<00:03:50.200> of<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.680> would<00:03:50.920> also<00:03:51.069> be<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.400> good

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
infusion of it would also be a good

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.509 
infusion of it would also be a good
douche<00:03:52.209> for<00:03:52.780> yeast<00:03:53.019> infections<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:53.920> of

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
douche for yeast infections and of

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.340 
douche for yeast infections and of
course<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:55.180> know<00:03:55.360> that's<00:03:55.840> nothing<00:03:56.170> that<00:03:56.200> I
