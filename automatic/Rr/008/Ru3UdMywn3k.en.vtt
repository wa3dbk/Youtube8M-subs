00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.769
 How about comrades since many 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.930
 users have commented on my videos and 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.390
 I have been asked how is it that I put 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.060
 that effect to the windows when opening them to 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.070
 close them or minimize them I decided to do 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.309
 this little video so that all 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.559
 get this excellent effect as you 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:32.840
 may give an account I do not have the 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.880
 effects on the windows since I 've 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.360
 uninstalled the program to perform 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.879
 everything from scratch good then you 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.820
 will go to the description of this video and 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.560
 the rar point file is downloaded 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.320
 they decompress it and we go to the folder 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.780
 extracted where will the very 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.680
 important credits the patch the 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.989
 program and the installer then about 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.010
 the setup we right click and execute 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.010
 as administrator 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.870
 since this little window appears we give 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.720
 in next here we accept the agreement of 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.540
 license and we give in next and again in 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.920
 next to start the installation now 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.920
 we wait a few seconds 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.780
 then we uncheck this option and we give in 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.780
 Finalize 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.150
 now so they can apply the 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.270
 patch to the program should disable its 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.790
 antivirus but calm that will not happen 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.210
 nothing is just a requirement so that everything 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.210
 come out well 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.479
 and well we go back to the folder and about the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.170
 paper we right click and execute as 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.170
 administrator 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.640
 we get this interface here we go click 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.640
 in peace 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.479
 and we make a waiting court 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.740
 and when we get this files budget 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.740
 we click on save license 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.140
 and ready and will have been now 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.870
 we can close this 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.180
 next step I will tell you more or less like 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.270
 I had the program set up since 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.310
 some asked me what are we looking for and 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.760
 we open it is here in the menu 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.760
 start 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.680
 well 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.350
 to begin it is important that this 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.530
 option has it lower or else the effects 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.450
 they will not be applied for obvious reasons 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.680
 you can have it off, so 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.680
 they press and change it 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.360
 As I said, that's how it should be 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.400
 look very good xd now let's go to the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.829
 Animations tab 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.530
 here are the large number of effects 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.230
 that we can choose but what I do is 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.530
 unfold up here and choose the last one 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.530
 option 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.609
 and then down here left marked this 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.069
 popcorn so that all are applied 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.409
 the effects randomly when opening 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.719
 close minimize or restore a window 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.540
 but if you want to choose an effect in 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:35.329
 only unchecks it if ready 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.190
 you come here you choose one and you give in advance 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.650
 so you can see how the effect is 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.560
 this would be for the moment of opening the 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.040
 window you choose one since 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.440
 there are many now we choose another one for 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.490
 close our windows if they want 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.070
 they do the same 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.560
 they unmark and choose one in particular they see 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.010
 their previous ones and select the one that most 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.010
 like 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:07.630
 and so x d then we go to the tab 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.630
 minimize and if they want to do the same 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.270
 likewise in the option to 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.370
 restore your windows choose one of 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.769
 the effects that as can be given 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.670
 account there enough is already everything is at 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.670
 like everyone 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.120
 Well, I'll leave it as I told you. 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.120
 a few moments 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.689
 now we go to menus and do everything 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.539
 exactly the same we only choose one of 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:39.539
 these many we have this one 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.590
 down here is this other and this one more 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.260
 well I'll leave this here or if 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.120
 you prefer, you can mark here 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.120
 down so that they stay as they already do 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.310
 I explained here in the menu is the same 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.100
 just do what I told you these 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.770
 last minutes as they have effects for 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:07.030
 distract yourself a good time x from just 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:09.430
 choose one well but well bacano and 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.080
 while I see which I like ahead in 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.080
 the video a little hahahaha 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.600
 yes 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.720
 or 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.009
 and since finally now we follow the 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.530
 next option that is the last one that 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.289
 it remains for us here we are going to give our 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.460
 windows a gelatinous touch for that 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:38.560
 we just have to mark this option here 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.349
 and here below choose one of these two 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.240
 alternatives in my case I always leave the 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:45.430
 second that is the one that gives it one more touch 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.280
 deep to the gelatinous effect when moving 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:52.240
 our windows and that would be all in the 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.750
 animation tab and in the next 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.560
 did not change anything that is in this either 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:02.530
 in this less is the same, or is it not 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.930
 change more nothing xd but you can 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.569
 try more options you are looking for more 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.610
 functions but in truth those that 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:12.129
 I explained them are like the most general 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.469
 and for which we are interested that are 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:17.740
 all of these here which I hope 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:19.990
 they have been clear and do not forget what 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.599
 more important is that this here is 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.240
 in homs and so on per 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:27.129
 program this has been everything and we can already 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.670
 verify that the effects on 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:31.630
 windows have been 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.630
 look at you 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.580
 while where display of the effects 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.190
 I'm leaving, I hope there's 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.010
 liked if it was like this, like the video 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:49.070
 but if you did not like it too, give it a lay 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.050
 video xd subscribe obviously and not 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.230
 being more will see us in a next 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.440
 opportunity god bless you chao 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.440
 bye
