00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 of shelves with the service of 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.830
 francesco letizia d'anello later for 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.679
 the avellino misses a success by three 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.690
 clear shifts is that however what it is 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.340
 been done so far by wolves is 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.130
 really something extraordinary below 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.410
 play off then it will collide 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.420
 against Juventus will be a nice one 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.880
 game because in any case it is said that never 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.070
 the prediction of the eve can be 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.099
 discounted by trenitalia in office with one 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.550
 once instead the ranking of the series a 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.730
 of the championship obviously have one 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.890
 carat decidedly superior to that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.870
 of the avellino without taking anything away from the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.420
 avellino but of course until the year 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.070
 last played in league for the boys a 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.750
 arrangement of rakes which would be 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.180
 well he did get very angry anyway 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.610
 the leadership because it is having to 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.649
 face a tour de force in December 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.930
 really amazing because we remember it 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.219
 that in series that will come down in the field 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.870
 also on December 26 and 29 we know 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.809
 which of course the appetite comes with eating 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.659
 and therefore looking at all the victories 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.979
 all positive results indeed 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.530
 from the avellino until now there is the will 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.479
 to continue on this road but seen 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.430
 it short-informed you 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.490
 also seen that in the Italian cup 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.259
 the juventus will be found in the presence of the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.070
 vice versa was better to say 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.750
 the other way around 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.759
 milan instead of brera the edges are 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.130
 proud of the mirror 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.869
 the first team that made you beat 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.240
 the heart where you grew those of the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.610
 you will always carry in but we know 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.590
 in short, of the various difficulties which 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.490
 this club is having the leadership 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.369
 by now 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.380
 is trying to sell and the company does not 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.640
 c series one way one side is trying to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.979
 go ahead and minus three points of 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.500
 penalization now the championship in 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.049
 still ranks with all the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.880
 the difficulty of the case is being made 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.560
 relatively well ammar is just we have 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.220
 addressed a question through social media 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.750
 network 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.610
 meanwhile the rebels where you can 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.659
 follow for the official pages yes 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.130
 is questioned and in twitter of bad luck e 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.439
 obviously looking at the headings 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.140
 dedicated to all the question of yesterday 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.450
 in fact we said it is according to you what is the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.390
 the fittest team in this period is 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.220
 therefore which one will prepare for 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.200
 face them better than this 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.660
 final rush of December because it 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.500
 let's remember 21 and the field 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.010
 26 and 29 obviously besides the next one 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.459
 which will be inaugurated until brera on Friday 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.200
 all the challenges on Saturday but then the 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.630
 derby the one created the virtus dog 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.239
 launch Sunday in the lunch match 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.190
 and then surely they will descend into 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.810
 more motivated camp just rested 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.940
 because in fact we said we play 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.070
 practically throughout December then there 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.140
 will be three weeks of stop three 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.880
 serious football weeks played 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.450
 then it will certainly fall towards the end of 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.489
 January 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.640
 in reality, however, the player will return to the 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.280
 respect of headquarters after the 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.380
 first ten days of January for ri 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.540
 to get ready for a second round 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.760
 that seems to be really now 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.530
 to set up a second championship for 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.200
 as for the series b is like the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.150
 judge this initiative to play 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.189
 anyway 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.510
 of the holidays but surely they arrive 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.629
 beautiful of our summer guest 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.159
 today and thanks to all of you for 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.409
