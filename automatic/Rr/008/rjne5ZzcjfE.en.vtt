00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
of them range from very easy to very

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.820 
of them range from very easy to very
difficult<00:00:24.210> particularly<00:00:25.109> number<00:00:25.439> 9<00:00:25.590> which<00:00:25.800> is

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
difficult particularly number 9 which is

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.439 
difficult particularly number 9 which is
collecting<00:00:26.400> flags<00:00:26.670> but<00:00:26.939> we'll<00:00:27.090> come<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.359> to

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
collecting flags but we'll come on to

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.779 
collecting flags but we'll come on to
that<00:00:27.480> one<00:00:27.689> later<00:00:27.920> so<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> first<00:00:29.250> lesson<00:00:29.460> is

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
that one later so the first lesson is

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.429 
that one later so the first lesson is
outside<00:00:30.359> loop<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:30.900> before<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.289> do<00:00:31.410> that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
outside loop but before you can do that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.020 
outside loop but before you can do that
firstly<00:00:32.040> you're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> need<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.579> know<00:00:32.730> how

firstly you're going to need to know how

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.610 
firstly you're going to need to know how
to<00:00:33.090> get<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> flight<00:00:33.719> school<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.410> if<00:00:34.530> we

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
going to push up on the left hand stick

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.960 
going to push up on the left hand stick
again<00:01:22.650> keep<00:01:22.890> an<00:01:22.980> absolute<00:01:23.400> straight<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.940> no

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
again keep an absolute straight with no

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.150 
again keep an absolute straight with no
direction<00:01:24.780> left<00:01:24.990> all<00:01:25.110> right<00:01:25.140> we're<00:01:25.890> gonna<00:01:25.980> go

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
direction left all right we're gonna go

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.440 
direction left all right we're gonna go
all<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.460> way<00:01:26.490> around<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.850> loop<00:01:26.970> till<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.300> get

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
all the way around the loop till we get

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.030 
all the way around the loop till we get
to<00:01:27.540> back<00:01:27.690> to<00:01:27.810> where<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:27.990> were<00:01:28.020> before<00:01:28.740> letting

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
to back to where we were before letting

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.540 
to back to where we were before letting
go<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.310> left<00:01:29.460> hand<00:01:29.640> stick<00:01:29.880> again<00:01:30.120> at<00:01:30.330> 11<00:01:30.660> ago

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
go the left hand stick again at 11 ago

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.500 
go the left hand stick again at 11 ago
that's<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.670> easy<00:01:32.820> part<00:01:32.940> of<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.270> two-part

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
that's the easy part of this two-part

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.360 
that's the easy part of this two-part
lesson<00:01:34.020> now<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:34.860> heading<00:01:35.070> towards<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
lesson now we're heading towards the

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.560 
lesson now we're heading towards the
bridge<00:01:37.730> and<00:01:38.730> it's<00:01:38.850> gonna<00:01:38.940> be<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> same<00:01:39.330> again

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
bridge and it's gonna be the same again

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.700 
bridge and it's gonna be the same again
except<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:39.960> time<00:01:40.080> there's<00:01:40.440> gonna<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
except this time there's gonna be a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.230 
except this time there's gonna be a
bridge<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> middle<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.670> our<00:01:41.730> loop<00:01:41.940> which

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
bridge in the middle of our loop which

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.160 
bridge in the middle of our loop which
we're<00:01:42.360> gonna<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.630> make<00:01:42.750> sure<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.080> avoid

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
we're gonna have to make sure we avoid

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.830 
we're gonna have to make sure we avoid
so<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.980> plan<00:01:44.160> here<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.370> to<00:01:44.490> delay<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.090> fraction

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
so the plan here is to delay a fraction

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.090 
so the plan here is to delay a fraction
of<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.990> second<00:01:46.350> after<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.890> through<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
of a second after going through that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.500 
of a second after going through that
marker<00:01:47.520> before<00:01:47.910> pushing<00:01:48.120> up<00:01:48.330> on<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
marker before pushing up on the

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.970 
marker before pushing up on the
left-hand<00:01:48.720> stick<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.440> that<00:01:49.560> should<00:01:49.770> take<00:01:49.950> us

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
left-hand stick and that should take us

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.680 
left-hand stick and that should take us
nicely<00:01:50.520> around<00:01:50.730> the<00:01:50.850> bridge<00:01:51.030> without<00:01:51.300> hitting

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
nicely around the bridge without hitting

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.480 
nicely around the bridge without hitting
again<00:01:52.020> absolutely<00:01:52.560> no<00:01:52.680> direction<00:01:52.830> keep<00:01:53.370> it

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
again absolutely no direction keep it

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.890 
again absolutely no direction keep it
completely<00:01:53.880> straight<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.540> once<00:01:54.690> you're<00:01:54.810> back

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
completely straight and once you're back

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.960 
completely straight and once you're back
facing<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.350> way<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.560> were<00:01:55.770> originally<00:01:56.190> level

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
facing the way you were originally level

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.680 
facing the way you were originally level
off<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.410> lesson<00:01:58.680> should<00:01:58.800> be<00:01:58.920> finished<00:01:59.690> so

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
off and the lesson should be finished so

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.090 
off and the lesson should be finished so
to<00:02:00.750> get<00:02:00.930> gold<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.410> mission<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.860> need<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
to get gold on this mission you need to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.610 
to get gold on this mission you need to

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
do a 58 seconds or less which is quite

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.690 
do a 58 seconds or less which is quite
tight<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.040> means<00:02:05.190> you're<00:02:05.310> gonna<00:02:05.370> have<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.580> do

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
tight it means you're gonna have to do
