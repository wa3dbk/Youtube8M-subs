so<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.930> has<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> lever<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> inside<00:00:26.189> that

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
so it has a lever on the inside that

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.220 
so it has a lever on the inside that
slides<00:00:26.970> across<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.510> post<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.930> create

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
slides across the post to create

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.320 
slides across the post to create
friction<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.400> really<00:00:29.699> as<00:00:29.910> simple<00:00:30.090> as

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
friction and it's really as simple as

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.420 
friction and it's really as simple as
pushing<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.810> button<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.320> anybody<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:32.040> use<00:00:32.099> it

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
pushing a button so anybody can use it

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.100 
pushing a button so anybody can use it
anybody<00:00:32.880> can<00:00:33.030> master<00:00:33.450> within<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.780> short<00:00:34.020> period

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
anybody can master within a short period

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.979 
anybody can master within a short period
of<00:00:34.469> time<00:00:35.390> basically<00:00:36.390> you're<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.540> gonna<00:00:36.780> put

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
of time basically you're just gonna put

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.860 
of time basically you're just gonna put
your<00:00:37.079> index<00:00:37.410> finger<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.100> button<00:00:38.969> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
your index finger on this button and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.380 
your index finger on this button and
you're<00:00:40.079> gonna<00:00:40.170> slide<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.800> across<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.520> or

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
you're gonna slide it across and or

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.729 
you're gonna slide it across and or
you're<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.540> gonna<00:00:42.809> push<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.290> sequence<00:00:43.680> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you're just gonna push it in sequence to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.529 
you're just gonna push it in sequence to
get<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> call<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.730> make<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.450> as

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
get the call that you want to make so as

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.290 
get the call that you want to make so as
you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.809> tell<00:00:48.950> it's<00:00:49.950> really<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.489> easy<00:00:50.700> so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
you can tell it's really that easy so

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.790 
you can tell it's really that easy so
you<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.840> work<00:00:52.050> out<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.379> sequence

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
you just have to work out the sequence

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.529 
you just have to work out the sequence
so<00:00:53.070> if<00:00:53.190> you're<00:00:53.309> gonna<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> series<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.090> yelps

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
so if you're gonna do a series of yelps

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.060 
so if you're gonna do a series of yelps
you<00:00:54.870> might<00:00:55.050> start<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.440> little<00:00:55.559> bit<00:00:55.800> slower

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
you might start a little bit slower

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.260 
you might start a little bit slower
working<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.850> little<00:00:57.030> bit<00:00:57.090> quicker<00:01:02.210> or<00:01:03.210> if

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
working to a little bit quicker or if

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.880

you're<00:01:03.390> gonna<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> curve<00:01:04.080> that's<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you're gonna do a curve that's just a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.370 
you're gonna do a curve that's just a
slow<00:01:05.129> drag<00:01:05.519> or<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> slow<00:01:06.060> push<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:07.790> love<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.030> PERS

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
slow drag or a slow push I love the PERS

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.780 
slow drag or a slow push I love the PERS
that<00:01:10.380> these<00:01:10.590> calls<00:01:10.860> make<00:01:11.159> they<00:01:11.340> make<00:01:11.520> really

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
that these calls make they make really

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.719 
that these calls make they make really
