00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
because these games are kind of similar

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.010 
because these games are kind of similar
in<00:00:30.019> how<00:00:30.199> they're<00:00:30.499> played<00:00:31.450> but<00:00:32.450> basically<00:00:32.840> on

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
in how they're played but basically on

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
back of the car for the reason being

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.690 
back of the car for the reason being
that<00:00:36.080> they<00:00:36.530> try<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:36.770> take<00:00:37.010> as<00:00:37.130> much<00:00:37.250> stuff<00:00:37.520> off

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
that they try to take as much stuff off

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.280 
that they try to take as much stuff off
the<00:00:37.820> signs<00:00:38.060> of<00:00:38.240> this<00:00:38.360> grants<00:00:38.630> pause<00:00:38.810> I<00:00:39.020> make<00:00:39.170> an

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
the signs of this grants pause I make an

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.070 
the signs of this grants pause I make an
ad<00:00:39.440> cinematic<00:00:40.130> and<00:00:40.510> it<00:00:41.510> was<00:00:41.630> kind<00:00:41.840> of<00:00:41.900> it's

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
ad cinematic and it was kind of it's

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.080 
ad cinematic and it was kind of it's
more<00:00:42.410> like<00:00:42.590> more<00:00:42.860> or<00:00:42.980> less<00:00:43.100> like<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.340> movie<00:00:43.700> kind

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
more like more or less like a movie kind

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.990 
more like more or less like a movie kind
of<00:00:44.180> game<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.080> I<00:00:45.310> basically<00:00:46.310> see<00:00:46.730> in<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:46.850> back

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
of game so I basically see in the back

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000 
of game so I basically see in the back
of<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.180> car<00:00:47.360> here<00:00:47.600> these<00:00:48.110> bars<00:00:48.410> going<00:00:48.680> up<00:00:48.890> and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
of the car here these bars going up and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.380 
of the car here these bars going up and
I<00:00:49.070> just<00:00:49.100> used<00:00:49.430> one<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:49.790> blows<00:00:49.940> up<00:00:50.000> that<00:00:50.360> I

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
I just used one and it blows up that I

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.990 
I just used one and it blows up that I
got<00:00:50.780> I<00:00:50.810> got<00:00:51.410> one<00:00:51.740> of<00:00:51.830> the<00:00:51.920> other<00:00:52.490> cars<00:00:52.820> like

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
got I got one of the other cars like

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.760 
got I got one of the other cars like
that<00:00:53.030> so<00:00:53.780> basically<00:00:54.110> what<00:00:54.290> it<00:00:54.320> is<00:00:54.500> if<00:00:54.680> you

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
that so basically what it is if you

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.470 
that so basically what it is if you
draft<00:00:55.100> people<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:55.579> get<00:00:55.760> points<00:00:55.940> towards<00:00:56.360> it

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
draft people you get points towards it

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.930 
draft people you get points towards it
if<00:00:56.600> you<00:00:56.720> drift<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:57.290> if<00:00:57.860> you<00:00:58.040> get<00:00:58.250> hang<00:00:58.490> time<00:00:58.760> so

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
if you drift and if you get hang time so

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.100 
if you drift and if you get hang time so
if<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.090> go<00:00:59.180> off<00:00:59.300> we<00:00:59.390> can<00:00:59.510> jump<00:00:59.690> or<00:00:59.840> something

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
if you go off we can jump or something

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.510 
if you go off we can jump or something
like<00:01:00.200> that<00:01:00.260> you're<00:01:00.920> going<00:01:01.040> to<00:01:01.100> it's<00:01:01.310> going<00:01:01.370> to

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
something pretty friggin epic like your

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.010 
something pretty friggin epic like your
level<00:01:12.920> two<00:01:13.069> ones<00:01:13.280> usually<00:01:13.520> are<00:01:14.060> something

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
level two ones usually are something

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.300 
level two ones usually are something
really<00:01:15.259> big<00:01:15.439> going<00:01:15.649> down<00:01:15.740> they<00:01:15.950> can<00:01:16.069> take<00:01:16.189> out

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
really big going down they can take out

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.179 
really big going down they can take out
a<00:01:16.369> bunch<00:01:16.579> of<00:01:16.700> cars<00:01:16.990> or<00:01:17.990> it'll<00:01:18.289> be<00:01:18.439> changing<00:01:18.950> the

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
a bunch of cars or it'll be changing the

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.919 
a bunch of cars or it'll be changing the
route<00:01:19.429> of<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.759> track<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.359> that's<00:01:20.719> pretty

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
route of the track and that's pretty

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.230 
route of the track and that's pretty
much<00:01:21.310> basically<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.639> idea<00:01:22.670> of<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.149> whole

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
much basically the idea of the whole

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.300 
much basically the idea of the whole
game<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:23.719> you<00:01:24.079> have<00:01:24.289> these<00:01:24.469> little<00:01:24.770> ones<00:01:25.100> that

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
game so you have these little ones that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.529 
game so you have these little ones that
can<00:01:25.429> take<00:01:25.579> out<00:01:25.700> people<00:01:26.090> if<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:26.270> do<00:01:26.389> at<00:01:26.479> the

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
can take out people if you do at the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.660 
can take out people if you do at the
right<00:01:26.719> time<00:01:26.899> you<00:01:27.049> can<00:01:27.079> see<00:01:27.350> any<00:01:27.710> time<00:01:28.219> you<00:01:28.369> see

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
right time you can see any time you see

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.580 
right time you can see any time you see
those<00:01:29.359> little<00:01:29.509> icons<00:01:29.959> of<00:01:30.079> the<00:01:30.109> cars<00:01:30.350> ahead<00:01:30.499> of

multiplayer<00:02:31.160> racing<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:32.090> have<00:02:32.300> ever<00:02:32.450> seen<00:02:32.660> in

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
multiplayer racing I have ever seen in

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.990 
multiplayer racing I have ever seen in
the<00:02:32.840> game<00:02:33.080> next<00:02:33.890> 24<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.370> two<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.700> four<00:02:34.880> is<00:02:34.970> a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.660 
the game next 24 is a two and four is a
three<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.290> really<00:02:36.769> really<00:02:36.950> think<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.400> blur

might outlast you can see that's pretty

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.229 
might outlast you can see that's pretty
cool<00:02:39.590> i<00:02:39.709> have<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.950> admit<00:02:40.040> like<00:02:40.370> that's<00:02:41.060> the

going to rent the game I'm just not sure

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.350 
going to rent the game I'm just not sure
how<00:03:00.829> the<00:03:01.040> multiplayer<00:03:01.549> will<00:03:01.819> be<00:03:01.970> which<00:03:02.180> is

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
how the multiplayer will be which is

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.500 
how the multiplayer will be which is
what<00:03:02.569> I<00:03:02.720> most<00:03:03.530> look<00:03:03.680> for<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.069> game<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:05.060> I'm<00:03:05.480> a

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
what I most look for in a game and I'm a

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.180 
what I most look for in a game and I'm a
little<00:03:05.900> worried<00:03:06.260> about<00:03:06.440> how<00:03:06.590> that'll<00:03:06.980> look

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
little worried about how that'll look

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.000 
little worried about how that'll look
I'm<00:03:07.610> not<00:03:07.760> sure<00:03:08.049> if<00:03:09.049> it<00:03:09.260> is<00:03:09.290> gonna<00:03:09.530> play<00:03:09.709> out<00:03:09.799> as

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
I'm not sure if it is gonna play out as

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.770 
I'm not sure if it is gonna play out as
well<00:03:10.220> as<00:03:10.459> this<00:03:10.610> its<00:03:10.819> or<00:03:10.940> even<00:03:11.180> is<00:03:11.329> multiplayer

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
well as this its or even is multiplayer

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.089 
well as this its or even is multiplayer
I<00:03:11.989> haven't<00:03:12.349> looked<00:03:12.410> into<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.709> I'll<00:03:12.950> look

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
I haven't looked into that I'll look

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.759 
I haven't looked into that I'll look
into<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:13.610> i'll<00:03:13.940> put<00:03:14.120> in<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.420> description

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
into it and i'll put in the description

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.199 
into it and i'll put in the description
after<00:03:15.769> I<00:03:15.980> post<00:03:16.190> this<00:03:16.280> video<00:03:16.459> but<00:03:17.269> I<00:03:17.450> really

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
after I post this video but I really

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.550 
after I post this video but I really
hate<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.239> keep<00:03:20.450> comparing<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.019> blur<00:03:21.290> but<00:03:21.500> I

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
hate to keep comparing it to blur but I

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.500 
hate to keep comparing it to blur but I
feel<00:03:21.769> like<00:03:21.799> blur<00:03:22.220> is<00:03:22.400> going<00:03:22.549> to<00:03:22.609> be<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:23.359> better

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
feel like blur is going to be the better

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.759 
feel like blur is going to be the better
game<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.019> I<00:03:24.049> feel<00:03:24.170> like<00:03:24.200> these<00:03:24.350> games<00:03:24.620> are

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
game and I feel like these games are

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.650 
game and I feel like these games are
kind<00:03:24.980> of<00:03:25.040> competing<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:26.090> way<00:03:26.239> their<00:03:26.420> boats

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
kind of competing the way their boats

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.250 
kind of competing the way their boats
played<00:03:26.989> it's<00:03:27.709> more<00:03:27.920> it's<00:03:28.190> more<00:03:28.280> it's<00:03:28.760> not<00:03:28.850> even

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
played it's more it's more it's not even

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.690 
played it's more it's more it's not even
racing<00:03:30.260> like<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.709> racing<00:03:31.250> there<00:03:31.489> you

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
racing like it is racing there you

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.400 
racing like it is racing there you
definitely<00:03:32.090> come<00:03:32.209> in<00:03:32.239> first<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:32.690> be<00:03:32.870> the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
definitely come in first to be the

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.379 
definitely come in first to be the
better<00:03:33.560> player<00:03:33.920> but<00:03:34.579> I<00:03:34.609> think<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:37.389> they're

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
better player but I think that they're

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.140 
better player but I think that they're
more<00:03:39.310> crashing<00:03:40.310> games<00:03:40.549> you're<00:03:40.880> trying<00:03:41.090> to

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
more crashing games you're trying to

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.440 
more crashing games you're trying to
take<00:03:41.299> out<00:03:41.450> other<00:03:41.630> people<00:03:42.019> in<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.170> process<00:03:42.350> and

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
take out other people in the process and

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.610 
take out other people in the process and
I'm<00:03:44.450> just<00:03:44.690> not<00:03:44.780> sure<00:03:44.870> how<00:03:44.959> this<00:03:45.200> one<00:03:45.350> will<00:03:45.440> play

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
I'm just not sure how this one will play

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.199 
I'm just not sure how this one will play
out<00:03:45.709> in<00:03:45.980> multiplayer<00:03:46.370> Thor<00:03:46.760> even<00:03:47.060> is

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
out in multiplayer Thor even is

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.970 
out in multiplayer Thor even is
multiplayer<00:03:47.900> so<00:03:48.200> I'm<00:03:48.410> gonna<00:03:48.560> have<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.769> give<00:03:48.889> it

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
multiplayer so I'm gonna have to give it

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.590 
multiplayer so I'm gonna have to give it
to<00:03:49.040> blur<00:03:49.250> on<00:03:49.280> this<00:03:49.519> one<00:03:49.730> and<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.299> don't<00:03:50.450> really

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
to blur on this one and I don't really

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.240 
to blur on this one and I don't really
like<00:03:50.840> picking<00:03:51.319> games<00:03:51.560> over<00:03:51.829> other<00:03:51.980> games

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
like picking games over other games

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.009 
like picking games over other games
because<00:03:52.489> obviously<00:03:53.060> a<00:03:53.420> lot<00:03:53.569> of<00:03:53.720> games<00:03:53.870> are

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
because obviously a lot of games are

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.569 
because obviously a lot of games are
different<00:03:54.350> but<00:03:54.440> these<00:03:54.620> two<00:03:54.859> games<00:03:55.069> are<00:03:55.280> pretty

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
different but these two games are pretty

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.390 
different but these two games are pretty
similar<00:03:56.079> but<00:03:57.079> split<00:03:57.799> second<00:03:58.099> is<00:03:58.160> a<00:03:58.190> really

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
similar but split second is a really

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.039 
similar but split second is a really
great<00:03:58.549> idea<00:03:58.849> for<00:03:59.000> a<00:03:59.090> video<00:03:59.180> game<00:03:59.359> and<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.810> feel

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
great idea for a video game and I feel

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.289 
great idea for a video game and I feel
like<00:04:00.079> that<00:04:00.519> it'll<00:04:01.519> be<00:04:01.700> a<00:04:01.730> pretty<00:04:01.940> good<00:04:02.060> game

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
like that it'll be a pretty good game

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.089 
like that it'll be a pretty good game
and<00:04:02.359> I<00:04:02.989> still<00:04:03.170> have<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.349> keep<00:04:03.470> an<00:04:03.590> eye<00:04:03.709> on<00:04:03.739> I'm

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
and I still have to keep an eye on I'm

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.500 
and I still have to keep an eye on I'm
not<00:04:04.160> going<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.400> make<00:04:04.459> my<00:04:04.609> judgment<00:04:05.090> call<00:04:05.239> on<00:04:05.269> it

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
not going to make my judgment call on it

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.330 
not going to make my judgment call on it
yet<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:05.989> whether<00:04:06.500> I'm<00:04:06.590> going<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.769> rent<00:04:06.950> it<00:04:07.130> or

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
yet and whether I'm going to rent it or

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.759 
yet and whether I'm going to rent it or
I'm<00:04:07.519> gonna<00:04:07.609> buy<00:04:07.849> it<00:04:08.019> we're<00:04:09.019> not<00:04:09.200> even<00:04:09.319> playing

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
I'm gonna buy it we're not even playing

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.099 
I'm gonna buy it we're not even playing
I'm<00:04:09.889> gonna<00:04:10.190> pass<00:04:10.549> on<00:04:10.760> it<00:04:10.910> but<00:04:11.419> I<00:04:11.450> feels<00:04:11.900> like<00:04:12.049> a

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
I'm gonna pass on it but I feels like a

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.500 
I'm gonna pass on it but I feels like a
pretty<00:04:12.290> cool<00:04:12.500> game<00:04:12.709> I<00:04:12.739> just<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:14.120> controls

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
pretty cool game I just the controls

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.449 
pretty cool game I just the controls
work<00:04:14.959> pretty<00:04:15.169> well<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.859> driving<00:04:16.250> and

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
work pretty well the driving and

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.490 
work pretty well the driving and
handling<00:04:16.910> is<00:04:17.030> pretty<00:04:17.269> smooth<00:04:17.539> the<00:04:18.260> only<00:04:18.380> thing

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
handling is pretty smooth the only thing

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.690 
handling is pretty smooth the only thing
I<00:04:18.530> didn't<00:04:18.709> like<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.829> drifting<00:04:19.280> was<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.459> little

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
I didn't like the drifting was a little

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.789 
I didn't like the drifting was a little
bit<00:04:19.820> wonky<00:04:20.030> for<00:04:20.450> me<00:04:20.539> at<00:04:20.780> first<00:04:20.810> I<00:04:21.289> take<00:04:21.590> some

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
bit wonky for me at first I take some

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.670 
bit wonky for me at first I take some
getting<00:04:22.220> used<00:04:22.250> to<00:04:22.610> but<00:04:22.870> it's<00:04:23.870> sort<00:04:24.560> of

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
getting used to but it's sort of

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.379 
getting used to but it's sort of
comfortable<00:04:25.039> it's

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
comfortable it's

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.300 
comfortable it's
not<00:04:25.479> as<00:04:25.599> comfortable<00:04:25.900> controls<00:04:26.499> as<00:04:26.800> in<00:04:27.009> blur<00:04:27.280> i

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
not as comfortable controls as in blur i

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.399 
not as comfortable controls as in blur i
like<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.699> blur<00:04:27.939> controls<00:04:28.449> work<00:04:28.870> really<00:04:29.050> well

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
like the blur controls work really well

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.360

and there's a lot of pluses and minuses
to<00:04:37.569> this<00:04:37.840> but<00:04:38.469> so<00:04:38.860> far<00:04:39.039> off<00:04:39.219> the<00:04:39.340> den<00:04:39.520> walking<00:04:39.849> i

00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:39.999

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:41.580 
to this but so far off the den walking i
can<00:04:40.150> grasp<00:04:40.360> but<00:04:40.599> it's<00:04:40.749> a<00:04:40.840> pretty<00:04:41.169> cool<00:04:41.469> looking

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
can grasp but it's a pretty cool looking

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.800 
can grasp but it's a pretty cool looking
game<00:04:41.919> like<00:04:42.219> I<00:04:42.340> like<00:04:42.520> you<00:04:42.729> know<00:04:42.819> i<00:04:42.939> only<00:04:43.509> played

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
game like I like you know i only played

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.420 
game like I like you know i only played
it<00:04:43.930> once<00:04:44.319> or<00:04:44.560> twice<00:04:44.650> because<00:04:44.949> there's<00:04:45.340> no

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
it once or twice because there's no

it once or twice because there's no
multiplayer<00:04:45.759> but<00:04:46.499> if<00:04:47.499> this<00:04:47.680> was<00:04:47.979> a

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
multiplayer but if this was a

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.649 
multiplayer but if this was a
multiplayer<00:04:48.639> game<00:04:48.729> i<00:04:48.939> think<00:04:49.120> it<00:04:49.419> might<00:04:49.629> be

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:49.659
