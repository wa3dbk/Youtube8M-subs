00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:10.950
 ants you want to visit me 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.890
 one big and beautiful house where he lives 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.260
 a huge road family is probably not 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.890
 I saw this house once when I was walking in the summer 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.650
 the forest under the branches of trees 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.760
 there is a high mound of twigs and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.860
 pine needles 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.020
 but out of it are businesslike 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.359
 run out little yorkie dweller and 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.570
 while others return carrying on themselves 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:38.699
 heavy booty guess what kind of house 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.159
 but of course it's an anthill and live in 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:45.389
 he is hardworking and friendly crumbs 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:47.760
 ants and what is this little white 

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:50.339
 lumps hidden in secluded corners 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.940
 big anthill think this stock 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:57.030
 food here and there are no eggs of which 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.579
 hatch small ants if 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.280
 an anthill is in danger of an adult 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.280
 ants first save eggs 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.670
 and lays eggs and takes babies 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.560
 ant queen so she in 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:17.200
 anthill the most important but the rest 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.420
 level are taken care of by their queens and 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.460
 little ant chic was always food 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.830
 so that they are warm and comfortable working 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.830
 the ants go far into the forest and 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.770
 collect prey of dead beetles and caterpillars 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.240
 green leaves of grass and twigs for 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.830
 construction and do you know that ants 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.380
 always finds a way home 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.870
 even if they are very, very far away from 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.850
 home as they manage it very much 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.760
 just leaving they spray 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.600
 special odorous fluid and finds 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.420
 way back by smell 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.650
 What do you think strong ants you 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.590
 it seems that the weak 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.930
 because they are so tiny but no 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.020
 after all the tiny ant can drag 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:09.580
 a load that weighs much more than he 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.899
 myself and who else is hanging upside down on 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.290
 anthill ceilings 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.170
 and this is a special ants that stocks 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.660
 yourself in the tummy sweet flower juice and 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.200
 when food supplies in storerooms fit 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.870
 the end 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.560
 they release this juice and feed their 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.050
 relatives 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.600

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.700

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.430

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.690

 who guard the entrances to the anthill from 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.709
 uninvited guests and any danger 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.709
 ready to rush into battle with enemies 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.959
