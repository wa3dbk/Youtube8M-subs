00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
a eyes fan out here and today I have to

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.950 
a eyes fan out here and today I have to
wall<00:00:11.160> openers<00:00:11.849> for<00:00:12.269> your<00:00:12.420> Minecraft

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
wall openers for your Minecraft

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.279 
wall openers for your Minecraft
minecarts<00:00:13.790> so<00:00:14.790> if<00:00:15.179> we<00:00:15.240> just<00:00:15.570> try<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.870> one

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
minecarts so if we just try this one

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.529 
minecarts so if we just try this one
this<00:00:16.470> one<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.710> flush<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.369> floor<00:00:17.699> with

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
this one is flush with the floor with

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.150 
this one is flush with the floor with
the<00:00:18.660> wall<00:00:18.869> excuse<00:00:19.439> me<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.949> both<00:00:20.670> sides<00:00:20.750> so<00:00:21.750> that

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
the wall excuse me on both sides so that

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.320 
the wall excuse me on both sides so that
yeah<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.369> looks<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.880> bit<00:00:23.970> cleaner<00:00:25.550> on<00:00:26.550> pop

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
yeah it just looks a bit cleaner on pop

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.779 
yeah it just looks a bit cleaner on pop
in<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.740> door<00:00:28.980> opening<00:00:29.640> and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
in we can see the door opening and

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.700 
in we can see the door opening and
closing<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.630> us<00:00:30.720> perfectly<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.410> let's<00:00:31.590> do

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
closing for us perfectly so let's do

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.240 
closing for us perfectly so let's do
that<00:00:31.769> once<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:36.950> it<00:00:37.950> was<00:00:38.040> closed<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.980> other

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
that once and it was closed so the other

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.770 
that once and it was closed so the other
one<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.969> bit<00:00:42.300> more<00:00:42.750> messy<00:00:44.149> layout<00:00:45.149> wise<00:00:45.390> in

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
one is a bit more messy layout wise in

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.580 
one is a bit more messy layout wise in
my<00:00:45.960> opinion<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:49.700> smallest<00:00:51.590> circuit

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
my opinion but it's the smallest circuit

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.189 
my opinion but it's the smallest circuit
wise<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.000> one<00:00:54.270> only<00:00:54.480> goes

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
wise so you can see this one only goes

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.290 
wise so you can see this one only goes
under<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.070> ground<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:56.940> one<00:00:57.000> goes

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
under the ground one and this one goes

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
under the ground one and this one goes
down<00:00:57.329> under<00:00:57.989> two<00:00:58.590> blocks<00:01:00.230> but<00:01:01.230> yeah<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:02.010> work

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
down under two blocks but yeah they work

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.780 
down under two blocks but yeah they work
nearly<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.940> same<00:01:03.920> this<00:01:04.920> one's<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.309> was<00:01:05.519> just

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
nearly the same this one's it was just

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.840 
nearly the same this one's it was just
harder<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.630> why

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.940 

so<00:01:11.850> let's<00:01:12.329> get<00:01:12.539> on<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.719> the<00:01:13.020> tutorial<00:01:13.229> for

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
so let's get on with the tutorial for

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.029 
so let's get on with the tutorial for
both<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.429> these<00:01:14.630> all<00:01:15.630> right<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.469> is<00:01:16.679> the

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
both of these all right so this is the

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.700 
both of these all right so this is the
smallest<00:01:17.490> one<00:01:17.990> so<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.049> want<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.289> start<00:01:19.319> off

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
smallest one so you want to start off

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.990 
smallest one so you want to start off
with<00:01:20.039> a<00:01:20.630> your<00:01:21.630> normal<00:01:22.079> railway<00:01:22.469> path<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.280> this

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
with a your normal railway path and this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.620 
with a your normal railway path and this
will<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.420> where<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:25.130> walls<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.429> be<00:01:26.630> so

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
will be where your walls going to be so

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.660 
will be where your walls going to be so
punch<00:01:27.869> out<00:01:28.079> these<00:01:28.619> two<00:01:28.890> rails<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.459> place

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
punch out these two rails and place

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.120 
punch out these two rails and place
detector<00:01:30.179> rails<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.539> their<00:01:30.719> places<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.439> place

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
detector rails in their places and place

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.449 
detector rails in their places and place
a<00:01:32.369> powered<00:01:32.939> rail<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.750> there<00:01:34.170> next<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
a powered rail right there next to the

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.029 
a powered rail right there next to the
sticky<00:01:35.819> piston<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:37.170> these<00:01:37.619> two<00:01:37.829> stick

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
sticky piston and on these two stick

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.699 
sticky piston and on these two stick
Pistons<00:01:38.459> at<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.909> end<00:01:39.030> place<00:01:39.359> to<00:01:39.750> piston

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
Pistons at the end place to piston

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:44.809 
Pistons at the end place to piston
multiple<00:01:41.130> blocks<00:01:41.869> then<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.439> make<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.489> shape

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
multiple blocks then you make this shape

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.910 
multiple blocks then you make this shape
right<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> side<00:01:45.929> where<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.409> two<00:01:46.619> sticky

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
right on the side where the two sticky

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.539 
right on the side where the two sticky
pistons<00:01:47.280> are<00:01:48.590> what<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> redstone<00:01:50.039> dust<00:01:50.340> all

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
pistons are what a redstone dust all

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.589 
pistons are what a redstone dust all
over<00:01:50.579> there<00:01:51.590> hey<00:01:52.590> porch<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.250> then<00:01:53.939> two<00:01:54.360> blocks

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:54.599 
over there hey porch and then two blocks

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:57.619 
over there hey porch and then two blocks
up<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.459> the<00:01:56.819> two<00:01:57.239> pistons

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:57.629 
up like that so that the two pistons

00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:01.419 
up like that so that the two pistons
extend<00:01:58.170> then<00:01:59.099> out<00:01:59.429> of<00:01:59.539> this<00:02:00.539> detector<00:02:01.110> rail

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
extend then out of this detector rail

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.789 
extend then out of this detector rail
you<00:02:02.429> put<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.789> repeater<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.329> two<00:02:03.569> tix<00:02:03.869> with<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.619> red

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
you put a repeater on two tix with a red

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.160 
you put a repeater on two tix with a red
sand<00:02:05.069> dust<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:06.140> then<00:02:07.549> again<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:09.599> same<00:02:09.899> thing

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
sand dust and then again the same thing

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.309 
sand dust and then again the same thing
on<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.440> other<00:02:10.470> side<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.890> repeater<00:02:11.489> on<00:02:11.579> two<00:02:11.819> tix

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
on the other side of repeater on two tix

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.699 
on the other side of repeater on two tix
with<00:02:13.319> eight<00:02:13.560> redstone<00:02:14.220> dust<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.590> should

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
with eight redstone dust so this should

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.770 
with eight redstone dust so this should
be<00:02:16.889> a<00:02:16.920> large<00:02:17.670> part<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.299> your<00:02:19.970> railway<00:02:20.970> station

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
be a large part of your railway station

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.339 
be a large part of your railway station
so<00:02:22.880> yeah<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.269> doesn't<00:02:24.600> work<00:02:24.870> that's<00:02:25.139> the

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
so yeah that doesn't work that's the

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.580 
so yeah that doesn't work that's the
only<00:02:25.590> thing<00:02:25.799> so<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.819> want<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.299> have<00:02:27.450> either<00:02:28.079> a

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
only thing so you want to have either a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.670 
only thing so you want to have either a
torch<00:02:28.920> there<00:02:29.400> or<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:30.150> block<00:02:30.720> with<00:02:31.260> red<00:02:31.470> some

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
torch there or a block with red some

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.379 
torch there or a block with red some
dust<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.040> top<00:02:32.099> there<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.639> doesn't<00:02:33.180> really

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
dust on top there it doesn't really

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.870 
dust on top there it doesn't really
matter<00:02:33.750> really<00:02:34.079> works<00:02:34.920> both<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.400> same<00:02:35.639> and

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
matter really works both the same and

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.259 
matter really works both the same and
then<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.269> place<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.750> piston<00:02:37.260> like<00:02:37.470> that

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
then just place a piston like that

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.050 
then just place a piston like that
update<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.450> paste<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.840> manually<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:41.250> now<00:02:41.489> you

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
update that paste in manually so now you

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.629 
update that paste in manually so now you
should<00:02:42.329> see<00:02:42.359> a<00:02:42.599> golden<00:02:42.959> just<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.769> mine<00:02:44.010> there

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
should see a golden just in mine there

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.080 
should see a golden just in mine there
you<00:02:45.060> go<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:46.049> that<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.220> smallest<00:02:47.669> one

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
you go so that is the smallest one

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.770 
you go so that is the smallest one
though<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.349> not<00:02:49.380> flush<00:02:50.209> so<00:02:51.209> let's<00:02:51.419> get<00:02:51.569> on

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
though it is not flush so let's get on

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.129 
though it is not flush so let's get on
with<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.200> flush<00:02:52.530> one<00:02:52.940> alright<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.329> for<00:02:54.720> the

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
with the flush one alright so for the

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.259 
with the flush one alright so for the
bigger<00:02:55.500> one<00:02:55.799> but<00:02:55.829> flush<00:02:56.579> with<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.819> wall<00:02:56.910> one

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
bigger one but flush with the wall one

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.509 
bigger one but flush with the wall one
you<00:02:57.900> want<00:02:58.079> to<00:02:58.109> start<00:02:58.319> off<00:02:58.530> with<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:59.130> exact

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
you want to start off with the exact

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.089 
you want to start off with the exact
same<00:02:59.730> setup<00:03:00.090> like<00:03:00.329> that<00:03:00.389> so<00:03:01.139> just<00:03:01.500> your<00:03:01.739> input

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
same setup like that so just your input

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.120 
same setup like that so just your input
rail<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.669> output<00:03:03.230> or<00:03:04.230> however<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.739> call<00:03:04.919> it

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
rail and output or however you call it

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.460 
rail and output or however you call it
you're<00:03:05.849> too<00:03:06.000> sticky<00:03:06.239> pistons<00:03:06.720> are<00:03:06.989> three

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
you're too sticky pistons are three

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.520 
you're too sticky pistons are three
sticky<00:03:07.739> business<00:03:07.919> rather

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
sticky business rather

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.600 
sticky business rather
like<00:03:08.770> this<00:03:09.390> then<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.660> third<00:03:11.319> rail<00:03:11.680> they're<00:03:12.160> not

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
like this then a third rail they're not

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.000 
like this then a third rail they're not
these<00:03:12.970> two<00:03:13.180> rails<00:03:13.450> out<00:03:13.690> next<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.440> door<00:03:14.740> and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
these two rails out next to the door and

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.860 
these two rails out next to the door and
place<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.520> tectorial<00:03:15.880> in<00:03:16.209> their<00:03:16.390> places<00:03:18.870> then

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
place the tectorial in their places then

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.580 
place the tectorial in their places then
you<00:03:20.819> get<00:03:21.819> your<00:03:21.850> four<00:03:22.510> it's<00:03:22.690> done<00:03:22.930> dust<00:03:23.290> in<00:03:23.470> a

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
you get your four it's done dust in a

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.979 
you get your four it's done dust in a
t-shape<00:03:24.100> like<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.910> on<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.330> side<00:03:25.569> where<00:03:25.840> the

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
t-shape like that on the side where the

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.510 
t-shape like that on the side where the
two<00:03:26.230> pistons<00:03:26.650> are<00:03:27.780> two<00:03:28.780> blocks<00:03:28.930> up<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.650> a

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
two pistons are two blocks up and a

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.470 
two pistons are two blocks up and a
total<00:03:31.030> walk<00:03:31.630> above<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:33.940> goes<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:34.120> like

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
total walk above so it goes just like

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.520 
total walk above so it goes just like
that<00:03:36.390> piston<00:03:37.390> movable<00:03:37.750> blocks<00:03:37.989> this<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.380> going

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
that piston movable blocks this is going

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.370 
that piston movable blocks this is going
to<00:03:38.590> be<00:03:38.680> what<00:03:38.890> is<00:03:39.069> showing<00:03:39.880> when<00:03:40.330> riding<00:03:40.989> mine

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
to be what is showing when riding mine

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.710 
to be what is showing when riding mine
cart<00:03:41.680> through<00:03:43.920> then<00:03:44.920> under<00:03:45.310> here<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:46.510> want<00:03:46.660> to

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
cart through then under here you want to

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.259 
cart through then under here you want to
come<00:03:46.840> out<00:03:47.050> of<00:03:47.080> this<00:03:47.500> redstone<00:03:48.070> dust<00:03:48.459> on<00:03:48.880> either

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
come out of this redstone dust on either

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.710 
come out of this redstone dust on either
side<00:03:49.660> it<00:03:49.840> doesn't<00:03:50.050> matter<00:03:50.940> place<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:52.300> repeater

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
side it doesn't matter place a repeater

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.449 
side it doesn't matter place a repeater
like<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.680> into<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.160> piston<00:03:54.910> let<00:03:55.330> that<00:03:55.540> piston

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
like that into a piston let that piston

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.970 
like that into a piston let that piston
go<00:03:57.459> out<00:03:58.260> like<00:03:59.260> this<00:03:59.590> so<00:04:01.200> yeah<00:04:02.200> like<00:04:02.410> this<00:04:02.709> so

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
go out like this so yeah like this so

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.690 
go out like this so yeah like this so
into<00:04:03.220> an<00:04:03.340> l-shape<00:04:04.019> then<00:04:05.019> a<00:04:05.370> repeater<00:04:06.370> on<00:04:06.459> one

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
into an l-shape then a repeater on one

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.600 
into an l-shape then a repeater on one
tick<00:04:06.940> go<00:04:07.660> up<00:04:07.870> one<00:04:08.080> like<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.769> and<00:04:08.980> place<00:04:09.370> a

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
tick go up one like that and place a

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.580 
tick go up one like that and place a
block<00:04:09.910> there<00:04:10.269> so<00:04:10.540> that<00:04:10.569> it<00:04:10.840> activates<00:04:11.140> that

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
block there so that it activates that

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.050 
block there so that it activates that
one<00:04:11.820> so<00:04:12.820> then<00:04:13.060> when<00:04:13.209> we<00:04:13.329> would<00:04:13.510> grab<00:04:13.780> our<00:04:13.930> mind

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
one so then when we would grab our mind

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.599 
one so then when we would grab our mind
cards<00:04:16.060> on<00:04:16.209> through<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.739> yeah<00:04:18.340> that's

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
cards on through so yeah that's

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:30.510 
cards on through so yeah that's
