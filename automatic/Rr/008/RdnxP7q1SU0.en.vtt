00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.919
 hello how are my name Mariana and 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.069
 today I bring you a super easy recipe and 

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:10.290
 super rich that I hope you like and then 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.969
 let's start with the video well 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.129
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.900
 Orion chocolates and chocolate topping 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.519
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.970
 take our roots and we're going to 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.970
 pull apart 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.750
 so that we have separated them what 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.449
 do after is to take our chocolates 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.730
 and we're going to take a part of the cookie 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.739
 and we're going to put a plate and we're going to 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.199
 put on top of the cookie 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.949
 the chocolate and then we will put the 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:42.100
 microwave for 10 to 15 seconds and we're going to 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.100
 wait 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.970
 since they have left the microwave they are going to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.280
 be a little soft and we are going to take 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.620
 the other part of the diet and we're going to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.300
 put on and let's push a little 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.170
 and we will do the same with all 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.170
 our cookies 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.750
 we are going to put our fingers 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.420
 refrigerator in what we put to bathroom 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.350
 marÃ­a our chocolate and we wait for 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.350
 that melts 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.600
 since there is our coverage of 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.360
 chocolate very well melted what I'm going 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.340
 to do is to remove it from the fire and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.759
 I'm going to put in my month and I'm going to take my 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.039
 chocolates from the fridge and I'm going to start 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.039
 put the chocolate to the chocolates 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.810
 me so that they look much prettier 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.909
 I'm going to put these colorful things 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.700
 that they did not know each other but about 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.149
 cults of colors that you put on and they look 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.579
 super nice and I will do the same with 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.130
 two same moles until finished and already one 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.640
 once covered we are going to get back 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.780
 at the refrigerator for an hour and they are going to 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.780
 be ready to eat 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.060
