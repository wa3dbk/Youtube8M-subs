00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
primarily a stills camera it has been

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.299 
primarily a stills camera it has been
built<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.899> video<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.409> mind<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.189> it's

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
built with video in mind but it's

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.149 
built with video in mind but it's
partially<00:01:05.820> due<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.119> weighing<00:01:06.740> 750<00:01:07.740> grams<00:01:07.979> for

partially due to weighing 750 grams for

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370 
partially due to weighing 750 grams for
its<00:01:08.280> body<00:01:08.490> only<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.600> lightweight<00:01:09.960> enough

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
its body only so it's lightweight enough

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.730 
its body only so it's lightweight enough
to<00:01:10.920> take<00:01:11.400> outside<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.360> shoot<00:01:12.659> with<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.500> can

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
to take outside and shoot with it can

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.980 
to take outside and shoot with it can
take<00:01:14.010> footage<00:01:14.549> at<00:01:14.760> 60<00:01:15.270> frames<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.630> second

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
take footage at 60 frames a second

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.830 
take footage at 60 frames a second
that's<00:01:16.229> full<00:01:16.500> HD<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.549> an<00:01:17.759> impressive<00:01:18.360> quality

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
that's full HD so an impressive quality

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.960 
that's full HD so an impressive quality

and obviously it's got this flip out
screen<00:01:21.150> which<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:21.720> help<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:22.110> viewing
