think<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.959> mentioned<00:03:19.320> briefly<00:03:19.410> in<00:03:19.709> one<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:19.950> the

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
think I mentioned briefly in one of the

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.180 
think I mentioned briefly in one of the
episodes<00:03:20.760> about<00:03:20.970> Mario<00:03:21.269> vs.<00:03:21.540> Donkey<00:03:21.570> I<00:03:22.320> might

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
episodes about Mario vs. Donkey I might

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.130 
episodes about Mario vs. Donkey I might
do<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.489> someday<00:03:23.970> but<00:03:24.360> don't<00:03:24.540> expect<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.019> any

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
do that someday but don't expect it any

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.509 
do that someday but don't expect it any
time<00:03:25.350> in<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.500> near<00:03:25.590> future<00:03:25.830> that's<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.340> game

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
time in the near future that's a game

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.040 
time in the near future that's a game
where<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.970> master<00:03:27.480> like<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.720> know<00:03:27.840> really

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
where a master like you know really

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.130 
where a master like you know really
learning<00:03:28.350> how<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.440> use<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.920> DS<00:03:29.100> for<00:03:29.489> that<00:03:29.610> and

learning how to use the DS for that and

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.800 
learning how to use the DS for that and
the<00:03:31.519> it's<00:03:32.519> just<00:03:32.970> not<00:03:33.300> something<00:03:33.450> that's<00:03:33.630> high

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
the it's just not something that's high

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.750 
the it's just not something that's high
my<00:03:33.959> list<00:03:34.140> at<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.320> moment<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.250> completely

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
my list at the moment it is completely

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.830 
my list at the moment it is completely
different<00:03:35.880> game<00:03:36.120> those<00:03:36.300> don't<00:03:36.570> think<00:03:36.720> I'm

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
different game those don't think I'm

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.199 
different game those don't think I'm
shipping<00:03:37.080> you<00:03:37.260> off<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.739> no<00:03:37.860> more<00:03:38.730> Mario

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
shipping you off of you no more Mario

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.449 
shipping you off of you no more Mario
vs.<00:03:39.570> Donkey<00:03:39.600> Kong<00:03:40.050> action<00:03:40.350> it's<00:03:40.709> pretty<00:03:41.340> much

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
vs. Donkey Kong action it's pretty much

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.160 
vs. Donkey Kong action it's pretty much
almost<00:03:41.670> its<00:03:41.940> entire<00:03:41.970> own<00:03:42.780> game<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.890> suppose

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
almost its entire own game I suppose

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.220 
almost its entire own game I suppose
now<00:03:46.890> that's<00:03:47.280> what<00:03:47.520> is<00:03:47.700> going<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.000> come<00:03:48.180> next

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
now that's what is going to come next

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.630 
now that's what is going to come next
I'm<00:03:49.830> not<00:03:49.980> gonna<00:03:50.100> spoil<00:03:50.280> anything<00:03:50.430> because

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
I'm not gonna spoil anything because

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.240 
I'm not gonna spoil anything because
it's<00:03:50.790> gonna<00:03:50.880> be<00:03:51.000> going<00:03:51.150> up<00:03:51.209> tomorrow<00:03:51.569> but<00:03:52.250> the

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
it's gonna be going up tomorrow but the

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.860 
it's gonna be going up tomorrow but the
one<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.490> I'm<00:03:53.610> technically<00:03:54.510> is<00:03:54.630> following

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
one that I'm technically is following

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.760 
one that I'm technically is following
this<00:03:55.020> one<00:03:55.170> though<00:03:55.319> I<00:03:55.350> guess<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.650> doesn't

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
this one though I guess it doesn't

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.470 
this one though I guess it doesn't
really<00:03:55.920> matter<00:03:56.160> which<00:03:56.580> is<00:03:56.850> which<00:03:57.150> because<00:03:57.390> I'm

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
really matter which is which because I'm

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.690 
really matter which is which because I'm
having<00:03:57.660> both<00:03:57.930> go<00:03:58.200> up<00:03:58.260> tomorrow<00:03:58.520> it's<00:03:59.520> going<00:03:59.640> to

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
having both go up tomorrow it's going to

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.360 
having both go up tomorrow it's going to
be<00:03:59.790> an<00:03:59.880> RPG<00:04:00.470> I'm<00:04:01.470> not<00:04:01.709> gonna<00:04:01.860> say<00:04:02.010> more<00:04:02.220> than
