technology<00:00:37.460> I'll<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.640> showing<00:00:38.820> audio<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:39.600> were

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
technology I'll be showing audio we were

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.719 
technology I'll be showing audio we were
running<00:00:40.049> on<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.890> shark<00:00:41.129> processor<00:00:41.610> today

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:41.729 
running on the shark processor today

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.450 
running on the shark processor today
this<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.239> shark<00:00:42.530> 371<00:00:43.530> board<00:00:43.769> this<00:00:44.309> is

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
this is a shark 371 board this is

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.070 
this is a shark 371 board this is
developed<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.120> conjunction<00:00:45.269> with<00:00:45.629> Danville

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
developed in conjunction with Danville

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.869 
developed in conjunction with Danville
signal<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.799> I'll<00:00:47.280> also<00:00:47.430> show<00:00:47.580> some

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
signal and I'll also show some

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.719 
signal and I'll also show some
algorithms<00:00:48.239> running<00:00:48.390> natively<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.199> PC<00:00:49.729> so

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
algorithms running natively on the PC so

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:52.430 
algorithms running natively on the PC so
again<00:00:50.909> Audio<00:00:51.210> Weaver<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.540> MATLAB<00:00:51.900> based<00:00:52.110> so

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
again Audio Weaver is MATLAB based so

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.140 
again Audio Weaver is MATLAB based so
I'm<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.650> to<00:00:52.680> switch<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.040> MATLAB<00:00:53.220> and<00:00:53.610> run

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
I'm going to switch to MATLAB and run

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.930 
I'm going to switch to MATLAB and run
some<00:00:54.330> MATLAB<00:00:54.629> scripts<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> first<00:00:56.820> example

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
some MATLAB scripts so the first example

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.880 
some MATLAB scripts so the first example
I<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.390> running<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.869> an<00:00:58.229> automatic<00:00:58.739> gain

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
I have running is an automatic gain

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.979 
I have running is an automatic gain
control<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.850> purpose<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.299> an<00:01:00.390> automatic<00:01:00.839> gain

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
control the purpose of an automatic gain

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.109 
control the purpose of an automatic gain
control<00:01:01.019> is<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> keep<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.830> output<00:01:02.040> level<00:01:02.610> at<00:01:03.059> a

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119 
control is to keep the output level at a

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.140 
control is to keep the output level at a
fixed<00:01:03.600> desired<00:01:04.019> level<00:01:04.439> independent<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
fixed desired level independent of the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.390 
fixed desired level independent of the
level<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.540> input<00:01:06.840> signal<00:01:07.160> what<00:01:08.160> you<00:01:08.250> have

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
level of the input signal what you have

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.910 
level of the input signal what you have
here<00:01:08.550> you<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.030> input<00:01:09.330> meter<00:01:09.920> showing

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
here you have the input meter showing

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.770 
here you have the input meter showing
you<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> output<00:01:11.340> meter<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.910> then<00:01:12.630> there's

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
you the output meter and then there's

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.050 
you the output meter and then there's
also<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.020> volume<00:01:13.260> control<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.670> adjust

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
also a volume control so I can adjust

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.340 
also a volume control so I can adjust
the<00:01:15.240> volume<00:01:15.270> control<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.050> input

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the volume control so this is the input

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.260 
the volume control so this is the input
volume<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.910> I<00:01:21.030> turn<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.360> up<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:24.000> output

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
volume and as I turn this up the output

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.420 
volume and as I turn this up the output
level<00:01:24.540> stays<00:01:24.720> about<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> same<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.860> AGC<00:01:26.280> is

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
level stays about the same so the AGC is

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.580 
level stays about the same so the AGC is
kind<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.790> kicking<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.560> attenuating<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
kind of kicking in and attenuating the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.190 
kind of kicking in and attenuating the
signal<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.850> way<00:01:29.970> Audio<00:01:30.270> Weaver<00:01:30.450> works<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.990> it

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
signal the way Audio Weaver works is it

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.649 
signal the way Audio Weaver works is it
uses<00:01:31.320> dynamic<00:01:31.650> instantiation<00:01:32.550> so<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.330> PC

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
uses dynamic instantiation so the PC

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.540 
uses dynamic instantiation so the PC
connects<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.260> and<00:01:34.440> sends<00:01:34.980> down<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.159> sequence

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
connects to it and sends down a sequence

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.850 
connects to it and sends down a sequence
of<00:01:35.700> commands<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.240> create<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:37.200> volume<00:01:37.350> control

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
of commands to create the volume control

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.200 
of commands to create the volume control
the<00:01:38.010> level<00:01:38.280> meters<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.670> automatic<00:01:39.060> gain

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the level meters the automatic gain

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.120 
the level meters the automatic gain
control<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.690> so<00:01:39.810> forth<00:01:40.050> and<00:01:40.440> so<00:01:40.800> I<00:01:40.830> can<00:01:41.040> do

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
control and so forth and so I can do

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.649 
control and so forth and so I can do
this<00:01:41.250> demo<00:01:41.520> without<00:01:41.970> having<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.360> recompile

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
this demo without having to recompile

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.660 
this demo without having to recompile
the<00:01:43.020> executable<00:01:43.620> everything<00:01:44.370> happens

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the executable everything happens

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.700 
the executable everything happens
dynamically<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.870> board<00:01:46.080> communicates<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
dynamically the board communicates to

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.580 
dynamically the board communicates to
the<00:01:46.800> PC<00:01:47.159> over<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.760> USB<00:01:48.150> interface<00:01:48.510> and<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the PC over a USB interface and the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.710 
the PC over a USB interface and the
board<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.860> also<00:01:49.920> USB<00:01:50.340> bus<00:01:50.820> powered<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
board is also USB bus powered so you

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.120 
board is also USB bus powered so you
just<00:01:51.930> plug<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.620> you're<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
just plug it in and you're up and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.120 
just plug it in and you're up and
running<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:54.510> this<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.080> 10<00:01:55.320> band<00:01:55.590> graphic

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
running and this is a 10 band graphic

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.190 
running and this is a 10 band graphic
equalizer<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.790> then<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.810> interact<00:01:58.050> with

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
equalizer and then I can interact with

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.700 
equalizer and then I can interact with
it<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.500> real-time<00:01:59.270> just<00:02:00.270> by<00:02:00.500> moving<00:02:01.500> the

it in real-time just by moving the
sliders<00:02:02.040> here<00:02:02.190> so<00:02:03.150> again<00:02:03.330> everything<00:02:03.630> happens

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080
