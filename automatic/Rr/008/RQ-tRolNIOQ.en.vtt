what I don't I don't have 40 hours to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040 
what I don't I don't have 40 hours to
spend<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.670> video<00:00:53.910> game<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.480> mean<00:00:54.660> unless

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
spend on one video game I mean unless

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.410 
spend on one video game I mean unless
the<00:00:55.289> content<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> game<00:00:56.370> justifies<00:00:57.120> that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the content of the game justifies that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.569 
the content of the game justifies that
long<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.020> runtime<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.160> never<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
long of a runtime but that's never the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.760 
long of a runtime but that's never the
case<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.270> probably<00:01:00.840> isn't<00:01:01.109> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
case this probably isn't going to be a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.490 
case this probably isn't going to be a
very<00:01:02.039> popular<00:01:02.309> opinion<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.300> games<00:01:03.930> are<00:01:04.199> just

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
very popular opinion but games are just

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.980 
very popular opinion but games are just
needlessly<00:01:05.129> long<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.820> I'm<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.360> spend<00:01:06.570> 60

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
needlessly long if I'm going to spend 60

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.140 
needlessly long if I'm going to spend 60
bucks<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> game<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.159> want<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.640> much<00:01:08.790> come<00:01:09.060> on

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
bucks on the game I want as much come on

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.210 
bucks on the game I want as much come on
take<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.479> possible<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.409> that's<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.920> fair

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
take this possible and that's a fair

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.640 
take this possible and that's a fair
point<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:11.790> when<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.540> say<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:12.990> 40<00:01:13.409> plus

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
point but when they say it's 40 plus

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.950 
point but when they say it's 40 plus
hours<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.159> gameplay<00:01:14.400> that's<00:01:15.180> not<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.780> what

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
hours of gameplay that's not really what

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.630 
hours of gameplay that's not really what
you're<00:01:16.080> getting<00:01:16.110> because<00:01:16.560> these<00:01:17.040> games<00:01:17.340> are

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
you're getting because these games are

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.090 
you're getting because these games are
built<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.119> doing<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.689> same<00:01:19.020> thing<00:01:19.439> over<00:01:19.710> and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
maybe it's killing bad guys who are

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.310 
maybe it's killing bad guys who are
transporting<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.790> person<00:01:24.270> or<00:01:24.450> item<00:01:24.869> from<00:01:25.080> point

a<00:03:18.160> few<00:03:18.490> weeks<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:19.240> game<00:03:19.480> will<00:03:19.750> actually<00:03:20.320> work

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
a few weeks the game will actually work

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.560 
a few weeks the game will actually work
and<00:03:20.890> it'll<00:03:21.070> be<00:03:21.280> cheaper<00:03:21.520> which<00:03:21.940> leads<00:03:22.240> to<00:03:22.390> the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
and it'll be cheaper which leads to the

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.570 
and it'll be cheaper which leads to the
next<00:03:22.870> one<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.290> problem<00:03:23.800> was<00:03:23.980> pre-ordering

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
next one the problem was pre-ordering

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.250 
next one the problem was pre-ordering
I've<00:03:24.940> never<00:03:25.240> understood<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.870> idea<00:03:26.140> of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
I've never understood the idea of

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.290 
I've never understood the idea of
pre-ordering<00:03:26.770> video<00:03:27.100> games<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.550> mean<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.150> an

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
pre-ordering video games I mean is it an

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.260 
pre-ordering video games I mean is it an
issue<00:03:28.450> of<00:03:28.780> scarcity<00:03:29.260> no<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.520> can't<00:03:30.850> be<00:03:30.940> that

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
issue of scarcity no it can't be that

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.520 
issue of scarcity no it can't be that
because<00:03:31.630> there<00:03:31.810> are<00:03:31.870> plenty<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.290> copies

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
because there are plenty of copies

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.500 
because there are plenty of copies
available<00:03:32.710> on<00:03:33.370> day<00:03:33.550> one<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:33.850> people<00:03:34.390> who

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
didn't pre-order or if I don't pre-order

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.360

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
me it all revolves around violence still

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.540 
me it all revolves around violence still
okay<00:04:02.050> not<00:04:02.260> all<00:04:02.470> games<00:04:02.980> revolve<00:04:03.370> around

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
okay not all games revolve around

violence<00:04:04.270> but<00:04:04.480> I<00:04:04.780> think<00:04:05.110> that<00:04:05.290> we<00:04:05.440> can<00:04:05.650> all

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
violence but I think that we can all

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.740 
violence but I think that we can all
agree<00:04:06.100> that<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.490> huge<00:04:06.790> majority<00:04:07.000> of<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.510> games

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
agree that a huge majority of the games

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.990 
agree that a huge majority of the games
that<00:04:07.960> have<00:04:08.080> been<00:04:08.230> releases<00:04:08.800> the<00:04:08.950> 1980s<00:04:09.760> have

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
that have been releases the 1980s have

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.850 
that have been releases the 1980s have
included<00:04:10.570> violence<00:04:10.810> as<00:04:11.170> a<00:04:11.200> major<00:04:11.530> component

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
included violence as a major component

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.310 
included violence as a major component
oh<00:04:12.400> he's<00:04:12.970> one<00:04:13.210> of<00:04:13.240> those<00:04:13.540> people<00:04:13.930> that<00:04:14.170> thinks

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
oh he's one of those people that thinks

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.979 
oh he's one of those people that thinks
that<00:04:14.740> violent<00:04:15.220> video<00:04:15.520> games<00:04:15.880> are<00:04:16.090> bad<00:04:16.270> versus

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
that violent video games are bad versus

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.710 
that violent video games are bad versus
you<00:04:17.049> know<00:04:17.620> I'm<00:04:17.979> not<00:04:18.160> at<00:04:18.579> all<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.030> just<00:04:19.479> think

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
you know I'm not at all I just think

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.180 
you know I'm not at all I just think
that<00:04:19.840> were<00:04:19.989> 30<00:04:20.259> years<00:04:20.530> into<00:04:20.799> this<00:04:20.889> and<00:04:20.949> it's

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
that were 30 years into this and it's

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.189 
that were 30 years into this and it's
about<00:04:21.340> time<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.789> branch<00:04:22.030> out<00:04:22.270> there's<00:04:22.690> just<00:04:22.780> so

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
about time to branch out there's just so

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.499 
about time to branch out there's just so
many<00:04:23.500> amazing<00:04:24.039> things<00:04:24.280> that<00:04:24.699> games<00:04:24.970> can<00:04:25.449> be

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
many amazing things that games can be

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.540 
many amazing things that games can be
but<00:04:26.050> we're<00:04:26.229> just<00:04:26.470> stuck<00:04:26.830> shooting<00:04:27.400> and

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690

video games of the last few years don't
include<00:04:33.970> any<00:04:34.240> violence<00:04:34.720> at<00:04:34.810> all<00:04:34.960> so<00:04:35.259> we<00:04:35.440> know

see<00:04:37.690> a<00:04:37.720> triple-a<00:04:38.319> game<00:04:38.590> in<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.860> near<00:04:39.039> future

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
see a triple-a game in the near future

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.969 
see a triple-a game in the near future
where<00:04:39.729> you<00:04:39.910> don't<00:04:40.210> hurt<00:04:40.569> people<00:04:40.599> or<00:04:41.259> aliens<00:04:41.860> or

where you don't hurt people or aliens or
anything<00:04:42.280> I<00:04:42.610> just<00:04:42.669> think<00:04:43.060> that'd<00:04:43.210> be<00:04:43.330> really

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
anything I just think that'd be really

anything I just think that'd be really
cool<00:04:43.960> video<00:04:44.440> games<00:04:44.680> have<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:45.039> potential<00:04:45.490> to

cool video games have the potential to

cool video games have the potential to
do<00:04:45.910> so<00:04:46.240> many<00:04:46.479> cool<00:04:46.840> things<00:04:46.870> but<00:04:47.380> we're<00:04:47.560> just

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
do so many cool things but we're just

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.770 
do so many cool things but we're just
stuck<00:04:48.069> doing<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.580> same<00:04:48.880> things<00:04:49.270> over<00:04:49.539> and

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
stuck doing the same things over and
