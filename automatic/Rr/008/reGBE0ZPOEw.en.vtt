 there is nothing we can do what they want 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.710
 but we can not assure that they are assigned 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.660
 a girl of 11 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.919
 kennedy min 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:12.679
 The truth is that I can not do better not to try too hard 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.679
 if we are we will always follow your opposition for endangering our 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.619
 lives 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.619
 do not you think 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.179
 riosa queen 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.900
 It is a very hard 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.270
 vengeful 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.650
 his theory failed and how I am no longer the only suspect has decided 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.870
 give up 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.790
 maybe it's still to come 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.370
 I said that moving tab us first would be dangerous if we do not do 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.120
 nothing we will not catch him in life 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.920
 you realize how decent he has suffered because of this whole affair or 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.920
 of them back after having them locked up in villa min 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.190
 if something I felt main 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.560
 none 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.460
 do not 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.680
 bothers me so much about the interruption process and how he requested in his 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.090
 moment of his death with which the other two states 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.740
 that's why I'm disappointed 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.900
 is not able to understand that if something so human does not 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.960
 what you just said 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.560
 it seems that he will not be satisfied unless I ended up being her 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.940
 unless you are 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.710
 his father 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.150
 You may have 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.860
 I just disagreed 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.860
 that he wanted his tour to be 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.329
 but the fact happened 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.329
 ten days later the cake 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.179
 we have players who make it look like 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.259
 everyone 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.129

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.599
 villordo 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.480
 // the protagonist for plus 4 plus the workers 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.569
 the city and its bullshit that always 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:44.949
 the baby map
