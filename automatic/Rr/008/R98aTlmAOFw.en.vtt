00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.570
 Testing today would like to 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.750
 tell talk about one knives 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:19.980
 one famous company is our company 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.279
 The spider model is called senor 8 maps 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:32.040
 and if you get a Russian translate 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:38.550
 Harpy This knife is made from 1 1990 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:42.660
 years that is, he was in the same directory with 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.660
 the first model spider to your car with 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.190
 model with a model called 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.860
 standard which served as a prototype 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:58.289
 great as we see the hilt of the harpy 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.180
 inherited outlines one to one and 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:06.720
 dimensions and outline of the handle and walker 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:12.570
 when you standard model had the same 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.810
 the handle is something else in my opinion was but i don't 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.409
 I remember academic knowledge I'm not really 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.470
 shine 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.409
 but shorter in the catalog of the year 90 was by 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.290
 my knives are 8 of them 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.939
 walker harpy police marina 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.939
 second model spiderco 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.420
 there was also such a small model 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.810
 a small knife is a spider to 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.909
 dad here is such a small wedge above 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.890
 arms 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:50.820
 general model produced by the company very and 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:53.810
 a long time ago about how much 20 20 25 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.340
 about twenty three 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:03.080
 only knives last generation in 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.700
 to please users 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.619
 move the clip to all four sides 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.080
 I do not know for such a knife that makes sense 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.650
 I personally am not happy about it all so 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.090
 not happy about this one 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.290
 occurring everywhere pair 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.480
 slow clips that son of fools came 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.720
 Enduro here is a hole for adjustment 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.160
 axial screws well, I do not know I do not like 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.610
 I liked the old cards more 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:39.690
 I also want to pay attention to this knife 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.140
 kinda multitool why because 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.810
 it was created for the needs 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.829
 Yachtsmen Ganush Malik was created 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.160
 Mariner. That is, this is the knife that had 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:56.640
 a longer straight tail 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.480
 other and blade so what is 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.440
 multitourity multitool is 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.440
 here in this slot 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.709
 so for someone can now open 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.110
 mystery what is it really behind 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.600
 slot is not 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:20.580
 water drain hole is not 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:25.440
 cleaning hole is a simple ordinary 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:29.900
 sailors will understand the same important key under 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.300
 bracing but unfortunately with you 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.319
 not to show you what 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.190
 shackle 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.220
 it's such a sweetheart and carved 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.440
 screwed well in short survive 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.820
 bracelets used reduced 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.430
 option fastener so the names here 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.459
 this key of different sizes allows 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.350
 twist this very same as he already has with a stud 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:01.530
 will or something that's exactly him 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:05.150
 because at least we have water 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:08.610
 grab can drain from anywhere cracks 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.670
 full of what's in front of that moth 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:16.760
 the handle is completely honored to close 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:22.470
 impossible, this is an important key 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:24.800
 so now what does it all mean today 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.760
 my friends and I have gathered 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:33.169
 test this little one with 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.940
 small peck about 70 millimeters 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:39.180
 test it on a rope and compare it with 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:46.139
 the leader of past tests was video 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:50.220
 shown the leader we had on the bar from the floor 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:52.889
 episodes then we have a night so well compare 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.580
 few Syrians are almost the same 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.930
 the length is but can only be said on 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:05.810
 One big tooth big step teeth 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.810
 different and so it went 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.060
 assistant 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:20.090
 we will support the bed cut w barium to 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:24.689
 remember how it was an effort 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:28.639
 probably the guys also felt there 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.639
 Sina is 200 strong now 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:40.749
 let's say something again 

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:43.269
 let's percent easy in opening 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:47.459
 and at ease and let it feel 

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:51.939
 efforts almost no rope breaks and 

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:53.019
 breaks effectively enough kerambit 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:57.879
 blade like 

00:05:53.019 --> 00:06:02.139
 this also contributes , that is, it is not 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:05.139
 souvenir as again many consider it 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:10.089
 not such a fetish knife 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:13.209
 this is a knife that was designed by me 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:15.879
 dear whole beads for a certain 

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:19.119
 tasks for sea tasks for ropes for 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:22.869
 ropes in everyday life is also great 

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:28.449
 hiding packaging hiding some 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:30.519
 the tape is cut off but the application given 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:34.139
 knife actually a lot I potatoes 

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:37.179
 I cleaned myself quite possible that is quite 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:39.869
 the potato turns skaters up 

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:39.869
 enough 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:47.150
 so who scolds and calls the harpy 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.720
 knife only method 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:54.350
 showing can only say that everyone 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.540
 knife together any knife over the whole month 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:03.080
 we have a certain time and in a certain 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:06.370
 place you still mean no place 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.330
 no time and no such task for a knife 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.430
 what else do I want to say 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.600
 This knife has gained immense popularity. 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.600
 after the release 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.670
 book trilogy and film trilogy 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:29.270
 all known peculiar such gourmet 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:32.750

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:51.110
 what had to get by with this knife as 

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:53.090
 was shown in the film after that 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.970
 Of course I gained mega popularity 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:08:00.680
 this picture is what his grip which on 

00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:06.400
 many posters captured this became 

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:06.400
 already a classic here for this all 

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:14.970
 conclusions can be made estimates 

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:18.110
