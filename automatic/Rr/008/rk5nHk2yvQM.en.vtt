00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
break the loop of them spawning if they

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.750 
break the loop of them spawning if they
are<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.870> little<00:01:24.990> too<00:01:25.440> close<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.520> entrance

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
are a little too close to the entrance

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.969 
are a little too close to the entrance
and<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.960> when<00:01:28.200> you're<00:01:28.320> doing<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.680> farm

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and if when you're doing this farm

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.609 
and if when you're doing this farm
enemies<00:01:29.430> behind<00:01:29.910> me<00:01:30.119> will<00:01:30.300> not<00:01:30.420> spawn<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.560> you

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
enemies behind me will not spawn so you

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.140 
enemies behind me will not spawn so you
won't<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.130> worry<00:01:32.190> about<00:01:32.490> being<00:01:32.820> shot<00:01:33.119> in

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
won't have to worry about being shot in

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.410 
won't have to worry about being shot in
the<00:01:33.300> back<00:01:33.479> by<00:01:33.510> a<00:01:33.720> vandal<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:36.060> see<00:01:36.210> how

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the back by a vandal and you see how

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.540 
the back by a vandal and you see how
quickly<00:01:37.050> they<00:01:37.260> spawn<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:37.830> just<00:01:38.190> like<00:01:38.310> that

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
quickly they spawn it's just like that

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.060 
quickly they spawn it's just like that
so<00:01:41.840> it's<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.930> pretty<00:01:43.080> good<00:01:43.350> alternate<00:01:43.800> to<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
so it's a pretty good alternate to the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.060 
so it's a pretty good alternate to the
other<00:01:44.220> loot<00:01:44.460> cave<00:01:44.640> because<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.420> it's<00:01:46.070> much

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
other loot cave because one it's much

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
other loot cave because one it's much
shorter<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.790> get<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:49.400> it<00:01:50.400> might<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:50.910> hard

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
shorter to get to and it might be hard

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.430 
shorter to get to and it might be hard
to<00:01:51.150> kill<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> enemies<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
to kill the enemies but if you have a

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.600 
to kill the enemies but if you have a
team<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> lot<00:01:53.550> easier

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
team it's going to be a lot easier

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.080 
team it's going to be a lot easier
obviously<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.750> i<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:55.950> bungees<00:01:56.880> gonna

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
obviously and i think bungees gonna

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.960 
obviously and i think bungees gonna
patch<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.990> other<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.730> here's<00:01:59.730> just<00:01:59.909> a
