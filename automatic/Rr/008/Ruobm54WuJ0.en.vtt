I'm just giving a demonstration and then

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.750 
I'm just giving a demonstration and then
after<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.780> once<00:02:19.200> you've<00:02:19.530> once<00:02:20.430> you've<00:02:20.580> said

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
start searching and when he comes up

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.250 
start searching and when he comes up
issued<00:02:56.730> by<00:02:56.879> him<00:02:57.030> straight<00:02:57.239> away<00:02:59.599> so<00:03:00.599> yeah<00:03:00.750> this

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
issued by him straight away so yeah this

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.130 
issued by him straight away so yeah this
is<00:03:01.410> just<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.650> demonstration<00:03:01.769> on<00:03:02.310> how<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.579> works

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
is just a demonstration on how it works

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.500 
is just a demonstration on how it works
this<00:03:04.140> would<00:03:04.349> like<00:03:04.799> usually<00:03:05.220> should<00:03:05.640> take<00:03:06.359> like

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
this would like usually should take like

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.240 
this would like usually should take like
around<00:03:06.750> two<00:03:06.900> minutes<00:03:07.109> per<00:03:07.200> now<00:03:07.410> actually<00:03:07.980> the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
around two minutes per now actually the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.280 
around two minutes per now actually the
recording<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.299> actually<00:03:09.690> slowing<00:03:09.900> down<00:03:10.109> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
recording is actually slowing down the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.960 
recording is actually slowing down the
software<00:03:10.650> I'm<00:03:10.769> using<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:11.160> record<00:03:11.310> my<00:03:11.579> computer

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
software I'm using to record my computer

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.259 
software I'm using to record my computer
which<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:12.720> slowing<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.319> down<00:03:13.349> so<00:03:13.739> yeah<00:03:14.280> but<00:03:14.670> it

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
which is slowing it down so yeah but it

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.640 
which is slowing it down so yeah but it
should<00:03:15.419> you<00:03:15.750> should<00:03:15.780> take<00:03:16.049> like<00:03:16.230> maybe<00:03:16.530> 10

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
should you should take like maybe 10

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.990 
should you should take like maybe 10
minutes<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.040> would<00:03:17.130> find<00:03:17.340> him<00:03:17.519> maximum

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
minutes and you would find him maximum

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.879 
minutes and you would find him maximum
for<00:03:18.780> 10,000<00:03:19.169> much<00:03:19.349> you're<00:03:19.500> going<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.650> go<00:03:19.769> for

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
for 10,000 much you're going to go for

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.379 
for 10,000 much you're going to go for
5,000<00:03:20.400> then<00:03:20.519> it's<00:03:20.639> going<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.819> take<00:03:20.970> much<00:03:21.150> numb

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
5,000 then it's going to take much numb

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.879 
5,000 then it's going to take much numb
along<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.380> time<00:03:22.560> than<00:03:22.739> that<00:03:22.769> so<00:03:23.669> yeah<00:03:24.889> that's

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
along the time than that so yeah that's

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.970 
along the time than that so yeah that's
about<00:03:26.069> it<00:03:26.220> really<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.019> press<00:03:28.260> f8<00:03:28.620> to

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
about it really and you just press f8 to

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.110 
about it really and you just press f8 to
pause<00:03:29.669> it<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.000> expose<00:03:30.959> them<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.970> restart<00:03:32.970> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
pause it and expose them to restart the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.479 
pause it and expose them to restart the
restart<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.109> program<00:03:34.200> but<00:03:34.500> like<00:03:34.680> unpause<00:03:35.459> it

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
restart the program but like unpause it
