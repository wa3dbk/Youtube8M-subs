have this lined up pretty well I

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.670 
have this lined up pretty well I
recommend<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> full<00:01:12.659> screen<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.409> for

recommend you a full screen for it for

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.620 
recommend you a full screen for it for
ATP<00:01:13.950> or<00:01:14.100> something<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.880> want<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.390> see

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
ATP or something you want to really see

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.039 
ATP or something you want to really see
this<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:16.409> want<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.619> line<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:18.060> pen

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
this you want to line it up with the pen

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.800 
this you want to line it up with the pen
and<00:01:19.350> now<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> idea<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> push<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.670> out<00:01:20.820> so

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and now the idea is to push it out so

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.210 
and now the idea is to push it out so
you're<00:01:22.170> going<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.320> kind<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.619> feel<00:01:22.830> some

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
you're going to kind of feel some

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.929 
you're going to kind of feel some
resistance<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:24.060> while<00:01:24.960> you're<00:01:25.110> turning

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
resistance here while you're turning

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.800 
resistance here while you're turning
especially<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.240> more<00:01:27.509> expensive

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
especially if you have a more expensive

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.120 
especially if you have a more expensive
chain<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.360> while<00:01:31.049> you're<00:01:31.200> turning<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.740> starts

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
chain so while you're turning it starts

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.190 
chain so while you're turning it starts
to<00:01:32.280> come<00:01:32.460> out<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.540> notice<00:01:33.810> there<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.049> see

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
to come out as you notice there you see

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.190 
to come out as you notice there you see
that<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.890> then<00:01:38.130> some<00:01:38.310> more<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:39.540> want<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.810> keep

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
that and then some more you want to keep

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.929 
that and then some more you want to keep
going<00:01:40.409> until<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.799> start<00:01:41.130> feeling<00:01:41.280> resistance

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
going until you start feeling resistance

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.840 
going until you start feeling resistance
again<00:01:42.740> let's<00:01:43.740> keep<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.220> don't<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.329> worried

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
again let's keep going don't be worried

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.100 
again let's keep going don't be worried
all<00:01:47.850> right<00:01:48.000> since<00:01:48.360> now<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:48.659> feeling<00:01:48.810> more

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
all right since now I'm feeling more

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.050 
all right since now I'm feeling more
resistance<00:01:49.710> again<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.579> when<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.820> want<00:01:51.000> to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
resistance again that's when you want to

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.969 
resistance again that's when you want to
stop<00:01:51.270> because<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.259> mushroom<00:01:52.799> heads

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
stop because then the mushroom heads

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.749 
stop because then the mushroom heads
coming<00:01:53.250> close<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:55.100> that's<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.490> want

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
coming close to this that's if you want

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.660 
coming close to this that's if you want
to<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.750> extend<00:01:58.380> your<00:01:58.530> chain<00:01:58.829> by<00:01:59.159> adding<00:01:59.520> more

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
to like extend your chain by adding more

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.109 
to like extend your chain by adding more
chain<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.380> want<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.770> use<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
chain to it but if you want to use a

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.179 
chain to it but if you want to use a
masterly<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.899> take<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.079> whole<00:02:04.259> pin

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
masterly you can just take the whole pin

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.889 
masterly you can just take the whole pin
out<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.880> put<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> master<00:02:06.600> link<00:02:06.750> where

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
out and just put the master link where

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.229 
out and just put the master link where
the<00:02:06.990> pin<00:02:07.170> was<00:02:09.050> so<00:02:10.050> yeah<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.819> take<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
the pin was so yeah you just take the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.650 
the pin was so yeah you just take the
whole<00:02:12.270> master<00:02:12.690> link

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
whole master link

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.310 
whole master link
out<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.530> there<00:02:15.240> but<00:02:16.240> since<00:02:16.480> now<00:02:16.810> I'm<00:02:17.110> going<00:02:17.260> to

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
out of there but since now I'm going to

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.100 
out of there but since now I'm going to
show<00:02:17.470> you<00:02:17.530> first<00:02:17.860> how<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.720> because<00:02:19.720> I'm<00:02:19.840> put

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
show you first how to because I'm put

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.570 
show you first how to because I'm put
this<00:02:20.140> chain<00:02:20.500> back<00:02:20.710> together<00:02:21.010> this<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.550> a

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
this chain back together this is a

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.280 
this chain back together this is a
really<00:02:21.910> short<00:02:22.090> cheap<00:02:22.450> chain<00:02:22.780> like<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.140> was

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
really short cheap chain like it was

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.100 
really short cheap chain like it was
just<00:02:23.470> like<00:02:23.710> scrap<00:02:24.400> chain<00:02:24.760> yeah<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.480> got<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> much

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
just like scrap chain yeah I got a much

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.260 
just like scrap chain yeah I got a much
more<00:02:26.380> expensive<00:02:26.710> chain<00:02:27.160> this<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:27.940> on<00:02:28.180> my

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
more expensive chain this and this on my

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.200 
more expensive chain this and this on my
BMX<00:02:28.630> bike<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.530> white<00:02:29.740> too<00:02:30.070> so<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.430> have<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.060> use

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
BMX bike it's white too so I have to use

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.140 
BMX bike it's white too so I have to use
this<00:02:31.420> not<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.780> scratch<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.200> paint<00:02:32.380> um<00:02:33.150> since

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
this not to scratch the paint um since

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.660 
this not to scratch the paint um since
now<00:02:34.330> I'm<00:02:34.390> feeling<00:02:34.630> some<00:02:35.530> resistance<00:02:35.980> I'm

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
now I'm feeling some resistance I'm

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.620 
now I'm feeling some resistance I'm
going<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.880> kind<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.120> back<00:02:37.300> off<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.690> chain<00:02:37.930> tool

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
going to kind of back off the chain tool

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.390 
going to kind of back off the chain tool
all<00:02:40.630> right<00:02:40.810> back<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.290> up<00:02:41.410> now<00:02:42.130> I'm<00:02:42.220> going<00:02:42.310> to

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
all right back it up now I'm going to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.100 
all right back it up now I'm going to
take<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.640> chain<00:02:42.880> out<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:45.960> you're<00:02:46.960> gonna

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
take the chain out and you're gonna

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.860 
take the chain out and you're gonna
wiggle<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.070> out<00:02:49.050> until<00:02:50.050> you<00:02:50.110> find<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:51.870> so

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
wiggle it out until you find this so

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.490 
wiggle it out until you find this so
here<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.980> could<00:02:54.160> add<00:02:54.730> your<00:02:55.210> extension<00:02:55.840> or<00:02:56.020> you

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
here you could add your extension or you

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.060 
here you could add your extension or you
can<00:02:56.650> hear<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.340> can<00:02:57.460> also<00:02:57.610> put<00:02:58.090> your<00:02:59.070> master

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
can hear you can also put your master

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.260 
can hear you can also put your master
link<00:03:00.250> on<00:03:00.460> there<00:03:00.760> for<00:03:01.570> BMX<00:03:01.960> bikes<00:03:02.260> around<00:03:02.560> bikes

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
link on there for BMX bikes around bikes

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.950 
link on there for BMX bikes around bikes
that<00:03:04.270> have<00:03:04.330> master<00:03:04.930> links<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.440> stuff<00:03:05.680> uh<00:03:06.960> and

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
that have master links and stuff uh and

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.440 
that have master links and stuff uh and
then<00:03:08.800> if<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.130> want<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.400> put<00:03:09.580> it<00:03:09.670> back<00:03:09.850> on<00:03:10.060> its

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
then if you want to put it back on its

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.570 
then if you want to put it back on its
kind<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.780> reverse<00:03:10.960> frog<00:03:11.530> process<00:03:12.280> you

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
kind of the reverse frog process you

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.780 
kind of the reverse frog process you
kind<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.880> have<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.750> push<00:03:14.170> this<00:03:14.440> in<00:03:14.650> here<00:03:14.980> this

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
kind of have to push this in here this

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.280 
kind of have to push this in here this
is<00:03:15.970> kind<00:03:16.210> of<00:03:16.240> hard<00:03:16.390> because<00:03:16.480> if<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.780> has<00:03:17.140> to

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
is kind of hard because if that has to

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.500 
is kind of hard because if that has to
be<00:03:17.350> lined<00:03:17.650> up<00:03:17.800> so<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.459> goes<00:03:18.670> in<00:03:18.910> straight<00:03:19.330> if

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
be lined up so it goes in straight if

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.570 
be lined up so it goes in straight if
you<00:03:19.630> feel<00:03:19.840> too<00:03:20.320> much<00:03:20.560> resistance<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.400> it's

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
you feel too much resistance that it's

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.120 
you feel too much resistance that it's
not<00:03:21.760> lighten<00:03:22.240> up<00:03:22.300> correctly<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.020> put<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:24.010> in

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
not lighten up correctly and put it in

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.550 
not lighten up correctly and put it in
backwards<00:03:24.550> put<00:03:25.240> the<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:26.020> know<00:03:26.110> show<00:03:26.320> you<00:03:26.380> guys

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
backwards put the you know show you guys

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.320 
backwards put the you know show you guys
after<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:26.980> put<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.280> in<00:03:29.430> yeah<00:03:30.430> this<00:03:30.640> is<00:03:30.790> it's<00:03:31.060> much

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
after I put it in yeah this is it's much

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.540 
after I put it in yeah this is it's much
harder<00:03:31.570> than<00:03:31.930> taking<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.890> chain<00:03:33.160> apart

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
harder than taking the chain apart

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.030 
harder than taking the chain apart
because<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:35.440> have<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.709> have<00:03:35.830> everything

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
because you have to have everything

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.670 
because you have to have everything
lined<00:03:36.580> up<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.450> if<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:37.720> don't<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.200> kinda

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
lined up and if you don't it kinda

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.340 
lined up and if you don't it kinda
doesn't<00:03:38.860> work<00:03:39.570> so<00:03:40.570> I'm<00:03:40.660> going<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.870> line<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.110> up

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
doesn't work so I'm going to line it up

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.699 
doesn't work so I'm going to line it up
right<00:03:41.620> now<00:03:44.940> alright<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:47.020> want<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.290> pull

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
right now alright so you want to pull

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.949 
right now alright so you want to pull
move<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.280> pin<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.820> pushes<00:03:49.209> and<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.720> want<00:03:49.900> to

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
move the pin the pushes and you want to

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.020 
move the pin the pushes and you want to
put<00:03:50.110> it<00:03:50.200> in<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.410> opposite<00:03:50.770> way<00:03:50.830> and<00:03:51.250> then<00:03:51.940> you

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
put it in the opposite way and then you

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.370 
put it in the opposite way and then you
want<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.300> start<00:03:52.510> turning<00:03:54.420> see<00:03:55.420> how<00:03:55.630> my<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.200> pin

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
want to start turning see how my the pin

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.979 
want to start turning see how my the pin
in<00:03:56.500> there<00:03:56.650> hit<00:03:56.920> that<00:03:57.270> all<00:03:58.270> right<00:03:58.450> now<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.720> want

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
in there hit that all right now I want

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.690 
in there hit that all right now I want
to<00:03:59.050> make<00:03:59.230> sure<00:03:59.260> it's<00:03:59.560> lined<00:03:59.770> up<00:03:59.980> but<00:04:00.340> it's<00:04:00.489> not

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
to make sure it's lined up but it's not

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.490 
to make sure it's lined up but it's not
so<00:04:01.000> I'm<00:04:01.120> going<00:04:01.270> to<00:04:01.330> push<00:04:01.600> it<00:04:01.810> like<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.320> back

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
so I'm going to push it like the back

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.850 
so I'm going to push it like the back
one<00:04:02.770> lined<00:04:03.520> up<00:04:03.790> like<00:04:04.209> straight<00:04:04.690> so<00:04:05.680> when<00:04:05.830> I

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
one lined up like straight so when I

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.640 
one lined up like straight so when I
push<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:06.250> in<00:04:06.400> there<00:04:06.430> it's<00:04:07.150> all<00:04:07.810> straight<00:04:08.170> since

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
push it in there it's all straight since

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.130 
push it in there it's all straight since
it's<00:04:08.890> going<00:04:09.220> in<00:04:09.340> pretty<00:04:09.640> easily<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:10.360> believe<00:04:10.989> it

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
it's going in pretty easily I believe it

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.440 
it's going in pretty easily I believe it
is<00:04:11.170> lined<00:04:11.500> up<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:12.000> now<00:04:13.000> I'm<00:04:13.120> just<00:04:13.180> going<00:04:13.330> to

is lined up and now I'm just going to

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.030 
is lined up and now I'm just going to
keep<00:04:13.980> pushing<00:04:14.980> that<00:04:15.310> in<00:04:16.260> like<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.560> opposite

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
keep pushing that in like the opposite

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:26.040 
keep pushing that in like the opposite
way<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:23.850> just<00:04:24.850> keep<00:04:25.060> you<00:04:25.180> own<00:04:25.300> all<00:04:25.780> right<00:04:25.930> now

way and just keep you own all right now
when<00:04:26.289> the<00:04:26.410> pin<00:04:26.620> hits<00:04:27.030> this<00:04:28.030> side<00:04:28.419> see<00:04:28.810> how

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
when the pin hits this side see how

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.450 
when the pin hits this side see how
there's<00:04:29.080> a<00:04:29.140> pin<00:04:29.410> in<00:04:29.530> there<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:30.130> want<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.370> make

there's a pin in there you want to make

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.100 
there's a pin in there you want to make
sure<00:04:30.520> it's<00:04:30.760> lined<00:04:30.970> up<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.360> then<00:04:31.419> you're<00:04:31.990> going

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
to feel if some resistance just keep

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.650 
to feel if some resistance just keep
going<00:04:35.669> alright<00:04:36.669> since<00:04:36.970> all<00:04:37.270> right<00:04:37.419> now<00:04:37.600> you

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
a master link there's no need to do this

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.610 
a master link there's no need to do this
because<00:04:54.820> it<00:04:55.120> will<00:04:55.270> not<00:04:55.450> be<00:04:55.690> tight<00:04:55.960> but<00:04:56.140> if<00:04:56.470> you

like<00:05:05.050> this<00:05:05.350> to<00:05:05.530> your<00:05:05.650> chain<00:05:05.919> like<00:05:06.850> just

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
like this to your chain like just

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.060 
like this to your chain like just
flexing<00:05:07.900> it<00:05:08.020> in<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.200> wrong<00:05:08.380> direction<00:05:08.620> not

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
flexing it in the wrong direction not

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.990 
flexing it in the wrong direction not
like<00:05:09.280> this<00:05:09.490> but<00:05:09.970> like<00:05:10.030> this<00:05:12.780> like<00:05:13.780> that<00:05:13.810> and

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
like this but like this like that and

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.120 
like this but like this like that and
then<00:05:16.000> went<00:05:16.660> after<00:05:17.140> a<00:05:17.169> couple<00:05:17.470> times<00:05:17.800> like<00:05:18.010> I

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
then went after a couple times like I

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.550 
then went after a couple times like I
did<00:05:18.370> check<00:05:19.270> your<00:05:19.419> chain<00:05:19.720> up<00:05:19.900> it<00:05:20.110> should<00:05:20.260> be

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
did check your chain up it should be

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.740 
did check your chain up it should be
much<00:05:20.770> much<00:05:21.130> looser<00:05:21.669> than<00:05:21.700> what<00:05:22.000> it<00:05:22.090> was<00:05:22.120> you

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
much much looser than what it was you

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.409 
much much looser than what it was you
can<00:05:22.900> just<00:05:23.020> keep<00:05:23.169> doing<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:23.590> and<00:05:24.000> after<00:05:25.000> time

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
can just keep doing that and after time

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.880 
can just keep doing that and after time
it<00:05:25.600> will<00:05:25.690> also<00:05:25.780> lose<00:05:26.020> up<00:05:26.260> but<00:05:26.500> now<00:05:26.620> it<00:05:26.770> actually

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
it will also lose up but now it actually

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.190 
it will also lose up but now it actually
feels<00:05:27.220> like<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.610> other<00:05:27.789> it<00:05:27.910> leaks<00:05:28.090> and<00:05:28.419> that

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
feels like the other it leaks and that

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.900 
feels like the other it leaks and that
is<00:05:29.380> how<00:05:29.760> you<00:05:30.760> use<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:31.690> chain<00:05:31.930> tool<00:05:32.169> to

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
dismantle chains and put them back
