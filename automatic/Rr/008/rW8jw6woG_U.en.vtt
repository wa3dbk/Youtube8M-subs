00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
extra length really does make a

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.200

forward and cut yourself but other than
that<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.560> mean<00:02:33.770> this<00:02:34.010> really<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.370> an<00:02:34.520> amazing

knife<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.210> know<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.510> Jason<00:02:35.660> actually<00:02:36.080> did

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
knife I know that Jason actually did

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.020 
knife I know that Jason actually did
make<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.530> newer<00:02:36.770> version<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.460> with<00:02:37.790> those

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
make a newer version of this with those

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.080 
make a newer version of this with those
improvements<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:39.260> I'm<00:02:40.250> not<00:02:40.460> sure<00:02:40.760> I'm<00:02:41.060> not

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
improvements so I'm not sure I'm not

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.150 
improvements so I'm not sure I'm not
100%<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.320> don't<00:02:42.530> want<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.830> quote<00:02:43.010> me<00:02:43.130> on

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
100% and I don't want you to quote me on

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.220 
100% and I don't want you to quote me on
this<00:02:43.280> but<00:02:43.850> I<00:02:43.910> think<00:02:44.330> he<00:02:44.450> is<00:02:44.630> going<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.900> be<00:02:45.020> doing

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
this but I think he is going to be doing

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.080 
this but I think he is going to be doing
a<00:02:45.320> production<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.460> jimping<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.030> the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
a production with the jimping and the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.850 
a production with the jimping and the
finger<00:02:47.330> guard<00:02:47.510> but<00:02:48.200> like<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.440> said<00:02:48.650> I'm<00:02:48.740> not

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
finger guard but like I said I'm not

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.950 
finger guard but like I said I'm not
100%<00:02:49.190> sure<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.300> guess<00:02:50.600> that's<00:02:50.780> something

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
100% sure so I guess that's something

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.570 
100% sure so I guess that's something
that<00:02:51.140> you'll<00:02:51.260> have<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.440> ask<00:02:51.530> Jason<00:02:52.100> if<00:02:52.340> and

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
that you'll have to ask Jason if and

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.430 
that you'll have to ask Jason if and
when<00:02:52.730> he's<00:02:52.880> going<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.090> be<00:02:53.150> doing<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.600> so<00:02:54.140> I

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
when he's going to be doing that so I

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.140 
when he's going to be doing that so I
know<00:02:54.680> for<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.130> fact<00:02:55.190> like<00:02:55.520> I<00:02:55.550> said<00:02:55.790> though<00:02:55.910> that

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
know for a fact like I said though that

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.850 
know for a fact like I said though that
he<00:02:56.570> actually<00:02:56.750> did<00:02:57.080> make<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.290> couple<00:02:57.500> like<00:02:57.830> that

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
he actually did make a couple like that

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.590 
he actually did make a couple like that
because<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.430> saw<00:02:58.610> them<00:02:58.850> was<00:02:59.060> working<00:02:59.300> in<00:02:59.510> his

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
because I saw them was working in his

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.050 
because I saw them was working in his
booth<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.900> blade<00:03:00.140> show<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.700> really<00:03:01.940> does

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
booth a blade show so and it really does

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.580 
booth a blade show so and it really does
make<00:03:02.240> a<00:03:02.300> huge<00:03:02.540> difference<00:03:02.990> just<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.380> a

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
make a huge difference just that a

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.990 
make a huge difference just that a
little<00:03:03.890> bit<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.100> jumping<00:03:04.490> in<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.760> finger

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
little bit of jumping in the finger

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.730 
little bit of jumping in the finger
guard<00:03:05.150> it<00:03:05.300> makes<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.510> huge<00:03:05.660> difference<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:06.710> I

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
guard it makes a huge difference so I

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.780 
guard it makes a huge difference so I
hope<00:03:06.980> he<00:03:07.010> is<00:03:07.190> going<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.400> be<00:03:07.520> doing<00:03:07.640> a

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
the most deals but I personally I

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.390

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.730 
haven't had any issues I think it holds
an<00:04:25.460> edge<00:04:25.580> very<00:04:25.640> well<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.750> that's<00:04:27.230> just<00:04:27.410> my

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
an edge very well so that's just my

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.050 
an edge very well so that's just my
experience<00:04:27.860> with<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.520> don't<00:04:28.670> know<00:04:28.820> maybe

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
experience with it I don't know maybe

you guys have had a different experience

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.440 
you guys have had a different experience
with<00:04:30.980> it<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.190> if<00:04:31.280> you<00:04:31.370> have<00:04:31.520> please<00:04:31.760> share

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
with it and if you have please share

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.900 
with it and if you have please share
that<00:04:32.480> with<00:04:32.810> me<00:04:32.990> but<00:04:33.320> um<00:04:34.160> let's<00:04:34.490> see<00:04:34.640> what<00:04:34.790> else

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
that with me but um let's see what else

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.480 
that with me but um let's see what else
I<00:04:35.360> think<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.140> it's<00:04:36.380> pretty<00:04:36.650> much<00:04:36.770> it<00:04:36.980> has<00:04:37.250> a<00:04:37.280> V

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
I think that it's pretty much it has a V

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.780 
I think that it's pretty much it has a V
grind<00:04:37.850> and<00:04:38.950> like<00:04:39.950> I<00:04:40.040> said<00:04:40.190> this<00:04:40.340> is<00:04:40.490> obviously

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
grind and like I said this is obviously

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.850 
grind and like I said this is obviously
the<00:04:40.910> seven<00:04:41.240> version<00:04:41.690> I<00:04:41.960> think<00:04:42.500> that's<00:04:42.770> pretty
