when<00:00:06.020> I<00:00:06.049> first<00:00:06.230> started<00:00:06.529> writing<00:00:06.710> about<00:00:07.009> 30

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:07.399 
when I first started writing about 30

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.850 
when I first started writing about 30
years<00:00:07.580> ago<00:00:07.970> or<00:00:08.240> even<00:00:08.299> longer<00:00:08.719> than<00:00:08.840> that<00:00:08.990> and<00:00:09.379> I

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
years ago or even longer than that and I

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.140 
years ago or even longer than that and I
went<00:00:09.950> out<00:00:10.070> with<00:00:10.219> a<00:00:10.250> group<00:00:10.370> of<00:00:10.520> cyclists<00:00:11.000> I

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
went out with a group of cyclists I

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.670 
went out with a group of cyclists I
noticed<00:00:11.480> there<00:00:11.600> was<00:00:11.750> quite<00:00:11.930> a<00:00:11.959> contrast<00:00:12.559> in

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
noticed there was quite a contrast in

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.320 
noticed there was quite a contrast in
writing<00:00:13.010> styles<00:00:13.400> particularly<00:00:13.910> when<00:00:14.029> we<00:00:14.150> went

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
writing styles particularly when we went

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.450 
writing styles particularly when we went
to<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:14.539> hills<00:00:14.750> some<00:00:15.590> would<00:00:15.740> stay<00:00:15.920> seated<00:00:16.219> to

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
to the hills some would stay seated to

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.859 
to the hills some would stay seated to
some<00:00:16.640> stand<00:00:17.000> and<00:00:17.270> some<00:00:17.570> would<00:00:17.690> use<00:00:17.840> a

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
some stand and some would use a

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.080 
some stand and some would use a
combination<00:00:18.260> of<00:00:18.619> the<00:00:18.740> two<00:00:18.949> the<00:00:19.609> problem<00:00:19.970> with

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
combination of the two the problem with

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.030 
combination of the two the problem with
staying<00:00:20.270> seated<00:00:20.600> is<00:00:20.870> that<00:00:21.140> it<00:00:21.350> has<00:00:21.500> a<00:00:21.530> tendency

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
staying seated is that it has a tendency

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.770 
staying seated is that it has a tendency
to<00:00:22.160> really<00:00:22.460> load<00:00:22.730> your<00:00:22.940> glute<00:00:23.210> in<00:00:23.360> your<00:00:23.480> backs

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:23.780 
to really load your glute in your backs

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.360 
to really load your glute in your backs
and<00:00:24.170> it<00:00:24.289> doesn't<00:00:24.560> change<00:00:24.770> that<00:00:25.039> muscle

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:25.370 
and it doesn't change that muscle

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.180 
and it doesn't change that muscle

recruitment as a triathlete I found that

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.590 
recruitment as a triathlete I found that
if<00:00:28.460> you<00:00:28.640> can<00:00:28.789> come<00:00:29.000> in<00:00:29.030> and<00:00:29.330> out<00:00:29.390> of<00:00:29.510> your

if you can come in and out of your
saddle<00:00:29.960> it's<00:00:30.560> advantageous<00:00:30.920> a<00:00:31.310> number<00:00:31.580> of

saddle it's advantageous a number of
ways<00:00:31.789> it<00:00:32.000> eliminates<00:00:32.419> that<00:00:32.509> load<00:00:32.899> in<00:00:33.140> your

I<00:00:39.289> found<00:00:40.100> when<00:00:40.219> I<00:00:40.280> was<00:00:40.399> doing<00:00:40.519> the<00:00:40.699> Hawaii

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
I found when I was doing the Hawaii

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.880 
I found when I was doing the Hawaii
Ironman<00:00:41.149> early<00:00:41.629> on<00:00:41.780> that<00:00:42.319> even<00:00:42.559> when<00:00:42.679> I<00:00:42.739> would

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
Ironman early on that even when I would

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.380 
Ironman early on that even when I would
get<00:00:42.979> to<00:00:43.069> the<00:00:43.159> rolling<00:00:43.550> hills<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:44.059> trying<00:00:44.300> to

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
get to the rolling hills and trying to

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.899 
get to the rolling hills and trying to
maintain<00:00:44.539> my<00:00:44.809> speed<00:00:45.319> if<00:00:45.530> I'd<00:00:45.979> stand<00:00:46.249> up<00:00:46.489> for<00:00:46.670> 10

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
maintain my speed if I'd stand up for 10

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:48.910 
maintain my speed if I'd stand up for 10
to<00:00:47.059> 15<00:00:47.179> pedal<00:00:47.749> strokes<00:00:48.050> again<00:00:48.469> that<00:00:48.829> would

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
to 15 pedal strokes again that would

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.919 
to 15 pedal strokes again that would
alleviate<00:00:49.129> that<00:00:49.399> huge<00:00:49.909> load<00:00:50.210> there<00:00:50.780> really

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929

the backside of the hill I've been in so

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.020 
the backside of the hill I've been in so
many<00:01:24.079> races<00:01:24.619> where<00:01:24.799> people<00:01:25.130> are<00:01:25.369> trying<00:01:25.939> to

I'm time traveling to be down in my Aero
bars<00:02:54.520> there's<00:02:55.520> a<00:02:55.610> great<00:02:55.880> little<00:02:56.000> drill<00:02:56.390> that

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
bars there's a great little drill that

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.480 
bars there's a great little drill that
you<00:02:56.630> can<00:02:56.720> use<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.470> smooth<00:02:57.800> out<00:02:57.980> your<00:02:58.040> pedal

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
you can use to smooth out your pedal

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.670 
you can use to smooth out your pedal
stroke<00:02:58.520> when<00:02:59.120> you're<00:02:59.270> on<00:02:59.390> gradual<00:03:00.050> grades<00:03:00.440> or

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
stroke when you're on gradual grades or

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.290 
stroke when you're on gradual grades or
even<00:03:01.070> going<00:03:01.250> into<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.520> wind<00:03:01.850> which<00:03:02.000> seems

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
even going into the wind which seems

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.270 
even going into the wind which seems
like<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.570> hill<00:03:02.960> and<00:03:03.200> it's<00:03:03.650> called<00:03:03.860> perfect

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
like a hill and it's called perfect

the<00:03:07.370> way<00:03:07.520> that<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:07.910> introduce<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.630> drill<00:03:08.930> is

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
the way that you introduce this drill is

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.860 
the way that you introduce this drill is
to<00:03:09.140> think<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.560> six<00:03:10.160> perfect<00:03:10.580> revolutions<00:03:11.450> with

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
to think of six perfect revolutions with

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.270 
to think of six perfect revolutions with
your<00:03:12.080> right<00:03:12.320> leg<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.890> when<00:03:13.040> you're<00:03:13.130> thinking

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
your right leg and when you're thinking

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.070 
your right leg and when you're thinking
of<00:03:13.490> perfect<00:03:13.790> revolutions<00:03:14.390> apply<00:03:15.020> the

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
of perfect revolutions apply the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.600 
of perfect revolutions apply the
pressure<00:03:15.470> with<00:03:15.710> the<00:03:15.830> ball<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.250> your<00:03:16.400> foot

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
pressure with the ball of your foot

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.550 
pressure with the ball of your foot
don't<00:03:16.910> bring<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.360> your<00:03:17.480> big<00:03:17.690> toe<00:03:17.960> or<00:03:17.990> your<00:03:18.170> toes

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
don't bring in your big toe or your toes

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.340 
don't bring in your big toe or your toes
at<00:03:18.860> three<00:03:19.460> o'clock<00:03:19.700> push<00:03:20.480> as<00:03:20.720> though<00:03:20.960> the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
at three o'clock push as though the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.230 
at three o'clock push as though the
pedal<00:03:21.740> stroke<00:03:22.010> is<00:03:22.190> more<00:03:22.400> elliptical<00:03:22.700> like<00:03:23.120> it

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
pedal stroke is more elliptical like it

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.030 
pedal stroke is more elliptical like it
looks<00:03:23.360> like<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.510> watermelon<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:24.709> push

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
looks like a watermelon so you push

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.520 
looks like a watermelon so you push

4 4 3 3 all the way down to one one and
as<00:03:42.170> you<00:03:42.320> get<00:03:42.470> better<00:03:42.709> when<00:03:42.860> you're<00:03:42.980> doing<00:03:43.220> this

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
as you get better when you're doing this

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.300 
as you get better when you're doing this
you'll<00:03:43.490> be<00:03:43.580> able<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.820> go<00:03:43.880> 1<00:03:44.209> 1<00:03:44.570> 2<00:03:44.990> 2<00:03:45.020> 1<00:03:45.620> 1<00:03:46.040> 2<00:03:46.280> 2

you'll be able to go 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2
obviously<00:03:47.180> it's<00:03:47.330> very<00:03:47.360> repetitive<00:03:47.900> but

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
obviously it's very repetitive but

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.199 
obviously it's very repetitive but
you'll<00:03:48.470> find<00:03:48.680> that<00:03:48.860> repeating<00:03:49.850> that<00:03:49.940> pattern

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
you'll find that repeating that pattern

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.090 
you'll find that repeating that pattern
over<00:03:50.630> again<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.410> won't<00:03:51.590> feel<00:03:51.830> as<00:03:51.980> though

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
over again you won't feel as though

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.860 
over again you won't feel as though
you're<00:03:52.280> mashing<00:03:52.640> your<00:03:52.940> pedal<00:03:53.300> stroke<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.780> I

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
you're mashing your pedal stroke and I

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.630 
you're mashing your pedal stroke and I
see<00:03:54.110> this<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.320> lot<00:03:54.530> where<00:03:54.680> people's<00:03:54.950> weight<00:03:55.490> is
