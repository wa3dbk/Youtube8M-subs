forget<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.469> mentioned<00:00:55.800> earlier<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.280> is

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
forget as I mentioned earlier this is

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.130 
forget as I mentioned earlier this is
still<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.699> beta<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:57.570> are<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> few<00:00:57.809> little

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
still in beta so there are a few little

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.630 
still in beta so there are a few little
performance<00:00:58.559> hiccups<00:00:58.949> now<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.309> then<00:00:59.430> which

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
performance hiccups now and then which

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.340 
performance hiccups now and then which
I'm<00:00:59.850> sure<00:01:00.030> will<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.300> ironed<00:01:00.719> out<00:01:00.809> over<00:01:01.140> time

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
I'm sure will be ironed out over time

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.439 
I'm sure will be ironed out over time
but<00:01:01.859> overall<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.399> relatively<00:01:02.850> smooth<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
but overall it's relatively smooth and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.000 
but overall it's relatively smooth and
good<00:01:03.660> quality<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.619> see<00:01:04.739> there<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:04.979> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
good quality as you can see there is a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.250 
good quality as you can see there is a
little<00:01:05.250> bit<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.549> lag<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.150> nothing<00:01:06.689> too<00:01:06.869> severe

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
little bit of lag but nothing too severe

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.380 
little bit of lag but nothing too severe
performance<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.189> lag<00:01:08.340> will<00:01:08.549> depend<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> few

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
performance and lag will depend on a few

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.480 
performance and lag will depend on a few
things<00:01:09.630> namely<00:01:09.990> your<00:01:10.290> Wi-Fi<00:01:10.680> connection<00:01:10.710> from

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
things namely your Wi-Fi connection from

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.520 
things namely your Wi-Fi connection from
both<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.030> phone<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> router<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.170> also

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
both the phone to the router and also

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.020 
both the phone to the router and also
the<00:01:13.680> chromecast<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> router<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.909> make

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the chromecast to the router so make

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.640 
the chromecast to the router so make
sure<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> stable<00:01:15.750> Wi-Fi<00:01:16.200> connection

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
but yeah you go into pretty much any

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.149 
but yeah you go into pretty much any
application<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:19.409> mirror<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.009> can

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
application here mirror it you can

well<00:01:24.270> I'm<00:01:24.630> about<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.900> play<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.170> video<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
well I'm about to play a video here and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.770 
well I'm about to play a video here and
yes<00:01:26.220> sound<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.670> also<00:01:26.939> transferred<00:01:27.180> I've<00:01:27.600> got

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
yes sound is also transferred I've got

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.690 
yes sound is also transferred I've got
my<00:01:27.900> TV<00:01:28.110> hooked<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.860> an<00:01:28.950> amplifier<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.640> it

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
my TV hooked up to an amplifier and it

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.120 
my TV hooked up to an amplifier and it
works<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.210> sounds<00:01:30.540> great<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.020> used<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.250> be

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
works and sounds great I used to be

works and sounds great I used to be
my<00:01:35.130> question<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:35.910> coming<00:01:36.480> from<00:01:36.690> me<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.200> was

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
my question was coming from me I was

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.780 
my question was coming from me I was
only<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:39.600> fool<00:01:40.370> around<00:01:41.370> me<00:01:41.820> little<00:01:42.720> discrim

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
only the fool around me little discrim

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.180 
only the fool around me little discrim
lands<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.320> yes<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.500> you're<00:01:46.620> wondering<00:01:47.010> that

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
lands and yes if you're wondering that

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.860 
lands and yes if you're wondering that
means<00:01:47.430> even<00:01:47.820> some<00:01:47.970> applications<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.630> don't

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
means even some applications that don't

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.510 
means even some applications that don't
officially<00:01:49.140> support<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.800> chromecast<00:01:50.010> now<00:01:50.460> do

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
officially support the chromecast now do

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:25.170 
officially support the chromecast now do
work<00:01:50.940> for<00:01:51.210> example<00:01:51.690> Spotify

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.550 

so<00:02:26.180> yet<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.600> could<00:02:26.750> probably<00:02:26.900> hear<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.290> slight

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
so yet you could probably hear a slight

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.140 
so yet you could probably hear a slight
few<00:02:27.890> hiccups<00:02:28.220> when<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.490> was<00:02:28.610> rotating<00:02:29.060> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
few hiccups when I was rotating the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.820 
few hiccups when I was rotating the
device<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.600> sound<00:02:29.840> kind<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.200> skipped<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.650> little

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
device to sound kind of skipped a little

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.800 
device to sound kind of skipped a little
bit<00:02:30.980> but<00:02:31.370> overall<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.880> played<00:02:32.090> smoothly<00:02:32.480> and

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
bit but overall it played smoothly and

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.050 
bit but overall it played smoothly and
the<00:02:32.870> sound<00:02:33.110> quality<00:02:33.500> was<00:02:33.650> very<00:02:33.890> good<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:34.430> just

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
the sound quality was very good so just

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.580 
the sound quality was very good so just
checking<00:02:35.240> out<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.569> general<00:02:35.900> latency<00:02:36.380> of<00:02:36.410> the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
checking out the general latency of the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.170 
checking out the general latency of the
cast<00:02:36.830> obviously<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.430> isn't<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.760> concrete

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
cast obviously this isn't a concrete

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.090 
cast obviously this isn't a concrete
test<00:02:38.540> when<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.810> do<00:02:38.959> more<00:02:39.170> demanding<00:02:39.680> actions

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
test when you do more demanding actions

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.250 
test when you do more demanding actions
the<00:02:40.250> latency<00:02:40.730> may<00:02:40.910> increase<00:02:41.240> but<00:02:41.750> yeah<00:02:42.080> if<00:02:42.140> we

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
the latency may increase but yeah if we

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.690 
the latency may increase but yeah if we
go<00:02:42.380> ahead<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.709> pause<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.010> video<00:02:43.100> here<00:02:43.280> we<00:02:43.550> can

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
go ahead and pause the video here we can

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.699 
go ahead and pause the video here we can
see<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.150> chromecast<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.870> about<00:02:45.080> 3/10<00:02:45.680> of

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
see that the chromecast is about 3/10 of

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.230 
see that the chromecast is about 3/10 of
a<00:02:45.830> second<00:02:46.160> behind<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.550> phone<00:02:46.730> which<00:02:46.970> isn't

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
a second behind the phone which isn't

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.600 
a second behind the phone which isn't
bad<00:02:47.540> at<00:02:47.660> all<00:02:47.810> in<00:02:48.080> terms<00:02:48.770> of<00:02:48.950> gaming<00:02:49.190> they<00:02:49.550> do

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
bad at all in terms of gaming they do

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.220 
bad at all in terms of gaming they do
work<00:02:50.030> but<00:02:50.270> you'll<00:02:50.390> find<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.750> hard<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.110> play

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
work but you'll find it hard to play

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.500 
work but you'll find it hard to play
just<00:02:51.590> by<00:02:51.709> looking<00:02:52.070> at<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.340> TV<00:02:52.670> especially<00:02:53.300> in

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
just by looking at the TV especially in

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.300 
just by looking at the TV especially in
games<00:02:53.989> like<00:02:54.260> temple<00:02:54.500> run<00:02:54.709> where<00:02:55.010> even<00:02:55.250> a

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
games like temple run where even a

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.740 
games like temple run where even a
slight<00:02:55.580> lag<00:02:55.819> can<00:02:56.090> cause<00:02:56.270> you<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.569> lose

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
slight lag can cause you to lose

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.870 
slight lag can cause you to lose
generally<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:57.560> found<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:57.980> cast<00:02:58.220> while<00:02:58.459> gaming

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
generally I found the cast while gaming

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.580 
generally I found the cast while gaming
to<00:02:59.000> be<00:02:59.120> relatively<00:02:59.570> smooth<00:02:59.900> most<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.380> time

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
to be relatively smooth most of the time

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.470 
to be relatively smooth most of the time
however<00:03:00.890> at<00:03:01.280> random<00:03:01.670> points<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.120> seemed<00:03:02.330> to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
however at random points it seemed to

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.940 
however at random points it seemed to
get<00:03:02.660> heavily<00:03:02.930> bogged<00:03:03.350> down<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.590> caused

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
get heavily bogged down and caused

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.130 
get heavily bogged down and caused
significant<00:03:04.700> slowdown<00:03:04.970> basically<00:03:05.720> bringing

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
significant slowdown basically bringing

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.229 
significant slowdown basically bringing
it<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.410> slideshow<00:03:06.980> like<00:03:07.160> experience<00:03:07.700> it

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
it to a slideshow like experience it

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.150 
it to a slideshow like experience it
does<00:03:08.480> eventually<00:03:08.750> catch<00:03:09.170> up<00:03:09.200> with<00:03:09.500> itself<00:03:09.800> and

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
does eventually catch up with itself and

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160 
does eventually catch up with itself and
become<00:03:10.489> relatively<00:03:10.910> smooth<00:03:11.269> again<00:03:11.570> but<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:12.110> do

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
become relatively smooth again but I do

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.130 
become relatively smooth again but I do
reiterate<00:03:12.860> this<00:03:13.220> is<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.519> beta<00:03:13.940> doing<00:03:14.780> general

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
reiterate this is a beta doing general

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.870 
reiterate this is a beta doing general
things<00:03:15.380> like<00:03:15.530> full<00:03:15.920> screening<00:03:16.370> your<00:03:16.519> Google

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
things like full screening your Google

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.610 
things like full screening your Google
Plus<00:03:17.090> even<00:03:17.390> rotating<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.140> be<00:03:18.230> full<00:03:18.470> screen

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
Plus even rotating it to be full screen

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.440 
Plus even rotating it to be full screen
I<00:03:18.800> found<00:03:19.190> absolutely<00:03:19.700> no<00:03:19.850> problems<00:03:20.330> with

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
I found absolutely no problems with

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.449 
I found absolutely no problems with
again<00:03:21.080> you<00:03:21.200> still<00:03:21.380> see<00:03:21.650> little<00:03:21.950> hiccups<00:03:22.280> now

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
again you still see little hiccups now

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.250 
again you still see little hiccups now
and<00:03:22.610> then<00:03:22.730> but<00:03:23.000> in<00:03:23.209> still<00:03:23.540> images<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:24.050> really

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
and then but in still images it really

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.420 
and then but in still images it really
doesn't<00:03:24.560> matter<00:03:24.709> it's<00:03:24.980> only<00:03:25.100> really

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
doesn't matter it's only really

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.430 
doesn't matter it's only really
important<00:03:25.940> in<00:03:26.060> games<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:26.600> I'm<00:03:27.050> sure<00:03:27.230> Google

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
important in games and I'm sure Google

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.410 
important in games and I'm sure Google
will<00:03:27.680> iron<00:03:27.890> out<00:03:28.130> most<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.550> these<00:03:28.640> problems<00:03:29.120> but

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
will iron out most of these problems but

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.630 
will iron out most of these problems but
yeah<00:03:30.079> you<00:03:30.140> can<00:03:30.380> see<00:03:30.530> here<00:03:30.739> it<00:03:30.920> looks<00:03:30.950> great<00:03:31.430> on

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
yeah you can see here it looks great on

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.160
