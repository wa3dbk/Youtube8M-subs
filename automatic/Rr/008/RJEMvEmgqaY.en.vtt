 two minutes and more to tell you 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.790
 a couple of little things and the first thing is that 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.490
 well the other day I was talking to a 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.110
 my friend and others but record in bad I 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.270
 in the channel I had a series of pokemon 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.600
 in which good was a wal club 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.970
 green eye pokemon and others which I 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.800
 I tried to pass and upload it to the channel 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.970
 the 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.800
 If I remember correctly, I think I saw it from 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.670
 new pokémon the channel of dual revolver 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.700
 dual revolver and I did not see it but it was not 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.350
 pokemon if it was not like a page where 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.670
 there were pokemon combats none I 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.830
 what I downloaded was an emulator and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.260
 others for the computer and I had it in the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.930
 portable that happens then stop uploading 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.330
 that series of videos that good I change 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.220
 to a computer like many of you will already know 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.510
 you have I guess it's good 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.120
 unboxing of the computer out there in the 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.950
 channel if you want you search in the search engine 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.870
 of channel you put unboxing and you will leave 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.330
 I suppose and good as you well know that 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.340
 there was a computer and I did not download the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.800
 emulator and so on and for that reason not 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.410
 I went back to upload videos from where 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.910
 little leaf man that I like 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.010
 quite do it since it reminded me 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.540
 much to my childhood 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.190
 and that I always although I am 16 years old 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.470
 he always reminded me and such said fuck 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.900
 but I remembered things from time to 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.990
 I played better when I was 78 years old and 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.270
 I played that game and I still remember it 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.100
 so I liked to upload it and so on 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.660
 there were people who said I remember the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.460
 first the first videos that came up from 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.500
 the first episodes was comment of 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.050
 you're a geek and stop uploading this and I 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.300
 I thought I'll upload whatever I want because 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.070
 is what I like and the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.110
 people who see it will like it and people 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.120
 that he does not like that he does not see it but as 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.550
 you always know is the people who come to 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.230
 your video channel even if you do not like it 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.940
 it remains to see it so that to find you 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.500
 criticism and tell you in the comments 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.750
 and I say thank you very much give me your 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.610
 dislike and give me your visit also what 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.870
 serves me so nothing that comes to 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.690
 commenting on them is probably going back 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.710
 to upload pokemon but one more version 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.880
 new 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.980
 good is not new not a version 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.240
 remasterizada of pokemon or the good thing you see 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.370
 here this countryman who comes to kill me 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.709
 Guiza shouted as I usually spend the 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.819
 I really think not scream but I was a 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.769
 point 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.629
 and good what you have to go commenting 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.879
 before, it was good that I will go back to 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.749
 think upload it again since I like it 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:06.510
 pretty and fun also play it and 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:08.129
 record it and upload it at once and it was good 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.689
 one thing that is easily recorded does not 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.799
 I had many requirements for a computer 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.930
 or anything and it was good to have a 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.180
 good computer well less so still 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.400
 I wanted to think about uploading it again but one 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.319
 remastered version of the gold pokémon of 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.180
 the dem boy and normal then see upload a 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.030
 remastered version that came out for ds 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.269
 so I'll download the emulator for ds and 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.139
 I'll upload it but upload it in streaming 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:34.230
 towards the weekends or someday 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:36.719
 I will stream a pokémon gold version 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.099
 remasterizada for ds that is quite 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.389
