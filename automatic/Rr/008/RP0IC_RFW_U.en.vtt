00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.780 
here it is I totally didn't realize that
my<00:02:15.700> printer<00:02:16.150> would<00:02:16.300> be<00:02:16.450> full<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.660> glass<00:02:16.989> oh<00:02:17.790> boy

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
my printer would be full of glass oh boy

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.030 
my printer would be full of glass oh boy
I've<00:02:19.360> made<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.930> boo-boo<00:02:20.230> we're<00:02:20.650> just<00:02:20.890> gonna

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
I've made a boo-boo we're just gonna

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.270 
I've made a boo-boo we're just gonna
we're<00:02:21.970> just<00:02:22.000> gonna<00:02:22.300> put<00:02:23.019> that<00:02:23.260> down<00:02:23.470> like<00:02:23.739> that

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
we're just gonna put that down like that

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.780 
we're just gonna put that down like that
I<00:02:24.310> think<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.180> ink<00:02:25.330> goes<00:02:25.540> in<00:02:25.780> here<00:02:25.989> somewhere

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
I think the ink goes in here somewhere

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:35.180 
I think the ink goes in here somewhere
I've<00:02:27.790> got<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.060> find<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.330> ink<00:02:28.720> hole<00:02:29.050> somehow

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.900 

and<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.220> think<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.519> paper<00:02:36.760> goes<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:37.570> right<00:02:38.110> in

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
and I think the paper goes just right in

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.270 
and I think the paper goes just right in
in<00:02:39.910> there<00:02:40.299> so<00:02:41.079> now<00:02:41.110> we<00:02:41.410> got<00:02:41.530> my<00:02:41.650> printer<00:02:42.130> all

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
in there so now we got my printer all

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.380 
fixed up it's time to print off some
documents<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.709> think<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.459> power<00:02:45.700> buttons<00:02:46.120> over

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.080 
documents I think the power buttons over
here<00:02:46.600> somewhere<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:47.350> found<00:02:47.860> here<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.430> and
