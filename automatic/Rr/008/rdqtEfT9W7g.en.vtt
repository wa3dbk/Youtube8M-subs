00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.909
 are 72 colored 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.330
 And Utrecht intense team need the money 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.489
 use of music with water 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.169
 holigschennis has the club from heusden silvio and you can also have very nice 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.289
 take color combinations 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.660
 what does your father need at night makes colored pencils 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.990
 I use myself 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.990
 and with the turn you so that I can see the club well 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.960
 their piece of kitchen roll and I use where users 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.400
 well that fun color display by I had good hope this time 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.620
 and I'm always a little sad 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.690
 then you can be 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.690
 perhaps make and work hard better from light to dark 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.640
 I proceed as follows I take the pencil I take a water job I get 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.750
 a bit of a night watch center of gravity 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.890
 I go through the tip of a pencil 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.600
 I do not also have the bend that you do not see this well because it is not that 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.680
 i know is 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.030
 and then I have a little bit of color here too 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.110
 I do not too bad 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.630
 they send you better see a lot of nations on Sunday afternoon 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.990
 and so the boy shot 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.760
 then I grab 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.760
 man heard and the church by the wind 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.500
 it is well wet 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.080
 I also always take the file to test 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.530
 colored 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.530
 a piece of bakery has this on paper 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.490
 this beautiful one starts a big pot 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.899
 apple only makes color 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.899
 I do not understand what in tough can you do something better 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.109
 I have a layer first 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.109
 can close 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.819
 and now just work 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.529
 shrink slightly usb darker 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.529
 I now just want to give up again 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:01.299
 I will leave this to a strip of land if I do not have to get up again every day 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.729
 you always in the church 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:07.049
 and then you get this beautiful music and the equally old place in the making this transition 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.049
 of course he can also just vote 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.049
 and you can send the color names in two lies 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.049
 just move a little of your large temporary saucer 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:42.559
 It is a unique brand filed and that explains play 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.189
 there is also sister no more than you know you have dried 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:59.589
 that is something to put on 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:02.969
 in a bend your direction 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.790

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.559
 greater range 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:09.660
 lies here 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.619
 add 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.049
 if you know he left 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.049
 they continue to invest in 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.900

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.680
 coachman 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.680
 look now see in the clip nothing concrete 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.370
 the art world series 9 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.370
 schultz so you can put this out 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:41.229
 then we can go a little darker and so I still had a bit of the size 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.509
 parking 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.509
 the size of the scratch card 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.419
 work with live numbers 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.199
 provided you willeke it was not that big that he also in this newspaper 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.550
 can see there 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.289
 that your marco progress 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.689
 from light to dark 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:18.689
 and that's how you finish old colors 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:23.009
 The most important thing is therefore no ordinary this ensures that you can with this 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.710
 patterns 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.229
 but the brand is nothing you can get all the color of green light and last 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.229

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.089

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.260
 white and then a little bit every time and the skin color can hurt 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:48.980
 use skin color I have the e17 10 more often 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.379

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.919
 and if you get those people a lot with a little bit you get 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.899
 really a little skin color 

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:02.189
