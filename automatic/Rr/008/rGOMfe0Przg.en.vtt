00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.950
 we already come back closer with you in this scenario in this scenario a little 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.810
 dismal 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.629
 we are precisely to take you home 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.230
 all the extraterrestrial evidence that the engineer by lazcano climb all 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.239
 you through near you engineer 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:19.160
 let's not talk more clairvoyants of clairvoyance and explain what it brings for us 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:23.529
 if you look we are going to present precisely as we discussed this was according to you 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:24.509
 minutes 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.769
 this interesting portal where you can keep 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.489
 vie not human origin but Julian be of extraterrestrial origin 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.770
 percent you will have the opportunity to observe 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.560
 percent 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.700
 right now we're going through the video 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.590
 those strange faces that stagnate 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.800
 and that definitely from my very particular point of view and some of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.840
 my fellow researchers we just did that they can not be 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.780
 percent of indigenous origin 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.730
 now engineer 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.550
 God, I have used to see that through what he has learned in school 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.800
 through history 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.560
 that the pre-Hispanic 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.650
 they showed hop they found faces in agreement we are two physicists but it does not fit inside 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.440
 of some woman in fact has 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.690
 because precisely characteristics a little abnormal if you can observe the 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.890
 eyes or very round 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.820
 to begin with they are very round in second place 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.340
 the head is very pure tuber ante 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.950
 i thirdly you can see that the technique you are using here is 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.520
 of engraving is neither painting is an engraving thefts is this has more 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.610
 originality inma reinforcement to think 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.600
 what you comment the heat of our ancestors in case it was male 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.040
 who saw in magallanes now elongated faces and round eyes makes me 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.850
 is born because it steals my attention 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.830
 see the eyes 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.460
 we are eyes 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.060
 who are and Alaves people of pre-Hispanic eras in fact 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.540
 he observed them a little torn at that time yes as you can see p 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.060
 there is a species like 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.660
 basins in the eyes 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.590
 are several faces that are observed not only is this video that we are 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.790
 passing his unique video nobody has presented this within what is the 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.900
 history or folio jica and the most important pride is that it is here in veracruz 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.890
 it is in our state where they are recorded they are difficult to access 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:22.939
 we can this one who is interested with pleasure to take it so that it knows 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.289
 this place 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:28.619
 what you comment is very true percent the operatives are very strange 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:34.069
 even ripped later as we go running the video will 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.189
 can observe a being 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.659
 very strange even it seems to be 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.819
 a painting captured as an x-ray we are not talking about an engraving and 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.779
 look at the face I'm really uncovered development bad 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:49.040
 indisputably 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.279
 is not something 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.900
 of what we are used to seeing through 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.240
 in crafts or dives 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.470
 or of the beasts that carved the prehispanic fox masters amazing to see 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.660
 through the books I remembered some movies pretty much those 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.649
 faces link mecano some images 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:07.380
 of some movies that I've seen 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.569
 but pons 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.700
 with fear of making a mistake, I do not venture to say what movies 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.370
 we talked about meeting appeared 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.429
 without looking at this is that was the face that impressed us the most 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:22.709
 because this one has features in what you mention in a movie that almost 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.779
 all the people we saw for a hundred hit us a lot and it was the 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:30.829
 predator 2 then I am so happy the block what reaches 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.789
 if it is that the head is very soon you will see three large elongated 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:40.599
 and especially the part of the mouth if you can observe is strange by a hundred the 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.799
 eyes as you say you are oblique are torn but percent 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.020
 let's look at the image, it would seem that 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.200
 a painting or we are not talking about an engraving we are talking about a 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.470
 very strange painting is totally different from everything we are 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.690
 used to seeing 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.690
 as a summary because we have little time to dismiss this block 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.490
 what definition ozores if for us this or for as much face 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.419
 so strange of different races 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:12.430
 I do not dare to advance a comment but it seems to be a cemetery 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:15.510
 very interesting engineer what presents us 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.630
 and what presents us mode of 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.940
 conclusion 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.109
 regarding this topic 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.830
 send your messages to 87 be 87 and generated by ccaa will not continue with 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.819
 us to present the evidence 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.380
 there is still more to present 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.820
 you receive the information through near you we are approaching are 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.599
 two sets want 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.539
 and if you want to know about this here is the engineer for 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.560
 make her know a little more about the extraterrestrial phenomenon 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.560
 do not take off 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.420
 seriously from mosport the ever this is to be
