not and i cannot get enough of them what

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.200 
not and i cannot get enough of them what
we<00:00:06.899> have<00:00:07.080> here<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.440> an<00:00:07.799> array<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.210> redstone

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
we have here is an array of redstone

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.940 
we have here is an array of redstone
torches<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.990> will<00:00:10.110> tell<00:00:10.290> me<00:00:10.320> exactly<00:00:10.830> how

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
torches that will tell me exactly how

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.270 
torches that will tell me exactly how
full<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:12.240> PEZ<00:00:13.019> dispenser<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:13.920> at<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.130> moment

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
full a PEZ dispenser is so at the moment

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.529 
full a PEZ dispenser is so at the moment
you<00:00:14.490> can<00:00:14.639> see<00:00:14.880> it's<00:00:15.859> three-fifths<00:00:16.859> full<00:00:17.539> now

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
you can see it's three-fifths full now

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.910 
you can see it's three-fifths full now
if<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.810> go<00:00:18.840> over<00:00:19.020> here<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:20.810> load<00:00:21.810> some<00:00:22.439> carts

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
if I go over here and I load some carts

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.939 
if I go over here and I load some carts
in<00:00:23.750> now<00:00:24.750> I'm<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.199> do<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> quick

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
in now I'm just going to do it the quick

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.580 
in now I'm just going to do it the quick
way<00:00:25.980> because<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:28.039> quicker<00:00:33.320> now<00:00:34.320> what<00:00:34.559> you

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
way because it's quicker now what you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.500 
way because it's quicker now what you
can<00:00:34.680> see<00:00:35.040> there<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.640> whole<00:00:36.120> bunch<00:00:36.329> of

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
can see there is a whole bunch of

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.389 
can see there is a whole bunch of
sensors<00:00:37.040> that<00:00:38.040> bang<00:00:38.550> against<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.559> stack<00:00:42.379> cool

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
sensors that bang against the stack cool

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.660 
sensors that bang against the stack cool
now<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.550> looks<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.239> broken<00:00:46.670> that's

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
now it looks like it's broken that's

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.400 
now it looks like it's broken that's
just<00:00:47.850> goes<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> leveling<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.230> don't

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
just goes to the leveling and I don't

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.200 
just goes to the leveling and I don't
know<00:00:49.559> why<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.100> happens<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.030> particular

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
know why that happens at that particular

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.600 
know why that happens at that particular
height<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.350> probably<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.800> some<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
height it's probably just some of the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.099 
height it's probably just some of the
way<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.739> thing<00:00:55.739> hits<00:00:56.449> but<00:00:57.449> when<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> drop

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
way the thing hits but when I drop

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.229 
way the thing hits but when I drop
another<00:00:58.350> one<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.370> works<00:00:59.579> so

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
another one in you can see it works so

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.579 
another one in you can see it works so
what<00:01:00.870> happens<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> every<00:01:02.480> 17<00:01:03.480> minecarts<00:01:04.409> hi

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
what happens is every 17 minecarts hi

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950 
what happens is every 17 minecarts hi
there's<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.339> sensor<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.970> we'll<00:01:06.450> bang<00:01:06.600> against

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
there's a sensor and we'll bang against

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.840 
there's a sensor and we'll bang against
the<00:01:07.110> thing<00:01:07.320> now<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.890> filled<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the thing now I just filled up to the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.570 
the thing now I just filled up to the
next<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.260> see<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.950> now

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
next one and you can see here that now

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.240 
next one and you can see here that now
we<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.970> four<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.600> lights<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.049> if<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.010> keep

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
we have four of the lights on if I keep

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.890 
we have four of the lights on if I keep
going<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:16.229> fill<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:17.659> usually<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.780> will

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
going and I fill it up usually you will

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.160 
going and I fill it up usually you will
have<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> fill<00:01:19.409> from<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> bottom<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:21.049> what<00:01:22.049> it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
have it fill from the bottom and what it

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.789 
have it fill from the bottom and what it
does<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.590> actually<00:01:22.770> bounces<00:01:23.580> off<00:01:24.680> everyone<00:01:25.680> in

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
does it actually bounces off everyone in

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.550 
does it actually bounces off everyone in
the<00:01:25.920> stack<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:27.600> kind<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> bit

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the stack so it kind of is a bit

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.210 
the stack so it kind of is a bit
unwieldy<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.880> concept<00:01:30.329> than<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
unwieldy this is one of a concept than a

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.800 
unwieldy this is one of a concept than a
one<00:01:32.220> hundred<00:01:32.520> percent<00:01:32.549> reliable<00:01:33.000> design

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
one hundred percent reliable design

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.640 
one hundred percent reliable design
because<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.799> not<00:01:35.009> really<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.900> goes<00:01:37.140> up<00:01:37.409> each

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
because it's not really it goes up each

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.950 
because it's not really it goes up each
one<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:40.460> when<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.610> gets<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.880> top<00:01:42.240> one<00:01:42.270> man

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
one and when it gets that top one man

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.600 
one and when it gets that top one man
that's<00:01:43.200> annoying<00:01:43.439> note<00:01:43.710> huh<00:01:46.220> when<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.340> gets<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
that's annoying note huh when it gets to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.719 
that's annoying note huh when it gets to
the<00:01:47.700> top<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:49.350> will<00:01:49.470> fall<00:01:49.649> back<00:01:49.829> down<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.369> in

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the top it will fall back down and in

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.310 
the top it will fall back down and in
that<00:01:50.820> case<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.299> will<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.540> boost<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.049> out<00:01:52.170> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that case it will just boost it out of

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.100 
that case it will just boost it out of
the<00:01:52.409> way<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:53.820> will<00:01:54.060> continue<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:54.840> I

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the way and it will continue so if I

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.010 
the way and it will continue so if I
fill<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.439> all<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.770> way<00:01:55.950> up

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.520 

I<00:02:01.329> probably<00:02:02.329> loaded<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:02.840> too<00:02:02.960> fast<00:02:03.200> it's<00:02:03.439> gonna

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
I probably loaded it too fast it's gonna

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.009 
I probably loaded it too fast it's gonna
have<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:03.829> fit<00:02:06.640> like<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.850> said<00:02:07.909> it<00:02:08.420> it's

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
have a fit like I said it it's

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.199 
have a fit like I said it it's
definitely<00:02:09.739> not<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.099> most<00:02:10.310> reliable<00:02:10.489> design

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
definitely not the most reliable design

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.780 
definitely not the most reliable design
but<00:02:12.140> it's<00:02:12.260> really<00:02:12.470> cool<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.099> wanted<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.459> I

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
but it's really cool and I wanted to I

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.550 
but it's really cool and I wanted to I
wanted<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.420> create<00:02:14.720> something<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.319> would

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
wanted to create something that would

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.650 
wanted to create something that would
tell<00:02:15.800> me<00:02:16.060> how<00:02:17.060> full<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.720> dispenser<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:18.860> without

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
tell me how full a dispenser is without

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.009 
tell me how full a dispenser is without
tough<00:02:20.660> redstone<00:02:21.290> wiring<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.660> it<00:02:23.660> looks<00:02:23.900> like

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
tough redstone wiring and it looks like

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.479 
tough redstone wiring and it looks like
I<00:02:25.090> mean<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.540> looks<00:02:26.810> kind<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.260> confusing<00:02:27.830> for

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
I mean that looks kind of confusing for

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.050 
I mean that looks kind of confusing for
red<00:02:28.670> stone<00:02:28.940> but<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.330> really<00:02:29.569> isn't<00:02:31.060> that

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
red stone but it really isn't that

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.319 
red stone but it really isn't that
should<00:02:32.299> be<00:02:32.420> enough<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.840> fill<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.730> no<00:02:34.730> maybe<00:02:35.120> one

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
should be enough to fill it no maybe one

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.920 
should be enough to fill it no maybe one
more<00:02:38.019> definitely<00:02:39.019> one<00:02:39.140> more<00:02:39.319> so<00:02:39.829> you<00:02:39.920> can<00:02:40.069> see

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
more definitely one more so you can see

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.920 
more definitely one more so you can see
over<00:02:41.930> here<00:02:41.959> we<00:02:42.290> have<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.680> for<00:02:43.010> full<00:02:43.599> once<00:02:44.599> i<00:02:44.750> put

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
over here we have it for full once i put

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.819 
over here we have it for full once i put
this<00:02:45.079> last<00:02:45.349> one<00:02:45.530> in<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.900> will<00:02:48.079> go<00:02:48.200> up<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.560> reach

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
this last one in it will go up to reach

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.150 
this last one in it will go up to reach
the<00:02:49.010> top<00:02:49.660> will<00:02:50.660> start<00:02:50.930> bouncing<00:02:51.410> against<00:02:52.040> a

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
the top will start bouncing against a

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.470 
the top will start bouncing against a
stack<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:54.310> now<00:02:55.310> we<00:02:55.370> have<00:02:55.549> it<00:02:55.819> completely<00:02:56.180> full

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
stack and now we have it completely full

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.449 
stack and now we have it completely full
every<00:02:57.110> now<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.349> again<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.680> torches<00:02:58.040> fall<00:02:58.250> off

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
every now and again the torches fall off

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.759 
every now and again the torches fall off
and<00:02:58.670> that's<00:02:58.849> just<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.180> way<00:02:59.329> they<00:03:00.170> bounce<00:03:00.470> off

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
and that's just the way they bounce off

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.949 
and that's just the way they bounce off
the<00:03:02.019> stack<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.049> on<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.530> detector<00:03:04.010> rail<00:03:04.190> here

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
the stack and on the detector rail here

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.990 
the stack and on the detector rail here
each<00:03:05.959> detector<00:03:06.530> rail<00:03:06.889> is<00:03:07.220> connected<00:03:07.850> to<00:03:07.970> a

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
each detector rail is connected to a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.240 
each detector rail is connected to a
different<00:03:08.480> LED<00:03:10.239> redstone<00:03:11.239> torch<00:03:11.859> it<00:03:12.859> looks

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
different LED redstone torch it looks

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.580 
different LED redstone torch it looks
like<00:03:13.639> there's<00:03:14.060> some<00:03:14.180> crazy<00:03:14.810> electronics

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
like there's some crazy electronics

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.870 
like there's some crazy electronics
going<00:03:15.859> it's<00:03:16.160> not<00:03:16.370> it's<00:03:16.670> just<00:03:16.850> a<00:03:17.620> single

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
going it's not it's just a single

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.970 
going it's not it's just a single
detector<00:03:19.880> rail<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.959> single<00:03:21.380> torch<00:03:21.620> and

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
detector rail to a single torch and

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.849 
detector rail to a single torch and
that's<00:03:22.670> it<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.690> that's<00:03:23.720> pretty<00:03:24.170> much<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.410> design

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
that's it so that's pretty much a design

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.800 
that's it so that's pretty much a design
it's<00:03:25.609> kind<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:26.000> cool<00:03:26.209> it's<00:03:26.540> kind<00:03:26.690> of

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
it's kind of cool it's kind of

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.339 
it's kind of cool it's kind of
unreliable<00:03:27.440> doesn't<00:03:28.400> work<00:03:28.549> very<00:03:28.579> well<00:03:28.940> in

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
unreliable doesn't work very well in

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.680 
unreliable doesn't work very well in
survival<00:03:30.349> multiplayer<00:03:30.500> at<00:03:31.069> all<00:03:31.280> but<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.510> does

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
survival multiplayer at all but it does

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.710 
survival multiplayer at all but it does
work<00:03:32.930> in<00:03:33.290> concept<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.430> if<00:03:34.849> anybody<00:03:35.299> can<00:03:35.510> think

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
work in concept and if anybody can think

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.780 
work in concept and if anybody can think
of<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:35.900> better<00:03:36.049> way<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.319> do<00:03:36.590> it<00:03:36.739> let<00:03:37.340> me<00:03:37.459> know<00:03:37.579> and

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
of a better way to do it let me know and

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.259 
of a better way to do it let me know and
i'll<00:03:37.910> see<00:03:38.510> what<00:03:38.630> i<00:03:38.660> can<00:03:38.750> do<00:03:39.049> to<00:03:39.079> implement<00:03:39.980> it

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
i'll see what i can do to implement it

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.099 
i'll see what i can do to implement it
but<00:03:41.269> other<00:03:41.389> than<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:41.630> yeah<00:03:42.410> it<00:03:42.560> is<00:03:42.680> it's<00:03:43.040> very

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
but other than that yeah it is it's very

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.599 
but other than that yeah it is it's very
cool<00:03:45.109> i<00:03:45.349> wanted<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.769> put<00:03:45.919> this<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.340> old

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
cool i wanted to put this in the old

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.210 
cool i wanted to put this in the old
Japan's<00:03:46.940> 9000<00:03:47.660> but<00:03:47.840> I<00:03:48.079> just<00:03:48.590> found<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:48.889> was<00:03:49.010> too

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
Japan's 9000 but I just found it was too

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.580 
Japan's 9000 but I just found it was too
unreliable<00:03:49.549> but<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.209> definitely<00:03:50.840> did<00:03:51.290> want<00:03:51.500> to

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
unreliable but I definitely did want to

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.449 
unreliable but I definitely did want to
show<00:03:51.739> you<00:03:52.239> how<00:03:53.239> it<00:03:53.359> worked<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:54.010> what<00:03:55.010> my<00:03:55.130> idea

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
show you how it worked and what my idea

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.610 
show you how it worked and what my idea
was<00:03:55.639> and<00:03:55.940> I<00:03:56.150> really<00:03:56.180> like<00:03:56.870> that<00:03:56.900> this<00:03:57.410> will
