00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.260
 and good to all and I am half this new 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.490
 big video point 5 and I bring new ones 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.380
 tests new advances in the 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.120
 research of the mural of the mountain 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.880
 exile from everything that surrounds the jetpack 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.860
 is the great mystery of the saga gta iv os 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.570
 I bring a huge novelty a very sound 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.669
 weird that you can hear under some 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.380
 certain coincidences before 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.090
 start I would like to ask you not to 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.330
 forget to give him the right choice with nothing 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.010
 more than adding we begin 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.770
 first of all I would like to give the 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.600
 thanks to cristian 95 because in reality 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.400
 although the investigation should be 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.230
 have brought the two I have been 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.150
 incredibly bundled with a lot of 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.280
 projects and it has been the end that 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.170
 has discovered everything so the merits 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.239
 they go to him what yes it is clear that 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.860
 after seeing this advance I will go back 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.600
 to all these investigations because 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.250
 this is awesome to get in 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.690
 scene first of all it would be that 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.280
 explain a bit what is the mural of the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.250
 mount exile that mural that is in the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.160
 top of that mountain and that encloses 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.500
 a network of connections that go from about 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.500
 eyes some books about x that are others 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.110
 glyphs and ends in three mysteries the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.020
 mystery of the UFO the mystery of the egg 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.909
 alien and the mystery of the jetpack I have 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.560
 number of videos regarding the 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.090
 three that's why I do not know them well 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.830
 you have them at your disposal but in 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.970
 any case all the research we 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.430
 take a character a character 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.100
 known as andy world is also you 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.229
 called the apocalyptic ips hippie bizarre 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.820
 that vagabond who says crazy things that do not 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.650
 they are so crazy and that you have a 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.540
 very similarity with the truth of the 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.250
 character of gta san andreas that gives us 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.600
 the jetpack this character told us that 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.340
 look at the stars 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.229
 a phrase that took us to the map of the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.390
 mysteries since there was a stranger 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.040
 message in which I put suite for the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.259
 stars that comes to be shoots the 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.299
 stars or rather that we look at 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.149
 she is marking this mark on the map of 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.070
 the mysteries lies precisely on the 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.170
 Galilean observatory is a place that 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.000
 has never been in my videos for 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.740
 talk about it in detail but in 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.140
 this case we have to mention it 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.119
 because everything happens here not only because 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.860
 the fact that it's a hiding place 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.509
 the mystery because in principle it is the 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.850
 site from which the stars would look 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.410
 apart from that, it comes out on the map of 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.480
 the mysteries like we look at the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.100
 detail stars and once we go see 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.380
 that the structure itself if we see it 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.390
 from above it has a form of some kind 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.100
 of glitz or some kind of scheme that 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.959
 he wants to indicate something but we do not know 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.819
 which as you can see we can see several 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.400
 lines that end in a few squares 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.590
 a few points larger than in principle 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.269
 Well, it would be some kind of connections, 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.190
 we can come to no conclusion but 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.959
 it is clear that it must mean something in 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.310
 the central part of this whole structure 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.340
 we found an obelisk and a kind 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.080
 of smaller sculpture both shaped 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.450
 eye shaped like a glyph 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.670
 Clifford Mayor of the mural of Mount Chile 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.920
 and this is where the curious thing comes and what 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.020
 more mysterious what could be the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.330
 definitive proof and that is that in a moment 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.220
 determined at a particular moment in time 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.260
 day the shadow that these 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.690
 objects at a certain moment it 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.860
 line up and that's when it sounds 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.860
 a strange sound 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.280
 Give us the most impactful sound is not the 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.960
 most impressive sound that you have 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.880
 listened to but of course it's a 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.740
 sound that is there that happens under those 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.690
 conditions what does it mean that there are 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.700
 to research more about that many 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.200
 you will be agreeing of course 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.210
 mystery of the nuclear rocket that I climbed 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.070
 also a long time ago and that is 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.170
 both are places that emit 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.700
 strange noises at different times 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.280
 well it is clear that this is a 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.140
 huge test something incredible that is going 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.670
 to motivate a lot to follow 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.920
 investigating this mystery because 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.780
 even in the absence of a few days for 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.180
 Exit gta 5 for the new generation 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.800
 we keep discovering things we follow 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.940
 seeing that this game is bigger and 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.040
 why with this call so that 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.510
 help in the research is clear 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.670
 that two thousand people are many more than 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.980
 two investigating we're going to address the issue 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.810
 in many different ways some more 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.700
 logical ones less but the 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.160
 chances of getting there are bigger 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.620
 so I ask you for that help and I ask you 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.790
 what do you think this noise means 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.860
 more me that you liked you do not know 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.790
 leave your comment and greetings and 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.480
 until next time 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.480
 goodbye
