00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.679
 managed in the brain together times 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.969
 I was traveling all day 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.260
 left home early this morning 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.570

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.840
 in the background such an airfield and quite 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.859
 quite where you can see the water so 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.710
 very completely 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.300

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.309

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.149

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.680
 that we're back there with the yellow one 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.210

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.239

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.010

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.230
 have organizations for technical reasons 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.789
 it does not get on the line and that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.489

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.960

 mend plane 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.829

 and we are not allowed to fly 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.210

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.909

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.019
