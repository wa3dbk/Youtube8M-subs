00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
cards in a good way because I really

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:50.900 
cards in a good way because I really
think<00:03:49.889> they're<00:03:50.040> doing<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.370> correctly<00:03:50.730> I

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
think they're doing this correctly I

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.189 
think they're doing this correctly I
don't<00:03:51.150> think<00:03:51.359> it<00:03:51.480> would<00:03:51.599> have<00:03:51.690> been<00:03:51.810> smart<00:03:52.079> to

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
don't think it would have been smart to

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.990 
don't think it would have been smart to
just<00:03:52.230> have<00:03:52.590> Batman<00:03:52.829> show<00:03:53.280> up<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.579> a<00:03:53.639> Justice

just have Batman show up in a Justice
League<00:03:54.150> movie<00:03:54.419> the<00:03:54.510> idea<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.989> having<00:03:55.139> a

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319

excellent<00:03:57.419> idea<00:03:57.599> I<00:03:57.989> just<00:03:58.290> hope<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.530> you

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799
