with<00:02:31.370> having<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.820> car<00:02:32.330> phone<00:02:33.340> what<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:34.570> maybe

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
with having a car phone what is maybe

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.470

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
more cool to play games but i think that

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.330 
more cool to play games but i think that
the<00:02:42.800> Galaxy<00:02:43.250> Nexus<00:02:43.340> was<00:02:43.730> livid<00:02:44.120> Kurt<00:02:44.860> but<00:02:45.860> not

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
the Galaxy Nexus was livid Kurt but not

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.010 
the Galaxy Nexus was livid Kurt but not
super<00:02:46.760> much<00:02:46.910> this<00:02:47.240> one<00:02:47.420> seems<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.690> be<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.870> little

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
super much this one seems to be a little

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.130 
super much this one seems to be a little
bit<00:02:48.140> more<00:02:48.320> curved<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:48.890> definitely<00:02:49.989> it's<00:02:50.989> a

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
bit more curved and definitely it's a

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.199 
bit more curved and definitely it's a
cool<00:02:51.350> loop<00:02:51.560> detail<00:02:52.070> there<00:02:52.370> but<00:02:52.610> our<00:02:52.820> grill
