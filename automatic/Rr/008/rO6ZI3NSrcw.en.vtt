00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.859
 hello and welcome his diary tells him 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.449
 that she's gone and so I'm at mwc 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.910
 2014 in barcelona on the stand of sony 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.359
 to introduce you to the new sony 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.090
 xperia of the two gifts that succeeds 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.680
 helpers we already knew 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.710
 must say that the raid had been announced 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.690
 during the iss to 2013 so six months to 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.460
 hardly after exams the z2 arrives already in 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.950
 obviously correcting small defects 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.590
 to use one who himself correct the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.969
 defects of the xperia they who had been 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.989
 announced in January 2013 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.059
 and that's to tell you that they like the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.469
 rate of update currently at 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.640
 only immobel so I hope we're going 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.100
 still arrive early stabilization 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.260
 or later, but until it starts 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.000
 play fast enough that's in terms 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.460
 of specifications made quite classic 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.739
 since we end up with a screen 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.629
 made man of 5.2 kursaal that a 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.480
 full hd resolution so we get 0.2 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.820
 more and more it's true that I have not 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.369
 of them huge ones in hand there but we 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.200
 still sees that it is that the edges 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.090
 are a little smaller without that it's 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.560
 so much better proportioned compared to 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.700
 general design at the weight level 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.320
 precisely speaking of general design 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.810
 what it changes little 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.170
 since it is even 1,558 grams against 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.610
 160 before the battery passed to 3200 put 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.490
 in earth but instead of 3000 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.640
 it's still ip 55-58 it's it's 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.950
 dust resistant 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.170
 and water in terms of finishing on 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.190
 found the famous tempered glass 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.360
 in front face is in front of nothing so 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.470
 so that's good tempered glass so what 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.560
 is not gorilla glass technology 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.600
 come on come we can think we find 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.750
 classic design we offered rejection 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.140
 in the other hand the z a compact that is 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.210
 based on the budget design of one and one 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.990
 see that it is really there little by little 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.090
 things close the same thing 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.950
 so here's that aside in terms of 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.700
 photos videos so as you know the 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.200
 z1 with ac revolutionize the genre with 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.600
 with the trial is the first smartphone 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.240
 with a kpn sensor companion on 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.510
 found these famous sensor of 20 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.250
 megapixels 27 megapixels exmor rs dance 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.720
 and a backlit sensor with a 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.930
 format of 1 2 3 we will say a wind 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.730
 ground on 2.3 inch front between 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.490
 others to with an apn in video camera 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.780
 of 2 megapixel exmor r also so and 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.790
 retro was so that's pretty good 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.010
 and the big novelty so it's no 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.680
 only he records in full hd as 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.560
 my dad he also records in 4k 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.760
 so small note if for some to 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.780
 block a reporter that I could see 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.780
 on twitter mec 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.840
 able to take pictures in case of 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.999
 chaos it makes some sense that this the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.989
 already made so the fourth is 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.290
 especially for video because the 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.849
 pics 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.100
 when you're on a megapixel quest and 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.690
 not necessarily pass cocoa 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.480
 short small apart so we come back on 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.390
 the four technical sites of which on this 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.070
 apn so it is supposed to be faster 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.150
 that has the same treatment as the 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.590
 last bet and jean-pierre month 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.700
 previous and so it should not be too much 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.320
 smooth and arnould first tests 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.060
 we made currently on at 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.130
 of the photo we actually find 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.960
 classic apn still not always 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.190
 no bed proposes explained larry 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.530
 holds no grid is a little 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.920
 shame we find the geotag on 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.220
 found the famous fashion social media 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.170
 on only one photo ap which allows to have 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.300
 new applications like the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.010
 augmented reality 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.040
 the view of the video in time she slow 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.750
 motion of a new plug in fine that 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.800
 will also happen on the xperia g20 it is 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.880
 a compact and so the video 4k 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.580
 so all these apps are 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.980
 developed for caregivers is a 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.980
 compact and zac 2 and 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.480
 so we will depend on his update of 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.280
 firmware in any case to come back 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.600
 quickly and we will be ready his person all 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.440
 proposed during this new processor 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.200
 qualcomm snapdragon 1,800 years ago to 3 yesterday 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.760
 so it's a strong weight and we 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.320
 not too familiar with performance but 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.980
 what I could read 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.109
 in fact you have the news that goes with 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.660
 and others yesterday welcomed 75% more 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:22.079
 fast that the 4 we already knew and 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.260
 to about 20% faster than the 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.570
 true good it seems to him 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.040
 not bad we will not see it because 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.060
 will think there really but really not 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.820
 where they are able to use 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.220
 all this power we but we know 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.860
 that some treatments next to 6 the 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.330
 brede put his veto he practices since 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.770
 the powerful is supposed to be able to handle 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.750
 much better all your post treatment 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.520
 pictures of videos and that's it 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.280
 possibly justifies the 4k and 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.990
 shell of this two video management 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.460
 and new photo features 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.180
 consume a lot of CPU time 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:59.130
 that's in terms of cheap games for a 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.930
 level of audio data in terms of 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.750
 photos at the design level 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.210
 I said it's tempered glass 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:11.340
 waterproof and durable more expensive 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:16.560
 since they were 55 cost 58 and in 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:19.169
 so ends on the 35 5 2 inches full hd 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.910
 nominal sorting we already knew the 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.419
 stalls and energy sorts mines it's x 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.330
 reality 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.280
 we find them on this on this smartphone 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.960
 which allows to have even if its 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.210
 not compete with slabs amoled or 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.789
 help that still allows to have some 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.190
 dallas stars a slab to his followers in 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.259
 terms of colorimetry last 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.539
 novelty still quite noticeable 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.720
 sound since the experience of 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:45.240
 two leaders and with the technology of 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.099
 noise reduction of 90 seconds and 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.449
 so its default merits with 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.590
 compatible earphones 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.980
 which means what potentially 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:56.450
 that when you used 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.860
 in transit and its 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.270
 ambient is going to be canceled it's still 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.780
 disappointed the pressure that this is really 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.060
 a little more than we appreciate 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.410
 particularly appreciates because by 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.570
 experience whether with the 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.330
 headphones of bad bill but there we 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.340
 has something to stay right here is 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.010
 in terms of taken to punish at the level 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.770
 the price a year ago is 699 euros 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.020
 without subscription necessarily while the 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.930
 mode both towards the smartphone by means of 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.760
 range like in the 300 350 matches 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.830
 it's true that it's still beautiful premium 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.210
 but that must be said that a good one 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.890
 well finished product and well finished and so 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.710
 in the lineage of zealand have a good 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.570
 evolution of the xperia z1 here I think 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.950
 which I have pretty much done so if you 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.689
 have nice questions from born patients 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.909
 die 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:44.909
 and very soon necessarily as m
