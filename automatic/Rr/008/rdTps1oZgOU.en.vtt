00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
clear is going on really nice takes a

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.580 
clear is going on really nice takes a
little<00:01:56.150> bit<00:01:56.330> effort<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.960> try<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.200> figure<00:01:57.470> out

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
little bit effort to try to figure out

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.190 
little bit effort to try to figure out
how<00:01:57.740> this<00:01:57.920> paint<00:01:58.220> works<00:01:58.490> but<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:59.180> don't<00:01:59.900> paint<00:02:00.110> a

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
how this paint works but I don't paint a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.010 
how this paint works but I don't paint a
lot<00:02:00.409> of<00:02:00.530> cars<00:02:01.299> maybe<00:02:02.299> over<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.689> mile<00:02:02.869> and

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
lot of cars maybe over a mile and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.780 
lot of cars maybe over a mile and
compared<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.470> my<00:02:03.560> lifetime<00:02:04.100> on<00:02:04.280> me<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.580> paint

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.100 
compared to my lifetime on me of paint
at<00:02:04.939> 40<00:02:05.330> or<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:07.000> let's<00:02:08.000> give<00:02:08.209> me<00:02:08.300> an<00:02:08.390> idea<00:02:08.539> of<00:02:08.810> how

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
at 40 or so let's give me an idea of how

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.779 
at 40 or so let's give me an idea of how
it's<00:02:09.319> working<00:02:09.530> up<00:02:09.770> I've<00:02:09.979> got<00:02:10.160> one<00:02:10.369> more<00:02:10.550> coat

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
it's working up I've got one more coat

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.500 
it's working up I've got one more coat
of<00:02:11.000> clear<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.780> go<00:02:11.900> on<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.910> we're<00:02:13.910> in<00:02:14.030> a

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
of clear to go on and we're in a

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.570 
of clear to go on and we're in a
discussion<00:02:15.380> about<00:02:15.590> whether<00:02:15.890> we<00:02:16.010> should<00:02:16.160> force

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
discussion about whether we should force

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
hanging out of the way you can see that

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.390 
hanging out of the way you can see that
there's<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.320> little<00:03:00.470> bit<00:03:00.680> orange<00:03:01.070> peel<00:03:01.370> and

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
there's a little bit orange peel and

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.270 
there's a little bit orange peel and
that's<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:03.170> can<00:03:03.320> happen<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:03.920> that's<00:03:04.100> not<00:03:04.250> a

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
that's that can happen so that's not a

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.520 
that's that can happen so that's not a
big<00:03:04.490> deal<00:03:04.700> we<00:03:04.970> plan<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.510> color<00:03:05.720> sand<00:03:05.810> anyways

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
big deal we plan to color sand anyways

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.680 
big deal we plan to color sand anyways
but<00:03:06.980> there's<00:03:07.520> a<00:03:07.610> bigger<00:03:07.880> problem<00:03:08.120> with<00:03:08.540> these

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
but there's a bigger problem with these

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.430 
but there's a bigger problem with these
painted<00:03:09.650> components<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.840> this<00:03:11.840> is<00:03:12.020> because

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
painted components and this is because

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.150 
painted components and this is because
of<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.800> new<00:03:13.400> style<00:03:13.760> paint<00:03:14.120> we've<00:03:15.020> gone<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.500> low

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
of the new style paint we've gone to low

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.710 
of the new style paint we've gone to low
v<00:03:16.430> OC<00:03:16.580> paints<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:18.940> what<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:19.970> wasn't<00:03:20.420> aware<00:03:20.510> of

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
v OC paints and what I wasn't aware of

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.120 
v OC paints and what I wasn't aware of
is<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.520> lack<00:03:22.520> of<00:03:22.550> color<00:03:23.120> cover<00:03:23.810> ability<00:03:24.740> that

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
is the lack of color cover ability that

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.150 
is the lack of color cover ability that
these<00:03:25.430> paints<00:03:26.000> no<00:03:26.270> longer<00:03:26.750> have<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:28.040> I'll

hoping you can see it here what's in the
finish<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:13.510> right<00:05:14.510> after<00:05:14.720> we<00:05:15.050> put<00:05:15.290> the<00:05:15.380> base

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
finish and right after we put the base

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.320 
finish and right after we put the base
coat<00:05:15.830> on<00:05:16.010> and<00:05:16.040> then<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.490> clear<00:05:16.730> coat<00:05:16.940> so<00:05:17.210> it's

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
coat on and then the clear coat so it's

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.390 
coat on and then the clear coat so it's
another<00:05:17.540> step<00:05:17.840> but<00:05:18.140> had<00:05:18.650> I<00:05:18.680> known<00:05:18.980> this<00:05:19.190> I

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
another step but had I known this I

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.800 
another step but had I known this I
would<00:05:19.430> have<00:05:19.670> just<00:05:19.730> reprime<00:05:20.390> heard<00:05:20.570> in<00:05:20.720> the

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
would have just reprime heard in the

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.310 
would have just reprime heard in the
booth<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:21.290> sprayed<00:05:21.950> the<00:05:22.070> collar
