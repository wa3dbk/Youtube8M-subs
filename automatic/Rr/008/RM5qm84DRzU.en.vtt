00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.360
 helmet predator in 2010 for the first time in 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.010
 history of designing helmets studio 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.990
 not 3 us developed and later 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.299
 patented this unique protective 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.980
 helmet original helmet predator 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.510
 This is a full helmet with all 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.470
 necessary characteristics and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.600
 unusual design 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.939
 With this video we begin a series of tests. 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.550
 the strength of the outer shell of the helmet predator 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.289
 in case of an accident the main element which 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.990
 counteracts a blow this is external 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.399
 hard shell helmet shell predator 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.500
 manufactured by composite 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.140
 technology and fiberglass with reinforcement 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.600
 kevlar most standard 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 helmet made from polycarbonate 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.280
 This is the most common material in 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.329
 production of helmets will not talk 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.010
 you brand name 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.920
 but this helmet has a European 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.500
 cert certification and 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.180
 2205 is another shell shell which 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.920
 we will also test manufactured by 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.170
 composite technology but without 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.270
 use of reinforcement from kevlar this 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.120
 also certified helmet famous 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.239
 brand such helmets are more expensive 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.159
 polycarbonate 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.780
 but the texture of the shell material is better 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.729
 absorbs the blow without passing it on 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.680
 driver's head during official 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.229
 test helmets use a variety of 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.189
 types of testing in our test we will 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.840
 use shock load 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.240
 arising from the free fall of the load 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.520
 cargo weight is 13 kilograms it 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.320
 quite a lot like normal weight 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.320
 sledgehammer averages 6 kilograms 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.580
 at the base of the cargo is fixed 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.320
 metal disk which 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.920
 will directly affect 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.360
 helmet shell our task is 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.490
 to compare the protective characteristics 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.470
 slam predator and standard 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.119
 certified helmets install 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:55.590
 polycarbonate helmet sheath on 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:57.210
 hard table and drop the load on 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.740
 slow motion replay you can see 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.740
 what happens to the helmet shell 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:16.880
 inspect damage to the weakest point 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.880
 it turned out the visor attachment points 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:35.370
 cracks appeared on both sides 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.500
 slow motion can be seen as in the area 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.890
 fastener visor deformed shell 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.019
 slam 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.970
 next test for composite shell 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.900
 helmet with official certification 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.849
 you and 2205 considering different materials 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.340
 used to make this and 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.510
 previous helmets we will be interested 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.510
 whether the difference at the moment of impact 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.550
 composite shell shell helmet better 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.380
 absorbs the blow but also as in the first 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.370
 case of visor attachment points 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.370
 breaks appeared 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.660
 in slow motion you can see how 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:41.900
 develops the chin part 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:44.720
 shell now see how to lead 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.430
 yourself shell helmet predator helmet predator 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.950
 made the same as the previous one 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.300
 helmet on composite technology but with 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.300
 extra gain from kevlar 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.040
 as you can see the helmet shell 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.870
 the predator withstood a thrust of 13 kilograms 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.980
 cargo 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.750
 the inner space of the shell is not 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.880
 decreased in comparison with previous 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.880
 polycarbonate and composite helmets 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.250
 where the strike took place 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:30.070
 the shell cracked by absorbing this energy 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:32.350
 strike so we made sure 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.730
 what helmet predator withstand top kick 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.650
 no worse than standard helmets we want 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.450
 to draw your attention to the fact that this 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.920
 we did the test just to 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.020
 clearly show the level of strength 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.020
 standard helmet and helmet predator 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.540
 in the next video we will change direction 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.729
 hitting and also show how to behave 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.880
 standard helmets and original helmet 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.880
 predator
