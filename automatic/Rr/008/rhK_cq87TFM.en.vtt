mage briefs is stronger than I well
there's<00:00:23.669> uh<00:00:23.790> you<00:00:24.720> can't<00:00:24.989> really<00:00:25.290> say<00:00:25.529> one<00:00:25.860> team

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
there's uh you can't really say one team

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.519 
there's uh you can't really say one team
is<00:00:26.220> barren<00:00:26.579> other<00:00:26.759> than<00:00:27.090> then<00:00:27.930> another<00:00:28.230> at

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
is barren other than then another at

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.679 
is barren other than then another at
this<00:00:28.680> tournament<00:00:28.919> basically<00:00:29.550> because<00:00:29.880> no<00:00:30.540> one

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
this tournament basically because no one

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.410 
this tournament basically because no one
really<00:00:30.720> knows<00:00:31.309> how<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.759> play<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.149> patch

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
really knows how to play this patch

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.669 
really knows how to play this patch
probably<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:35.160> yeah<00:00:35.699> I<00:00:36.030> think<00:00:36.300> our<00:00:36.719> MP<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.440> just

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:37.679 
probably so yeah I think our MP is just

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.209 
probably so yeah I think our MP is just
been<00:00:37.920> buffed<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.340> lot<00:00:39.440> do<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.500> think<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
been buffed a lot do you think in the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.180 
been buffed a lot do you think in the
upcoming<00:00:41.370> weeks<00:00:41.820> more<00:00:42.480> teams<00:00:42.809> will<00:00:43.230> learn<00:00:43.949> to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
upcoming weeks more teams will learn to

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.860 
upcoming weeks more teams will learn to
play<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> paladin<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.449> it<00:00:45.600> even<00:00:45.839> possible

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
play a paladin and is it even possible

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.680 
play a paladin and is it even possible
to<00:00:46.320> learn<00:00:47.160> playing<00:00:47.640> paladin<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.269> a<00:00:48.359> couple<00:00:48.629> of

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
to learn playing paladin in a couple of

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.259 
to learn playing paladin in a couple of
weeks<00:00:48.749> I<00:00:49.230> don't<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.670> look<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.059> can

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
weeks I don't think you can look you can

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.380 
weeks I don't think you can look you can
learn<00:00:51.420> our<00:00:51.629> class<00:00:51.960> 2a<00:00:52.829> 2mon<00:00:53.579> level<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
learn our class 2a 2mon level in a

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.360 
learn our class 2a 2mon level in a
couple<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.839> weeks<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.769> only<00:00:55.980> team<00:00:56.190> that's

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
couple of weeks the only team that's

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.009 
couple of weeks the only team that's
been<00:00:56.579> able<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.940> swap<00:00:57.179> classes<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.899> know

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
been able to swap classes you know

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.919 
been able to swap classes you know
efficiently<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:58.980> been<00:00:59.159> x6<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> look

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
efficiently it's been x6 and if you look

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:02.569 
efficiently it's been x6 and if you look
at<00:01:01.019> that<00:01:01.109> online<00:01:01.260> records<00:01:01.829> they<00:01:02.069> practice

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
at that online records they practice

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.380 
at that online records they practice
other<00:01:03.390> classes<00:01:03.839> a<00:01:03.870> lot<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:05.070> don't<00:01:05.940> think<00:01:06.120> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
other classes a lot so I don't think a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.530 
other classes a lot so I don't think a
few<00:01:06.780> weeks<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.259> to<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.380> enough<00:01:08.540> Kint

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
few weeks is going to be enough Kint

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.929 
few weeks is going to be enough Kint
switch<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> paladin<00:01:11.070> he<00:01:11.250> was<00:01:11.399> the<00:01:11.549> first<00:01:11.759> to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
switch to a paladin he was the first to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.980 
switch to a paladin he was the first to
do<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.290> tournament<00:01:14.810> were<00:01:15.810> you

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
do it to it in this tournament were you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.889 
do it to it in this tournament were you
surprised<00:01:16.619> did<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.130> expect<00:01:17.460> teams<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.390> switch

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
surprised did you expect teams to switch

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.800 
surprised did you expect teams to switch
to<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:20.130> peladeen<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.790> because<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.570> thats

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
to the peladeen just because it is thats

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.039 
to the peladeen just because it is thats
wrong<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:23.310> expected<00:01:24.119> pretty<00:01:24.360> much<00:01:24.540> every<00:01:24.840> team

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
wrong I expected pretty much every team

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.280 
wrong I expected pretty much every team
that<00:01:25.079> wasn't<00:01:25.680> our<00:01:25.829> MP<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.369> swap<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.820> paladin

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
that wasn't our MP to swap to a paladin

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.200 
that wasn't our MP to swap to a paladin
so<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:29.009> wasn't<00:01:29.189> surprised<00:01:29.640> at<00:01:29.759> all<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:30.090> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
so it wasn't surprised at all what I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.240 
so it wasn't surprised at all what I
thought<00:01:30.600> Kim<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:30.990> going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> run<00:01:31.500> ret<00:01:32.039> pally

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
thought Kim was going to run ret pally

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.859 
thought Kim was going to run ret pally
against<00:01:32.610> us<00:01:32.729> maybe<00:01:33.149> would<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.420> won<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.659> he

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
against us maybe would have won if he

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.929 
against us maybe would have won if he
did<00:01:34.189> so<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.969> yeah<00:01:36.180> no<00:01:36.450> surprise<00:01:36.899> at<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.939> which

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
did so so yeah no surprise at all which

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.969 
did so so yeah no surprise at all which
was<00:01:39.149> your<00:01:39.600> heart<00:01:39.840> has<00:01:39.960> meshed<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.259> far<00:01:40.619> was<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
was your heart has meshed so far was it

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.560

the<00:01:41.280> winner's<00:01:41.880> bracket<00:01:41.969> fight<00:01:42.299> against

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the winner's bracket fight against

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.170 
the winner's bracket fight against
gravitas<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.320> think<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.969> loss

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
gravitas I think it was a the loss

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.139 
gravitas I think it was a the loss
against<00:01:45.630> got<00:01:45.810> game<00:01:46.049> when<00:01:46.770> our<00:01:47.430> priest<00:01:47.759> died<00:01:47.969> in

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
against got game when our priest died in

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.709 
against got game when our priest died in
cheap<00:01:48.329> shot<00:01:48.600> every<00:01:49.049> game<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.659> think

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
cheap shot every game so do you think

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.370 
cheap shot every game so do you think
you<00:01:51.990> could<00:01:52.109> have<00:01:52.229> won<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.820> no<00:01:54.350> with<00:01:55.350> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you could have won this one no with a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.170 
you could have won this one no with a
bit<00:01:55.590> practice<00:01:56.039> with<00:01:56.250> three-point<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.789> we<00:01:57.030> could

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
bit practice with three-point I we could

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.300 
bit practice with three-point I we could
have<00:01:57.270> done<00:01:57.359> a<00:01:57.420> lot<00:01:57.630> better<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.130> because<00:01:59.130> we're

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
have done a lot better but because we're

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.910 
have done a lot better but because we're
coming<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.670> cold<00:02:00.090> into<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.570> tournament<00:02:01.140> it's

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
coming in cold into this tournament it's

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.770 
coming in cold into this tournament it's
kind<00:02:02.039> of<00:02:02.159> difficult<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.700> form<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.270> decent

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
kind of difficult to form a decent

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.289 
kind of difficult to form a decent
strategy<00:02:04.170> against<00:02:04.619> such<00:02:05.310> an<00:02:05.429> erratic<00:02:05.909> lineup

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
strategy against such an erratic lineup

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.650 
strategy against such an erratic lineup
like<00:02:06.509> rmd<00:02:07.170> against<00:02:07.770> our<00:02:07.920> MP<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.940> RMP<00:02:09.360> needs<00:02:09.570> a

like rmd against our MP the RMP needs a
lot<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.869> practice<00:02:10.259> beforehand<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.980> make<00:02:11.010> sure

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
lot of practice beforehand to make sure

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.760 
lot of practice beforehand to make sure
that<00:02:11.610> they<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.540> mitigate<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:13.230> lot

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that they can mitigate a lot

that they can mitigate a lot
a initial<00:02:14.400> burst<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.000> because<00:02:15.480> we've<00:02:15.630> had

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
a initial burst and because we've had

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.510 
a initial burst and because we've had
basically<00:02:16.080> no<00:02:16.200> practice<00:02:16.770> or<00:02:16.950> three<00:02:17.160> point<00:02:17.400> 0

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
basically no practice or three point 0

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.020 
basically no practice or three point 0

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
against that comp then we basically

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.870 
against that comp then we basically

at<00:02:39.570> all<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.260> think<00:02:40.530> at<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.130> point<00:02:41.250> maybe

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
at all and I think at that point maybe

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.190 
at all and I think at that point maybe
it<00:02:41.910> was<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.090> little<00:02:42.510> bit<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.750> desperation

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
it was a little bit of desperation

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.400 
it was a little bit of desperation

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.770 
coming into his decision making because
a<00:02:46.410> mutilate<00:02:47.340> rogue<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.090> frost<00:02:48.300> mage<00:02:48.510> at<00:02:48.690> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
a mutilate rogue and a frost mage at the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.640 
a mutilate rogue and a frost mage at the
moment<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.290> synergy<00:02:49.710> is<00:02:50.570> is<00:02:51.650> pretty

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
moment the synergy is is pretty

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.830

unstoppable and when when you're a
hunter<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.230> you've<00:02:55.440> got<00:02:55.560> no<00:02:55.740> experience<00:02:55.980> in

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
terms of colliding ability then I didn't

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.760 
terms of colliding ability then I didn't
even<00:02:59.670> use<00:02:59.880> kidney<00:03:00.180> shot<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:00.480> Sylar<00:03:01.350> in<00:03:01.620> that

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
even use kidney shot on Sylar in that

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.980 
even use kidney shot on Sylar in that
game<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.220> all<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:02.880> did<00:03:03.090> was<00:03:03.120> spam<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.570> late<00:03:03.780> and
