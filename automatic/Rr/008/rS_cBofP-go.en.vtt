is basically themed and it looks nice it
it's<00:01:56.399> fast<00:01:57.030> I'm<00:01:57.390> adding<00:01:58.200> my<00:01:58.380> stuff<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.250> see

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
it's fast I'm adding my stuff and to see

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.840 
it's fast I'm adding my stuff and to see
how<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.790> fares<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.420> all<00:02:00.689> my<00:02:00.930> applications

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
how it fares with all my applications

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.310 
how it fares with all my applications
but<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.090> don't<00:02:03.329> think<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.689> will<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.930> much<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
but I don't think it will have much of a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.999 
but I don't think it will have much of a
problem<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:06.409> think<00:02:07.409> if<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.680> turn<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
problem I think if you turn the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.260 
problem I think if you turn the
animations<00:02:08.550> off<00:02:08.759> or<00:02:09.770> add<00:02:10.770> your<00:02:11.489> own<00:02:11.520> launcher

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
animations off or add your own launcher

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.260 
animations off or add your own launcher
here

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
here

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.040 
here
some<00:02:13.510> as<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:14.440> can<00:02:14.590> see<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.950> app<00:02:15.750> app<00:02:16.750> drawer

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
some as you can see the app app drawer

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.660 
some as you can see the app app drawer
button<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:18.240> don't<00:02:19.240> really<00:02:19.420> like<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.960> it's<00:02:20.890> it's

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.120 
button I don't really like it it's it's
not<00:02:21.850> very<00:02:22.060> nice<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:23.350> if<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.740> add<00:02:23.860> your<00:02:24.070> own

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
not very nice so if you add your own

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.570 
not very nice so if you add your own
launch<00:02:24.520> or<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.880> can<00:02:25.030> fix<00:02:25.210> all<00:02:25.420> this<00:02:25.570> stuff<00:02:25.810> and
