let's do a backsplash for it so we
measured<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.590> he's<00:01:43.920> making<00:01:44.220> tile<00:01:44.460> I'm

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
measured it out he's making tile I'm

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.179 
measured it out he's making tile I'm
making<00:01:45.149> time<00:01:45.390> yeah

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
making time yeah

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
there you go just great and you use the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.539 
there you go just great and you use the
board<00:01:49.319> to<00:01:49.439> keep<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.770> from<00:01:49.920> getting<00:01:50.069> into<00:01:50.399> your

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
board to keep it from getting into your

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.120 
board to keep it from getting into your
other<00:01:50.789> color<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:51.509> look<00:01:51.840> at<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:53.009> now

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
other color right look at that and now

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.739 
other color right look at that and now
we've<00:01:53.280> filled<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:53.939> tin<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.569> fun

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:54.749 
we've filled up the tin this is the fun

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.099 
we've filled up the tin this is the fun
part<00:01:55.020> about<00:01:55.079> stuff<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.399> real

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
part about stuff it can be real

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.120 
part about stuff it can be real
laborious<00:01:58.109> at<00:01:58.289> times<00:01:58.500> that's<00:01:58.740> why<00:01:58.859> we<00:01:58.950> made<00:01:59.100> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
laborious at times that's why we made a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.709 
laborious at times that's why we made a
sort<00:01:59.429> of<00:01:59.460> wonky<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.060> sort<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.329> off-center

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
sort of wonky and sort of off-center

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.149 
sort of wonky and sort of off-center
because<00:02:01.109> then<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.319> can<00:02:01.469> make<00:02:01.560> mistakes

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
because then you can make mistakes

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.419 
because then you can make mistakes
nobody<00:02:02.549> knows<00:02:02.729> yeah<00:02:03.780> all<00:02:04.380> right<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.979> after

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
nobody knows yeah all right so after

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.910 
nobody knows yeah all right so after
that<00:02:05.630> with<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> backboard<00:02:07.140> went<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.560> they

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
that with a backboard went on they

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.380 
that with a backboard went on they
attach<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.519> back<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:08.819> yeah<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.209> had

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
attach to the back of this yeah we had

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.630 
attach to the back of this yeah we had
to<00:02:09.420> actually<00:02:09.690> pre-cut<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> backboard<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.280> that

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
to actually pre-cut a backboard so that

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.400 
to actually pre-cut a backboard so that
is<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.849> piece<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.330> added<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.290> then

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
is a piece that we added to it and then

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.470 
is a piece that we added to it and then
also<00:02:13.590> we<00:02:13.860> meet<00:02:14.099> we<00:02:14.340> made<00:02:14.519> a<00:02:14.549> refrigerator<00:02:15.180> door

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480
