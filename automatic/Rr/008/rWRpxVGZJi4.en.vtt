is<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.730> very<00:00:33.940> first<00:00:34.270> Need<00:00:34.750> for<00:00:34.780> Speed<00:00:36.870> that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
is the very first Need for Speed that

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.590 
is the very first Need for Speed that
came<00:00:38.110> out<00:00:38.350> on<00:00:38.380> the<00:00:38.560> PlayStation<00:00:39.430> series<00:00:40.180> I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
came out on the PlayStation series I

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.740 
came out on the PlayStation series I
think<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.800> is<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.010> port<00:00:42.640> from<00:00:43.000> the<00:00:43.210> 3do

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
think this is a port from the 3do

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.130 
think this is a port from the 3do
version<00:00:44.610> although<00:00:45.610> I'm<00:00:45.760> not<00:00:46.000> 100%<00:00:46.840> sure<00:00:46.930> about

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
version although I'm not 100% sure about

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.960 
version although I'm not 100% sure about
that<00:00:47.710> and<00:00:48.220> I<00:00:49.180> really<00:00:49.690> like<00:00:49.900> it<00:00:50.200> this<00:00:50.620> was<00:00:50.970> back

that and I really like it this was back

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.080 
that and I really like it this was back
in<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.330> day<00:00:52.510> when<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.980> Need<00:00:54.310> for<00:00:54.340> Speed<00:00:54.580> was

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
in the day when the Need for Speed was

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.530 
in the day when the Need for Speed was
actually<00:00:56.070> fresh<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:57.490> was<00:00:57.700> actually<00:00:58.150> had<00:00:58.330> more

of<00:00:58.630> a<00:00:58.720> focus<00:00:59.140> on<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.410> race<00:00:59.590> inside<00:01:00.160> of<00:01:00.370> things

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
of a focus on the race inside of things

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.780 
of a focus on the race inside of things

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
game but it was a it's like yeah kind of

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.199 
game but it was a it's like yeah kind of
seen<00:03:55.660> some<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.650> these<00:03:56.740> tracks<00:03:57.100> before<00:03:57.370> now<00:03:57.850> can

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
then they need for speed hot pursuit

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.660 
then they need for speed hot pursuit
which<00:04:05.470> kind<00:04:05.709> of<00:04:05.770> went<00:04:05.920> back<00:04:06.070> on<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.340> streets

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
which kind of went back on the streets

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.730 
which kind of went back on the streets
but<00:04:06.880> then<00:04:07.060> it's<00:04:07.270> like<00:04:07.530> police<00:04:08.530> vs.<00:04:10.380> driver<00:04:11.380> and

but then it's like police vs. driver and

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.830 
but then it's like police vs. driver and
you<00:04:11.830> can<00:04:12.040> be<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.310> police<00:04:12.640> or<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.150> getaway

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
you can be the police or the getaway

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.860 
you can be the police or the getaway
driver<00:04:14.230> or<00:04:14.709> whatever<00:04:15.130> act<00:04:15.459> on<00:04:15.640> that<00:04:15.880> and<00:04:16.239> then

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
all the growth for high functioning

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.670 
all the growth for high functioning
graphics<00:05:07.180> and<00:05:07.360> all<00:05:07.450> that<00:05:07.630> kind<00:05:07.900> of<00:05:08.050> splendor

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
graphics and all that kind of splendor

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.550 
graphics and all that kind of splendor
and<00:05:09.150> it<00:05:10.150> is<00:05:10.300> still<00:05:10.600> pretty<00:05:10.870> good<00:05:11.050> to<00:05:11.229> look<00:05:11.350> at<00:05:11.500> I

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
and it is still pretty good to look at I

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.190 
and it is still pretty good to look at I
like<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:12.040> variety<00:05:12.160> in<00:05:13.120> the<00:05:13.419> environments

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
like the variety in the environments

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.320 
like the variety in the environments
that<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.500> racing<00:05:14.979> in<00:05:15.100> and<00:05:15.250> stuff<00:05:15.850> like<00:05:16.060> that

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
that you racing in and stuff like that

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.550 
that you racing in and stuff like that
it<00:05:16.540> was<00:05:16.720> something<00:05:17.169> that

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
it was something that

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.810 
it was something that
you<00:05:18.620> know<00:05:18.740> appealed<00:05:19.430> to<00:05:19.580> me<00:05:19.820> and<00:05:20.360> I<00:05:21.610> don't<00:05:22.610> know

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
you know appealed to me and I don't know

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.930 
you know appealed to me and I don't know
if<00:05:22.880> it<00:05:23.000> uses<00:05:23.300> a<00:05:23.330> similar<00:05:23.750> engine<00:05:24.110> to<00:05:24.680> Road<00:05:25.669> Rash

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
if it uses a similar engine to Road Rash

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.150 
if it uses a similar engine to Road Rash
32-bit<00:05:26.870> I<00:05:27.080> couldn't<00:05:27.440> really<00:05:27.590> tell<00:05:27.950> you

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
32-bit I couldn't really tell you

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.000 
32-bit I couldn't really tell you
there's<00:05:29.000> some<00:05:29.240> bits<00:05:29.450> of<00:05:29.600> it<00:05:29.780> do<00:05:29.960> remind<00:05:30.440> me<00:05:30.590> and

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.570 

yeah<00:05:34.010> as<00:05:34.340> I<00:05:34.490> say<00:05:34.700> it<00:05:34.970> is<00:05:35.090> good<00:05:35.360> is<00:05:35.660> well<00:05:35.960> worth

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
yeah as I say it is good is well worth

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.010 
yeah as I say it is good is well worth
it's<00:05:37.580> well<00:05:37.850> worth<00:05:38.060> checking<00:05:38.389> out<00:05:38.600> you<00:05:38.810> can

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
it's well worth checking out you can

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.170 
it's well worth checking out you can
probably<00:05:39.230> pick<00:05:39.650> this<00:05:39.860> up<00:05:40.100> quite<00:05:40.580> cheap<00:05:40.970> now

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
probably pick this up quite cheap now

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.790 
probably pick this up quite cheap now
and<00:05:41.389> I<00:05:41.480> think<00:05:41.810> I<00:05:41.960> paid<00:05:44.260> couple<00:05:45.260> of<00:05:45.350> pounds<00:05:45.770> for

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
and I think I paid couple of pounds for

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.040 
and I think I paid couple of pounds for
this<00:05:46.100> didn't<00:05:46.910> pay<00:05:47.060> an<00:05:47.180> awful<00:05:47.570> lot<00:05:47.750> for<00:05:47.990> it

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
this didn't pay an awful lot for it

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.760 
this didn't pay an awful lot for it
that's<00:05:48.260> all<00:05:48.470> and<00:05:48.800> it<00:05:49.340> was<00:05:49.550> well<00:05:49.790> worth<00:05:50.060> having

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
that's all and it was well worth having

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.390 
that's all and it was well worth having
a<00:05:51.770> look<00:05:51.800> at<00:05:53.410> simply<00:05:54.410> really<00:05:54.830> if<00:05:54.919> nothing<00:05:55.250> else

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
a look at simply really if nothing else

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.850 
a look at simply really if nothing else
to<00:05:55.700> actually<00:05:55.820> see<00:05:56.300> Need<00:05:56.570> for<00:05:56.600> Speed<00:05:56.810> as<00:05:57.320> it<00:05:57.590> was

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
to actually see Need for Speed as it was

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.900 
to actually see Need for Speed as it was
as<00:05:58.220> it<00:05:58.460> started<00:05:59.090> and<00:05:59.830> in<00:06:00.830> my<00:06:01.040> opinion<00:06:01.190> has<00:06:01.790> he

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
as it started and in my opinion has he

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.909 
as it started and in my opinion has he

suggesting that they should have just
kept<00:06:05.570> doing<00:06:05.780> the<00:06:05.960> same<00:06:05.990> old<00:06:06.229> thing<00:06:06.740> for<00:06:07.600> some
