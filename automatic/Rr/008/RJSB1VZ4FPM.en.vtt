00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 the double double you dc keynote is now 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.870
 over and as we already have in advance 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.680
 actually ios 8 was expected 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.960
 presented 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.969
 the apple developers so the people the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.880
 Apple have a develop account 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.100
 already ios 8 beta 1 from the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.199
 download dev center and on your 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.359
 Use registered devices and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.060
 try and so on and if you are 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.310
 no developer since but still ios 8 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.230
 beta 1 in this case, or else 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.420
 later, of course, beta 2 beta 3 and so on 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.920
 should try further then should 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.099
 you watch this video a lot 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.099
 fun 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.329
 to use ios beta version 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.519
 you need a device which apple 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.289
 registered as a developer is the 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.269
 the idea happens via the ju 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.339
 unique device number the every 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.350
 iphone every ipad and also every ipod 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.809
 owns touch and if this number 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.969
 is registered then you can also 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.530
 use beta version of ios 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.780
 luckily you have to go now 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.760
 not for 80 euros a year a developer 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.740
 buy account at apple it is enough 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.360
 the only idea is the ju of the self 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.119
 to register with a developer 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.580
 most do that for about five 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.289
 this is true for a whole year 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.569
 could all for a year then basically all 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.399
 ios beta version use the come out 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:19.450
 and of course that's right now 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.240
 quite a lot 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.130
 about every two three four weeks in 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.100
 the rhythm is about the new come 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.720
 ios 8 beta version out and yes you 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.039
 then you can just download 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.990
 I also have a developer account 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.850
 and I also have some slots available 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.039
 I can give you a small donation 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.289
 So also gladly enter your july 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.250
 the link so my e-mail address in 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.110
 The reason is below in the description 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.810
 easy time on it go to me a mail 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.069
 Write and then we clarify that from me 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.140
 show you now for the first time as her 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.929
 idea and then of course 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.660
 also how to install ios 8 beta 1 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.879
 you can open itunes first 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.170
 and connect your white to the computer 

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:58.390
 then yes this opens here 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.979
 Survey page and you see which 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.110
 device have connected here in my 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.819
 fall an iphone 5s and then you have 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.390
 here for example the serial number 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.769
 stand 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.810
 and if you now click a left 

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:09.759
 on the serial number makes then changes 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.290
 this field and there is the idea 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.239
 and behind it is just one 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.519
 pretty long code consists of 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.290
 Letters and numbers and that's exactly 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.120
 this number we need 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.349
 if you make a right-click on it 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.330
 then you can do the whole thing directly in 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.739
 copy the clipboard that is 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.540
 you can not miss any mistakes or 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.769
 So build something with such a long code 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.989
 of course, can happen 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.700
 So just right-click copy and 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.400
 the whole then to the developer or 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.090
 Stop sending me and that was it 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.620
 already everything 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.890
 of course we have to continue now 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.349
 and download the ios 8 beta first down 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.239
 there is currently no page for 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.190
 It will be over the next few hours 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.080
 go online you can find the link below 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.670
 in the description so you know how 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.319
 The whole thing looks like I show you here 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.020
 once the site from last year 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.170
 so 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.150
 ios 7 was downloadable and there you see 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.190
 So all the different devices with 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.800
 the individual download links the whole 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.970
 then leads you to mega dot co there 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.700
 you can just download it 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.600
 without any problems and then we are 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.090
 even at the last step 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.920
 arrived before we get the ios 8 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.050
 install beta version we hang up 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.000
 every case before a backup to that is 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.800
 very important it is a beta 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.900
 version and of course we do not want one 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.770
 data loss so something can go wrong 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.140
 go very clear 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.420
 and that's why it's always important 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.370
 have current backup either on 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.530
 Now click yourself or a simple 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.820
 Create backup in the icloud like you 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.280
 that would rather like 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.500
 also you have to on your iphone or 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.600
 ipad still looking for my iphone 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.400
 disable function there you go 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.410
 just in the settings on iCloud 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.420
 and then push the regulator at mine 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.550
 Search iphone enter password to be 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.900
 then this is disabled 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.910
 is in the reason of this theft protection 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.200
 so no other your iphone 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.180
 can restore 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.770
 and if that's all done then 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.300
 you can either go to 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.860
 search updates or iphone 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.370
 Restore what you prefer to click 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.959
 would like to 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.850
 it also works with after updates 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.380
 search and the great is there are yours 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.730
 data then directly on it that is 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.800
 you have no stress with the backup 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.050
 so I would say again 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.790
 Are you looking for updates if you are 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.260
 have a windows computer then hold 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.420
 you press the shift key and click 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.670
 if you press a mac from then on 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.950
 you the old key and then presses 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.230
 looking for updates then comes this 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.060
 window here and then you go into the 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.470
 path in download folder for example 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.170
 or where you are at least 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.750
 where you have the ios 8 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.880
 downloaded beta version and 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.130
 the world then clicks open 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.919
 the whole is checked with apple and 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.260
 then ios 8 beta will be yours 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.180
 iphone up playing it was then 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.530
 more steps are not necessary 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.280
 I almost all this very quickly 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.070
 together 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.370
 So you have to register your juli id 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.169
 the ios 8 beta firmware from the network 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.750
 the links are in the 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.180
 description then create a backup 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.520
 Disable my iphone and search 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.800
 then then the firmware file 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.690
 play it all is so fast 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.030
 It can go and then I would say 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.040
 I wish you much fun with ios eight 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.550
 As I said it is a beta can 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.440
 mistake before 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.140
 Do not be mad if there is something 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.300
 and then if it bothers too much 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.590
 Just go back to ios 7 and 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.180
 maybe the next beta again 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.650
 Try it definitely 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.570
 really fun to try around 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.890
 I can only tell you and become with me 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.420
 Of course, it's the whole thing 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.400
 give beta version videos 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.810
 I hope you are looking forward to it and 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.430
 then I would say if you have the video 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.840
 has fallen or helped shows it to me 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.000
 happy with a thumbs up or 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.050
 a comment and then we'll see each other 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.050
 in the next video ciao
