type of grass tutorial in this tutorial
I'm<00:00:05.279> just<00:00:05.310> gonna<00:00:05.609> cover<00:00:05.850> real<00:00:06.089> quick<00:00:06.299> how<00:00:06.450> to

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
I'm just gonna cover real quick how to

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.500 
I'm just gonna cover real quick how to
make<00:00:06.750> hardened<00:00:07.049> paper<00:00:08.059> like<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.240> sheet

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
make hardened paper like this sheet

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.280 
make hardened paper like this sheet
right<00:00:09.719> here<00:00:11.000> and<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.179> hard<00:00:12.420> paper<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.929> pretty

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
right here and so hard paper is pretty

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.039 
right here and so hard paper is pretty
much<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.559> basis<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.309> making<00:00:15.299> any<00:00:15.599> part<00:00:15.900> in

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
much the basis for making any part in

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.099 
much the basis for making any part in
this<00:00:16.260> kind<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.560> paper<00:00:16.800> crafting<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:18.109> it's

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
this kind of paper crafting and it's

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.509 
this kind of paper crafting and it's
pretty<00:00:19.350> much<00:00:19.850> it's<00:00:20.850> actually<00:00:20.970> quite<00:00:21.420> simple

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
pretty much it's actually quite simple

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.759 
pretty much it's actually quite simple
what<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:23.970> take<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> sheet<00:00:25.740> of

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
what I do is just take like a sheet of

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.580 
what I do is just take like a sheet of
normal<00:00:26.400> printer<00:00:26.640> paper<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.380> fold<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.439> twice

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
normal printer paper and fold it twice

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.910 
normal printer paper and fold it twice
where<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.130> glue<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.429> between<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:31.830> you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
where it's glue in between and so if you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.690 
where it's glue in between and so if you
let<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.099> dry<00:00:32.189> for<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.030> couple<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.450> hours<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:34.700> can

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
let it dry for a couple of hours you can

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.760 
let it dry for a couple of hours you can
make<00:00:35.940> like<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.630> little<00:00:36.989> sheet<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.530> foreign

paper like this just gonna show you real
quick<00:00:42.930> how<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.520> do<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:47.090> first<00:00:48.110> one<00:00:50.480> side<00:00:53.719> so

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
quick how I do this so first one side so

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.119 
quick how I do this so first one side so
once<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.110> fold<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:56.809> apply<00:00:57.809> glue<00:00:58.050> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
once you fold it just apply glue and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.279 
once you fold it just apply glue and
most<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> thumb<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.780> used<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
most of the thumb I just used like a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.399 
most of the thumb I just used like a
little<00:01:01.859> piece<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.160> cardboard<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:03.290> spread<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
little piece of cardboard to spread the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.779 
little piece of cardboard to spread the
glue

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:16.160 

death<00:01:10.399> then<00:01:11.399> just<00:01:12.740> love<00:01:14.600> I'm<00:01:15.600> sure<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:16.049> all

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
death then just love I'm sure it's all

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:28.630 
death then just love I'm sure it's all
even

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:48.450 

or<00:01:29.420> which<00:01:29.570> ones

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.840 

and<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:49.869> at<00:01:50.869> this<00:01:51.020> point<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.500> could<00:01:51.800> like<00:01:52.580> make

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
and so at this point you could like make

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.140 
and so at this point you could like make
another<00:01:53.090> one<00:01:53.240> of<00:01:53.270> these<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:54.759> glue<00:01:55.759> those<00:01:55.970> in

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
another one of these and glue those in

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.609 
another one of these and glue those in
each<00:01:56.240> others<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:56.750> have<00:01:56.960> like<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.200> larger

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
each others so you have like a larger

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.490 
each others so you have like a larger
sheet<00:01:57.860> of<00:01:58.009> your<00:01:58.100> hard<00:01:58.400> paper<00:01:58.720> but<00:01:59.720> usually<00:02:00.350> are

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
sheet of your hard paper but usually are

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.240 
sheet of your hard paper but usually are
just<00:02:00.710> making<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.130> size<00:02:02.979> so<00:02:04.300> well<00:02:05.300> again<00:02:06.250> and

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
just making this size so well again and

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.400 
just making this size so well again and
now<00:02:07.940> once<00:02:08.810> you've<00:02:08.959> made<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:11.030> little<00:02:11.989> chiffon

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
now once you've made a little chiffon

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.790 
now once you've made a little chiffon
paper<00:02:12.709> like<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:14.110> obviously<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.380> still<00:02:15.620> needs

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
paper like that obviously it still needs

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.840 
paper like that obviously it still needs
to<00:02:15.920> dry<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.840> what<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.200> do<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.730> for<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.820> first

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
to dry and what I do is for the first

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.960 
to dry and what I do is for the first
couple<00:02:20.330> of<00:02:20.360> hours<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:21.340> put<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.370> couple<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.730> books

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
couple of hours I put a couple of books

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.009 
couple of hours I put a couple of books
on<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:24.220> but<00:02:25.220> no<00:02:25.850> matter<00:02:26.000> how<00:02:26.209> long<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.660> let<00:02:26.870> it

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
on it but no matter how long you let it

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.180 
on it but no matter how long you let it
dry<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:28.250> always<00:02:28.489> ends<00:02:29.000> up<00:02:29.380> warping<00:02:30.380> or<00:02:30.590> curving

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
dry it always ends up warping or curving

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.540 
dry it always ends up warping or curving
and<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:33.140> there's<00:02:33.530> really<00:02:34.100> no<00:02:34.340> way<00:02:34.370> of

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
and so there's really no way of

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.900 
and so there's really no way of
defending<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.690> from<00:02:36.560> happening<00:02:36.890> as<00:02:37.580> far<00:02:37.760> as

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
defending that from happening as far as

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.080 
defending that from happening as far as
I<00:02:38.000> know<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:40.040> what<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.250> do<00:02:40.370> most<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:40.940> time

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
I know and so what I do most of the time

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.670 
I know and so what I do most of the time
is<00:02:42.250> once<00:02:43.250> I've<00:02:43.400> made<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.730> something<00:02:44.000> like<00:02:44.150> this

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
is once I've made it something like this

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.009 
is once I've made it something like this
and<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.799> needs<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.070> dry<00:02:46.400> alright<00:02:46.850> like<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.780> said

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
and it needs to dry alright like I said

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.720 
and it needs to dry alright like I said
the<00:02:48.380> first<00:02:48.560> couple<00:02:48.860> of<00:02:48.890> hours<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.310> put<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.549> couple

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
the first couple of hours I put a couple

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.479 
the first couple of hours I put a couple
of<00:02:49.850> books<00:02:50.030> on<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:51.230> after<00:02:51.500> does<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.860> take

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
of books on it and after does I take

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.280 
of books on it and after does I take
them<00:02:52.670> off<00:02:52.790> let's<00:02:53.360> try<00:02:53.600> some<00:02:53.810> more<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.170> then

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
them off let's try some more and then

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.479 
them off let's try some more and then
it's<00:02:54.410> gonna<00:02:54.620> warp<00:02:55.329> however<00:02:57.130> if<00:02:58.130> it's<00:02:58.340> gonna

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
it's gonna warp however if it's gonna

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.550 
it's gonna warp however if it's gonna
warp<00:02:58.760> it's<00:02:58.970> gonna<00:02:59.150> curve<00:02:59.390> upwards<00:03:00.049> like<00:03:00.350> that

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
warp it's gonna curve upwards like that

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.160 
warp it's gonna curve upwards like that
and<00:03:01.459> once<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.820> looks<00:03:02.090> like<00:03:02.299> that<00:03:02.480> I'm<00:03:02.989> just

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
and once it looks like that I'm just

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.630 
and once it looks like that I'm just
gonna<00:03:03.290> turn<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.560> around<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:04.250> then<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:04.519> gonna

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
gonna turn it around and then it's gonna

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.690 
gonna turn it around and then it's gonna
curve<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.690> other<00:03:05.810> way<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.400> once<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.549> done

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
curve the other way and once it done

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.229 
curve the other way and once it done
that<00:03:07.850> a<00:03:07.910> couple<00:03:07.970> of<00:03:08.239> times<00:03:09.579> at<00:03:10.579> some<00:03:10.970> point

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
that a couple of times at some point

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.900 
that a couple of times at some point
it's<00:03:11.690> gonna<00:03:11.870> stop<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:13.160> it's<00:03:13.310> gonna<00:03:13.430> stay<00:03:13.670> flat

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
it's gonna stop and it's gonna stay flat

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.850 
it's gonna stop and it's gonna stay flat
like<00:03:14.480> for<00:03:14.989> example<00:03:15.049> this<00:03:15.410> piece<00:03:15.620> right<00:03:15.799> here

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
like for example this piece right here

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.690 
like for example this piece right here
or<00:03:16.820> relatively<00:03:17.390> flat<00:03:17.630> of<00:03:17.780> course<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.700> it's

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
or relatively flat of course and it's

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.210 
or relatively flat of course and it's
really<00:03:19.880> important<00:03:20.329> that<00:03:20.360> you<00:03:20.829> wait<00:03:21.829> for<00:03:22.070> that

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
really important that you wait for that

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.310 
really important that you wait for that
to<00:03:22.340> happen<00:03:22.549> otherwise<00:03:23.239> if<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.870> start<00:03:24.110> making

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
to happen otherwise if you start making

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.030 
to happen otherwise if you start making
corners<00:03:24.739> out<00:03:24.829> of<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.420> at<00:03:26.420> that<00:03:26.480> point<00:03:27.040> before

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
corners out of it at that point before

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.880 
corners out of it at that point before
it's<00:03:28.180> completely<00:03:29.650> stopped<00:03:30.650> curving

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
it's completely stopped curving

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.869 
it's completely stopped curving
you're<00:03:33.610> parsing<00:03:33.939> of<00:03:34.209> end<00:03:34.569> up<00:03:35.430> bending<00:03:36.430> as<00:03:36.670> such

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
you're parsing of end up bending as such

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.910 
you're parsing of end up bending as such
and<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:37.209> don't<00:03:37.689> want<00:03:37.870> that<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.049> happen<00:03:38.170> so

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
and you don't want that to happen so

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.339 
and you don't want that to happen so
I've<00:03:39.700> made<00:03:39.849> a<00:03:39.909> little<00:03:40.030> color<00:03:40.299> a<00:03:40.780> little

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
I've made a little color a little

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:52.080 
I've made a little color a little
time-lapse<00:03:41.829> video<00:03:42.129> about<00:03:42.480> about<00:03:43.480> things

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:59.700 

you

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.170 

okay<00:05:00.710> so<00:05:00.770> that's<00:05:01.340> pretty<00:05:01.520> much<00:05:01.610> it<00:05:01.730> for<00:05:01.940> this

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
okay so that's pretty much it for this

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.000 
okay so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial<00:05:02.360> so<00:05:03.170> I'm<00:05:03.320> just<00:05:03.470> gonna<00:05:03.650> let<00:05:03.830> this<00:05:03.950> dry

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
tutorial so I'm just gonna let this dry

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.820 
tutorial so I'm just gonna let this dry
now<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:05.980> after<00:05:06.980> that<00:05:07.160> I<00:05:07.460> again<00:05:07.730> I<00:05:08.530> think<00:05:09.530> I'm

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
now and after that I again I think I'm

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.400 
now and after that I again I think I'm
gonna<00:05:10.240> work<00:05:11.240> some<00:05:11.450> more<00:05:11.540> to<00:05:11.720> Tokarev<00:05:12.140> and

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
gonna work some more to Tokarev and

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.040 
gonna work some more to Tokarev and
finish<00:05:13.040> that<00:05:13.570> before<00:05:14.570> making<00:05:14.870> more<00:05:15.080> tutorials

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
finish that before making more tutorials

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.890 
finish that before making more tutorials
so<00:05:18.050> yeah<00:05:18.260> that's<00:05:18.500> pretty<00:05:18.860> much<00:05:19.070> it<00:05:19.160> for<00:05:19.400> now
