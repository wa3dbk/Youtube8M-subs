00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.910
 channel share videos terrible and I decided 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.380
 play next car game again 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.910
 In general, I will ride but today on 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.990
 such monsters who are me 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.470
 constantly surprised 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:36.340
 how fast is he quick fast in general 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.980
 dangerous since basically how much 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.080
 I played in the next car game I was rammed 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.739
 these kids today i decided on it 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.890
 ride try what is it 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:52.570
 so let's take a ride let's go 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.790
 Asphalt I do not know there so well so here 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.600
 leave everything as it is so okay 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:02.110
 laps 5 let's seven laps let's do everything 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.750
 start flight so Well Well let's see how he 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.600
 manifest itself 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:13.280
 I then think it is generally cheerful 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.729
 apparatik but anyway 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.880
 he bumps into me constantly 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:23.810
 that is why i think that it is the waters of the river 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.729
 probably I think so because more on 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.030
 it almost never went so I 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.860
 I can't think for sure yet 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.730
 so Well let's just on it 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.140
 let's not go here to pull the cat 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.620
 so it starts 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.350
 how it starts fast enough 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.060
 abruptly but here 's something even me back 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.970
 the wing failed this bucket taranus 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.450
 well guys i'm already here because of a pair of nothing 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.729
 I don’t see that I don’t know that it’s the same 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.740
 happens and in general everything is as always 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:01.140
 by crashed all one another loosened with 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.030
 the tracks he is there all just fly so quieter 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.119
 not under me not under me not in me oh oh 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.300
 oh oh oh i have it i'm even really 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.660
 I rammed nobody and I already have 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.610
 almost from the car well, now this is my joint 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.130
 so but me here immediately vigorous 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.870
 so kicked in the backside dispersed therefore 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.590
 I will not stay so quietly quiet 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.000
 quietly calm guys so let's you without 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.000
 aggression will somehow be on me 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.880
 psycho braked with should have been here but u 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:39.620
 I is not got oh guys i 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.270
 yes you are a bitch at the gate so I have a hat 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.170
 on the roof was on general my car in 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.980
 porridge guys all this completely I think 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.540
 instant losing now 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.480
 since all I have is number 13 out of 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.780
 24 but in principle you know the guys because 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.230
 they 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.930
 Well, since I don't drive, maybe I'm still in 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.459
 Basically, I'll catch them 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.989
 so let's accelerate 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.900
 quickly razgonchik let's come on come on 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.600
 damn sorry I took her a little does not go 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.480
 nifiga although in principle if competently in 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.070
 turns they go in like i usually 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.480
 in one place so well here is nothing 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.250
 not visible so let's go 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.989
 hush-hush-hush-hush on the apex we enter 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.900
 here you need to be inhibited like this 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.459
 drift a little in 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.269
 so actually one character we already 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.939
 sighed 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.810
 so it became two here on the way too 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:38.650
 it’s kind of dumb right there 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.239
 character go to landfill 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.790
 only the guy survive here so 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.389
 let's go in the trash his view of 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.000
 I do not know it is unlikely it would have 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:53.540
 went in real life since 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.680
 Well, you can see for yourself, and especially my manners 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:01.909
 drive them damage to it already affects 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:04.040
 so the third lap went and I'm still at 11 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.209
 the only place well damn just to all 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.299
 approached again at this turn 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.919
 flew him constantly fly out so I 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.980
 don't do the scene on it so poured out 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:14.930
 well, well, quietly, quietly, quietly 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.310
 quiet quiet quiet so 1 rebetenka 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:24.199
 who unfolded it I have 10 already place 10 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.970
 n it's good i was 9 still it would be 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.229
 generally excellent so often in a sharp 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.530
 the turn will be yes guys 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.720
 date, too, a couple I do not know what they are doing here 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.849
 damn well guys it seems to me they of course 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.090
 fly a couple more but I still have to 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:41.180
 the tail there is one damage nature so 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.940
 I need to be more careful on 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.270
 the road is so quiet quiet brake brake quiet 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.199
 quiet quiet well please no but japanese 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.960
 policeman 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:54.409
 again I lost these two places 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.849
 this is why I took the bucket well, 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:01.099
 goddamn babay guys it's scary 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:04.820
 scary to know that you're on the twelfth 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:07.159
 place but from 24 it is good I do not know where 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.840
 there 1 here this half here which i am there 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.330
 I don’t know they’re probably still old 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.680
 everyone crashed on crashed 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.129
 all were scattered here 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:22.340
 in the corners are 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:25.530
 so where else we lost 12 it is a fact 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.810
 so let's get gas 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.790
 catch up with at least seventh place I need 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.920
 exactly snatch it exactly 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:36.330
 fortune teller do not go need to tear it do not know 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.030
 so neatly as quiet as 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.680
 what are you drifting here so quietly come on 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.780
 give gas gas gas i owe it to me 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.920
 flinch so from the cabin can not see anything 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.530
 so here so here so here basically 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.070
 nothing to drive but also somehow defective 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.650
 know so on 1 we sent now how 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.170

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.180
 not bad I already like it 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:03.590
 like guys so quieter quieter quieter quieter 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:07.770
 you are a little quieter 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:10.409
 11 place as a pancake food but I need 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.169
 somehow hold on 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.929
 this guys need a hundred percent to keep but 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:18.719

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.289

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.540
 this is unlikely but can win if
