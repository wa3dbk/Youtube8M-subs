battery<00:02:47.120> for<00:02:48.120> his<00:02:48.300> legs

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.960 

yeah<00:02:58.650> it's<00:02:58.830> pretty<00:02:59.070> cool<00:02:59.430> he's<00:02:59.580> probably<00:02:59.790> just

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
yeah it's pretty cool he's probably just

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:11.690 
yeah it's pretty cool he's probably just
short<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.660> 10<00:03:01.650> inches<00:03:02.160> tall<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:11.370> doing<00:03:11.670> a

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
short of 10 inches tall and doing a

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.060 
short of 10 inches tall and doing a
little<00:03:11.760> bit<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.120> size<00:03:12.360> comparison<00:03:12.630> here

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:42.369 

Bongo<00:03:20.070> beat<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.370> stand

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:52.119 

and<00:03:42.470> we'll<00:03:43.310> put<00:03:44.200> Optimus<00:03:45.200> next<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.890> them<00:03:46.010> so<00:03:51.129> I

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
and we'll put Optimus next to them so I

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.479 
and we'll put Optimus next to them so I
think<00:03:52.519> laughter<00:03:52.670> mrs.<00:03:52.970> just<00:03:53.329> a<00:03:53.450> bit<00:03:53.599> taller<00:03:53.959> so

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.309 

you<00:03:58.489> get<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.700> rough<00:03:59.000> idea<00:03:59.180> how<00:03:59.690> tall<00:04:00.049> you<00:04:00.170> will

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
you get a rough idea how tall you will

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:32.600 
you get a rough idea how tall you will
be

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.500 

and<00:04:33.610> probably<00:04:34.420> about<00:04:35.790> 70%<00:04:36.790> of<00:04:36.940> this<00:04:37.120> is<00:04:37.300> all

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
and probably about 70% of this is all

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.370 
and probably about 70% of this is all
custom<00:04:37.870> made<00:04:38.620> from<00:04:39.520> all<00:04:39.880> Transformers<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:41.080> used

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380

Megatron<00:05:20.629> Voyager<00:05:21.229> Class<00:05:21.379> I<00:05:21.800> think<00:05:22.129> it<00:05:22.250> was

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
Megatron Voyager Class I think it was

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.700 
Megatron Voyager Class I think it was
and<00:05:24.169> and<00:05:24.789> an<00:05:25.789> old<00:05:26.270> robot<00:05:26.870> model<00:05:27.169> kit<00:05:27.349> I've<00:05:27.530> had
