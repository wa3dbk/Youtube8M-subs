 so three engines the 120 240 and 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.920
 the 150 horses with a maneuverability 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.050
 exemplary in town a payload 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.480
 important since we go in the version 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.810
 4 tons 5 up to 2 tons 7 load 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.610
 useful 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.030
 so it's really the urban vehicle 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.030
 ultimate 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.760
 for whoever is right after who 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.650
 has just been renewed the new 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.810
 the new renault master so a 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.210
 vehicle that is completely re design 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.580
 and new powers since 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.710
 now we go from 110 to 165 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.119
 horses passing through 225 and 135 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.190
 horses 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:21.000
 bi turbo technology on the 135 and 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.009
 165 and then serial passage with the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.369
 convenient the stop and start also on 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.740
 the on the 135 65 engines shows the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.060
 little last one of the capes of m i 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.720
 completely a new vehicle that 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.069
 just cover the segment the segment of 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.020
 boats swimming the range distribution is 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.130
 due to the tonnage of the utility range you 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.409
 have a bus and a vehicle that we go 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.170
 find in 150 horses on the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.940
 versions 3 tons 5 5 tons 6 and 6.5 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.440
 I did not talk about the 5 ton 6 version 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.229
 That's really something 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.409
 is going to be pretty marginal and so 150 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.280
 horses on versions 3.5 5.6 6.25 and 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.880
 180 horsepower on version 7.5 and 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.380
 possibility of having a robotic box 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.380
 on the nation sits like that 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.930
 in the continuity of the range 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.630
 distribution we have three vehicles of 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.370
 larger tonnage from 10 to 26 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.060
 tons the first of these vehicles 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.510
 is called the cables of m without being 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.600
 This is the heart of our range 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.790
 between 10 and 18 tons is found in 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.740
 several engines so two 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.430
 engines one engine 5 liters one engine 1 8 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.010
 liter of 120 horses to 320 horses 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.450
 all our vehicles in the range 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.190
 particular distribution on this vehicle 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.620
 doctors ' cables are equipped with 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.260
 robotic serial box with of course 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.400
 the possibilities mechanical box or on 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.610
 some wooden models every morning 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.610
 winter 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.000
 the next vehicle is the wild of 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.670
 where it is a little bigger 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.310
 on tonnages from 18 to 26 tonnes in 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.220
 silhouette only 2 or in silhouette 6 2 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.110
 this vehicle has the particularity of being 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.940
 with a cabin of two meters 30 so 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.040
 a little wider than the vehicle 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.850
 previous that allows more comfort 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.350
 with a peculiarity is an effort has 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.230
 been done on the soundproofing of this 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.290
 vehicle since it therefore benefits from a 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.930
 gain inside of -35% compared to 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.120
 the previous generation the wade has 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.950
 also some particularities in term 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.180
 of motorisation since it is proposed in 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.850
 Gnv and motorized gas engines 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.769
 bio diesel 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.049
 the third vehicle is the vehicle 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.850
 access therefore the vehicles of 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.319
 accessories price of a niche on a 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.470
 segment called trucks to 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.650
 low-profile cabin particularly popular 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.959
 on the uses of type 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.430
 collection of garbage is in 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.500
 any case all that is business of 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.700
 climb downhill so this vehicle in 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.819
 safe cabin but it's like his name 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.730
 Monday allows easy climb and 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.129
 simplify in the cabin with gait 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.450
 is the flat floor that allows for 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.390
 climb down right left of 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.790
 quite easy way a cabin 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.890
 very hot pavilions allowing 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.229
 circulated to both ends without any 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.639
 physical stress is what the truck 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.190
 there is also another peculiarity 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.570
 it's that he has one of the most 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.880
 narrow market 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.800
 the narrow way allows especially to radius 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.449
 exceptional turning on the streets 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.449
 and in the middle
