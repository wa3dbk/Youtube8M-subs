00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:16.080
 crypt what is the name of the tomb of salt 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:23.220

 the main legs do not break 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.860
 so I can no longer 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.990
 since a pass over the top of the town 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.020

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.680
 see all capture also seen so 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.070
 the coordinate is in here 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.610
 some this stone is not far from clever 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.610

 quite nice and cozy 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:30.230

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:33.260
 149 to 132 that's how you see the late 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.590
