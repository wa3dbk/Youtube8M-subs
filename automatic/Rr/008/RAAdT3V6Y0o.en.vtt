00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.520
 Hello, this is Silvia de AlmerÃ­a 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.009
 puntocom and in this video I'm going to 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.639
 explain what is most important for 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.200
 lose weight be fit to have a 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.749
 good health and good condition 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.140
 physical and and then say it is not the 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:19.820
 diet and neither exercise then the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.750
 big question is what is the most 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.650
 important to lose weight 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.920
 the answer is found here and here 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:34.540
 is the mind and emotions things 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.880
 psychic spirituals everything but physical 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.100
 when your knee hurts when you have 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.980
 diabetes when you have the metabolism 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.900
 slow when you are overweight you think 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.150
 that you have to do more exercise versÃ³ 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.610
 exercise or different exercise or have 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.220
 to feed you different but you 're not 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.350
 fighting against the water current already 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.350
 a much easier solution much more 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.360
 effective and it's not so much the food or the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.110
 lack of exercise makes our 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.149
 bodies begin to hurt I'll give 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.460
 examples of that these are only three 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.130
 examples but there are millions of examples 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.649
 that the mind and emotions play 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.649
 a very big role in how it looks 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.600
 our body and our health the first 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.159
 example that equality 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.259
 georges think 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.170
 wrote this book develops your 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.479
 brain because he simply with the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.819
 power of his mind safe the back had 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.429
 a bicycle accident and the doctors 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:32.950
 they told you you have to operate and so you're not going to 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:36.429
 to be able to walk anymore we will have 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.429
 than putting a metal bar in the 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.020
 column to keep it rigid and it's 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.720
 about you have indicated that there would never be 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.060
 could play sports and they could not 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.360
 leave me peace and I have lying there the bed without 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.790
 be able to move around a lot with your mind I enter 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.080
 his body as he was chiropractor and 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.690
 he knew anatomy well and simply 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.820
 with the mind was the areas that were 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.820
 broken that were damaged 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.300
 sure after a few weeks of six 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.230
 weeks I was already swimming doing 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.660
 exercise and no operation and until 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.730
 now it's fine is the next example 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.740
 that emotions and thoughts 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.170
 beliefs influences our body is 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.680
 the book by luis g 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.530
 Your body is healing your body and here it says 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.900
 mental causes for physical illness 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.239
 here in relation to 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.569
 beliefs and thoughts with 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.640
 diseases and discomforts not only physical 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.549
 but also mental anxiety or 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.340
 depression is what happens in our 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.239
 lives and influences our bodies and not 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.159
 always a very obvious way for example 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.930
 of the knee your knee hurts 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:58.930
 you want with your partner and you start 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.459
 to hurt the stomach for example like this and 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.129
 here are almost all the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.510
 diseases and discomforts if for example 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.019
 Do you have diabetes 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.879
 if you have hepatitis without doubling the 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.019
 knee column anything 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:16.720
 you find here and his method is with 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.879
 positive affirmations that on the one hand 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.900
 puts for example inflammation of 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.710
 problem 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:27.760
 then the reason is fear 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.850
 seeing red and your thoughts are in 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.830
 flames although his positive affirmation is 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.130
 my thoughts are full of peace 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.550
 calm and centered there that 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.980
 repeating it you are reprogramming your mind 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.930
 and then the body is no longer affected 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.700
 and the inflammation goes away 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:52.030
 for example the third example is from 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.030
 Bryant you see this lady she had a 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.050
 tumor the size of a ball 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.020
 basketball in the stomach was the doctor and 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.820
 dave to cooperate and told me do not let me 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.800
 do it my way and in that process 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:13.630
 he developed his own emotional method 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.510
 to cure any disease were in 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.280
 six and a half months the tumor had 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.680
 disappeared without medication without 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.110
 doctors help only therapies 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.190
 alternatives developing their own 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.760
 emotional method 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.390
 she realized that when she agreed 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.170
 to memories of 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.500
 from the past when I was a child and there was a 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.740
 emotional conflict 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.590
 those emotions had stayed there 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.410
 stagnant in your body and with the years 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.780
 had produced more and more damage in the 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:53.330
 body and once found those 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:57.810
 memories asking for forgiveness and also 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:01.680
 forgiving the body safe alone without 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:04.200
 that I had to cut anything or take 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.510
 medicines nothing was just a process 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:11.450
 emotional then these three examples 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:13.620
 it is not using the mind the second is 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:18.480
 reprogramming the mind and the third one is 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:21.180
 taking away the mind and feel like sensing and 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.389
 think of today is that 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.759
 already the mind is powerful but we also 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:29.009
 it can be great damage what we have to 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.590
 to do is to use the mind and not leave 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.240
 to use us because everything 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.190
 what is happening our life everything what 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.800
 that we are experiencing physically and 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.199
 mentally emotionally we are 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.630
 attracting by our thoughts 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:45.479
 Of course it is unconsciously nobody 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.280
 he wants his knee to hurt 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.850
 a slow metabolism or having 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:54.210
 diabetes that is overweight but there 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.550
 to use the mind to solve 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.560
 all those things and just use the 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.380
 mind when it's needed because when 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.380
 we remove the mind the body is so 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.289
 powerful that he heals alone so no 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.080
 only focus on food and 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:13.530
 exercise but go and look for books 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.580
 look for seminars courses on the internet or 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.020
 in the city 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.550
 look for people 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.060
 Sometimes you can give them 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.910
 concessions with methods topics 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:28.990
 Energetic emotional methods methods 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:32.050
 mental all that is non-physical 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:35.620
 because this will help them more and more 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:38.710
 quick and easier to get your 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.080
