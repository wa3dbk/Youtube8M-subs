00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
what we're going to do today is just

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.600 
what we're going to do today is just
take<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> look<00:00:40.440> at<00:00:40.559> some<00:00:40.650> benchmark<00:00:41.129> results

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
take a look at some benchmark results

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.380 
take a look at some benchmark results
some<00:00:42.239> temperatures<00:00:42.720> some<00:00:43.590> noise<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:45.239> is

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
some temperatures some noise that is

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.350 
some temperatures some noise that is
generated<00:00:45.870> from<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> fans<00:00:46.410> under<00:00:46.860> load

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
generated from the fans under load

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.490 
generated from the fans under load
mainly<00:00:48.360> because<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:48.960> has<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.170> different

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
mainly because this one has a different

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.710 
mainly because this one has a different
graphics<00:00:50.250> card<00:00:50.550> has<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.210> nvidia<00:00:51.720> gtx<00:00:52.620> 87<00:00:53.520> m

three gigabyte version the rest of the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.520 
three gigabyte version the rest of the
hardware<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.030> pretty<00:00:57.239> much<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.480> same<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:58.110> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
hardware is pretty much the same as the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.290 
hardware is pretty much the same as the
other<00:00:58.650> one<00:00:58.860> but<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> different<00:01:00.060> video

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
other one but with the different video

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.620 
other one but with the different video
card<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:01.079> thought<00:01:01.290> we<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.220> you<00:01:02.760> guys<00:01:02.940> would

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
card we thought we and you guys would

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.120 
card we thought we and you guys would
probably<00:01:04.020> like<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.979> different

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 
probably like to see the different

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.400 
probably like to see the different
results<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.910> you<00:01:06.060> get<00:01:06.180> from<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.509> one<00:01:06.720> as

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
results that you get from this one as

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.040 
results that you get from this one as
normal<00:01:08.009> we're<00:01:08.940> going<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.300> is<00:01:09.600> shoot<00:01:09.840> some

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
normal we're going to do is shoot some

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.170 
normal we're going to do is shoot some
thermal<00:01:10.410> pictures<00:01:10.740> as<00:01:10.890> well<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.880> let's<00:01:12.060> go

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
thermal pictures as well so let's go

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.920 
thermal pictures as well so let's go
ahead<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.509> things<00:01:12.630> started<00:01:14.840> we're<00:01:15.840> going

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
ahead and get things started we're going

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.090 
ahead and get things started we're going
to<00:01:16.020> start<00:01:16.259> off<00:01:16.410> with<00:01:16.470> 3dmark<00:01:17.340> Vantage<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:19.100> see

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
to start off with 3dmark Vantage and see

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.210 
to start off with 3dmark Vantage and see
the<00:01:20.220> results<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.240 

as<00:01:27.760> you<00:01:27.970> can<00:01:28.090> see<00:01:28.360> room<00:01:29.110> ambient<00:01:29.590> noise<00:01:29.740> about

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
as you can see room ambient noise about

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.070 
as you can see room ambient noise about
forty<00:01:30.610> one<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:30.910> a<00:01:30.970> half<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:33.690> as<00:01:34.690> I<00:01:34.720> talked

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
forty one and a half and as I talked

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.030 
forty one and a half and as I talked
about<00:01:35.380> 70<00:01:35.920> decibels<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:37.440> you'll<00:01:38.440> see<00:01:38.680> that<00:01:38.830> go

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
about 70 decibels and you'll see that go

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.100 
about 70 decibels and you'll see that go
up<00:01:39.160> as<00:01:39.370> the<00:01:39.520> fans<00:01:39.820> kick<00:01:40.120> up<00:01:40.300> as<00:01:40.480> a<00:01:40.660> benchmark
