00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
things by now so just like a go at

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.580 
things by now so just like a go at
plucking<00:03:38.150> those<00:03:38.269> strings<00:03:38.599> again<00:03:38.750> four<00:03:39.260> three

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
plucking those strings again four three

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.800 
plucking those strings again four three
two<00:03:39.859> one

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.050 

okay<00:03:43.349> very<00:03:43.620> good<00:03:43.709> now<00:03:44.370> once<00:03:44.610> you've<00:03:44.790> done<00:03:45.000> that

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
okay very good now once you've done that

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
I want you to go back to the second

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.970 
I want you to go back to the second
string<00:03:47.310> with<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.730> middle<00:03:48.000> finger<00:03:48.420> oh<00:03:48.980> and

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
string with the middle finger oh and

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.770 
string with the middle finger oh and
then<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.370> third<00:03:50.580> string<00:03:51.030> with<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.540> first

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
then the third string with the first

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.949 
then the third string with the first
finger<00:03:52.489> so<00:03:53.489> if<00:03:53.760> we<00:03:53.790> join<00:03:54.120> those<00:03:54.360> notes<00:03:54.630> on<00:03:54.840> the

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
finger so if we join those notes on the

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.160 
finger so if we join those notes on the
end<00:03:55.080> it<00:03:55.290> should<00:03:55.319> sound<00:03:55.650> like<00:03:55.770> this

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.990 

okay<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.590> what<00:04:01.769> happens<00:04:02.190> is<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.519> can<00:04:02.670> repeat

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
okay and what happens is you can repeat

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.910 
okay and what happens is you can repeat
that<00:04:03.239> over<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.780> over<00:04:03.930> again<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.650> joins

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
that over and over again and it joins

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:15.500 
that over and over again and it joins
together<00:04:05.220> perfectly<00:04:05.940> like<00:04:06.180> this

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.689 

okay<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.709> can<00:04:16.859> see<00:04:17.040> that<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:17.370> sounds

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
okay and you can see that that sounds

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.449 
okay and you can see that that sounds
really<00:04:18.060> nice<00:04:18.239> now<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:18.900> suggest<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:19.680> can<00:04:19.979> change

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
really nice now I suggest you can change

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.879 
really nice now I suggest you can change
the<00:04:20.669> different<00:04:21.060> chords<00:04:21.419> for<00:04:22.320> example<00:04:22.710> if<00:04:22.800> we

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
the different chords for example if we

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.530 
the different chords for example if we
went<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.310> G<00:04:23.490> chord<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:24.030> of<00:04:24.240> course<00:04:24.419> you

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
went to the G chord and of course you

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.030 
went to the G chord and of course you
already<00:04:24.660> know<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.110> G<00:04:25.290> chord<00:04:25.500> because<00:04:25.740> we

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
already know the G chord because we

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.080 
already know the G chord because we
learned<00:04:26.250> that<00:04:26.370> in<00:04:26.610> one<00:04:26.729> of<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.910> previous

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
learned that in one of the previous

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.930 
learned that in one of the previous
segments<00:04:27.840> but<00:04:28.590> just<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:28.979> refresh<00:04:29.280> your<00:04:29.580> memory

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
segments but just to refresh your memory

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.790 
segments but just to refresh your memory

the first string at fret 3 ok you can

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.129 
the first string at fret 3 ok you can
pause<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.120> video<00:04:42.240> if<00:04:42.449> you<00:04:42.630> just<00:04:42.840> need<00:04:43.020> to

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
pause the video if you just need to

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.200 
pause the video if you just need to
check<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.410> now<00:04:44.130> what's<00:04:44.430> going<00:04:44.639> to<00:04:44.699> happen<00:04:45.060> is

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
check that now what's going to happen is

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.060 
check that now what's going to happen is
the<00:04:45.750> thumb<00:04:46.110> is<00:04:46.350> now<00:04:46.500> going<00:04:46.680> to<00:04:46.740> pluck<00:04:46.949> the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
the thumb is now going to pluck the

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.129 
the thumb is now going to pluck the
sixth<00:04:47.430> string<00:04:47.669> because<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.720> some<00:04:48.960> always

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
sixth string because the some always

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.050 
sixth string because the some always
plucks<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.710> root<00:04:49.889> note<00:04:50.100> of<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.370> chord<00:04:50.400> when

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
plucks the root note of the chord when

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.120 
plucks the root note of the chord when
we<00:04:51.240> were<00:04:51.330> on<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.510> D<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.110> root<00:04:52.289> note<00:04:52.530> was<00:04:52.949> the

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
we were on the D the root note was the

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.279 
we were on the D the root note was the
fourth<00:04:53.370> string<00:04:53.669> but<00:04:53.910> now<00:04:54.060> we're<00:04:54.240> on<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.449> G<00:04:54.690> the

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
fourth string but now we're on the G the

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.320 
fourth string but now we're on the G the
root<00:04:55.500> note<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:55.889> the<00:04:56.039> sixth<00:04:56.340> string<00:04:56.430> ok<00:04:57.060> I<00:04:57.090> hope

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
root note is the sixth string ok I hope

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.360 
root note is the sixth string ok I hope
that<00:04:57.510> makes<00:04:57.690> sense<00:04:57.810> but<00:04:58.650> these<00:04:58.860> three<00:04:59.130> fingers

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
that makes sense but these three fingers

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.890 
that makes sense but these three fingers
are<00:04:59.760> still<00:05:00.030> going<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.360> be<00:05:00.479> on<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:00.690> same

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
are still going to be on the same

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.600 
are still going to be on the same
strings<00:05:01.260> as<00:05:01.440> before<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.039> third<00:05:02.250> string

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
strings as before the third string

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.300 
strings as before the third string
second<00:05:03.419> string<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:03.840> first<00:05:04.169> string<00:05:04.500> so<00:05:05.039> when

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
second string and first string so when

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.070 
second string and first string so when
we<00:05:05.460> apply<00:05:05.789> this<00:05:05.850> picking<00:05:06.449> pattern<00:05:06.840> it'll

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
we apply this picking pattern it'll

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.190 
we apply this picking pattern it'll
sound<00:05:07.260> like<00:05:07.380> this

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.400 

great<00:05:14.950> so<00:05:15.580> what<00:05:15.730> I<00:05:15.760> suggest<00:05:15.910> you<00:05:16.210> do<00:05:16.450> is<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.960> do

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
great so what I suggest you do is to do

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.500 
great so what I suggest you do is to do
that<00:05:17.440> picking<00:05:17.980> pattern<00:05:18.340> twice<00:05:18.610> on<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:19.000> D<00:05:19.180> and

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
that picking pattern twice on the D and

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.690 
that picking pattern twice on the D and
then<00:05:20.050> twice<00:05:20.350> on<00:05:20.560> the<00:05:20.650> G<00:05:20.830> so<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:21.340> should<00:05:21.550> sound

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
then twice on the G so it should sound

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.239 
then twice on the G so it should sound
like<00:05:21.820> this

00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:24.249 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:26.620 

you

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.890 

you

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.559 

mmm

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
mmm

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:42.399 
mmm
and<00:05:31.990> then<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:32.259> can<00:05:32.409> do<00:05:32.559> it<00:05:32.679> again

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:43.990 

Oh

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
Oh

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.730 
Oh
okay<00:05:45.000> I<00:05:45.030> think<00:05:45.510> you<00:05:45.570> get<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.780> idea<00:05:45.900> now<00:05:46.710> I

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
okay I think you get the idea now I

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.130 
okay I think you get the idea now I
suggest<00:05:47.130> you<00:05:47.460> practice<00:05:48.330> that<00:05:48.570> with<00:05:48.750> the<00:05:49.020> other
