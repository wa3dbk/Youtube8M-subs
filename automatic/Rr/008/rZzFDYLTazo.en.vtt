00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.390 
me does it this way and it's kind of a
way<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:12.990> prefer<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.620> it's<00:00:13.769> more<00:00:13.950> like<00:00:14.070> salt

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
way I prefer to do it's more like salt

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.750 
way I prefer to do it's more like salt
garlic<00:00:15.120> chili<00:00:15.570> chicken<00:00:16.109> but<00:00:16.890> as<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.580> can<00:00:17.699> see

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
garlic chili chicken but as you can see

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.679 
garlic chili chicken but as you can see
could<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.600> run<00:00:18.750> through<00:00:18.900> how<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.170> do<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.500> so

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
could you run through how we do this so

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.480 
could you run through how we do this so
basically<00:00:21.689> plain<00:00:22.140> flour<00:00:22.380> into<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.039> container

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
basically plain flour into a container

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.810 
basically plain flour into a container
and<00:00:24.500> basically<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:25.890> level<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.369> out

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
and basically just level this out

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.800 
and basically just level this out
now<00:00:27.710> again<00:00:28.710> I'm<00:00:29.010> cooking<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.789> four<00:00:30.090> as<00:00:30.689> I

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
now again I'm cooking this for four as I

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.569 
now again I'm cooking this for four as I
did<00:00:30.990> with<00:00:31.170> previous<00:00:31.740> video<00:00:31.980> egg<00:00:32.219> fried<00:00:32.550> rice

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
did with previous video egg fried rice

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.979 
did with previous video egg fried rice
and<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.870> all<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.079> do<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.590> level<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.100> out<00:00:35.219> and

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
and so all I do is level that out and

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.630 
and so all I do is level that out and
basically<00:00:36.989> go<00:00:37.290> over<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.010> whole<00:00:38.190> layer<00:00:38.520> of

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
basically go over the whole layer of

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.630 
basically go over the whole layer of
flour<00:00:39.480> with<00:00:40.020> pepper<00:00:40.559> go<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.100> pepper<00:00:41.309> all<00:00:41.610> over

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
flour with pepper go and pepper all over

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.310 
flour with pepper go and pepper all over
that<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:43.969> once<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.149> finish<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.989> will

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
that and once I finish with that I will

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.740 
that and once I finish with that I will
do<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.800> coating<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.850> very<00:00:48.239> light<00:00:48.480> coating

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
do a coating a very light coating

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.439 
do a coating a very light coating
assault<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.520> use<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> product<00:00:51.090> called

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
assault and then I use a product called

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.860 
assault and then I use a product called
smoked<00:00:52.320> salt<00:00:52.980> which<00:00:53.219> I've<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.480> found<00:00:54.629> in

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
smoked salt which I've really found in

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.619 
smoked salt which I've really found in
in<00:00:55.050> Sainsbury's<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:56.059> then<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.149> literally<00:00:57.420> will

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
in Sainsbury's and then I literally will

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.410 
in Sainsbury's and then I literally will
sprinkle<00:00:57.930> some<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.980> mix<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> in

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
sprinkle some of that on and mix it in

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.459 
sprinkle some of that on and mix it in
but<00:01:00.420> I'll<00:01:00.539> leave<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.840> watch<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.020> part

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
but I'll leave you to watch that part

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.170 
but I'll leave you to watch that part
and<00:01:01.710> I'll<00:01:02.309> update<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.850> go<00:01:02.969> through<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and I'll update you as I go through the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.220 
and I'll update you as I go through the
rest

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:02:44.839 

you

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.420 

so<00:02:45.390> once<00:02:45.540> that's<00:02:45.749> done<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:45.959> all<00:02:46.650> mixed<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.249> you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
so once that's done and all mixed in you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.369 
so once that's done and all mixed in you
can<00:02:47.640> literally<00:02:48.120> move<00:02:48.359> that<00:02:48.599> to<00:02:48.749> the<00:02:48.870> side<00:02:48.900> and

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
can literally move that to the side and

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.149 
can literally move that to the side and
leave<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.519> there<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:52.290> next<00:02:52.530> stage<00:02:52.739> really

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
leave it there and the next stage really

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.420 
leave it there and the next stage really
is<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:54.480> quickly<00:02:54.719> make<00:02:54.959> up<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.560> sort<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.129> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
is to quickly make up the sort of the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.050 
is to quickly make up the sort of the
egg<00:02:57.200> sort<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.290> marinade<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:58.980> speak<00:02:59.310> so

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
egg sort of marinade so to speak so

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.819 
egg sort of marinade so to speak so
literally<00:03:00.599> one<00:03:00.810> egg<00:03:00.959> into<00:03:01.639> mixing<00:03:02.639> jug<00:03:02.849> and

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
literally one egg into mixing jug and

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.610 
literally one egg into mixing jug and
what<00:03:04.829> I<00:03:04.859> then<00:03:05.159> do<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.670> using<00:03:06.120> hoisin<00:03:06.599> sauce<00:03:06.780> so

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
what I then do is using hoisin sauce so

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.580 
what I then do is using hoisin sauce so
for<00:03:07.829> this<00:03:07.950> will<00:03:08.280> be<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:09.200> tablespoon<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.439> so<00:03:10.560> a

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
for this will be a tablespoon and so a

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.580 
for this will be a tablespoon and so a
teaspoon<00:03:10.889> of<00:03:11.370> moisten<00:03:12.209> sauce<00:03:12.480> into<00:03:12.840> with<00:03:13.469> the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
teaspoon of moisten sauce into with the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.770 
teaspoon of moisten sauce into with the
egg<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.669> literally<00:03:15.090> just<00:03:15.359> whisk<00:03:15.599> that<00:03:15.689> up

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
egg and you literally just whisk that up

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.619 
egg and you literally just whisk that up
and<00:03:16.549> once<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.730> finish<00:03:18.120> with<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.329> leave<00:03:18.510> it

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
and once you finish with that leave it

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.659 
and once you finish with that leave it
to<00:03:18.719> the<00:03:18.810> side<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.650> then<00:03:20.189> it'll<00:03:20.310> be<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> case<00:03:20.639> of

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
to the side and then it'll be a case of

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.179 
to the side and then it'll be a case of
cutting<00:03:21.209> up<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.419> chicken<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:22.079> this<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:23.010> where

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:23.189 
cutting up the chicken and this is where

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.280 
cutting up the chicken and this is where
the<00:03:23.310> chicken<00:03:23.699> will<00:03:24.359> actually<00:03:24.659> go<00:03:24.810> into<00:03:24.840> this

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
the chicken will actually go into this

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.530 
the chicken will actually go into this
and<00:03:26.189> once<00:03:26.430> you've<00:03:26.609> finished<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:27.269> actually

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
and once you've finished you actually

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.809 
and once you've finished you actually
you<00:03:27.780> put<00:03:28.019> this<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:28.500> with<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:29.040> flour<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.639> then

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
you put this in with the flour and then

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.220 
you put this in with the flour and then
fry<00:03:30.090> it's<00:03:30.810> not<00:03:30.900> only<00:03:31.019> quite<00:03:31.199> a

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
fry it's not only quite a

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.250 
fry it's not only quite a
straightforward<00:03:31.469> process<00:03:32.989> chicken<00:03:33.989> itself

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
straightforward process chicken itself

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.240 
straightforward process chicken itself
doesn't<00:03:34.590> need<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> vast<00:03:34.980> amount<00:03:35.219> of

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
doesn't need a vast amount of

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.530 
doesn't need a vast amount of
ingredients<00:03:35.790> as<00:03:35.879> the<00:03:36.030> flour<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.449> the<00:03:36.510> salt

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
ingredients as the flour and the salt

with<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.290> chicken<00:04:12.470> what<00:04:12.830> I'm<00:04:12.980> gonna<00:04:13.069> do<00:04:13.220> is

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
with the chicken what I'm gonna do is

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.369 
with the chicken what I'm gonna do is
cut<00:04:14.299> off<00:04:14.360> any<00:04:14.480> parts<00:04:14.840> that<00:04:14.870> aren't<00:04:15.170> on<00:04:15.260> there

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379

unfortunately<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:16.250> best<00:04:16.430> chicken<00:04:16.699> as<00:04:17.299> an

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
unfortunately the best chicken as an

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.090 
unfortunately the best chicken as an
example<00:04:17.810> there<00:04:18.500> was<00:04:18.620> quite<00:04:18.769> a<00:04:18.799> few<00:04:18.859> little

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
example there was quite a few little

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.530 
example there was quite a few little
bits<00:04:19.340> of<00:04:19.459> sort<00:04:19.699> of<00:04:19.760> tendons<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.269> stuff<00:04:20.449> like

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
bits of sort of tendons and stuff like

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.469 
bits of sort of tendons and stuff like
that<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:21.019> it's<00:04:21.470> just<00:04:21.500> a<00:04:21.680> case<00:04:21.859> of<00:04:22.270> cut<00:04:23.270> them<00:04:23.389> out

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
that so it's just a case of cut them out

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.480 
that so it's just a case of cut them out
and<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:24.620> then<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:24.830> literally<00:04:25.070> cut<00:04:25.400> the

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
and and then you literally cut the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.360 
and and then you literally cut the
chicken<00:04:25.729> into<00:04:26.150> nice<00:04:26.900> little<00:04:27.169> pieces<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:28.220> just

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
chicken into nice little pieces it just

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.710 
chicken into nice little pieces it just
depends<00:04:28.639> how<00:04:28.760> big<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:29.060> want<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.330> just<00:04:29.479> bear<00:04:29.660> in

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
depends how big you want to just bear in

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.120 
depends how big you want to just bear in
mind<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:30.020> bigger<00:04:30.260> it<00:04:30.410> is<00:04:30.530> it's<00:04:30.710> gonna<00:04:30.830> take<00:04:31.070> a

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
mind the bigger it is it's gonna take a

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.770 
mind the bigger it is it's gonna take a
little<00:04:31.220> bit<00:04:31.400> longer<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.790> fry<00:04:32.030> which<00:04:32.389> will<00:04:32.600> give

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
little bit longer to fry which will give

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.860 
little bit longer to fry which will give
the<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:34.160> batter<00:04:34.430> a<00:04:34.580> bit<00:04:34.760> more<00:04:34.880> crispy<00:04:35.300> again

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
the the batter a bit more crispy again

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.270 
the the batter a bit more crispy again
that's<00:04:36.139> just<00:04:36.260> down<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.590> however<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:37.160> would

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280

see I just cut up into some pieces these

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.830 
see I just cut up into some pieces these
are<00:04:45.050> quite<00:04:45.350> small<00:04:45.830> in<00:04:46.130> all<00:04:46.250> fairness<00:04:46.660> as<00:04:47.660> they

are quite small in all fairness as they

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.390 
are quite small in all fairness as they
cook<00:04:48.050> a<00:04:48.260> bit<00:04:48.410> quicker<00:04:48.650> it's<00:04:49.220> always

into<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.270> flour<00:05:05.479> I<00:05:05.810> normally<00:05:06.320> do<00:05:06.410> a<00:05:06.440> couple<00:05:06.740> of

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
into the flour I normally do a couple of

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.409 
into the flour I normally do a couple of
handfuls<00:05:06.979> at<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.250> time<00:05:07.490> now<00:05:07.880> if<00:05:08.000> you'd<00:05:08.120> making

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
handfuls at a time now if you'd making

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:09.580 
handfuls at a time now if you'd making
this<00:05:08.479> for<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.690> couple<00:05:08.780> of<00:05:08.930> people<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:09.440> could

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
this for a couple of people you could

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.980 
this for a couple of people you could
probably<00:05:09.710> do<00:05:09.919> this<00:05:10.070> all<00:05:10.250> in<00:05:10.370> one<00:05:10.490> batch<00:05:10.789> but<00:05:11.150> as

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
probably do this all in one batch but as

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.240 
probably do this all in one batch but as
I<00:05:12.080> said<00:05:12.169> I've<00:05:12.320> done<00:05:12.470> it<00:05:12.590> before<00:05:12.680> so<00:05:12.919> I<00:05:13.190> think

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
I said I've done it before so I think

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.500 
I said I've done it before so I think
I've<00:05:13.460> done<00:05:13.580> it<00:05:13.669> in<00:05:13.760> about<00:05:13.910> three<00:05:14.210> or<00:05:14.240> four

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
I've done it in about three or four

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.230 
I've done it in about three or four
batches<00:05:14.720> for<00:05:15.110> this<00:05:15.260> particular<00:05:15.620> night<00:05:16.310> so

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
batches for this particular night so

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.440 
batches for this particular night so
literally<00:05:18.080> chicken<00:05:18.440> into<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.650> flour<00:05:18.950> and

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
literally chicken into the flour and

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.520 
literally chicken into the flour and
what<00:05:20.450> you<00:05:20.570> learned<00:05:20.870> see<00:05:21.050> you<00:05:21.110> in<00:05:21.169> a<00:05:21.229> couple<00:05:21.349> of

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
what you learned see you in a couple of

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.500 
what you learned see you in a couple of
minutes<00:05:21.740> as<00:05:21.860> we<00:05:21.979> doing<00:05:22.310> is<00:05:22.460> just<00:05:22.970> moving<00:05:23.300> the

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
minutes as we doing is just moving the

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.110 
minutes as we doing is just moving the
flour<00:05:23.720> over<00:05:24.229> the<00:05:24.260> top<00:05:24.530> of<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.710> chicken<00:05:25.120> the

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
flour over the top of the chicken the

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.940 
flour over the top of the chicken the
better<00:05:26.330> that<00:05:26.510> you<00:05:26.750> it's<00:05:27.560> actually<00:05:27.830> better

better that you it's actually better
than<00:05:28.160> more<00:05:28.370> that<00:05:28.520> you<00:05:28.669> coat<00:05:29.090> this<00:05:29.240> and<00:05:29.450> flour

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
that separate the chicken the better it

that separate the chicken the better it
will<00:05:31.430> come<00:05:31.610> out<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:33.110> can<00:05:33.380> really<00:05:33.650> you<00:05:33.889> could

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
will come out you can really you could

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.560 
will come out you can really you could
put<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.460> whole<00:05:34.610> shape<00:05:34.820> block<00:05:35.060> on<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.240> chicken

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
put the whole shape block on the chicken

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.210 
put the whole shape block on the chicken
just<00:05:35.780> in<00:05:35.930> with<00:05:36.139> the<00:05:36.200> flour<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:36.590> just<00:05:36.800> mix<00:05:37.070> it

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
just in with the flour and just mix it

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.500 
just in with the flour and just mix it
round<00:05:37.400> but<00:05:37.550> you'll<00:05:37.669> see<00:05:37.849> that<00:05:37.880> it<00:05:38.150> does<00:05:38.300> kind

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
round but you'll see that it does kind

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.350 
round but you'll see that it does kind
of<00:05:38.599> stick<00:05:38.780> together<00:05:38.930> as<00:05:39.229> you'll<00:05:39.380> see<00:05:39.590> there

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
of stick together as you'll see there

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.520 
of stick together as you'll see there
you<00:05:41.360> actually<00:05:41.660> really<00:05:41.840> want<00:05:42.110> this<00:05:42.260> more

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
you actually really want this more

coated in flour and they're easily

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.719 
coated in flour and they're easily
movable<00:05:46.370> and<00:05:48.099> once<00:05:49.099> you've<00:05:49.220> done<00:05:49.340> that<00:05:49.400> it's

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.360 

so<00:06:09.730> once<00:06:09.910> happy<00:06:10.240> with<00:06:10.800> how<00:06:11.800> you<00:06:11.860> with<00:06:12.220> the

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
so once happy with how you with the

so once happy with how you with the
batter<00:06:12.790> on<00:06:13.000> the<00:06:13.090> chicken<00:06:13.510> you<00:06:14.110> can't<00:06:14.350> do<00:06:14.500> this

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
batter on the chicken you can't do this

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.890 
batter on the chicken you can't do this
in<00:06:14.770> a<00:06:14.860> wok<00:06:15.070> I<00:06:15.310> tend<00:06:16.180> to<00:06:16.210> use<00:06:16.300> it<00:06:16.480> the<00:06:16.540> d<00:06:16.660> fat

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
in a wok I tend to use it the d fat

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.420 
in a wok I tend to use it the d fat
fryers<00:06:17.200> it<00:06:17.500> makes<00:06:17.680> it<00:06:17.860> a<00:06:17.920> little<00:06:18.040> bit<00:06:18.250> more

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
fryers it makes it a little bit more

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.450 
fryers it makes it a little bit more
crispy<00:06:18.850> it's<00:06:19.480> a<00:06:19.540> lot<00:06:19.660> easier<00:06:19.990> to<00:06:20.140> do<00:06:20.370> but<00:06:21.370> you

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
crispy it's a lot easier to do but you

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.180 
crispy it's a lot easier to do but you
can<00:06:21.610> do<00:06:21.730> it<00:06:21.790> in<00:06:21.850> a<00:06:21.910> wok<00:06:22.090> as<00:06:22.690> long<00:06:22.870> as<00:06:22.990> you<00:06:23.190> get

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
can do it in a wok as long as you get

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.370 
can do it in a wok as long as you get
the<00:06:24.310> oil<00:06:24.580> hot<00:06:25.000> enough<00:06:25.240> that<00:06:25.480> sort<00:06:26.110> of<00:06:26.140> truck

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
the oil hot enough that sort of truck

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.770 
the oil hot enough that sort of truck
they<00:06:26.590> drop<00:06:26.920> the<00:06:27.010> chicken<00:06:27.190> in<00:06:27.460> and<00:06:27.700> give<00:06:28.420> it<00:06:28.630> a

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
they drop the chicken in and give it a

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.780 
they drop the chicken in and give it a
bit<00:06:28.900> of<00:06:28.930> a<00:06:29.050> crisp<00:06:29.320> it's<00:06:30.220> just<00:06:30.370> easier<00:06:30.640> with<00:06:30.730> a

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
bit of a crisp it's just easier with a

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.590 
bit of a crisp it's just easier with a
deep<00:06:30.910> fat<00:06:31.120> fryer

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600

once<00:06:32.590> I<00:06:32.710> spent<00:06:32.980> literally<00:06:33.720> dependent<00:06:34.720> on<00:06:34.870> the

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
once I spent literally dependent on the

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.780 
once I spent literally dependent on the
time<00:06:35.140> and<00:06:35.290> how<00:06:35.380> once<00:06:35.980> you've<00:06:36.160> cut<00:06:36.370> it<00:06:36.460> up<00:06:36.610> I

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
time and how once you've cut it up I

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.340 
time and how once you've cut it up I
tend<00:06:37.000> to<00:06:37.030> cut<00:06:37.210> up<00:06:37.330> into<00:06:37.600> smaller<00:06:37.870> bits<00:06:38.050> and

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
tend to cut up into smaller bits and

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.600 
tend to cut up into smaller bits and
sort<00:06:38.740> of<00:06:38.800> fry<00:06:39.040> it<00:06:39.100> for<00:06:39.580> almost<00:06:40.180> a<00:06:40.480> minute<00:06:40.630> and

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
sort of fry it for almost a minute and

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.250 
sort of fry it for almost a minute and
as<00:06:42.610> you<00:06:42.790> can<00:06:42.880> see<00:06:42.940> it<00:06:43.180> comes<00:06:43.419> out<00:06:43.630> it's

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
as you can see it comes out it's

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.320 
as you can see it comes out it's
relatively<00:06:44.620> nice<00:06:44.860> it's<00:06:45.370> quite<00:06:45.580> dry<00:06:45.820> dish

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
relatively nice it's quite dry dish

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.270 
relatively nice it's quite dry dish
once<00:06:47.110> that's<00:06:47.260> in<00:06:47.410> the<00:06:47.530> wok<00:06:47.740> and<00:06:47.980> it<00:06:48.130> should

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
once that's in the wok and it should

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.370 
once that's in the wok and it should
just<00:06:48.370> work<00:06:48.460> around<00:06:48.790> it<00:06:49.090> covering<00:06:50.050> it<00:06:50.230> with<00:06:50.290> a

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
just work around it covering it with a

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.380 
just work around it covering it with a
light<00:06:50.560> coating<00:06:51.310> of<00:06:51.490> salt<00:06:52.270> and<00:06:53.850> then<00:06:54.850> once

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
light coating of salt and then once

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.320 
light coating of salt and then once
that's<00:06:55.570> done<00:06:55.750> I<00:06:56.430> continue<00:06:57.430> to<00:06:57.550> do<00:06:57.700> a<00:06:58.000> few

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
that's done I continue to do a few

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.510 
that's done I continue to do a few
batches<00:06:58.480> and<00:06:58.960> as<00:06:59.320> I've<00:06:59.530> done<00:06:59.680> of<00:06:59.830> each<00:07:00.010> batch<00:07:00.280> I

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
batches and as I've done of each batch I

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.659 
batches and as I've done of each batch I
then<00:07:00.669> put<00:07:00.910> a<00:07:00.940> bit<00:07:01.180> more<00:07:01.330> so<00:07:01.570> on<00:07:01.919> on<00:07:02.919> the<00:07:03.340> fresh

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:03.669 
then put a bit more so on on the fresh

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:05.730 
then put a bit more so on on the fresh
batch<00:07:03.940> and<00:07:04.870> what<00:07:05.020> you'll<00:07:05.140> see<00:07:05.290> me<00:07:05.380> doing<00:07:05.530> in<00:07:05.680> a

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
batch and what you'll see me doing in a

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.430 
batch and what you'll see me doing in a
minute<00:07:05.980> is<00:07:06.190> spray<00:07:07.030> sprinkling<00:07:07.780> over<00:07:07.930> some
