00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
right here i made a inverter it helped

right here i made a inverter it helped
extend<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:59.450> red<00:02:00.450> dust<00:02:00.750> radius<00:02:02.810> now<00:02:03.810> let's

extend the red dust radius now let's
fall<00:02:04.350> from<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.009> inverter<00:02:06.649> over<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.509> door

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
fall from the inverter over to the door

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.580 
fall from the inverter over to the door
I<00:02:11.450> better<00:02:12.450> like<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:13.020> because<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.440> is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
I better like this because it is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.760 
I better like this because it is
completely<00:02:14.459> hitting<00:02:14.940> hidden<00:02:15.600> from<00:02:15.840> sight<00:02:16.260> so

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
that will do let's close it back up

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:51.069 
that will do let's close it back up
again

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079

there you go and now you'll have to

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.910 
there you go and now you'll have to
leave<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.909> open<00:02:57.269> unless<00:02:57.720> I'm<00:02:58.349> working<00:02:58.769> on<00:02:58.860> a

fun I know a lot of people don't like it
but<00:03:48.459> I<00:03:48.609> do<00:03:50.579> let's<00:03:51.579> see<00:03:51.849> what<00:03:52.060> else<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.540> herb

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.990 

trying<00:03:56.139> to<00:03:56.230> think

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.080

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
oh yeah i'll show you how to make a

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.030 
oh yeah i'll show you how to make a
inverter<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:05.030> easy<00:04:05.240> way<00:04:05.680> instead<00:04:06.680> of<00:04:06.740> waste

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
inverter the easy way instead of waste

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.780 
inverter the easy way instead of waste
and<00:04:07.190> all<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.430> materials<00:04:08.060> i<00:04:08.830> am<00:04:09.830> the<00:04:12.430> zen<00:04:13.430> here

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
and all the materials i am the zen here

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.730 
and all the materials i am the zen here
is<00:04:13.940> going<00:04:14.210> to<00:04:14.270> be<00:04:14.390> your<00:04:14.570> powered<00:04:14.930> off<00:04:15.110> n<00:04:15.380> so

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
is going to be your powered off n so

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.780 
is going to be your powered off n so
let's<00:04:15.980> say<00:04:17.950> let's<00:04:18.950> place<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.340> taurus<00:04:19.609> right

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
let's say let's place the taurus right

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.670 
let's say let's place the taurus right
there<00:04:22.000> there<00:04:23.000> you<00:04:23.090> go<00:04:23.180> that's<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.110> inverter

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
there there you go that's the inverter

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.460 
there there you go that's the inverter
most<00:04:25.040> lot<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.490> people<00:04:25.760> make<00:04:26.060> it<00:04:26.240> like<00:04:26.470> let's

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
most lot of people make it like let's

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.320 
most lot of people make it like let's
see

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.420 

oops<00:04:34.710> do<00:04:35.710> sand<00:04:37.650> some<00:04:38.650> people<00:04:38.949> make<00:04:39.130> it<00:04:39.280> like

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
oops do sand some people make it like

and<00:04:45.830> there's<00:04:46.820> no<00:04:47.030> point<00:04:47.360> in<00:04:47.540> to<00:04:47.810> making<00:04:48.050> it

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
and there's no point in to making it

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.150 
and there's no point in to making it
like<00:04:48.440> that<00:04:48.710> at<00:04:48.890> all<00:04:50.890> actually<00:04:51.890> they<00:04:52.070> don't

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
like that at all actually they don't

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.010 
like that at all actually they don't
work<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:52.730> don't<00:04:53.000> know<00:04:53.090> how<00:04:53.210> other<00:04:53.420> people<00:04:53.780> make

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
work I don't know how other people make

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.130 
work I don't know how other people make
it<00:04:57.760> well<00:04:58.760> there<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.150> go<00:04:59.210> that's<00:04:59.540> an<00:04:59.720> inverter

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
it well there you go that's an inverter

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:11.080 
it well there you go that's an inverter
and<00:05:06.610> good<00:05:07.610> luck<00:05:07.760> making<00:05:08.060> your<00:05:08.390> secret<00:05:08.840> room
