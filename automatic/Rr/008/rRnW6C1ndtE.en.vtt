00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540 

now<00:00:00.390> we<00:00:00.450> will<00:00:00.659> show<00:00:01.040> how<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.070> simple

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
now we will show how a simple

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.749 
now we will show how a simple
synthesizer<00:00:03.330> is<00:00:03.950> realized<00:00:04.950> using<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.580> touch

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
synthesizer is realized using the touch

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.240 
synthesizer is realized using the touch
box<00:00:06.029> editor<00:00:06.480> upload<00:00:07.200> it<00:00:07.379> into<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.710> touch<00:00:07.890> box

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
box editor upload it into the touch box

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.740 
box editor upload it into the touch box
and<00:00:09.240> played<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.469> touch<00:00:11.099> screen<00:00:11.630> so<00:00:12.630> we

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
and played on the touch screen so we

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.510 
and played on the touch screen so we
start<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.910> pc<00:00:14.910> based<00:00:15.660> editor<00:00:16.529> written<00:00:17.400> in

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
start the pc based editor written in

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.630 
start the pc based editor written in
java<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.570> structure<00:00:19.350> view<00:00:19.740> where

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
java so this is the structure view where

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.259 
java so this is the structure view where
the<00:00:20.939> modules<00:00:21.869> are<00:00:22.619> connected<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:24.090> is

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
the modules are connected and this is

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.050 
the modules are connected and this is
the<00:00:24.449> interface<00:00:24.840> view<00:00:25.350> where<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.789> will

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the interface view where what will

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.429 
the interface view where what will
appear<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.750> touch<00:00:27.930> screen<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.880> previewed

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
appear on the touch screen is previewed

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.319 
appear on the touch screen is previewed
so<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.560> start<00:00:31.830> by<00:00:32.009> creating<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.579> keyboard

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
so we start by creating a keyboard

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.069 
so we start by creating a keyboard
module<00:00:34.219> so<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.910> module<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:36.899> its

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
module so this is the module with its

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.700 
module so this is the module with its
inputs<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.090> outputs<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.500> this

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
inputs and outputs and this is how this

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.670 
inputs and outputs and this is how this
interface<00:00:41.550> module<00:00:42.090> will<00:00:42.809> appear<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
interface module will appear on the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.240 
interface module will appear on the
touch<00:00:43.860> screen<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.270> place<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.989> module<00:00:46.350> here

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
touch screen so we place the module here

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.549 
touch screen so we place the module here
and<00:00:49.489> now<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.550> create<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.480> sound<00:00:51.870> generating

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
and now we create the sound generating

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.340 
and now we create the sound generating
device<00:00:54.140> which<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:56.210> can<00:00:57.210> choose<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:58.289> example

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
device which we can choose for example

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.530 
device which we can choose for example
to<00:00:58.859> use<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> square<00:01:00.000> wave<00:01:00.210> oscillator<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:05.540> we

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
to use a square wave oscillator and we

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.600 
to use a square wave oscillator and we
want<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.430> connect<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.619> frequency<00:01:10.619> output<00:01:10.830> of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
want to connect the frequency output of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.760 
want to connect the frequency output of
the<00:01:11.909> keyboard<00:01:12.299> module<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> frequency

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the keyboard module to the frequency

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.090 
the keyboard module to the frequency
input<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.060> oscillator<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.710> do<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.890> like

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
input of the oscillator so we do it like

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.670 
input of the oscillator so we do it like
this<00:01:17.880> clicking<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> output<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.470> first

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
this clicking on the output of the first

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.219 
this clicking on the output of the first
module<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.369> connecting<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> input<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
module and connecting it to the input of

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:31.580 
module and connecting it to the input of
the<00:01:22.560> layer<00:01:24.350> play<00:01:25.350> again<00:01:26.000> yeah<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:30.290> then<00:01:31.290> we

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the layer play again yeah and then we

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.149 
the layer play again yeah and then we
connect<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> output<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.299> oscillator<00:01:34.159> to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
connect the output of the oscillator to

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.499 
connect the output of the oscillator to
the<00:01:35.840> whole<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:41.119> would<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.150> rise

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the whole you out so this would be rise

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.289 
the whole you out so this would be rise
to<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.979> very<00:01:43.979> simple<00:01:44.430> st.<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.880> which<00:01:45.060> this

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
to a very simple st. in which this

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.440 
to a very simple st. in which this
oscillator<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.049> always<00:01:46.790> sounding<00:01:47.790> through

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
oscillator is always sounding through

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.289 
oscillator is always sounding through
the<00:01:48.659> audio<00:01:49.170> outputs<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.950> its<00:01:50.490> frequency<00:01:50.970> is

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the audio outputs and its frequency is

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.539 
the audio outputs and its frequency is
controlled<00:01:51.810> by<00:01:51.960> which<00:01:52.409> key<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.920> pressed<00:01:53.159> on

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
controlled by which key is pressed on

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.620 
controlled by which key is pressed on
the<00:01:53.759> keyboard<00:01:54.829> so<00:01:55.829> if<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.610> generate<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.390> code

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the keyboard so if we generate the code

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.330 
the keyboard so if we generate the code
for<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.110> very<00:01:58.469> simple<00:01:58.829> synthesizer<00:02:01.159> we<00:02:02.159> can

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
for this very simple synthesizer we can

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.940 
for this very simple synthesizer we can
then<00:02:02.520> switch<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.990> made<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:07.500> code<00:02:07.770> is

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
then switch to made and this code is

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.729 
then switch to made and this code is
automatically<00:02:08.520> uploaded<00:02:09.119> into<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.629> cash<00:02:10.500> box

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
automatically uploaded into the cash box

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.050 
automatically uploaded into the cash box
project

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
project

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.630 
project
so<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:17.360> see<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:17.960> file<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.040> assembly

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
so you see that the file of the assembly

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.820 
so you see that the file of the assembly
program<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.300> magic<00:02:20.570> has<00:02:20.720> been<00:02:20.900> modified<00:02:21.170> so

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
program for magic has been modified so

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.630 
program for magic has been modified so
this<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.090> new<00:02:24.160> file<00:02:25.160> that's<00:02:25.460> been

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
this is the new file that's been

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.010 
this is the new file that's been
generated<00:02:25.670> by<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.450> editor<00:02:27.790> then<00:02:28.790> we<00:02:29.030> build

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
generated by the editor then we build

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:43.300 
generated by the editor then we build
the<00:02:30.740> project<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:41.710> assembly<00:02:42.710> file<00:02:42.950> and

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
the project and the assembly file and

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.900 
the project and the assembly file and
main<00:02:44.270> file<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.720> been<00:02:45.290> changed<00:02:45.770> we<00:02:46.340> load<00:02:46.670> the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
main file have been changed we load the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:03:09.450 
main file have been changed we load the
programming<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.600> board

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.450 

this<00:03:10.060> why

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
this why

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.670 
this why
now<00:03:12.060> program<00:03:12.600> is<00:03:12.690> loaded<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.200> we<00:03:13.380> are<00:03:13.470> ready

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
now program is loaded and we are ready

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.090 
now program is loaded and we are ready
to<00:03:13.770> start<00:03:13.950> aboard<00:03:14.700> when<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:15.030> will<00:03:15.860> start<00:03:16.860> the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
to start aboard when we will start the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.720 
to start aboard when we will start the
program<00:03:18.290> we<00:03:19.290> will<00:03:19.500> see<00:03:19.710> that<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:20.070> leg<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.520> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
program we will see that the leg of the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.290 
program we will see that the leg of the
j<00:03:21.060> test<00:03:21.330> shows<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.950> rating<00:03:23.550> system<00:03:23.910> version

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
j test shows the rating system version

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.990 
j test shows the rating system version
and<00:03:24.510> we<00:03:25.500> will<00:03:25.650> hear<00:03:25.950> though<00:03:26.160> she<00:03:26.220> feels<00:03:26.730> later

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
and we will hear though she feels later

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:40.250 
and we will hear though she feels later
sounding<00:03:27.630> through<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.320> speakers<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:39.200> if<00:03:40.200> we

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
sounding through the speakers so if we

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:48.830 
sounding through the speakers so if we
now<00:03:42.140> start<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:47.330> touchscreen<00:03:48.330> emulator<00:03:48.720> for

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
now start the touchscreen emulator for

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.440 
now start the touchscreen emulator for
the<00:03:49.140> board<00:03:49.350> we<00:03:49.620> are<00:03:49.710> ready<00:03:49.830> to<00:03:49.980> communicate<00:03:50.640> if

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
the board we are ready to communicate if

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.500 
the board we are ready to communicate if
you<00:03:51.630> see<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:53.550> city<00:03:53.790> operating<00:03:54.210> system

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
you see that the city operating system

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.950 
you see that the city operating system
is<00:03:54.630> now<00:03:54.750> on<00:03:54.990> because<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.500> leg<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:56.090> as<00:03:57.090> light<00:03:57.780> up

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
is now on because the leg is as light up

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.830 
is now on because the leg is as light up
a<00:03:58.140> power<00:03:58.320> line<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:59.480> we<00:04:00.480> can<00:04:00.660> start

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
a power line and we can start

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.050 
a power line and we can start
touchscreen<00:04:01.500> emulator<00:04:01.920> so<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.850> we<00:04:03.030> are

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
touchscreen emulator so that we are

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:12.110 
touchscreen emulator so that we are
ready<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.510> communicate<00:04:04.410> with<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.770> board<00:04:11.120> so

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
ready to communicate with the board so

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.880 
ready to communicate with the board so
we<00:04:12.150> now<00:04:14.360> stop<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.540> gdb<00:04:15.990> process<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.590> unlock

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
we now stop the gdb process to unlock

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.810 
we now stop the gdb process to unlock
the<00:04:17.040> access<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.520> the<00:04:17.610> serial<00:04:18.030> port<00:04:22.010> and<00:04:23.010> after

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
the access to the serial port and after

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.200 
the access to the serial port and after
we<00:04:24.660> start<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.580> touch<00:04:26.580> screen<00:04:26.700> and<00:04:26.970> later

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
we start the touch screen and later

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.850 
we start the touch screen and later
which<00:04:27.480> is<00:04:27.630> ready<00:04:27.840> to<00:04:28.050> communicate<00:04:28.560> with<00:04:28.590> the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
which is ready to communicate with the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:38.950 
which is ready to communicate with the
board<00:04:30.410> so<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.710> ice<00:04:32.090> started

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.320 

see<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.080> oscillator<00:04:40.590> is<00:04:40.800> no<00:04:40.949> something

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
see the oscillator is no something

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.129 
see the oscillator is no something
we<00:04:42.449> can<00:04:42.629> change<00:04:43.020> its<00:04:43.319> frequency<00:04:44.509> by<00:04:45.509> using<00:04:45.870> the

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
we can change its frequency by using the

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:53.629 
we can change its frequency by using the
keyboard<00:04:46.319> Walker

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.699
