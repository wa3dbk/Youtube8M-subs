00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.160
 carp freshwater bony fish 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.640
 so this dish is just an amateur 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.189
 I'll cook it in the oven 2 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.990
 medium onion cut into rings is 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.270
 we need to basics 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.610
 dishes in which we will bake a carp 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.160
 I grease first with vegetable oil and 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.100
 then spread all chopped onions on 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.760
 bottom 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.760
 cover but in general 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.750
 take potatoes 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:49.129
 prefabricated spices pieces you can 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:52.129
 also cut 3 4 potatoes into small 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.589
 the pieces should be small 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.430
 so that they can bake along with 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.479
 fish in general, mix these pieces 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.110
 potatoes with spices and salt 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:07.030
 vegetable oil and put on top 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.030
 too layer on the meadow 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.630
 Sazan I already almost 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.850
 the power now remains only to do on 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:25.119
 two sides of it frequent cuts across 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.119
 this is done to eat fish 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.979
 it was possible with bones roughly speaking 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.979
 how she is very bony 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.370
 pepper we add spices for fish 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.040
 spread carp on top of potatoes 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.770
 watering a lot of mayonnaise and become 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.170
 oven for 60 minutes temperature 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.600
 about a hundred and eighty two hundred degrees 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.540
 30 minutes until cooked 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.250
 can cover the top with foil either 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.520
 cover your dishes in general to 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.690
 the potatoes are cooked until ready 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.690
