00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
is a really good attacker has to play

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.660 
is a really good attacker has to play
further<00:02:34.049> back<00:02:34.349> so<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.650> can<00:02:34.769> keep<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.190> bat<00:02:35.340> for

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
further back so you can keep the bat for

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.880 
further back so you can keep the bat for
I<00:02:36.060> defender<00:02:36.780> back<00:02:36.900> for<00:02:37.110> some<00:02:37.349> of<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:37.799> it's

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
I defender back for some of that so it's

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.319 
I defender back for some of that so it's
really<00:02:38.040> pretty<00:02:38.310> ridiculous<00:02:38.790> what's<00:02:38.970> happened

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
really pretty ridiculous what's happened

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.800 
really pretty ridiculous what's happened
however<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.590> don't<00:02:41.549> know<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.329> pretty<00:02:42.629> solid

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
however I don't know it is pretty solid

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.089 
however I don't know it is pretty solid
but<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.260> have<00:02:43.409> to<00:02:43.500> play<00:02:43.620> for<00:02:43.680> at<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:43.980> back

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
but you have to play for at the back

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.289 
but you have to play for at the back
which<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.489> only<00:02:44.670> usually<00:02:44.940> likes<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.120> play

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
which it's only usually likes to play

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.000 
which it's only usually likes to play
free<00:02:45.569> at<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.720> back<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.079> not<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.650> nice<00:02:46.799> it's

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
free at the back is not the nice it's

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.140 
free at the back is not the nice it's
not<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.280> greatest<00:02:47.459> things<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.819> that<00:02:47.940> feels

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
not the greatest things you that feels

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.420 
not the greatest things you that feels
attacking<00:02:48.720> however<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.739> midfield<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.310> do

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
attacking however in midfield you do

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.009 
attacking however in midfield you do
have<00:02:50.670> some<00:02:50.910> people<00:02:51.180> who<00:02:51.269> can<00:02:51.510> hit<00:02:51.660> some<00:02:51.840> pretty

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
have some people who can hit some pretty

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.470 
have some people who can hit some pretty
good<00:02:52.079> long<00:02:52.319> shots<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.640> played<00:02:53.910> free<00:02:54.299> in<00:02:54.390> the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
good long shots so I played free in the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.479 
good long shots so I played free in the
middle<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.840> Gibson<00:02:55.680> can't<00:02:55.980> hit<00:02:56.099> a<00:02:56.129> good<00:02:56.340> long

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
middle and Gibson can't hit a good long

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.069 
middle and Gibson can't hit a good long
shot<00:02:56.700> although<00:02:57.000> his<00:02:57.180> stats<00:02:57.510> say<00:02:57.810> otherwise

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
shot although his stats say otherwise

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.170 
shot although his stats say otherwise
his<00:02:58.890> shooting<00:02:59.160> should<00:02:59.400> be<00:02:59.549> higher<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.970> so

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
his shooting should be higher and so

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.180 
his shooting should be higher and so
she's<00:03:00.420> pace<00:03:00.840> they<00:03:01.440> feel<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> lot<00:03:01.799> better<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.099> the
