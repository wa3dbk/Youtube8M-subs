it's a na a new approach which i believe

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.800 
it's a na a new approach which i believe
is<00:03:37.890> from<00:03:38.420> jcpenney<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:40.730> it's<00:03:41.730> short<00:03:42.270> sleeved

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
it's probably that's cotton it's off and

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.949 
it's probably that's cotton it's off and
it's<00:03:47.130> long<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.730> comes<00:03:47.970> with<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.600> same<00:03:48.780> length

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
it's long it comes with the same length

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.300 
it's long it comes with the same length
as<00:03:49.140> other<00:03:49.320> one<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.680> comes<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:50.010> little<00:03:50.130> bit
