00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 there are very good guys welcome to a 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.200
 new video and we are here on xbox 360 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.840
 when a new video and this time as 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.730
 says the title of the good video I still do not know 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.960
 how is the video going to be because 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.420
 just happened and as it is already a 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.010
 I usually say this because what am I going to 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.930
 do and it's pretty much what I 'm going to 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.650
 explain here as you see we can go through 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.630
 certain certain blocks maybe some do not 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.939
 know some yes but it is always 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.560
 well remember this you can use it 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.700
 both in minecraft servers of pc 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.469
 on your xbox 360 xbox wii consoles 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.329
 playstation 3 playstation 4 can 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.280
 use it very easily as you see here 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.399
 I have a door example of a door 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.280
 of iron let's do the following we 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.590
 we place in front of the door just a 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.379
 block from low to tiny to touch the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.020
 door just as you see here we throw 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.910
 an inder but we think and we can 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.940
 go through another block that we can 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.410
 to cross is for example the crystal here 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.680
 I have another example, let's do what 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.690
 same as they see and we advance that opposite 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.120
 this trick is epic because they can 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.140
 use it for many functions 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.250
 they can be for trolling 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.500
 mainly to me it is 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.340
 happening many let's go back to 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.440
 enter we enter and another escape that 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.330
 we can do is with this kind of 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.920
 Stairs that are blocked can 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.870
 also be with hatches but I here 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.170
 put a slab to make it easier 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.080
 identify it as you come we approach like this 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.580
 we left it is important to clarify that this 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.130
 trick does not work with certain blocks 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.080
 but with some in specific for 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.760
 example those already mentioned I have been 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.350
 testing if you can with this amount 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.420
 of blocks so let's prove it 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.890
 Yes you can 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.060
 ok could not 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.840
 let's try with stone could not 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.090
 with earth 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.570
 you can not with stone 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.340
 it is not more you can not 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.340
 with this mineral to see 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.510
 we can not go through the diamond, not what 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.270
 we can go through 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.460
 let's see this we will not go through and 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.650
 before we debate we can not 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.120
 go through as they see only some 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.070
 objects already mentioned can be 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.870
 go through as for example also the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.490
 fences the fences we can go through 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.990
 if there is a large fence fences 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.500
 we can do the following with the ceen 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.370
 of the port 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.250
 and we go through ok a pretty easy trick 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.090
 we can also go through the bars 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.150
 metal doing the same trick and the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.940
 we also cross the cobblestone berries 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.940
 we can go through the way they see 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.280
 now if we can go through the leaves as 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.710
 a moment that I'm running out of 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.840
 hungry and finally the aforementioned 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.680
 crystal that we can go through very 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.480
 easily and smells even this trick 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.300
 It can be used for many things 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.890
 for example here we have an example of 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.910
 a glass and below there are some stairs 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.920
 but if we do not want anyone to enter as 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.790
 we are going to do to enter we are going to 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.590
 place one in there but and we go through 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.790
 we can go through this very easily and 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.000
 here we can put a hidden room 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.190
 etc. let's go out ok 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.910
 we go out and here I have an example yet 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.960
 greater with an enchantment table 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.510
 we do the same trick and we go down 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.480
 a pretty pretty cool trick that 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.720
 he seems with his teachers his chests 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.370
 excuse me for many little things that 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.930
 it is really very useful 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.100
 this secret room can use it 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.380
 as a secret room and that 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.319
 interpreters be your input 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.069
 here we enter and 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.840
 we can enter and as said before it is 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.969
 very good to remember this trick for 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.590
 those who already know and if not 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:55.599
 you know you can leave your like that 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.549
 will exceed times subscribe to the channel to

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.280
 new videos here I say goodbye goodbye 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.310
 all right 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.310
 but no 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.420
 assets 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.200
