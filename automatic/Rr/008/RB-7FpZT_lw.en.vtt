00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
they look like when they're all

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.060 
they look like when they're all
physically<00:00:26.250> cabled<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> PC

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
physically cabled up so you have the PC

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.440 
physically cabled up so you have the PC
the<00:00:29.519> console<00:00:30.859> and<00:00:31.859> then<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.520> TV<00:00:32.759> and

the console and then you have the TV and
the<00:00:33.570> monitor<00:00:35.570> so<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.170> setup<00:00:37.410> I'm<00:00:38.070> just

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the monitor so for this setup I'm just

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.709 
the monitor so for this setup I'm just
gonna<00:00:38.309> show<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> ps3<00:00:39.149> console<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.660> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
gonna show the ps3 console one that I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.139 
gonna show the ps3 console one that I
currently<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:40.140> configured<00:00:40.710> here<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.940> I've

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
currently have configured here so I've

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.350 
currently have configured here so I've
got<00:00:42.500> on<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.710> back<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.850> cable<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.329> I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
got on the back I have that cable that I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.020 
got on the back I have that cable that I
talked<00:00:45.660> about<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.260> has<00:00:46.440> HDMI<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:47.460> end<00:00:47.700> so

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
talked about that has HDMI on one end so

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.540 
talked about that has HDMI on one end so
that<00:00:48.059> plugs<00:00:48.420> into<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.719> ps3<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.379> then<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that plugs into the ps3 and then on the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.369 
that plugs into the ps3 and then on the
other<00:00:50.610> hand<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.539> DVI<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> DVI<00:00:54.379> has

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
other hand we have DVI so the DVI has

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.830 
other hand we have DVI so the DVI has
the<00:00:55.620> video<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.610> end<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.090> then<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the video on one end and then the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.610 
the video on one end and then the
Toslink<00:00:58.530> optical<00:00:59.190> audio<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> other<00:01:00.149> end

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
Toslink optical audio on the other end

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.619 
Toslink optical audio on the other end
for<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.680> ps3<00:01:01.949> sound<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.820> gonna<00:01:03.090> go<00:01:03.270> there<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
for the ps3 sound is gonna go there and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.579 
for the ps3 sound is gonna go there and
that's<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.290> know<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.409> you're<00:01:04.530> gonna

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
that's I just know that you're gonna

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.640 
that's I just know that you're gonna
have<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> make<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> ps3<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.409> need

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
have to make in the ps3 so that you need

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.830 
have to make in the ps3 so that you need
to<00:01:07.740> use<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> optical<00:01:08.250> sound<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.939> then<00:01:09.720> you

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
to use the optical sound and then you

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.380 
to use the optical sound and then you
have<00:01:10.020> your<00:01:10.380> regular<00:01:10.530> HDMI<00:01:11.159> out<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.790> video<00:01:12.030> so

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
have your regular HDMI out the video so

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.300 
have your regular HDMI out the video so
those<00:01:12.570> two<00:01:12.780> get<00:01:12.960> combined<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.560> they<00:01:14.159> get

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
those two get combined and they get

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.530 
those two get combined and they get
output<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.880> an<00:01:15.000> HDMI<00:01:16.490> from<00:01:17.490> via<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.150> this

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
output on an HDMI from via the this

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.920 
output on an HDMI from via the this
liner<00:01:19.020> box<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.860> looks<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.729> then

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
liner box so it looks like that and then

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.090 
liner box so it looks like that and then
I<00:01:21.930> think<00:01:22.080> about<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.380> thing<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.860> has<00:01:22.979> an

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
I think about this thing is it has an

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
I think about this thing is it has an
on/off<00:01:23.400> switch<00:01:23.430> sinking<00:01:24.210> shut<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.869> off<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> is

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
on/off switch sinking shut it off it is

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.480 
on/off switch sinking shut it off it is
a<00:01:25.380> power<00:01:25.770> powered<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.540> has<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> power<00:01:27.900> cable

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
a power powered so it has a power cable

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.440 
a power powered so it has a power cable
and<00:01:29.490> I'll<00:01:30.030> show<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.270> how<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> splitter<00:01:31.259> looks

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
and I'll show you how the splitter looks

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
and I'll show you how the splitter looks
so<00:01:33.450> splitters<00:01:34.110> down<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:35.360> okay<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
so splitters down here okay so for the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.340 
so splitters down here okay so for the
splitter<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:39.000> splitter<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.509> powered<00:01:39.930> also

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
splitter the splitter is powered also

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.170 
splitter the splitter is powered also
but<00:01:40.740> when<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.070> not<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.369> use<00:01:41.400> these<00:01:41.939> lights

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
but when it's not in use these lights

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.090 
but when it's not in use these lights
are<00:01:42.600> not<00:01:42.840> lit<00:01:43.079> all<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.470> time<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.040> not

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
are not lit all the time so it's not

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.850 
are not lit all the time so it's not
like<00:01:44.220> they're<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.899> 24/7<00:01:45.899> they're<00:01:46.380> only<00:01:46.649> it's

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
like they're on 24/7 they're only it's

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.560 
like they're on 24/7 they're only it's
only<00:01:47.009> on<00:01:47.220> when<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.729> when<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.149> detects<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
only on when it when it detects the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.380 
only on when it when it detects the
signal<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.439> input<00:01:49.829> input<00:01:50.070> signal<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
signal the input input signal so the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.999 
signal the input input signal so the
input<00:01:51.600> signal<00:01:51.930> comes<00:01:52.140> from<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> splitter<00:01:52.770> box

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
input signal comes from the splitter box

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.639 
input signal comes from the splitter box
or<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.430> console<00:01:53.850> carrying<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.020> video<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
or the console carrying the video and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.209 
or the console carrying the video and
audio<00:01:56.219> signal<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:58.229> goes<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> splitter<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
audio signal it goes to the splitter the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.170 
splitter is going to send it out on two
outputs<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.159> going<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.030> cable

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
outputs one is going to be the cable

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.929 
outputs one is going to be the cable
that<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.450> connect<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.960> your<00:02:03.990> TV<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:05.490> other<00:02:05.670> is

capture card so as shown there there's

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.449 
capture card so as shown there there's
the<00:02:11.600> PC<00:02:11.959> so<00:02:12.500> somewhere<00:02:12.830> in<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.010> back<00:02:13.160> over

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
the PC so somewhere in the back over

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.570 
the PC so somewhere in the back over
there<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:14.270> connects<00:02:15.100> so<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:16.190> can<00:02:16.310> see<00:02:16.459> in

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
there it connects so you can see in

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.600 
there it connects so you can see in
there<00:02:16.850> there's<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:19.450> fx8<00:02:20.450> poor<00:02:20.780> process<00:02:21.230> here

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.780 

and<00:02:25.610> that's<00:02:25.790> pretty<00:02:26.000> much<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.300> now<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:31.580> one

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
and that's pretty much it now the one

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.280 
and that's pretty much it now the one

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
change that you have to make in the ps3

select optical digital you're not going

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.360 
select optical digital you're not going
to<00:02:44.150> select<00:02:44.300> HDMI<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:45.500> can<00:02:45.650> select<00:02:45.860> optical

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
to select HDMI you can select optical

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.180 
to select HDMI you can select optical
digital<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:47.590> then<00:02:48.590> you're<00:02:48.709> just<00:02:48.830> gonna<00:02:48.920> leave

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
digital and then you're just gonna leave

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.330 
digital and then you're just gonna leave
it<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:50.030> default<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.920> can<00:02:51.920> just<00:02:52.190> check

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
it on the default and you can just check

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.660 
it on the default and you can just check
off<00:02:52.519> AAC<00:02:53.470> that's<00:02:54.470> that's<00:02:54.920> all<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.340> need<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.550> do

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
off AAC that's that's all you need to do

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.120 
off AAC that's that's all you need to do
do<00:02:56.120> not<00:02:56.150> choose<00:02:56.720> 5.1<00:02:58.150> Dolby<00:02:59.150> Digital<00:02:59.180> or<00:02:59.720> DTS

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
do not choose 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.979 
do not choose 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS
because<00:03:01.130> if<00:03:01.519> you<00:03:01.670> if<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.120> play<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.330> game<00:03:02.630> that

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
because if you if you play a game that

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.199 
because if you if you play a game that
has<00:03:03.920> that<00:03:04.160> you're<00:03:04.310> gonna<00:03:04.400> get<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.610> static<00:03:04.970> sound

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
has that you're gonna get a static sound

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.120 
has that you're gonna get a static sound
the<00:03:05.810> reason<00:03:06.080> for<00:03:06.170> that<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.500> because<00:03:06.530> the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
the reason for that is because the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.320 
the reason for that is because the
capture<00:03:07.459> card<00:03:07.670> unless<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.000> have<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.120> capture

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
capture card unless you have a capture

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.920 
capture card unless you have a capture
card<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:09.230> supports<00:03:09.590> capturing<00:03:09.980> 5.1<00:03:10.580> audio

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
card that supports capturing 5.1 audio

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.870 
card that supports capturing 5.1 audio
you<00:03:11.930> will<00:03:12.049> get<00:03:12.290> static<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.430> took<00:03:13.610> me<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.790> while

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
you will get static it took me a while

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.949 
you will get static it took me a while
to<00:03:13.940> figure<00:03:14.090> that<00:03:14.269> out<00:03:14.390> because<00:03:14.480> when<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:14.720> used

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
to figure that out because when I used

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.560 
to figure that out because when I used
to<00:03:15.019> stream<00:03:15.320> like<00:03:15.560> Tekken<00:03:15.920> Tag<00:03:16.130> that<00:03:17.090> game<00:03:17.329> does

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
to stream like Tekken Tag that game does

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.190 
to stream like Tekken Tag that game does
5.1<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:19.370> had<00:03:19.610> a<00:03:19.640> horrible<00:03:19.910> static<00:03:20.360> sound<00:03:20.570> it

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
5.1 and I had a horrible static sound it

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.420 
5.1 and I had a horrible static sound it
took<00:03:21.350> me<00:03:21.500> forever<00:03:21.799> to<00:03:22.010> figure<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.370> out

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
took me forever to figure that out

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.069 
took me forever to figure that out
because<00:03:22.820> I<00:03:23.060> was<00:03:23.180> thinking<00:03:23.480> why<00:03:23.660> doesn't<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:23.959> do

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
because I was thinking why doesn't it do

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.930 
because I was thinking why doesn't it do
this<00:03:24.170> on<00:03:24.320> other<00:03:24.410> games<00:03:24.650> so<00:03:25.610> that's<00:03:25.760> pretty

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
this on other games so that's pretty

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.620 
this on other games so that's pretty
much<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.329> as<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:27.290> can<00:03:27.410> see<00:03:27.470> here<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:28.450> have<00:03:29.450> the

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
much it as you can see here I have the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.900 
much it as you can see here I have the
stream<00:03:30.170> not<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.070> stream<00:03:31.340> but<00:03:31.519> I<00:03:31.549> just<00:03:31.760> have
