again<00:00:00.299> if<00:00:00.510> we<00:00:00.599> hit<00:00:00.690> play<00:00:00.870> right<00:00:01.079> now

00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:01.669 
again if we hit play right now

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:03.830 
again if we hit play right now
absolutely<00:00:02.669> nothing<00:00:03.330> will<00:00:03.449> happen

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
absolutely nothing will happen

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.320 
absolutely nothing will happen
so<00:00:04.259> let's<00:00:04.620> incorporate<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.460> first<00:00:05.700> real<00:00:06.029> bit

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
so let's incorporate the first real bit

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.780 
so let's incorporate the first real bit
of<00:00:06.509> programming<00:00:07.319> in<00:00:07.379> here<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.799> give<00:00:08.340> our<00:00:08.550> ball

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
of programming in here and give our ball

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.640 
of programming in here and give our ball
an<00:00:09.080> artificial<00:00:10.080> force<00:00:10.320> we're<00:00:10.469> going<00:00:10.590> to

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
an artificial force we're going to

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.959 
an artificial force we're going to
manually<00:00:11.040> set<00:00:11.219> some<00:00:11.400> sort<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.610> force<00:00:11.820> on<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
manually set some sort of force on the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.249 
manually set some sort of force on the
ball<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.240> get<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.389> moving<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.990> we're<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.230> to

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
ball to get it moving and we're going to

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.660 
ball to get it moving and we're going to
write<00:00:13.380> our<00:00:13.410> first<00:00:13.650> script<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.460> keep<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
write our first script to keep the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.099 
write our first script to keep the

greater career c-sharp is probably the

sort of skills you want to practice the
other<00:00:54.120> thing<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.300> note<00:00:54.449> about<00:00:54.510> JavaScript

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
other thing to note about JavaScript

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.689 
other thing to note about JavaScript
it's<00:00:55.199> not<00:00:55.289> real<00:00:55.559> javascript<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.219> not<00:00:56.250> normal

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
it's not real javascript is not normal

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
it's not real javascript is not normal
JavaScript<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.570> variant<00:00:57.989> people<00:00:58.350> refer

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
JavaScript it's a variant people refer

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.619 
JavaScript it's a variant people refer
to<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.890> unity<00:00:59.280> script<00:00:59.550> because<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.480> not

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
to as a unity script because it's not

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.849 
to as a unity script because it's not
quite<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> same<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.230> anyway<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.770> use

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
quite the same so anyway I like to use

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.740 
quite the same so anyway I like to use
c-sharp<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.399> think<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.030> well<00:01:03.180> worth<00:01:03.210> doing<00:01:03.449> so

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
c-sharp I think it's well worth doing so

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.960 
c-sharp I think it's well worth doing so
this<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.710> by<00:01:05.040> default<00:01:05.250> called<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> new<00:01:05.610> behavior

script you can call anything you like

script you can call anything you like
and<00:01:10.470> we're<00:01:11.369> going<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.520> create<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> folder<00:01:11.970> to

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and we're going to create a folder to

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.840 
and we're going to create a folder to
keep<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:12.720> our<00:01:12.750> scripts<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.729> going

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
keep all our scripts in so this is going

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.210 
keep all our scripts in so this is going
to<00:01:14.909> be<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.030> script<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:16.409> pretty<00:01:17.100> much

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
to be the script that that pretty much

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.640 
to be the script that that pretty much
has<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> behavior<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.240> our<00:01:18.270> balls<00:01:18.720> that

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
has all the behavior for our balls that

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.950 
has all the behavior for our balls that
sounded<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.040> little<00:01:20.130> bit<00:01:20.310> dirty<00:01:20.720> one<00:01:21.720> thing<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
sounded a little bit dirty one thing to

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.330 
sounded a little bit dirty one thing to
keep<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.170> mind<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:22.530> an<00:01:22.740> object<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.280> to

keep in mind if an object is going to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.010 
keep in mind if an object is going to

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
some of you may be thinking I can use

some of you may be thinking I can use
multiple<00:01:29.970> inheritance<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:30.600> something<00:01:31.020> like

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
multiple inheritance or something like

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.740 
multiple inheritance or something like
that<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:33.000> use<00:01:33.270> multiple

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that don't do that but do use multiple

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.450 
that don't do that but do use multiple
scripts<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.409> example<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> could<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.100> one

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
scripts for example you could have one

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.399 
scripts for example you could have one
script<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:35.909> things<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.229> that<00:01:37.229> you're<00:01:37.320> going

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
script for things like that you're going

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.350 
script for things like that you're going
to<00:01:37.470> use<00:01:37.650> all<00:01:37.890> objects<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.850> hit<00:01:39.060> points

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
to use all objects that have hit points

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.210 
to use all objects that have hit points
are<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.470> sort<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.920> hit<00:01:41.189> points

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
are going to have a sort of hit points

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.920 
are going to have a sort of hit points
script<00:01:41.700> or<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.880> health<00:01:42.090> script<00:01:42.360> applied<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.810> it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
script or a health script applied to it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.630 
script or a health script applied to it
and<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.560> gives<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.040> oh<00:01:44.189> well<00:01:44.369> it'll

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and that gives it like oh well it'll

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.859 
and that gives it like oh well it'll
start<00:01:44.880> off<00:01:45.000> by<00:01:45.119> setting<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.450> hit<00:01:45.570> points<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
start off by setting the hit points to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.530 
start off by setting the hit points to
100<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.409> then<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.950> has<00:01:47.220> functions<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.939> to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
100 and then it has functions to to

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.870 
100 and then it has functions to to
receive<00:01:48.899> damage<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.560> maybe<00:01:49.649> heal<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
receive damage and maybe heal and and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.219 
receive damage and maybe heal and and
give<00:01:51.060> various<00:01:51.329> feedback<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.930> things<00:01:52.020> like

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
give various feedback and things like

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.660 
give various feedback and things like
that<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.950> entirely<00:01:53.250> separate<00:01:53.640> from

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
that and that is entirely separate from

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
that and that is entirely separate from
the<00:01:53.820> script<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.240> says<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.049> respond

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
the script that says you know I respond

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.469 
the script that says you know I respond
to<00:01:55.860> keyboard<00:01:56.250> input<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.700> move<00:01:56.820> around<00:01:57.030> that

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
to keyboard input and move around that

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.580 
to keyboard input and move around that
way<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.659> don't<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.079> one<00:01:58.200> big

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
way you don't have just one big

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.139 
way you don't have just one big
monolithic<00:01:59.100> player<00:01:59.430> script<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.969> then<00:02:00.090> you

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
monolithic player script and then you

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.310 
monolithic player script and then you
have<00:02:00.270> another<00:02:00.479> monster<00:02:00.750> script<00:02:01.170> that

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
have another monster script that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.230 
have another monster script that
duplicates<00:02:01.740> after<00:02:02.040> code<00:02:02.250> instead<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.060> share

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
duplicates after code instead you share

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.819 
duplicates after code instead you share
the<00:02:03.360> Crow<00:02:03.540> code<00:02:03.810> both<00:02:04.020> players<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.439> monsters

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
the Crow code both players and monsters

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.499 
the Crow code both players and monsters
will<00:02:04.979> use<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.310> hit<00:02:05.549> point<00:02:05.790> script<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.390> on

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
will use the hit point script and so on

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.359 
will use the hit point script and so on
and<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.719> forth<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.009> course<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.280> much

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
and so forth this is of course a much

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.949 
and so forth this is of course a much
simpler<00:02:08.700> project<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.629> not<00:02:09.690> going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.899> be

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
simpler project so it's not going to be

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.600 
simpler project so it's not going to be
much<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.080> an<00:02:10.229> issue<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.619> let's<00:02:11.370> double<00:02:11.580> click

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
much of an issue so let's double click

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.790 
much of an issue so let's double click
on<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.120> open<00:02:12.420> our<00:02:12.690> ball<00:02:12.870> script<00:02:13.110> in

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
on this to open our ball script in

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.160 
on this to open our ball script in
monodevelop<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.670> i<00:02:15.570> just<00:02:15.750> have<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.930> slide<00:02:16.140> it

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
monodevelop and i just have to slide it

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.030 
monodevelop and i just have to slide it
over<00:02:16.290> for<00:02:16.530> my<00:02:16.620> other<00:02:16.770> monitor<00:02:16.950> here<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:19.040> do

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
over for my other monitor here and do

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.420 
over for my other monitor here and do
some<00:02:20.220> awkward<00:02:20.550> resizing<00:02:21.710> so<00:02:22.710> monodevelop<00:02:23.130> is

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
some awkward resizing so monodevelop is

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.450 
some awkward resizing so monodevelop is
the<00:02:23.640> editor<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.000> comes<00:02:24.360> with<00:02:24.720> unity3d<00:02:25.460> you

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
the editor that comes with unity3d you

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.490 
the editor that comes with unity3d you
can<00:02:26.610> also<00:02:26.790> use<00:02:27.060> Visual<00:02:27.510> Studio<00:02:27.600> Express<00:02:27.870> or

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
can also use Visual Studio Express or

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.650 
can also use Visual Studio Express or
potentially<00:02:29.490> any<00:02:29.580> version<00:02:29.820> of<00:02:29.970> video<00:02:30.210> Visual

potentially any version of video Visual

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.920 
potentially any version of video Visual

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
Studio but most people I think probably

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.380 
Studio but most people I think probably
use<00:02:34.050> mono<00:02:34.290> develop<00:02:34.530> as<00:02:34.740> better<00:02:35.280> hooks<00:02:36.030> into

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
use mono develop as better hooks into

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.540 
use mono develop as better hooks into
unity<00:02:36.720> for<00:02:37.350> example<00:02:37.710> if<00:02:37.830> there<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.070> an<00:02:38.340> error

this<00:02:59.670> anyway<00:03:00.090> just<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.630> make<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.930> explicit<00:03:01.260> if

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
this anyway just to make it explicit if

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.230 
this anyway just to make it explicit if
it's<00:03:01.680> missing<00:03:02.070> it'll<00:03:02.490> fill<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:02.880> for<00:03:03.090> you

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
it's missing it'll fill it in for you

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.300 
it's missing it'll fill it in for you
but<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.480> like<00:03:03.720> having<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.110> explicitly<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:05.130> very

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
but I like having it explicitly so very

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.860 
but I like having it explicitly so very
simple<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.820> starts<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.450> off<00:03:06.570> with<00:03:06.600> two

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
simple it starts you off with two

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.540 
simple it starts you off with two
separate<00:03:07.200> functions<00:03:07.320> one<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:08.100> will<00:03:08.250> run<00:03:08.400> at

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
separate functions one that will run at

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.580 
separate functions one that will run at

the start of the program and one that is

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.340 
the start of the program and one that is

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
position and rotation that exists we can

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.000 
position and rotation that exists we can
go<00:03:44.970> transform<00:03:45.630> dot<00:03:46.440> position<00:03:47.250> dot<00:03:48.209> X<00:03:49.010> right

go transform dot position dot X right
and<00:03:50.130> then<00:03:50.370> your<00:03:50.550> you've<00:03:50.820> gotten<00:03:51.090> your

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
and then your you've gotten your

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.910 
and then your you've gotten your
x-coordinate<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.350> includes<00:03:52.680> our

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
x-coordinate and that includes our

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.440 
x-coordinate and that includes our
rigidbody<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:55.010> we're<00:03:56.010> going<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.310> add<00:03:56.640> force

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
rigidbody and we're going to add force

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.910 
rigidbody and we're going to add force
to<00:03:58.350> our<00:03:58.410> rigidbody

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
to our rigidbody

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.740 
to our rigidbody
and<00:03:59.070> there's<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.850> few<00:04:00.030> different<00:04:00.270> ways<00:04:00.390> that<00:04:00.450> we

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
and there's a few different ways that we

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.330 
and there's a few different ways that we
can<00:04:00.900> pass<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.739> force<00:04:02.870> we<00:04:03.870> can<00:04:04.110> instantiate<00:04:05.040> a

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
can pass the force we can instantiate a

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.270 
can pass the force we can instantiate a
vector3<00:04:05.850> object<00:04:06.360> or<00:04:06.959> we<00:04:07.590> can<00:04:07.709> just<00:04:07.830> feed<00:04:08.160> it

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
vector3 object or we can just feed it

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.380 
vector3 object or we can just feed it
some<00:04:08.430> coordinates<00:04:08.790> directly<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.300> know

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
some coordinates directly and you know

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.390 
some coordinates directly and you know
what<00:04:09.510> I'm<00:04:09.630> just<00:04:09.690> going<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.930> do<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.410> I'm<00:04:10.890> going

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
what I'm just going to do that I'm going

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.380 
what I'm just going to do that I'm going
to<00:04:11.459> apply<00:04:11.940> actually<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.930> know<00:04:13.019> what<00:04:14.390> now

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
to apply actually you know what now

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.670 
to apply actually you know what now
we'll<00:04:15.540> do<00:04:15.600> it<00:04:15.660> this<00:04:15.750> way<00:04:15.900> we're<00:04:16.350> in<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.470> plant

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
we'll do it this way we're in a plant

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.470 
we'll do it this way we're in a plant
force<00:04:16.950> start<00:04:17.669> off<00:04:17.760> with<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:18.030> go<00:04:18.120> straight<00:04:18.180> up

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
force start off with that go straight up

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.810 
force start off with that go straight up
so<00:04:18.690> we<00:04:18.780> know<00:04:19.160> we're<00:04:20.160> going<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.310> set<00:04:20.519> a<00:04:20.549> force

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
so we know we're going to set a force

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.610 
so we know we're going to set a force
and<00:04:21.480> I<00:04:21.510> think<00:04:21.690> these<00:04:21.780> will<00:04:21.930> have<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:22.080> be<00:04:22.200> fairly

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
and I think these will have to be fairly

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.490 
and I think these will have to be fairly
large<00:04:22.860> numbers<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.520> like<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.539> thousand<00:04:25.110> make<00:04:25.380> it

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
large numbers of like a thousand make it

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.500 
large numbers of like a thousand make it
a<00:04:25.530> float<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:26.010> zero

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
a float and zero

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.420 
a float and zero
and<00:04:27.600> then<00:04:27.810> close<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.290> off<00:04:28.320> I'm<00:04:29.160> just<00:04:29.250> going

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
and then close that off I'm just going

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.520 
and then close that off I'm just going
to<00:04:29.490> save<00:04:29.730> this<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:30.210> I'm<00:04:30.900> going<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.050> tab<00:04:31.290> back

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
to save this and I'm going to tab back

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.260 
to save this and I'm going to tab back
over<00:04:31.800> I've<00:04:32.010> got<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.220> lot<00:04:32.340> of<00:04:32.430> windows<00:04:32.670> open<00:04:32.790> to

over I've got a lot of windows open to
unity

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
unity

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.500 
unity
it<00:04:33.960> should<00:04:34.230> Auto<00:04:34.490> compile<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:35.670> there's

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
it should Auto compile it there's

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.030 
it should Auto compile it there's
nothing<00:04:36.780> in<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.900> console<00:04:37.260> no<00:04:37.380> errors<00:04:37.680> that

nothing in the console no errors that

nothing in the console no errors that

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
the status bar down here would also show

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.800 
the status bar down here would also show
you<00:04:39.840> errors<00:04:40.200> from<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.920> console<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.400> now<00:04:41.600> if<00:04:42.600> I

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
you errors from the console and now if I

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.090 
you errors from the console and now if I
play<00:04:43.200> well<00:04:43.530> nothing's<00:04:43.830> going<00:04:43.980> to<00:04:44.010> happen

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
play well nothing's going to happen

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.070 
play well nothing's going to happen
actually<00:04:44.630> nothing<00:04:45.630> at<00:04:45.840> all

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
actually nothing at all

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.350 
actually nothing at all
the<00:04:46.380> reason<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:46.770> there<00:04:47.340> is<00:04:47.370> no<00:04:47.700> gravity<00:04:48.120> on<00:04:48.240> the

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
the reason is there is no gravity on the

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.660 
the reason is there is no gravity on the
ball<00:04:48.510> but<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.110> also<00:04:49.410> haven't<00:04:49.830> put<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.370> script

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
ball but I also haven't put the script

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.250 
ball but I also haven't put the script
on<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:51.090> object<00:04:51.480> the<00:04:51.540> script<00:04:51.780> is<00:04:51.900> just<00:04:51.930> one<00:04:52.170> of

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
on the object the script is just one of

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.840 
on the object the script is just one of
my<00:04:52.350> assets<00:04:52.800> right<00:04:52.950> now<00:04:53.070> it's<00:04:53.250> not<00:04:53.400> actually<00:04:53.760> in

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
my assets right now it's not actually in

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.300 
my assets right now it's not actually in
use<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:54.510> once<00:04:54.720> again<00:04:54.840> I'm<00:04:55.530> going<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:55.980> take<00:04:56.220> the

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
use so once again I'm going to take the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.030 
use so once again I'm going to take the
ball<00:04:56.430> script<00:04:56.700> I'm<00:04:56.850> going<00:04:57.480> to<00:04:57.680> drag<00:04:58.680> it<00:04:58.740> onto

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
ball script I'm going to drag it onto

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.280 
ball script I'm going to drag it onto
the<00:04:59.220> ball<00:04:59.430> and<00:04:59.700> now<00:05:00.540> if<00:05:00.630> I<00:05:00.690> click<00:05:00.720> on<00:05:00.990> ball<00:05:01.170> you

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
the ball and now if I click on ball you

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.690 
the ball and now if I click on ball you
can<00:05:01.440> see<00:05:01.560> there's<00:05:01.710> a<00:05:01.770> ball<00:05:01.920> script<00:05:02.310> script

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
can see there's a ball script script

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.460 
can see there's a ball script script
applied<00:05:03.450> to<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:03.780> if<00:05:03.840> I<00:05:03.900> hit<00:05:03.990> play<00:05:04.200> once

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
applied to it and if I hit play once

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.760 
applied to it and if I hit play once
more<00:05:05.990> there<00:05:06.990> we<00:05:07.080> go<00:05:07.170> you<00:05:07.290> got<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.440> force<00:05:07.680> applied

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
more there we go you got a force applied

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.970 
more there we go you got a force applied
to<00:05:07.950> it<00:05:08.390> apparently<00:05:09.390> I<00:05:09.630> got<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.650> direction

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
to it apparently I got the direction

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.620 
to it apparently I got the direction
wrong<00:05:11.100> I<00:05:11.250> didn't<00:05:11.610> realize<00:05:11.850> that<00:05:11.880> a<00:05:12.090> thousand

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
wrong I didn't realize that a thousand

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:20.360 
wrong I didn't realize that a thousand
would<00:05:12.720> be<00:05:12.780> going<00:05:15.500> would<00:05:16.500> be<00:05:16.530> going<00:05:16.740> down<00:05:19.130> no<00:05:20.130> no

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
would be going would be going down no no

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.120 
would be going would be going down no no
okay<00:05:20.730> I<00:05:20.820> think<00:05:21.090> so<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:21.930> was<00:05:22.020> right<00:05:22.260> positive

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
okay I think so I was right positive

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.800 
okay I think so I was right positive
numbers<00:05:23.220> are<00:05:23.550> up<00:05:23.760> I<00:05:23.970> think<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:24.330> just<00:05:24.450> happened

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
numbers are up I think it just happened

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.410 
numbers are up I think it just happened
so<00:05:24.870> fast<00:05:25.020> that<00:05:25.380> I<00:05:25.500> missed<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:25.770> first<00:05:25.920> bounce

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
so fast that I missed the first bounce

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.580 
so fast that I missed the first bounce
there<00:05:27.420> we<00:05:27.570> go<00:05:27.660> slowly<00:05:27.870> starts<00:05:28.170> to<00:05:28.200> go<00:05:28.350> up<00:05:28.380> and

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
there we go slowly starts to go up and

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.680 
there we go slowly starts to go up and
then<00:05:29.100> stops<00:05:31.310> why<00:05:32.310> did<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:32.610> stop<00:05:32.850> I'm<00:05:33.090> actually

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
then stops why did it stop I'm actually

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:43.520 
then stops why did it stop I'm actually
genuinely<00:05:34.170> confused<00:05:34.380> about<00:05:34.680> this<00:05:42.290> it<00:05:43.290> didn't

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
genuinely confused about this it didn't

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.970 
genuinely confused about this it didn't
stop<00:05:43.740> here<00:05:44.040> I<00:05:48.380> think<00:05:49.380> it<00:05:49.470> failed<00:05:49.710> about

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
stop here I think it failed about

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.500 
stop here I think it failed about
somehow<00:05:50.340> something<00:05:50.670> with<00:05:51.060> the<00:05:51.120> materials

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
somehow something with the materials

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.350 
somehow something with the materials
maybe<00:05:51.890> after<00:05:52.890> the<00:05:52.980> artist<00:05:53.250> I<00:05:53.340> I<00:05:53.400> really<00:05:53.940> really

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
maybe after the artist I I really really

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.710 
maybe after the artist I I really really
did<00:05:54.510> not<00:05:54.600> expect<00:05:54.750> that<00:05:55.080> to<00:05:55.200> happen<00:05:56.510> it's<00:05:57.510> I

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
did not expect that to happen it's I

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.840 
did not expect that to happen it's I
think<00:05:57.810> it's<00:05:58.080> just<00:05:58.140> going<00:05:58.350> to<00:05:58.530> slow<00:05:58.760> let's<00:05:59.760> take

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
think it's just going to slow let's take

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:00.980 
think it's just going to slow let's take
a<00:05:59.910> look<00:06:00.060> at<00:06:00.120> the<00:06:00.210> physics<00:06:00.480> material<00:06:00.810> is<00:06:00.900> there

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
a look at the physics material is there

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.890 
a look at the physics material is there
anything<00:06:01.170> we<00:06:01.320> could<00:06:01.440> do<00:06:01.680> to<00:06:02.540> fiddle<00:06:03.540> with<00:06:03.660> that

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
anything we could do to fiddle with that

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.080 
anything we could do to fiddle with that
um<00:06:04.140> is<00:06:04.620> it<00:06:04.830> friction<00:06:05.220> maybe<00:06:05.400> I<00:06:05.610> think<00:06:05.880> it<00:06:05.970> may

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
um is it friction maybe I think it may

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.220 
um is it friction maybe I think it may
have<00:06:06.120> been<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.360> friction<00:06:06.750> that<00:06:06.870> caused<00:06:07.050> it

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
have been the friction that caused it

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.570 
have been the friction that caused it
clamping<00:06:07.620> let's<00:06:07.950> take<00:06:08.100> away<00:06:08.220> all<00:06:08.430> the

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
friction from our ball and see what

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.260 
friction from our ball and see what
happens<00:06:12.920> mmm<00:06:13.920> still<00:06:14.190> I<00:06:14.370> think<00:06:14.820> it's<00:06:15.060> just<00:06:15.210> a

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
happens mmm still I think it's just a

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.270 
happens mmm still I think it's just a
minimum<00:06:15.570> speed<00:06:15.750> and<00:06:16.020> when<00:06:16.500> it's<00:06:16.650> bouncing

clamped<00:06:48.689> and<00:06:48.869> come<00:06:49.049> to<00:06:49.169> a<00:06:49.199> rest<00:06:49.469> and<00:06:49.679> I'm

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:50.189 
clamped and come to a rest and I'm

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:51.559 
clamped and come to a rest and I'm
willing<00:06:50.519> to<00:06:50.549> bet<00:06:50.789> there's<00:06:51.059> somewhere<00:06:51.389> where

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:51.569 
willing to bet there's somewhere where

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:54.979 
willing to bet there's somewhere where
you<00:06:51.629> can<00:06:51.779> tweak<00:06:52.109> that<00:06:52.139> value<00:06:52.829> ah<00:06:53.689> the<00:06:54.689> sleep

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:54.989 
you can tweak that value ah the sleep

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:58.189 
you can tweak that value ah the sleep
velocity<00:06:55.499> I'm<00:06:55.859> sure<00:06:56.219> that's<00:06:56.459> it<00:06:56.929> let<00:06:57.929> me<00:06:57.959> bring

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 
velocity I'm sure that's it let me bring

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.079 
velocity I'm sure that's it let me bring
that<00:06:58.259> back<00:06:58.559> down<00:06:58.709> to<00:06:58.859> 100<00:06:59.219> and<00:06:59.489> again<00:06:59.729> if<00:06:59.879> I<00:06:59.939> hit

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:00.089 
that back down to 100 and again if I hit

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:04.549 
that back down to 100 and again if I hit
play<00:07:01.369> it'll<00:07:02.369> hit<00:07:02.489> and<00:07:02.789> stop<00:07:03.049> but<00:07:04.049> if<00:07:04.169> I<00:07:04.259> take

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:04.559 
play it'll hit and stop but if I take

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:07.129 
play it'll hit and stop but if I take
down<00:07:04.739> the<00:07:05.039> sleep<00:07:05.279> velocity<00:07:05.759> dramatically<00:07:06.749> by

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 
down the sleep velocity dramatically by

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:09.189 
down the sleep velocity dramatically by
say<00:07:07.439> inserting<00:07:08.069> a<00:07:08.159> zero<00:07:08.549> in<00:07:08.729> front<00:07:08.759> of<00:07:08.999> that

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 
say inserting a zero in front of that

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:10.969 
say inserting a zero in front of that
and<00:07:10.199> hit<00:07:10.649> play

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 
and hit play

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:14.929 
and hit play
ah<00:07:12.979> not<00:07:13.979> quite<00:07:14.009> Oh

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:14.939 
ah not quite Oh

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:16.489 
ah not quite Oh
bounce<00:07:15.179> threshold<00:07:15.629> let's<00:07:16.079> try<00:07:16.199> that<00:07:16.349> one

00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:16.499 
bounce threshold let's try that one

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:23.179 
bounce threshold let's try that one
point<00:07:17.309> five<00:07:20.539> there<00:07:21.539> we<00:07:21.959> go<00:07:22.289> so<00:07:22.889> that's<00:07:23.069> the

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:23.189 
point five there we go so that's the

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:25.489 
point five there we go so that's the
problem<00:07:23.509> I'm<00:07:24.509> gonna<00:07:24.659> leave<00:07:24.839> it<00:07:24.959> where<00:07:25.319> it<00:07:25.439> is

00:07:25.489 --> 00:07:25.499 
problem I'm gonna leave it where it is

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:27.139 
problem I'm gonna leave it where it is
because<00:07:25.889> you<00:07:26.039> know<00:07:26.069> what<00:07:26.309> that<00:07:26.669> sounds

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:27.149 
because you know what that sounds

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:28.909 
because you know what that sounds
perfectly<00:07:27.689> fine<00:07:27.929> we're<00:07:28.559> going<00:07:28.679> to<00:07:28.739> want<00:07:28.859> our

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 
perfectly fine we're going to want our

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:30.169 
perfectly fine we're going to want our
objects<00:07:29.249> to<00:07:29.309> move<00:07:29.399> faster<00:07:29.789> anyway<00:07:29.969> let's

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:30.179 
objects to move faster anyway let's

00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:33.159 
objects to move faster anyway let's
let's<00:07:30.419> pick<00:07:30.569> 300<00:07:31.049> as<00:07:31.139> a<00:07:31.169> nice<00:07:31.349> medium<00:07:31.949> speed

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:33.169 
let's pick 300 as a nice medium speed

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:35.600 
let's pick 300 as a nice medium speed
looks<00:07:34.169> good<00:07:34.349> to<00:07:34.469> me<00:07:34.499> all<00:07:35.099> right<00:07:35.159> so<00:07:35.519> this

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.610 
looks good to me all right so this

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:36.829 
looks good to me all right so this
object<00:07:35.819> is<00:07:36.059> going<00:07:36.119> to<00:07:36.239> keep<00:07:36.360> bouncing<00:07:36.689> back

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:36.839 
object is going to keep bouncing back

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:37.819 
object is going to keep bouncing back
and<00:07:36.989> forth<00:07:37.049> because<00:07:37.409> it<00:07:37.499> has<00:07:37.619> perfect

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:37.829 
and forth because it has perfect

00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:41.869 
and forth because it has perfect
bounciness<00:07:38.249> and<00:07:40.039> awesome<00:07:41.039> next<00:07:41.549> thing<00:07:41.789> we

00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:41.879 
bounciness and awesome next thing we

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:43.009 
bounciness and awesome next thing we
need<00:07:41.999> is<00:07:42.179> we<00:07:42.419> need<00:07:42.449> to<00:07:42.599> be<00:07:42.659> able<00:07:42.719> to<00:07:42.809> move<00:07:42.959> the

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:43.019 
need is we need to be able to move the

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:45.529 
need is we need to be able to move the
paddle<00:07:43.369> but<00:07:44.369> before<00:07:44.879> I<00:07:44.909> do<00:07:45.029> that<00:07:45.059> let's<00:07:45.389> make

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:45.539 
paddle but before I do that let's make

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:47.600 
paddle but before I do that let's make
it<00:07:45.599> just<00:07:45.899> slightly<00:07:46.009> more<00:07:47.009> visually<00:07:47.369> appealing

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:47.610 
it just slightly more visually appealing

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.079 
it just slightly more visually appealing
by<00:07:48.119> giving<00:07:48.389> it<00:07:48.479> a<00:07:48.629> slight<00:07:48.899> diagonal<00:07:49.889> motion<00:07:50.159> so

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:51.089 
by giving it a slight diagonal motion so

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:53.419 
by giving it a slight diagonal motion so
now<00:07:51.239> it<00:07:51.479> should<00:07:51.509> hit<00:07:51.869> and<00:07:52.049> then<00:07:52.349> fall<00:07:52.799> down<00:07:52.829> I

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:53.429 
now it should hit and then fall down I

00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:54.619 
now it should hit and then fall down I
don't<00:07:53.849> know<00:07:53.909> I<00:07:53.939> find<00:07:54.119> that<00:07:54.239> very<00:07:54.389> satisfying

00:07:54.619 --> 00:07:54.629 
don't know I find that very satisfying

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:56.569 
don't know I find that very satisfying
alright<00:07:55.589> so<00:07:55.889> we<00:07:56.069> need<00:07:56.159> to<00:07:56.249> be<00:07:56.309> able<00:07:56.369> to<00:07:56.459> move

00:07:56.569 --> 00:07:56.579 
alright so we need to be able to move

00:07:56.579 --> 00:07:58.639 
alright so we need to be able to move
the
