00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
come across me as the greatest movie in

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.710 
come across me as the greatest movie in
the<00:00:24.990> world<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.949> was<00:00:26.099> okay<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.119> enjoyed<00:00:27.570> it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the world it was okay and I enjoyed it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.450 
the world it was okay and I enjoyed it
but<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.199> wasn't<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> movie<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.099> wanted<00:00:29.340> to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
but it wasn't like a movie I wanted to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.179 
but it wasn't like a movie I wanted to
see<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> billion<00:00:29.910> times<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:31.260> when<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.830> got<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
see a billion times so when I got the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.880 
see a billion times so when I got the
requests<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:34.079> wanted<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> draw<00:00:34.649> her

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
requests I I really wanted to draw her

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.069 
requests I I really wanted to draw her
just<00:00:35.640> because<00:00:35.730> she<00:00:35.969> has<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.930> her

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
just because she has that I like her

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.500 
just because she has that I like her
design<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> like<00:00:38.040> her<00:00:38.219> poufy<00:00:38.969> hair<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.450> I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
design and I like her poufy hair and I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.940 
design and I like her poufy hair and I
really<00:00:39.960> wanted<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.379> draw<00:00:40.620> something

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
really wanted to just draw something

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.080 
really wanted to just draw something
like<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.250> because<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.550> don't<00:00:41.700> usually<00:00:41.790> put

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
like that because I don't usually put

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.940 
like that because I don't usually put
too<00:00:42.270> much<00:00:42.390> effort<00:00:42.600> into<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.079> hair<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.920> I

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
too much effort into the hair so I

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.200 
too much effort into the hair so I
thought<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.340> would<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:44.760> fun<00:00:44.969> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
thought that would be really fun and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.850 
thought that would be really fun and
because<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> movie<00:00:46.020> put<00:00:46.230> like<00:00:46.379> such<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> bad

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
because the movie put like such a bad

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.380 
because the movie put like such a bad
taste<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.219> my<00:00:47.309> mouth<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.610> first<00:00:47.760> time<00:00:48.059> but

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
taste in my mouth the first time but

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.360 
taste in my mouth the first time but
that<00:00:48.719> probably<00:00:49.590> could<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:49.920> been<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
that probably could have been the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.799 
that probably could have been the
mountain<00:00:50.670> doing<00:00:50.910> sour<00:00:51.149> skittles<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.719> was

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
mountain doing sour skittles I was

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.990 
mountain doing sour skittles I was
eating<00:00:52.140> at<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> time<00:00:52.530> that's<00:00:53.070> not<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.520> best

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
eating at the time that's not the best

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.119 
eating at the time that's not the best
combo<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.050> decided<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.800> should<00:00:55.980> probably

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
combo but I decided I should probably

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.849 
combo but I decided I should probably
watch<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.180> trailers<00:00:57.570> again<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.410> like<00:00:58.530> again

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
watch the trailers again just like again

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.880 
watch the trailers again just like again
better<00:00:59.489> feel<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.120> movie<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.770> just<00:01:01.770> like

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
better feel of the movie and just like

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.110 
better feel of the movie and just like
remember<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.489> little<00:01:02.640> bit<00:01:02.789> better<00:01:02.910> because

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
remember it a little bit better because

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.000 
remember it a little bit better because
I<00:01:03.300> hadn't<00:01:03.570> seen<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.439> don't<00:01:04.739> know<00:01:04.830> how

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010

long to come out two years ago three
years<00:01:06.840> ago<00:01:07.049> now<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.530> don't<00:01:07.799> know<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.549> yeah<00:01:08.939> I

wanted<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> watch<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.560> watched<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
wanted to watch it so I watched the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.520 
wanted to watch it so I watched the
trailer<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:12.119> truly<00:01:12.780> makes<00:01:13.080> me<00:01:13.170> want<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.380> see

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.640 
first time so I think I'm probably gonna
try<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.240> again<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.500> I

don't know I just have this weird
feeling<00:01:21.840> about<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> movie<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.920> didn't

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
feeling about the movie that I didn't

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.499 
feeling about the movie that I didn't
like<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.549> can't<00:01:23.850> remember<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.390> was

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
like and I can't remember what it was

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
bow I try to use perfectly straight

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.289 
bow I try to use perfectly straight
lines<00:03:19.170> for<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.280> string<00:03:20.609> because<00:03:20.970> she's<00:03:21.180> not

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
lines for the string because she's not

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.270 
lines for the string because she's not
pulling<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.720> back<00:03:21.900> yet<00:03:22.139> so<00:03:22.260> it's<00:03:22.500> just<00:03:22.859> there

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
pulling it back yet so it's just there

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.699 
pulling it back yet so it's just there
it's<00:03:23.910> really<00:03:24.540> tight<00:03:24.810> between<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.290> two<00:03:25.410> limbs

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
it's really tight between the two limbs

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.920 
it's really tight between the two limbs
so<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.790> should<00:03:26.970> be<00:03:27.090> perfectly<00:03:27.359> straight<00:03:27.540> that

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
drew in Denair like the strands was a

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.779 
drew in Denair like the strands was a
little<00:04:38.020> too<00:04:38.139> complicated<00:04:38.350> for<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:39.160> so<00:04:39.669> I've

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
little too complicated for that so I've

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.029 
little too complicated for that so I've
just<00:04:39.820> painted<00:04:40.150> in<00:04:40.479> the<00:04:40.720> hair<00:04:40.930> individually

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
just painted in the hair individually

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.740 
just painted in the hair individually
well<00:04:42.280> not<00:04:42.490> individually<00:04:42.940> but<00:04:43.060> separate<00:04:43.479> like

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
well not individually but separate like

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.930 
well not individually but separate like
with<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.380> paintbrush<00:04:44.650> was<00:04:45.009> a<00:04:45.100> paint<00:04:45.460> bucket

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
with the paintbrush was a paint bucket

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.550 
with the paintbrush was a paint bucket
yeah<00:04:46.180> that's<00:04:46.479> I'm<00:04:46.570> trying<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.840> say<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.139> then<00:04:47.530> I

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
yeah that's I'm trying to say and then I

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.409 
yeah that's I'm trying to say and then I
went<00:04:47.770> through<00:04:48.100> and<00:04:48.340> changed<00:04:48.880> all<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.210> line

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
went through and changed all the line

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.390 
went through and changed all the line
art<00:04:49.630> from<00:04:49.870> black<00:04:50.199> to<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.500> color<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.979> was<00:04:51.130> more

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
art from black to a color that was more

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.520 
art from black to a color that was more
in<00:04:51.940> contrast<00:04:52.509> with<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.900> colors<00:04:53.199> that<00:04:53.410> there

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
in contrast with the colors that there

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.830 
in contrast with the colors that there
behind<00:04:53.860> it<00:04:54.009> so<00:04:54.250> for<00:04:54.910> skin<00:04:55.240> like<00:04:55.449> I<00:04:55.539> used<00:04:55.720> to
