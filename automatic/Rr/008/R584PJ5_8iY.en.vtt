00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:10.899 

carry<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:07.580> down<00:01:09.229> there<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.350> go

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that's what it's gonna look like in

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.100 
that's what it's gonna look like in
pocket<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.460> see<00:01:14.700> absolutely<00:01:15.110> nothing

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
pocket as you can see absolutely nothing

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.240 
pocket as you can see absolutely nothing
is<00:01:16.229> showing<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.689> when<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.810> pull<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.170> out<00:01:19.290> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
is showing and when you pull it out you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.060 
is showing and when you pull it out you
just<00:01:20.520> kind<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> tilt<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.240> back<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:22.320> pull<00:01:25.070> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
just kind of tilt it back and pull the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.480 
just kind of tilt it back and pull the
goal<00:01:26.280> basically<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.590> almost

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
goal basically I think of it as almost

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.899 
goal basically I think of it as almost
like<00:01:30.450> using<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.930> wave<00:01:31.110> feature<00:01:31.829> you're<00:01:32.610> going

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
like using the wave feature you're going

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.499 
like using the wave feature you're going
to<00:01:33.090> pull<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:34.350> back<00:01:34.619> against<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.150> part

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
to pull it back against so this part

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.179 
to pull it back against so this part
actually<00:01:36.720> catches<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.619> seam<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.159> your

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
actually catches on the seam of your

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.179 
actually catches on the seam of your
pocket<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:40.250> pull<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.340> out<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.829> you're

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
pocket and pull it out so if you're

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.190 
pocket and pull it out so if you're
familiar<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.850> using<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.570> emerson<00:01:46.020> wave

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
familiar with using the emerson wave

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.350 
familiar with using the emerson wave
knives<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:48.210> has<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.350> lot<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.700> same<00:01:50.970> feel

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360

very sharp honestly so as you can see it
does<00:03:12.269> have<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.569> very<00:03:12.870> nice<00:03:13.169> design<00:03:13.500> with<00:03:14.340> the

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
does have a very nice design with the

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.710 
does have a very nice design with the
blade<00:03:14.730> as<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.720> handle<00:03:16.229> kind<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.560> moves<00:03:16.889> upwards

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
blade as a handle kind of moves upwards

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.520 
blade as a handle kind of moves upwards
so<00:03:18.720> when<00:03:18.900> cut<00:03:19.139> in<00:03:19.319> you<00:03:20.190> can<00:03:20.370> have<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:22.290> blade

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
so when cut in you can have the blade

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.080 
so when cut in you can have the blade
touch<00:03:22.829> in<00:03:23.099> and<00:03:23.419> your<00:03:24.419> knuckles<00:03:25.790> will<00:03:26.790> not<00:03:26.940> be

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
touch in and your knuckles will not be

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.119 
touch in and your knuckles will not be
hitting<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.629> surface<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.709> that's<00:03:28.889> kind<00:03:29.099> of

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
hitting the surface so that's kind of

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.219 
hitting the surface so that's kind of
nice<00:03:29.280> makes<00:03:29.699> it<00:03:29.849> easier<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.269> cut<00:03:30.569> it<00:03:33.049> so<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.109> have

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229 
nice makes it easier to cut it so I have

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:37.729 
nice makes it easier to cut it so I have
to<00:03:34.290> use<00:03:34.470> less<00:03:34.680> force<00:03:35.150> very<00:03:36.150> thin<00:03:36.569> blade<00:03:37.440> steel

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
to use less force very thin blade steel

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.460 
to use less force very thin blade steel
also<00:03:38.510> but<00:03:39.510> doesn't<00:03:40.409> Bend<00:03:41.989> might<00:03:42.989> still<00:03:43.290> be<00:03:43.440> a

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
also but doesn't Bend might still be a

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.819 
also but doesn't Bend might still be a
good<00:03:43.859> fillet<00:03:44.729> knife<00:03:44.940> maybe<00:03:45.530> might<00:03:46.530> not<00:03:46.680> be

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
good fillet knife maybe might not be

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:55.180 
good fillet knife maybe might not be
long<00:03:47.040> enough<00:03:48.590> full<00:03:49.590> tang<00:03:49.859> as<00:03:50.129> you<00:03:50.280> can<00:03:50.459> see

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.220 

the<00:03:55.490> handle<00:03:56.260> it's<00:03:58.510> not<00:03:59.510> actually<00:03:59.780> sure<00:03:59.990> what

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
the handle it's not actually sure what

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.290 
the handle it's not actually sure what
the<00:04:00.380> handle<00:04:00.770> is<00:04:00.860> I<00:04:03.400> believe<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.730> is<00:04:04.850> some<00:04:05.060> type

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
the handle is I believe it is some type

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.860 
the handle is I believe it is some type
of<00:04:06.010> plastic<00:04:07.010> but<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.340> may<00:04:07.790> be<00:04:07.850> wrong<00:04:10.330> has<00:04:11.330> almost

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
of plastic but I may be wrong has almost

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:26.310 
of plastic but I may be wrong has almost
a<00:04:12.670> wooden<00:04:13.670> look<00:04:13.970> to<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:14.690> it<00:04:15.489> may<00:04:16.489> be<00:04:16.520> wood

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.990 

yeah<00:04:27.320> it<00:04:27.500> does<00:04:27.710> not<00:04:27.920> actually<00:04:28.400> say<00:04:28.640> in<00:04:28.850> the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000
