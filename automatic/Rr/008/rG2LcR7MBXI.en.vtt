00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
do that let's have a look at the

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.580 
do that let's have a look at the
ingredients<00:00:39.490> so<00:00:40.030> you<00:00:40.060> know<00:00:40.330> what<00:00:40.540> you<00:00:40.690> need

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:55.440 

you

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.760 

you

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:10.190 

you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.560 

so<00:01:11.200> we<00:01:11.500> starting<00:01:12.040> with<00:01:12.070> preparing<00:01:12.700> our<00:01:12.850> crusts

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
so we starting with preparing our crusts

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.130 
so we starting with preparing our crusts
we<00:01:14.560> transfer<00:01:15.189> the<00:01:15.460> flour<00:01:16.210> into<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.750> food

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
we transfer the flour into the food

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.460 
we transfer the flour into the food
processor<00:01:17.200> let<00:01:18.040> me<00:01:18.189> add<00:01:18.310> salt<00:01:18.729> and<00:01:19.240> sugar<00:01:20.229> and

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
processor let me add salt and sugar and

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.670 
processor let me add salt and sugar and
baking<00:01:20.890> powder<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.909> then<00:01:22.030> we're<00:01:22.240> going<00:01:22.509> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
baking powder and then we're going to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.170 
baking powder and then we're going to
pulse<00:01:23.680> it<00:01:23.950> a<00:01:24.070> little<00:01:24.310> bit<00:01:24.430> until<00:01:24.700> all<00:01:24.820> is<00:01:24.970> well

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
pulse it a little bit until all is well

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.240 
pulse it a little bit until all is well
combined<00:01:25.539> then<00:01:25.750> we'll<00:01:26.080> add<00:01:26.259> our<00:01:26.289> cold<00:01:26.890> butter

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
combined then we'll add our cold butter

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.600 
combined then we'll add our cold butter
cut<00:01:27.580> into<00:01:27.759> small<00:01:28.090> cubes<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.920> like<00:01:30.130> this<00:01:30.340> and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
cut into small cubes just like this and

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.429 
cut into small cubes just like this and
then<00:01:30.729> we're<00:01:30.909> going<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.330> be<00:01:31.420> pulsing<00:01:31.899> it<00:01:32.080> again

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
then we're going to be pulsing it again

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.999 
then we're going to be pulsing it again
just<00:01:33.039> until<00:01:33.610> we<00:01:34.140> almost<00:01:35.140> cannot<00:01:35.619> see<00:01:35.890> our

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
just until we almost cannot see our

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.609 
just until we almost cannot see our
butter<00:01:36.310> like<00:01:36.640> this<00:01:36.850> then<00:01:37.509> we<00:01:37.659> add<00:01:37.840> our<00:01:38.110> eggs

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
butter like this then we add our eggs

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:46.380 
butter like this then we add our eggs
and<00:01:40.440> our<00:01:43.050> heavy<00:01:44.050> cream<00:01:44.409> here<00:01:45.220> we<00:01:45.490> go<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.060> now

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
and our heavy cream here we go and now

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.059 
and our heavy cream here we go and now
we're<00:01:46.569> going<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.869> be<00:01:47.080> processing<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.740> until

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
we're going to be processing it until

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:54.830 
we're going to be processing it until
our<00:01:48.250> dough<00:01:48.670> forms<00:01:49.450> nice<00:01:50.409> ball<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:52.390> like<00:01:52.869> that

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
our dough forms nice ball just like that

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.410 
our dough forms nice ball just like that
there<00:01:55.840> we<00:01:55.869> go<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:56.830> then<00:01:56.979> we<00:01:57.130> go<00:01:57.369> for<00:01:58.330> another

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
there we go and then we go for another

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.240 
there we go and then we go for another
ten<00:01:58.810> seconds<00:01:59.200> or<00:01:59.319> so<00:01:59.560> until<00:01:59.970> it's<00:02:00.970> ready<00:02:01.270> we

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
ten seconds or so until it's ready we

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.219 
ten seconds or so until it's ready we
flatten<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.369> it<00:02:03.490> nice<00:02:03.819> and<00:02:04.179> wrap<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:04.959> in<00:02:05.080> a

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
flatten it it nice and wrap it in a

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.800 
flatten it it nice and wrap it in a
plastic<00:02:05.740> wrap<00:02:05.799> I'm<00:02:06.429> making<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:07.360> flat<00:02:07.600> so

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
plastic wrap I'm making it so flat so

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.449 
plastic wrap I'm making it so flat so
it's<00:02:07.959> easier<00:02:08.229> for<00:02:08.259> me<00:02:08.440> later<00:02:08.739> on<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:09.160> roll<00:02:09.340> it

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
it's easier for me later on to roll it

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.940 
it's easier for me later on to roll it
out<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:09.880> this<00:02:10.539> goes<00:02:10.780> into<00:02:11.079> the<00:02:11.200> fridge<00:02:11.380> for

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
out and this goes into the fridge for

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.150 
out and this goes into the fridge for
one<00:02:12.670> hour<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.329> after<00:02:13.690> an<00:02:13.989> hour<00:02:14.140> I'm<00:02:14.739> removing

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.610 
one hour and after an hour I'm removing
from<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.609> fridge<00:02:15.790> half<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.299> my<00:02:16.570> dough<00:02:17.260> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.170 
spray or if you have a baking spray it's
good<00:02:38.079> as<00:02:38.230> well<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.739> then<00:02:39.340> we're<00:02:39.579> lining<00:02:39.820> it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
good as well and then we're lining it

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.960

with<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.859> parchment<00:02:41.859> paper<00:02:42.070> this<00:02:42.400> will<00:02:42.609> make<00:02:42.790> it

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
with a parchment paper this will make it

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.330 
with a parchment paper this will make it
much<00:02:43.269> easier<00:02:43.660> later<00:02:44.019> on<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.890> take<00:02:45.130> our

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340

thin<00:04:58.160> I'm<00:04:59.160> going<00:04:59.490> around<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.940> one<00:05:00.330> millimeter

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
thin I'm going around the one millimeter

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.719 
thin I'm going around the one millimeter
one<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:01.680> half<00:05:01.830> just<00:05:02.070> like<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.370> can<00:05:02.520> see

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
one and a half just like you can see

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.090 
one and a half just like you can see
here<00:05:03.000> after<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.780> slowed<00:05:04.020> rolled<00:05:04.440> out<00:05:04.860> I'm

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
here after it slowed rolled out I'm

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.330 
here after it slowed rolled out I'm
using<00:05:05.280> my<00:05:05.580> cookie<00:05:06.210> cutter<00:05:06.740> just<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.890> cut

to<00:05:11.310> one<00:05:11.610> centimeter<00:05:12.000> thick<00:05:12.450> just<00:05:12.810> how<00:05:12.960> you

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
to one centimeter thick just how you

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.500 
to one centimeter thick just how you
like<00:05:13.350> it<00:05:13.380> and<00:05:13.710> then<00:05:14.310> I'm<00:05:14.460> arranging<00:05:14.789> it<00:05:15.090> on<00:05:15.240> top

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
like it and then I'm arranging it on top

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.570 
like it and then I'm arranging it on top
of<00:05:15.539> my<00:05:15.690> cheese<00:05:16.169> layer<00:05:16.440> in<00:05:17.100> a<00:05:17.310> crisscross

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
pattern just like this and this goes

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.150 
pattern just like this and this goes
