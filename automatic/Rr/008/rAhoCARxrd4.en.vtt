00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.789 

right<00:00:00.780> next<00:00:01.079> up<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.439> sports<00:00:02.070> pad<00:00:02.610> soccer<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.659> I

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:03.799 
right next up is sports pad soccer and I

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.800 
right next up is sports pad soccer and I
strongly<00:00:04.799> suspect<00:00:05.130> that<00:00:05.730> that<00:00:05.910> will<00:00:06.299> be

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
strongly suspect that that will be

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.580 
strongly suspect that that will be
needing<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.529> use<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:09.260> pad<00:00:10.260> controller

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
needing the use of the pad controller

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.509 
needing the use of the pad controller
again<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:12.200> yes<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.349> does<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.769> can't<00:00:14.040> even<00:00:14.190> push

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
again and yes it does I can't even push

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.210 
again and yes it does I can't even push
up<00:00:14.759> on<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.240> normal<00:00:15.570> controller<00:00:16.109> without<00:00:16.350> it

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
up on a normal controller without it

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.900 
up on a normal controller without it
flying<00:00:17.609> off<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.240> yeah<00:00:18.390> it's<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.750> paddle<00:00:19.050> game

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910

flying off so yeah it's a paddle game
it's<00:00:20.910> an<00:00:21.060> interesting<00:00:21.359> use<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.990> paddle

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
it's an interesting use of the paddle

it's an interesting use of the paddle

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
least up whoa but this makes no sense if

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.310 
least up whoa but this makes no sense if
it's<00:01:08.180> supposed<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.540> be<00:01:08.660> a<00:01:08.690> paddle<00:01:09.110> game<00:01:09.290> than<00:01:09.560> a

it's supposed to be a paddle game than a

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.140 
it's supposed to be a paddle game than a
wait<00:01:12.320> wait<00:01:12.619> right<00:01:12.950> is<00:01:13.250> might<00:01:13.430> actually<00:01:13.729> be

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
wait wait right is might actually be

yes<00:01:23.150> I'm<00:01:23.540> your<00:01:23.810> son<00:01:23.990> idiot<00:01:24.290> basically<00:01:24.770> the

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
yes I'm your son idiot basically the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.880 
yes I'm your son idiot basically the
question<00:01:25.400> is<00:01:25.550> can<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:26.420> even<00:01:26.780> emulate<00:01:27.500> the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
question is can is even emulate the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.540 
question is can is even emulate the
sports<00:01:28.190> bad<00:01:28.460> I<00:01:29.050> don't<00:01:30.050> think<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:30.830> didn't<00:01:31.369> see

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
sports bad I don't think so I didn't see

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.430 
sports bad I don't think so I didn't see
it<00:01:31.580> as<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.880> option<00:01:33.729> no<00:01:34.729> I<00:01:35.080> honestly<00:01:36.080> think<00:01:36.290> that

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
it as a option no I honestly think that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.770 
it as a option no I honestly think that
it<00:01:36.649> can't<00:01:36.920> actually<00:01:37.220> emulate<00:01:38.119> a<00:01:38.149> sports<00:01:38.509> pad

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
it can't actually emulate a sports pad

00:01:38.780 --> 00:02:00.520 
it can't actually emulate a sports pad
so<00:01:40.509> whoa<00:01:41.509> oh<00:01:51.970> oh<00:01:55.959> oh<00:01:58.990> someone<00:01:59.990> get<00:02:00.140> into<00:02:00.380> goes
