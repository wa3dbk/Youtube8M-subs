because I don't even know if he wears
them<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:29.290> maybe<00:03:29.500> he<00:03:30.129> comes<00:03:30.400> with<00:03:30.579> them<00:03:30.730> so<00:03:30.910> you

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
them so maybe he comes with them so you

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.909 
them so maybe he comes with them so you
can<00:03:31.150> rip<00:03:31.359> them<00:03:31.510> off<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.139> be<00:03:32.319> like<00:03:32.590> the

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
think of this figure I think it's kind

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.210 
think of this figure I think it's kind
of<00:04:06.190> like<00:04:06.340> that<00:04:07.239> Brahma<00:04:07.930> bull<00:04:08.319> rock<00:04:08.650> not<00:04:09.010> the

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
but I think this is just another kind of

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.380 
but I think this is just another kind of
like<00:04:19.650> using<00:04:20.650> old<00:04:21.159> parts<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.940> make<00:04:22.120> something

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
like using old parts to make something

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.990 
like using old parts to make something

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
new if you get what I'm saying but if

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.760
