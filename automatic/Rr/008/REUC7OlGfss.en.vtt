00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.990 
starting to theorize this is because
there's<00:04:20.690> so<00:04:20.870> much<00:04:21.050> of<00:04:21.260> this<00:04:21.880> algae<00:04:22.880> and

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
there's so much of this algae and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.120 
there's so much of this algae and
vegetation<00:04:23.480> you<00:04:23.930> know<00:04:24.200> playing<00:04:24.500> growth<00:04:24.800> that

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
vegetation you know playing growth that

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.910 
vegetation you know playing growth that
happens<00:04:25.520> in<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.730> summer<00:04:25.940> sometimes<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.920> when

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
happens in the summer sometimes and when

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.500 
happens in the summer sometimes and when
we<00:04:28.040> pull<00:04:28.250> our<00:04:28.370> worms<00:04:28.580> up<00:04:28.850> there<00:04:29.000> is<00:04:29.090> covered<00:04:29.420> in

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
we pull our worms up there is covered in

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.060 
we pull our worms up there is covered in
slime<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:30.260> we're<00:04:30.470> getting<00:04:30.560> these<00:04:30.770> little

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
slime and we're getting these little

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.580 
slime and we're getting these little
itty<00:04:31.190> bitty<00:04:31.280> nibbles<00:04:31.850> which<00:04:32.320> we<00:04:33.320> didn't<00:04:33.560> know

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
itty bitty nibbles which we didn't know

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.230 
itty bitty nibbles which we didn't know
bull<00:04:33.860> heads<00:04:34.040> were<00:04:34.190> capable<00:04:34.400> of<00:04:34.790> being<00:04:34.970> so

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
bull heads were capable of being so

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.190 
bull heads were capable of being so
picky<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:36.290> but<00:04:37.240> yeah<00:04:38.240> I'm<00:04:38.540> kind<00:04:38.810> of<00:04:38.840> wonder<00:04:39.080> if

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
picky it but yeah I'm kind of wonder if

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.750 
picky it but yeah I'm kind of wonder if
it's<00:04:39.350> because<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.710> slime<00:04:40.070> is<00:04:40.100> making<00:04:40.580> our

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
it's because the slime is making our

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.460 
it's because the slime is making our
worms<00:04:41.450> and<00:04:41.720> appetizing

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470
