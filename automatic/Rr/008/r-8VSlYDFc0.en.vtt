they<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:23.910> definitely<00:00:24.480> pick<00:00:24.689> up<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.990> play

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
they just definitely pick up and play

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.470 
they just definitely pick up and play
but<00:00:26.010> one<00:00:26.220> complaint<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.910> lot<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.180> people

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
but one complaint that a lot of people

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.439 
but one complaint that a lot of people
may<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.500> too<00:00:29.130> much<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:30.090> jump

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
may have is this is too much of a jump

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.990 
may have is this is too much of a jump
in<00:00:30.630> kind<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.019> experienced<00:00:31.830> there's<00:00:32.730> really

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
in kind of experienced there's really

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.330 
in kind of experienced there's really
not<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.390> much<00:00:33.870> strategy<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.130> game

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
not that much strategy to the game

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.299 
not that much strategy to the game
unlike<00:00:36.140> Battlefield<00:00:37.140> Bad<00:00:37.230> Company<00:00:37.380> 2<00:00:37.829> that's

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
unlike Battlefield Bad Company 2 that's

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.240 
unlike Battlefield Bad Company 2 that's
a<00:00:38.489> game<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.879> seems<00:00:39.210> what<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.320> need<00:00:40.559> strategy

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
a game that seems what you need strategy

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.979 
a game that seems what you need strategy
there's<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> team<00:00:41.879> that's<00:00:42.329> around<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.840> all<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
there's a team that's around you all the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.869 
there's a team that's around you all the
time<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.440> need<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.920> mean<00:00:44.250> even<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> team

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
time you need I mean even the team

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.119 
time you need I mean even the team
deathmatch<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:46.020> modern<00:00:46.410> warfare<00:00:46.559> 2<00:00:46.739> there's

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
deathmatch in modern warfare 2 there's

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.910 
deathmatch in modern warfare 2 there's
really<00:00:47.309> not<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.550> much<00:00:47.850> strategy<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:49.379> that

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
really not that much strategy but that

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.680 
really not that much strategy but that
could<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.219> plus<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.820> since<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.270> more

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
could be a plus and since that more

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.779 
could be a plus and since that more
people<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.170> get<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.680> jump<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.340> after<00:00:53.489> all

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
people can get in and jump in after all

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.189 
people can get in and jump in after all
this<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> most<00:00:54.629> played

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
this is one of the most played

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.290 
this is one of the most played
first-person<00:00:55.949> shooters<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.460> believe<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.120> all

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
first-person shooters I believe of all

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.279 
first-person shooters I believe of all
time<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.579> they've<00:00:59.579> had<00:00:59.820> tons<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.539> graphical

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
time and they've had tons of graphical

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.229 
time and they've had tons of graphical
little<00:01:01.530> touches<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.160> mean<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.670> story<00:01:03.000> mode

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
little touches I mean the story mode

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.200 
little touches I mean the story mode
overall<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> big<00:01:05.430> cinematic

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
overall is like a big cinematic

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.060 
overall is like a big cinematic
experience<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.140> fact<00:01:07.320> they<00:01:07.470> even<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.830> one

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
experience in fact they even have one

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.130 
experience in fact they even have one
mission<00:01:08.490> where<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.330> take<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> role<00:01:09.960> that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
mission where you take on the role that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.740 
mission where you take on the role that
terrorist<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.369> believe<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:12.000> think<00:01:12.420> I'm<00:01:12.540> getting

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
terrorist I believe I think I'm getting

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.000 
terrorist I believe I think I'm getting

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
it flamed for

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.910 
it flamed for
to<00:01:14.130> terrorists<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.660> you<00:01:16.350> basically<00:01:16.500> do

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
to terrorists but you basically do

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.700 
to terrorists but you basically do
things<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:18.630> terrorists<00:01:19.080> would<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.500> go

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
