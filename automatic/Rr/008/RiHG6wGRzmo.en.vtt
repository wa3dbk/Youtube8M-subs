pretty stupid not graphics wise I mean
literally<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:32.070> mob<00:00:32.340> looks<00:00:32.640> as<00:00:32.850> if<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.210> would

about this mob apart from ranting about
its<00:00:37.050> stupidness<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.340> let's<00:00:38.520> move<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
its stupidness so let's move on to the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.330 
its stupidness so let's move on to the
next<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> final<00:00:40.140> image<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
next and the final image this is a

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.639 
next and the final image this is a
procedurally<00:00:42.030> generated<00:00:42.059> dungeon<00:00:42.960> now<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
procedurally generated dungeon now the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.380 
procedurally generated dungeon now the
resolution<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.460> image<00:00:44.760> isn't<00:00:44.969> quite

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
resolution of this image isn't quite

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.479 
resolution of this image isn't quite
high<00:00:45.809> enough<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.800> means<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:47.370> i<00:00:47.430> zoom

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
high enough this means that when i zoom

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.220 
high enough this means that when i zoom
in<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.149> will<00:00:48.300> blur<00:00:48.539> slightly<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.170> can't

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
in it will blur slightly and you can't

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.439 
in it will blur slightly and you can't
make<00:00:50.070> out<00:00:50.309> exactly<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:51.000> we're<00:00:51.090> looking<00:00:51.360> at

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
make out exactly what we're looking at

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.810 
make out exactly what we're looking at
I'll<00:00:51.840> try<00:00:51.989> my<00:00:52.170> best<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.190> said<00:00:53.250> before<00:00:53.520> this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
I'll try my best like I said before this

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.119 
I'll try my best like I said before this
dungeon<00:00:54.239> has<00:00:54.360> been<00:00:54.539> procedurally<00:00:55.050> generated

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
dungeon has been procedurally generated

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.529 
dungeon has been procedurally generated
this<00:00:56.129> means<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.670> been<00:00:56.789> generated<00:00:57.420> by

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
this means that it's been generated by

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.000 
this means that it's been generated by
the<00:00:57.600> game's<00:00:57.840> engine<00:00:58.140> rather<00:00:58.770> than<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the game's engine rather than a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.260 
the game's engine rather than a
developer<00:00:59.489> making<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.879> dungeon

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
developer making this dungeon

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.060 
developer making this dungeon
specifically<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.440> might<00:01:01.559> think<00:01:01.800> that's

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
specifically or you might think that's

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.009 
specifically or you might think that's
crazy<00:01:02.340> how<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:02.969> gain<00:01:03.120> possibly<00:01:03.629> do<00:01:03.780> that

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
crazy how can they gain possibly do that

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.570 
crazy how can they gain possibly do that
the<00:01:04.350> way<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.619> works<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.309> developer

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the way it works is that a developer

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640 
the way it works is that a developer
makes<00:01:06.180> these<00:01:06.390> specific<00:01:06.810> ones<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.409> all<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
makes these specific ones and all the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.770 
makes these specific ones and all the
engine<00:01:07.950> does<00:01:08.100> itself<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.360> add<00:01:09.510> them<00:01:09.689> all

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
engine does itself is just add them all

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.660 
engine does itself is just add them all
together<00:01:09.930> very<00:01:10.740> much<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.400> mob

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
together very much like the mob

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.940 
together very much like the mob
generation<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.659> gun<00:01:12.840> generation<00:01:13.409> this

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
generation and the gun generation this

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.920 
generation and the gun generation this
is<00:01:14.130> an<00:01:14.250> image<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.490> I've<00:01:14.729> created<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.630> shows

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
is an image that I've created it shows

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.410 
is an image that I've created it shows
the<00:01:16.110> way<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.430> different

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the way that I think that the different

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.969 
the way that I think that the different
rooms<00:01:18.630> might<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:19.049> been<00:01:19.170> created<00:01:19.560> separately

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
rooms might have been created separately

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.920 
rooms might have been created separately
and<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.909> mix<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.420> matched<00:01:21.630> by<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and then just mix and matched by the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.600 
and then just mix and matched by the
game's<00:01:22.229> engine<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.740> course<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.340> could<00:01:23.400> be

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
game's engine of course I could be

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.340 
game's engine of course I could be
completely<00:01:23.790> wrong<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> way

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
completely wrong but this is the way

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.499 
completely wrong but this is the way
that<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.530> think<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.130> been<00:01:26.280> generated<00:01:26.790> now<00:01:27.479> I

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
that I think is been generated now I

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.749 
that I think is been generated now I
could<00:01:27.810> zoom<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.530> explain<00:01:29.009> every<00:01:29.340> item<00:01:29.549> in

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
could zoom in and explain every item in

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.270 
could zoom in and explain every item in
detail<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.869> because<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> resolution<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.100> too

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
detail but because the resolution is too

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.740 
detail but because the resolution is too
low<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:32.939> kind<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.240> hard<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.509> me<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
low that it's kind of hard for me to

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.780 
low that it's kind of hard for me to
make<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.380> I'd<00:01:34.860> practically<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.579> be

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
make out and I'd practically just be

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.910 
make out and I'd practically just be
guessing<00:01:36.450> everything<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.530> instead<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.829> me

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
guessing everything so instead of me

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.800 
guessing everything so instead of me
making<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.549> fool<00:01:38.700> out<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.880> myself<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:39.540> just

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
making a fool out of myself I'm just

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.450 
making a fool out of myself I'm just
