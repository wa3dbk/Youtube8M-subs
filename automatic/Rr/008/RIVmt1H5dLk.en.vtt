00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 and 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.930
 Hello everyone, Taras Mishchenko 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.910
 Today I will tell you about one of the most 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.070
 beautiful computers available on 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.680
 Ukrainian market is 20 one and a half 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.790
 inch apple imac 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.980
 new moment is a lot like 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.689
 predecessor he made monoblock 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.610
 aluminum and glass housing 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.800
 but this time apple used 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.720
 interesting design reception of the case and 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.520
 magician which is located display 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.800
 tapers to edges to five millimeters 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.540
 so at first glance it seems that I 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.060
 the floor was allowed to accommodate components 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.130
 incredibly small space on the 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.700
 fact closer to the center of the body becomes 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.650
 thicker 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.180
 so the designer of the company succeeded 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.250
 create only optical illusion 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.290
 illusion cheese thin aimak is not yet 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.060
 there is but even in this design 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.980
 the computer looks very nice and 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.329
 small thickness effect in general 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.600
 breathtaking in the first minutes 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.600
 dating 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.980
 hull and twink cut from a single piece 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.100
 aluminum that cover the entire rear 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.850
 bottom of the front panel of the same 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.590
 material made stand display 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.870
 occupies almost the entire front 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.240
 part of the body and covered with protective glass 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.610
 body ventilation hole only two 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.100
 one located on the back immediately 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.840
 stand support and the second in general 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.180
 rendered at the bottom end of the body 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.170
 Stereo speakers are also located there. 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.900
 audio systems 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.970
 Fortunately or unfortunately, but with a new design 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.010
 there was no place for an optical drive 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.690
 since I stopped using it yet 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.400
 two years ago I'll write it in 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.010
 the advantage of the stand is fixed 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.909
 in the middle of the back cover adjusting only 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.549
 tilt display 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.200
 but you can not raise the screen height 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.000
 if only to substitute something under 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.860
 the magician display angle 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.869
 regulated in a small range 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.180
 the adjustment itself takes place gently and not 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.770
 requires great effort 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.900
 21 and a half inch ips display 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.750
 new aimak has excellent 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.369
 color and viewing angles 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.350
 screen resolution full hd and at such 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.330
 diagonal from the working distance of pixels 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.340
 the display itself is not visible on 5 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.070
 millimeters thinner than my mac passed and 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.720
 created by technology full 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.580
 lamination its application allowed 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.260
 reduce the amount of glare on the display 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.599
 Apple engineer managed to reduce 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.139
 reflection of light from the front surface 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.319
 glass 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:19.420
 used the method of plasma spraying 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.280
 thus protective glass and magician 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.989
 covered with a very thin layer of special 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.969
 spraying which allowed to reduce 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.370
 the reflectivity of the glass did not affect 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.620
 color rendition imac display backlight 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.629
 has 16 adjustment steps and in manual 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.590
 mode but can also be adjusted 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.659
 automatically 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.519
 due to the light sensor which 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:40.750
 next to webcam tails g 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.549
 This imac model is equipped 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.250
 intel core quad core processor 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.260
 i5 with a frequency of 2 7 gigahertz 8 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.209
 gigabytes of ram and hard 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.129
 1 terabyte disk and video card 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.730
 geforce gt 640m 512 megabytes of memory 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.980
 performance of this configuration 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.980
 It will be sufficient for most tasks and 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.139
 with the scientific video card geforce gt 640m 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.030
 you can even run modern games on 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.659
 certainly not at the maximum 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.069
 settings 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.049
 slightly spoils the picture 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.909
 disk system performance in 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.980
 this version of mac is set hard though 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:15.189
 1 terabyte drive but rotation speed 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.169
 spindle reaching only 5400 revolutions per 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.849
 minute as a result the write speed on 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.579
 hard drive according to black magic tests 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.609
 is 92 and 6 megabytes per second 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.139
 read 93 3 megabytes per second this 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.729
 rather modest result especially 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.650
 Considering that this is a desktop 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.479
 computer as the case of his magician 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.459
 one-piece self expand 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.229
 configuration will be problematic if 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.430
 generally possible at home 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:38.109
 your magician user can 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.500
 use a fairly wide range 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.310
 connectors that are not exactly apple style 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.139
 they are all located in the back 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.930
 hull which makes it very difficult for them 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.519
 access and so much my poppy is 3 5 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.120
 millimeter headphone jack 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.970
 sd card slot with 4 usb 30 ports at once 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.829
 two sonar bolt and one gigabit connectors 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.329
 ethernet last can be used 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.909
 to connect to the internet but also 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.769
 grooves have a wifi module which is not 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.379
 grabs this abundance so this is the connector 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.269
 hdmi which fell like not like but 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.310
 at macbook pro with retina screen set 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.659
 It means that a battle magician could still 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.040
 the ability to connect it to the TV 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.689
 without adapters 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.370
 it would be useful and let them be very 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.630
 popular with saimak 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.219
 wireless keyboard supplied 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.989
 magic mouse 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:22.330
 which is connected to the computer by 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.070
 to the bluetooth 40 protocol complete 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.779
 the keyboard is a complete 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.669
 copy of laptop keyboards apple 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:28.720
 It has a compact design without 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.370
 digital block 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.320
 made in aluminum with 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.420
 glossy plastic base and matte 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.670
 white plastic keys 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.890
 apple users get used to 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.600
 The keyboard does not have to the rest 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.260
 will need to take some time to 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.050
 addictive 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.850
 magic mouse debuted back in 2009 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.740
 year and is still offered in 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.140
 By the side, even he is the moment of his 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.030
 Out was not the best mouse with 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.380
 great design magic mouse can't 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.100
 suggest the user is not good 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.410
 ergonomics 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.240
 not responsiveness to work made on and 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.890
 worth to leave this mouse this 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.350
 gesture support in the operating system 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.270
 The os x installation has a variety of models. 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.860
 which will be more convenient in work 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.410
 notches pre-installed operating room 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.330
 os x 10 83 system 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.640
 it scales well for resolution 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.460
 display fonts do not look blurry 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.410
 working with her could quickly except this 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.480
 they are famous for their stable work 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.390
 but if this option does not suit on 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.770
 Mig can also put windows 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.260
 apple imac is a great example 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.750
 symbiosis of design and technology which 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.400
 so lack of modern industry for 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.320
 he can be forgiven for this arrangement 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.320
 connectors and other minor issues
