yarn in place while we're stitching and
that's<00:01:42.450> also<00:01:42.630> important<00:01:43.670> my<00:01:44.670> daughter

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
that's also important my daughter

that's also important my daughter
Jessica<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.540> another<00:01:45.840> example<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
Jessica is another example of a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.039 
Jessica is another example of a
different<00:01:47.189> way<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.430> do<00:01:47.670> tension<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.810> she

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
different way to do tension in that she

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.230 
different way to do tension in that she
lets<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.740> yarn<00:01:50.009> drape<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.880> front<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.149> her

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
lets the yarn drape in front of her

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.120 
lets the yarn drape in front of her
three<00:01:51.450> fingers<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.020> she<00:01:52.140> uses<00:01:52.409> her<00:01:52.560> pointer

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
three fingers but she uses her pointer

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.580 
three fingers but she uses her pointer
finger<00:01:53.700> specifically<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.750> tension<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.350> she's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
finger specifically for tension so she's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.709 
finger specifically for tension so she's
doing<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.100> from<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.520> top<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:57.119> her<00:01:57.270> hand<00:01:57.509> rather

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
doing it from the top of her hand rather

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.980 
doing it from the top of her hand rather
than<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> bottom<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.740> that's<00:01:58.890> okay<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.880> you

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
than the bottom and that's okay and you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.359 
than the bottom and that's okay and you
can<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.110> how<00:02:01.200> quickly<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.890> consistently

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
can see how quickly and consistently

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.209 
can see how quickly and consistently
she's<00:02:02.670> stitching<00:02:03.409> that's<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.649> thanks<00:02:05.070> for

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
she's stitching that's it thanks for
