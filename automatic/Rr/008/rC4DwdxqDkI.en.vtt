from<00:01:26.580> art<00:01:26.850> history<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.479> gardening<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.259> picked

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
from art history to gardening I picked

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.039 
from art history to gardening I picked
one<00:01:28.950> called<00:01:29.400> accelerated<00:01:30.210> learning<00:01:30.720> because

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
one called accelerated learning because

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.649 
one called accelerated learning because
it<00:01:31.229> seemed<00:01:31.619> appropriate<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.850> first<00:01:33.090> step<00:01:33.360> is

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
it seemed appropriate the first step is

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.649 
it seemed appropriate the first step is
to<00:01:34.140> establish<00:01:34.320> your<00:01:34.740> purpose<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:36.390> would<00:01:36.540> you

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
to establish your purpose what would you

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.450 
to establish your purpose what would you
hope<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.229> out<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.619> book<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.040> I

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
hope to get out of a book like this I

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.160 
hope to get out of a book like this I
couldn't<00:01:39.000> come<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:39.840> clear

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
couldn't come up with a really clear

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.140 
couldn't come up with a really clear
purpose<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.430> would<00:01:41.610> prove<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
purpose and that would prove to be a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.510 
purpose and that would prove to be a
problem<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.259> moved<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> next<00:01:44.310> step

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
problem but I moved on to the next step

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.539 
problem but I moved on to the next step
which<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.259> close<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.290> eyes<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
which is to close your eyes so if you

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.310 
which is to close your eyes so if you
would<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.820> take<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> moment<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:48.780> with

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
would just take a moment right now with

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.069 
would just take a moment right now with
a<00:01:49.350> clear<00:01:49.710> purpose<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.399> mind<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.659> feel
