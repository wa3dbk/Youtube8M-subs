 Today I show you as yours 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.260
 make your own offer in the weather 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.269
 can and should start first 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.750
 we here only times something like a he 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.490
 villiger and can break down like that and 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.679
 put the wito out of nature 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.900
 later the villager or the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.480
 manager so then we go ours here 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.570
 offer so I just do it now 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.309
 a sword bow arrow for iron like that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.080
 you are packing some of this here 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.449
 grabbed and call the bow down here 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.400
 back and forth and take that namely 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.650
 what you then from villagers 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.260
 get the umhin paktiert then stop 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.760
 What you give her that you have to 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.070

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.750

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.589
 sword four iron for three food 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.839
 for two iron and then stop 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.119
 this is my only problem 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.140
 what you still need for that is 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.470

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.660
 just stop it but find it different 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.590

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.300
 look what you have that you have to 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.250
 because hold and as just said 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.820

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.340
 Let's take the world and then load 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.690

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.550

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.290

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.710
 that is now the crate is also the 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.210
 then make contents for items 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.770

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.260
 So get on it again 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.860

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.200
 do a lot 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.690
 but we need the filter here then 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.190
 Let's go to great shops and 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.740
 you can choose the pictures in here 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.250

 we do here on and ended despite that 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.010
 You can finally do it with the trade 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.990
 that you can be the last star 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.700
 and that the world not have a new 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.069
 make an offer if you can 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.410
 now offer expires that we do 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.540
 brands filter but can give me the whole 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.459
 either with control and save it 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.660
 or we go on a cebit and safe 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.360
 and then we can leave that and 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.830
 pull us right back in minecraft like that 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.870

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.519
 our citizens now have our wool 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.160
 Bubbles are just the s invincible and 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.959
 that with me stop buying those and 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.030
 we actually had it but there is 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.950
 what else is that here namely that 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.019
 no new offer comes to that 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.610

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.470

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.640
 offer under that is you can do that 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.650

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:09.840
 difficult and very many parts you have 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.860

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.799

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.260
 We can totally die on that 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.000
 bashing 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.889

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.639

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.209
 of course if it burns then I can 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.989

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.680

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.079

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.310
