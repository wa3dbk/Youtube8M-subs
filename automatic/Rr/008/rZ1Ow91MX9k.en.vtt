stirring<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.870> stirring<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.620> stirring<00:03:53.709> and

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
stirring and stirring and stirring and

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.050 
stirring and stirring and stirring and
it<00:03:55.690> may<00:03:55.959> seem<00:03:56.019> like<00:03:56.500> it's<00:03:56.709> never<00:03:57.010> going<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.459> mix

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
it may seem like it's never going to mix

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.530 
it may seem like it's never going to mix
up<00:03:58.359> but<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:58.750> will<00:03:58.930> eventually<00:04:00.090> until<00:04:01.090> at<00:04:01.359> last

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
up but it will eventually until at last

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.250 
up but it will eventually until at last
it<00:04:02.049> becomes<00:04:02.440> kind<00:04:02.769> of<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:03.180> yogurt<00:04:04.260> consistency

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
it becomes kind of a yogurt consistency

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.089 
it becomes kind of a yogurt consistency
I<00:04:05.290> would<00:04:05.530> say<00:04:05.769> you<00:04:06.519> don't<00:04:06.700> want<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.150> too<00:04:07.450> thick

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
I would say you don't want it too thick

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.559 
I would say you don't want it too thick
but<00:04:09.099> you<00:04:09.220> also<00:04:09.400> don't<00:04:09.760> want<00:04:09.880> it<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.209> be<00:04:10.329> too

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
but you also don't want it to be too

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.089 
but you also don't want it to be too
thin<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:10.959> watery<00:04:11.169> so<00:04:11.590> this<00:04:11.739> is<00:04:11.859> a<00:04:11.889> good

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
thin and watery so this is a good

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.059 
thin and watery so this is a good
consistency<00:04:12.730> here<00:04:13.650> alright<00:04:14.650> so<00:04:14.889> now<00:04:15.040> it's

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
consistency here alright so now it's

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.909 
consistency here alright so now it's
time<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.519> sit<00:04:16.120> in<00:04:16.299> your<00:04:16.479> shower<00:04:16.780> or<00:04:17.109> tub<00:04:17.500> and

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
sit in a place where it's okay if it

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.089 
sit in a place where it's okay if it
gets<00:04:22.330> a<00:04:22.419> little<00:04:22.539> bit<00:04:22.780> messy<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:23.800> wouldn't

whole lot of rubbing all throughout you

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:48.520 
whole lot of rubbing all throughout you

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
don't want to try to rub it in too much

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.730 
don't want to try to rub it in too much
just<00:04:48.919> kind<00:04:49.220> of<00:04:49.419> glide<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:50.960> product<00:04:51.470> all<00:04:51.680> over

just kind of glide the product all over

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.839 
just kind of glide the product all over
your<00:04:52.190> legs<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:52.669> get<00:04:52.789> a<00:04:52.849> good<00:04:53.150> coverage<00:04:53.629> and

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
your legs and get a good coverage and

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.490 
your legs and get a good coverage and
the<00:04:55.849> amount<00:04:56.210> that<00:04:56.300> you've<00:04:56.569> seen<00:04:56.870> that<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.169> had

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
the amount that you've seen that I had

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.709 
the amount that you've seen that I had
mixed<00:04:57.979> up<00:04:58.129> it's<00:04:58.460> not<00:04:58.639> gonna<00:04:58.909> probably<00:04:59.539> be

00:04:59.709 --> 00:04:59.719 
mixed up it's not gonna probably be

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:02.170 
mixed up it's not gonna probably be
enough<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.650> cover<00:05:00.949> both<00:05:01.580> of<00:05:01.789> my<00:05:01.940> legs

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
enough to cover both of my legs

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.899 
enough to cover both of my legs
thoroughly<00:05:02.840> so<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:03.860> could<00:05:04.129> always<00:05:04.340> go<00:05:04.639> back<00:05:04.879> and

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
thoroughly so I could always go back and

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.029 
thoroughly so I could always go back and
mix<00:05:05.509> up<00:05:05.690> a<00:05:05.780> little<00:05:05.990> bit<00:05:06.110> more<00:05:06.349> but<00:05:06.710> that<00:05:06.860> can

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
mix up a little bit more but that can

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.279 
mix up a little bit more but that can
kind<00:05:07.190> of<00:05:07.310> be<00:05:07.370> hassle<00:05:07.969> so<00:05:08.210> I<00:05:08.240> prefer<00:05:08.629> to<00:05:09.080> have<00:05:09.229> it

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
kind of be hassle so I prefer to have it

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.680 
kind of be hassle so I prefer to have it
all<00:05:09.620> mixed<00:05:09.919> up<00:05:10.250> prior<00:05:10.699> to<00:05:10.729> applying<00:05:11.240> it<00:05:11.479> to<00:05:11.599> my

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
all mixed up prior to applying it to my

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.279 
all mixed up prior to applying it to my
legs<00:05:11.930> I<00:05:12.319> do<00:05:12.770> use<00:05:13.310> you<00:05:14.120> know<00:05:14.270> a<00:05:14.509> good<00:05:14.900> bit<00:05:15.139> of

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
legs I do use you know a good bit of

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.070 
legs I do use you know a good bit of
this<00:05:15.469> in<00:05:15.740> one<00:05:15.919> application<00:05:16.580> probably<00:05:16.909> half<00:05:17.629> of

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
this in one application probably half of

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.649 
this in one application probably half of
the<00:05:18.560> container<00:05:19.039> is<00:05:19.370> what<00:05:19.639> I<00:05:19.669> can<00:05:19.909> use<00:05:20.120> for<00:05:20.419> one

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
the container is what I can use for one

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.999 
the container is what I can use for one
application<00:05:21.500> for<00:05:21.530> both<00:05:22.039> legs<00:05:22.659> of<00:05:23.770> course<00:05:24.770> if

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 
application for both legs of course if

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:26.770 
application for both legs of course if
your<00:05:25.159> mixture<00:05:25.400> tends<00:05:25.969> to<00:05:26.150> have<00:05:26.330> a<00:05:26.360> thinner

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
your mixture tends to have a thinner

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.189 
your mixture tends to have a thinner
consistency<00:05:27.310> it<00:05:28.310> would<00:05:28.490> probably<00:05:29.060> go<00:05:29.690> further

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
consistency it would probably go further

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.870 
consistency it would probably go further
and<00:05:30.530> you<00:05:30.620> wouldn't<00:05:30.889> need<00:05:31.069> quite<00:05:31.490> as<00:05:31.639> much

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
and you wouldn't need quite as much

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.850 
and you wouldn't need quite as much
product<00:05:32.330> like<00:05:32.810> what<00:05:32.990> I<00:05:33.020> had<00:05:33.259> shown<00:05:33.529> with<00:05:33.710> my

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
product like what I had shown with my

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.670 
product like what I had shown with my
pudding<00:05:34.279> like<00:05:34.430> consistency<00:05:35.380> so<00:05:36.380> now<00:05:36.529> I'm

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
pudding like consistency so now I'm

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.399 
pudding like consistency so now I'm
gonna<00:05:36.770> go<00:05:37.039> ahead<00:05:37.159> and<00:05:37.370> rinse<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.690> spoon<00:05:39.050> and

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
gonna go ahead and rinse the spoon and

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.499 
gonna go ahead and rinse the spoon and
the<00:05:39.529> little<00:05:39.740> bowl<00:05:40.009> so<00:05:40.669> that<00:05:40.819> I<00:05:40.849> don't<00:05:41.000> have<00:05:41.210> to

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
the little bowl so that I don't have to

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.140 
the little bowl so that I don't have to
worry<00:05:41.719> about<00:05:41.870> it<00:05:42.229> drying<00:05:42.740> and<00:05:43.219> being<00:05:43.699> harder

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
worry about it drying and being harder
