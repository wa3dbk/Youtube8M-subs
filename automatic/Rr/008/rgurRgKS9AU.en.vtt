00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
why video is the future of communication

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.920 
why video is the future of communication
is<00:02:59.110> that<00:02:59.410> video<00:02:59.709> is<00:02:59.920> more<00:03:00.069> human<00:03:00.720> none<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.870> us

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
is that video is more human none of us

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.210 
is that video is more human none of us
have<00:03:02.170> any<00:03:02.319> trouble<00:03:02.680> engaging<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.160> a

this is after all the core of what it

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.020 
this is after all the core of what it

loud why do they sound so impersonal and
somewhat<00:03:16.360> alien<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:17.620> reason<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.130> that<00:03:18.160> it's

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
somewhat alien the reason is that it's

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.490 
somewhat alien the reason is that it's
