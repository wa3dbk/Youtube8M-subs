 it is very very very easy to do the 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.140
 materials are very simple 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.000
 get the procedure is a little bit 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.000
 delayed because you have to let the 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.489
 mass but outside of that is very easy makes 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.170
 the baking time is almost 5 to 10 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.690
 minutes that is the truth is very very very 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.890

 we need 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.130
 well let's start by placing the 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.130
 flour in the bowl 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.290
 Y 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.920

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.920
 Butter 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.370
 and we are going to lilac sugar 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.680
 let's start kneading until we 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.260
 it is a smooth mixture but at the same time 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.600
 is going to crumble right now they will see 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.090
 more or less how are we going and going and are we going 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.270
 knead knead knead do not worry if 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.860
 It was so dry is a little dry you 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.860

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.770
 and we're going to add the vanilla 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.840
 since you are and fallen apart we will be 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.840
 the vanilla and we return to knead 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.580
 We are going to put it on a waxed paper 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.580
 and we are going to put it one hour 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:09.619
 and to make the win we are going to place in 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.619
 a saucepan the cream to beat 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.070
 the sugar 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.830

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.810
 move quite a lot until we are 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.810
 make a mixture 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.930
 that by doing it up and releasing it 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.110
 stay in a thread we will remove the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.320
 fire and let's move a little and we're going 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.210
 to place in a bag or sleeve if 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.980
 you have a perfect sleeve but as 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.980
 I did not have a bag 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.810

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.750
 knead the dough we will flatten with a 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.270
 roller I did not have a roller I had to 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.950
 use a glass and let's cut in 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.830
 circles I occupy the measure of 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.840
 little horse 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.970

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.190
 a centimeter and a half more radio or 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.930
 less and we're going to put it in a 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.230
 tray with flour and waxed paper 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.060

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.719
