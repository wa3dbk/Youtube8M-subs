for<00:05:06.039> blocking<00:05:06.580> shots<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:07.090> getting<00:05:07.360> on<00:05:07.449> the

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
for blocking shots and getting on the

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.570 
for blocking shots and getting on the
boss<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.169> doing<00:05:08.410> some<00:05:08.560> things<00:05:08.770> like<00:05:09.009> that<00:05:09.069> so

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
boss and doing some things like that so

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.330 
boss and doing some things like that so
and<00:05:10.360> then<00:05:10.569> we<00:05:10.690> had<00:05:10.810> a<00:05:10.840> couple<00:05:11.169> that<00:05:11.380> didn't<00:05:12.220> do

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
and then we had a couple that didn't do

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.129 
and then we had a couple that didn't do
the<00:05:12.789> things<00:05:13.060> that<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.300> wanted<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.690> do<00:05:13.900> so

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
the things that I wanted to do so

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.890 
the things that I wanted to do so
because<00:05:14.289> a<00:05:14.590> really<00:05:15.430> good<00:05:15.639> inside<00:05:16.300> player<00:05:16.630> and

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
because a really good inside player and

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.600 
because a really good inside player and
strong<00:05:17.199> and<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:17.590> think<00:05:17.919> he<00:05:17.979> played<00:05:18.220> as<00:05:18.370> strong

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
strong and I think he played as strong

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.820 
strong and I think he played as strong
as<00:05:18.819> it<00:05:18.940> needs<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.389> and<00:05:19.599> definitely<00:05:20.530> didn't<00:05:20.740> do

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.990 
the things I wanted to do on the
defensive<00:05:22.509> end<00:05:22.720> so<00:05:23.130> but<00:05:24.130> again<00:05:24.430> you<00:05:24.669> know<00:05:24.819> with
