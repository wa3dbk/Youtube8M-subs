light is should I be scared and it tells
you<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.060> temperature<00:03:45.390> outside<00:03:45.420> which

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
you the temperature outside which

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.340 
you the temperature outside which
unfortunately<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.920> 18<00:03:47.610> Celsius<00:03:48.420> which<00:03:49.020> was

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
unfortunately is 18 Celsius which was

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.110 
unfortunately is 18 Celsius which was
warmer<00:03:49.740> than<00:03:49.770> this<00:03:50.010> morning<00:03:50.220> which<00:03:50.520> was<00:03:50.550> 15

Celsius so I'm thinking it's around 68
degrees<00:03:55.350> 69<00:03:56.280> degrees<00:03:56.900> something<00:03:57.900> like<00:03:58.080> that

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
degrees 69 degrees something like that

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.330 
degrees 69 degrees something like that
that's<00:03:58.770> what<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:58.950> feels<00:03:59.130> like<00:03:59.250> outside<00:04:01.340> yeah

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
that's what it feels like outside yeah

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.400 
that's what it feels like outside yeah
here's<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.180> mirror<00:04:03.420> so<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:03.870> can<00:04:04.050> see<00:04:04.170> into

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
here's the mirror so you can see into

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:16.610 
here's the mirror so you can see into
the<00:04:04.560> back<00:04:04.709> no<00:04:05.430> leather<00:04:05.910> seats<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.989> like<00:04:16.440> these

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.009 
the back no leather seats I like these
little<00:04:16.799> circular<00:04:17.130> things<00:04:17.970> only<00:04:18.540> problem<00:04:18.930> is

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
little circular things only problem is

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.900 
little circular things only problem is
that<00:04:19.079> they<00:04:19.320> spin<00:04:19.739> all<00:04:19.980> around<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.549> if<00:04:20.790> you

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
that they spin all around and if you

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.790 
that they spin all around and if you
were<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.060> drunk<00:04:21.390> person<00:04:21.600> like<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.079> you<00:04:22.410> would

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
were a drunk person like that you would

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.670 
were a drunk person like that you would
totally<00:04:23.210> do<00:04:24.210> something<00:04:24.510> with<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:24.660> lights<00:04:25.530> are

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
totally do something with it lights are

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.090 
totally do something with it lights are
right<00:04:25.800> here<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:26.280> would<00:04:26.490> currently<00:04:26.700> have<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:27.240> on

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
right here I would currently have it on

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.070 
right here I would currently have it on
automatic<00:04:29.100> you<00:04:29.970> can<00:04:30.150> put<00:04:30.419> it<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.660> high<00:04:30.840> beam

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
automatic you can put it to high beam

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.250 
automatic you can put it to high beam
low<00:04:31.620> beam<00:04:31.860> nothing<00:04:32.790> but<00:04:33.540> I<00:04:33.570> put<00:04:33.780> an<00:04:33.840> automatic

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
low beam nothing but I put an automatic

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.580 
low beam nothing but I put an automatic
you<00:04:34.350> can<00:04:34.470> also<00:04:34.710> adjust<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.400> height<00:04:35.700> of<00:04:35.970> the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.700 

the<00:04:40.160> beams<00:04:40.430> so<00:04:41.090> it<00:04:41.210> can<00:04:41.330> be<00:04:41.420> higher<00:04:41.630> lower<00:04:41.960> this

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
the beams so it can be higher lower this

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.940 
the beams so it can be higher lower this
is<00:04:42.890> this<00:04:43.310> is<00:04:43.460> just<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.880> mirrors<00:04:44.890> here's<00:04:45.890> the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
is this is just the mirrors here's the

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.140 
is this is just the mirrors here's the
inside<00:04:46.160> of<00:04:46.670> course<00:04:47.000> there's<00:04:47.210> an<00:04:47.300> automatic

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
inside of course there's an automatic

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.320 
inside of course there's an automatic
window<00:04:50.680> retractor<00:04:51.790> and<00:04:52.790> there's<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.060> mirrors

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
window retractor and there's the mirrors

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.990 
window retractor and there's the mirrors
from<00:04:53.420> outside<00:04:53.810> as<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.110> Sun<00:04:54.290> Goes<00:04:54.320> Down<00:04:55.000> but
