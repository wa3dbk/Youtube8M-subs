so<00:00:10.460> this<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:12.059> usually<00:00:12.509> called<00:00:12.719> windmill<00:00:13.849> split

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
so this is usually called windmill split

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.070 
so this is usually called windmill split
time<00:00:15.030> crossing<00:00:15.540> above<00:00:15.719> your<00:00:15.870> head<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.850> this

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
time crossing above your head and this

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.599 
time crossing above your head and this
some<00:00:19.080> people<00:00:19.170> call<00:00:19.439> water<00:00:19.770> mill<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.490> also

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
some people call water mill you can also

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.970 
some people call water mill you can also
call<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:20.880> split<00:00:21.330> time<00:00:21.630> hip<00:00:22.199> reels<00:00:22.500> but<00:00:22.800> if

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
call it split time hip reels but if

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.340 
call it split time hip reels but if
we're<00:00:23.100> gonna<00:00:23.189> call<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.550> windmill<00:00:24.170> makes<00:00:25.170> its

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
we're gonna call this windmill makes its

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.189 
we're gonna call this windmill makes its
let's<00:00:25.590> call<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.980> water<00:00:26.550> mill<00:00:26.810> I've<00:00:27.810> been

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
let's call this water mill I've been

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.849 
let's call this water mill I've been
noticing<00:00:29.210> that<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.570> lot<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.050> people<00:00:31.380> know

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
noticing that a lot of people know

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.430 
noticing that a lot of people know
windmill<00:00:32.480> but<00:00:33.480> actually<00:00:33.960> aren't<00:00:34.230> very

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
windmill but actually aren't very

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.160 
windmill but actually aren't very
comfortable<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:35.280> water<00:00:36.120> mill<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.690> we'll<00:00:36.960> just

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
comfortable in water mill so we'll just

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.350 
comfortable in water mill so we'll just
talk<00:00:37.320> about<00:00:37.350> how<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> make<00:00:38.219> sure<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.820> do

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
talk about how to make sure you can do

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.950 
talk about how to make sure you can do
water<00:00:39.600> mill<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.050> both<00:00:40.350> directions

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
water mill in both directions

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.639 
water mill in both directions
prerequisite<00:00:44.000> to<00:00:45.000> things<00:00:45.210> let's<00:00:45.360> say<00:00:45.649> hip

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
prerequisite to things let's say hip

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.819 
prerequisite to things let's say hip
reels<00:00:47.780> you<00:00:48.780> definitely<00:00:49.289> build<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.620> new<00:00:49.680> hip

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
reels you definitely build a new hip

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.430 
reels you definitely build a new hip
reels<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.399> each<00:00:50.820> direction<00:00:52.910> and<00:00:54.230> probably<00:00:55.230> you

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
reels in each direction and probably you

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.650 
reels in each direction and probably you
want<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.829> able<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.219> windmill<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.329> both

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
want to be able to do windmill in both

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.810 
want to be able to do windmill in both
directions<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.770> can't<00:01:01.949> do<00:01:02.160> those<00:01:02.340> go

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
directions so if you can't do those go

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.280 
directions so if you can't do those go
back<00:01:02.850> learn<00:01:03.329> them<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:03.840> come<00:01:04.019> back<00:01:04.049> here

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
back learn them and then come back here

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.359 
back learn them and then come back here
and<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.439> we're<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.710> talk<00:01:07.799> about<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.010> few

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
and then we're going to talk about a few

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.270 
and then we're going to talk about a few
ways<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.909> understand<00:01:09.420> water<00:01:10.380> mill<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.100> few

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
ways to understand water mill and a few

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.090 
ways to understand water mill and a few
ways<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:11.610> into<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.530> one<00:01:13.530> way<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
ways to get into it one way is to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100 
ways to get into it one way is to
realize<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.430> windmill<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.330> water<00:01:15.659> mill<00:01:15.930> are

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
realize that windmill and water mill are

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.950 
realize that windmill and water mill are
a<00:01:16.140> bit<00:01:16.290> arbitrary<00:01:17.159> distinctions<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.780> it's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
a bit arbitrary distinctions really it's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.380 
a bit arbitrary distinctions really it's
just<00:01:19.049> milling<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.159> poi<00:01:20.340> are<00:01:20.369> crossing<00:01:20.939> front

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
just milling the poi are crossing front

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.880 
just milling the poi are crossing front
the<00:01:21.600> back<00:01:21.810> front<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> back<00:01:22.500> they're<00:01:22.770> going

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the back front the back they're going

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
the back front the back they're going
split<00:01:23.250> time<00:01:23.430> same<00:01:23.640> direction<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:25.140> can

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
split time same direction and you can

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.050 
split time same direction and you can
get<00:01:25.409> through<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> huge<00:01:25.979> range<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.460> motion<00:01:26.880> from

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
get through a huge range of motion from

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.490 
get through a huge range of motion from
way<00:01:27.330> above<00:01:27.570> your<00:01:27.750> head<00:01:28.490> out<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> sides

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
way above your head out to the sides

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.859 
way above your head out to the sides
right<00:01:31.500> down<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.009> your<00:01:32.100> hips<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:33.509> that's<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
right down to your hips so that's the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.499 
right down to your hips so that's the
whole<00:01:34.049> range<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.439> motion<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.119> it's<00:01:36.119> basically

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
whole range of motion and it's basically

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.170 
whole range of motion and it's basically
the<00:01:36.689> same<00:01:36.869> pattern<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.820> way<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.000> can

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the same pattern so one way you can

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.469 
the same pattern so one way you can
learn<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.990> once<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.799> get<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.250> in

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
learn this is once you get it up here in

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.690 
learn this is once you get it up here in
windmill<00:01:42.479> learn<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.590> slowly<00:01:43.860> open<00:01:44.009> your<00:01:44.280> arms

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
windmill learn to slowly open your arms

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.120 
windmill learn to slowly open your arms
open<00:01:45.390> open<00:01:45.960> down<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:46.560> I'll<00:01:46.860> take<00:01:47.100> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
open open down then I'll take a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.249 
open open down then I'll take a
double-take<00:01:47.460> day<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.820> won't<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.180> easy<00:01:48.329> until

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
double-take day it won't be easy until

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.569 
double-take day it won't be easy until
you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.560> all<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> way<00:01:50.009> down<00:01:50.159> here<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you can do it all the way down here and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.520 
you can do it all the way down here and
and<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.899> leave<00:01:52.020> new<00:01:52.170> thing<00:01:52.409> it's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
and then you can leave new thing it's

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740 
and then you can leave new thing it's
like<00:01:52.590> one<00:01:52.770> arm<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.040> time<00:01:53.479> we'll<00:01:54.479> talk<00:01:54.630> about

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
like one arm at a time we'll talk about

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.569 
like one arm at a time we'll talk about
that<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.200> another<00:01:55.259> video<00:01:55.619> that's<00:01:55.890> one<00:01:56.280> way<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
that in another video that's one way to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.649 
that in another video that's one way to
really<00:01:56.880> come<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.210> understand<00:01:57.719> water<00:01:58.320> mill

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
really come to understand water mill

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.060 
really come to understand water mill
another<00:02:00.659> way<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> understand<00:02:01.320> water<00:02:01.560> mill<00:02:01.829> is

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
another way to understand water mill is

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.740 
another way to understand water mill is
that<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.030> variation<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.229> hip<00:02:05.100> reels<00:02:05.750> so

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
that it's a variation on hip reels so

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.800 
that it's a variation on hip reels so
these<00:02:06.990> are<00:02:07.170> same<00:02:07.500> time<00:02:07.799> hip<00:02:07.979> reels<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.879> notice

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
these are same time hip reels and notice

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.660 
these are same time hip reels and notice
that<00:02:10.080> they're<00:02:10.410> both<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.979> front<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.489> both

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
that they're both in front and both

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.050 
that they're both in front and both
behind<00:02:12.120> at<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.360> top<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
behind at the top of the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.640 
behind at the top of the

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
reels aka watermelon and it also teaches

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.520 
reels aka watermelon and it also teaches
you<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.650> materials<00:04:21.130> which<00:04:21.430> is<00:04:21.519> pretty<00:04:21.669> cool

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
you the materials which is pretty cool

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.990 
you the materials which is pretty cool
either<00:04:23.530> way<00:04:23.680> once<00:04:23.979> you've<00:04:24.099> got<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.430> hip<00:04:24.700> reels

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
either way once you've got the hip reels

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.760 
either way once you've got the hip reels
to<00:04:25.150> split<00:04:25.419> time<00:04:25.539> hip<00:04:25.720> reels<00:04:25.960> watermill

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
to split time hip reels watermill

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.909 
to split time hip reels watermill
and<00:04:27.039> you<00:04:27.370> can<00:04:27.490> go<00:04:27.580> up<00:04:27.789> into<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.660> pewter<00:04:29.199> windmill

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
and you can go up into a pewter windmill

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.700 
and you can go up into a pewter windmill
fitter<00:04:30.449> then<00:04:31.449> you<00:04:31.599> have<00:04:31.750> a<00:04:31.780> lot<00:04:32.259> more<00:04:32.470> freedom

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
fitter then you have a lot more freedom

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.010 
fitter then you have a lot more freedom
with<00:04:32.830> point<00:04:33.300> but<00:04:34.300> just<00:04:34.449> make<00:04:34.599> sure<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:34.810> get<00:04:34.900> it

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
with point but just make sure you get it

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.900 
with point but just make sure you get it
both<00:04:35.169> ways<00:04:35.349> both<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:35.919> them<00:04:36.039> windmill<00:04:36.699> and

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
both ways both of them windmill and

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.240 
both ways both of them windmill and
water<00:04:37.240> mill<00:04:37.539> really<00:04:38.380> make<00:04:38.530> sure<00:04:38.710> clockwise

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
water mill really make sure clockwise

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.680 
water mill really make sure clockwise
and<00:04:39.460> counter<00:04:39.789> clockwise<00:04:39.819> or<00:04:40.330> else<00:04:40.479> of<00:04:40.599> course

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
and counter clockwise or else of course

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.260 
and counter clockwise or else of course
you<00:04:41.080> won't<00:04:41.229> be<00:04:41.349> able<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.800> turn<00:04:42.130> which<00:04:43.000> makes

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
you won't be able to turn which makes

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.749 
you won't be able to turn which makes
poi<00:04:43.569> spinning<00:04:43.720> much<00:04:44.620> less<00:04:44.860> fun<00:04:45.069> than<00:04:45.370> post

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
poi spinning much less fun than post

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.719 
poi spinning much less fun than post
bidding<00:04:46.060> with<00:04:46.750> turning<00:04:47.610> yeah<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:49.750> I<00:04:49.840> think<00:04:49.900> I

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
bidding with turning yeah and I think I

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.490 
bidding with turning yeah and I think I
think<00:04:51.729> that's<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.180> most<00:04:52.330> important<00:04:52.900> stuff<00:04:53.139> so

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
think that's the most important stuff so

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.360 
think that's the most important stuff so
I<00:04:54.300> grabbed<00:04:55.300> your<00:04:55.419> poi<00:04:55.630> play<00:04:56.139> with<00:04:56.289> that<00:04:56.410> take

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
I grabbed your poi play with that take

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.499 
I grabbed your poi play with that take
all<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.699> different<00:04:57.789> approaches<00:04:58.389> because

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
all the different approaches because

00:04:58.509 --> 00:04:59.939 
all the different approaches because
each<00:04:58.720> of<00:04:58.750> those<00:04:58.960> approaches<00:04:59.440> teaches<00:04:59.830> you

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
each of those approaches teaches you

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.159 
each of those approaches teaches you
something<00:05:00.130> different<00:05:00.639> the<00:05:01.419> O<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.840> only<00:05:02.050> other

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
something different the O the only other

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.860 
something different the O the only other
thing<00:05:02.380> is<00:05:02.530> of<00:05:02.650> course<00:05:02.680> each<00:05:03.099> hand<00:05:03.750> needs<00:05:04.750> to<00:05:04.810> be

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
thing is of course each hand needs to be

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.960 
thing is of course each hand needs to be
able<00:05:04.990> to<00:05:05.080> do<00:05:05.199> this<00:05:05.409> at<00:05:05.650> your<00:05:05.680> hip<00:05:05.949> needs<00:05:06.849> to<00:05:06.909> be

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
able to do this at your hip needs to be

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.640 
able to do this at your hip needs to be
able<00:05:07.030> to<00:05:07.120> pass<00:05:07.419> through<00:05:07.810> that<00:05:07.960> give<00:05:08.199> me<00:05:08.409> five

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
able to pass through that give me five

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.240 
able to pass through that give me five
around<00:05:09.099> behind<00:05:09.490> position<00:05:10.740> spinning<00:05:11.740> outwards

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
around behind position spinning outwards

around behind position spinning outwards
and<00:05:12.699> inwards<00:05:15.090> if<00:05:16.090> you're<00:05:16.300> missing<00:05:16.690> that<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:17.169> lot

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
and inwards if you're missing that a lot

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.899 
and inwards if you're missing that a lot
of<00:05:17.530> this<00:05:17.710> will<00:05:17.889> be<00:05:17.979> awkward<00:05:18.190> so<00:05:18.430> just<00:05:18.729> make

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
of this will be awkward so just make

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.260 
of this will be awkward so just make
sure<00:05:19.120> you<00:05:19.240> can<00:05:19.419> both<00:05:20.050> ways<00:05:20.380> don't<00:05:21.340> go<00:05:21.580> this<00:05:22.030> way

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
sure you can both ways don't go this way

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.020 
sure you can both ways don't go this way

thumb in both directions both hands we
got<00:05:29.050> all<00:05:29.229> of<00:05:29.259> that<00:05:29.530> it<00:05:29.800> should<00:05:30.039> start<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.460> flow

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
got all of that it should start the flow

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.909 
got all of that it should start the flow
and<00:05:31.270> don't<00:05:31.719> expect<00:05:31.960> it<00:05:32.110> all<00:05:32.229> in<00:05:32.380> one<00:05:32.530> day<00:05:32.710> it

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
and don't expect it all in one day it

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.520 
and don't expect it all in one day it
might<00:05:33.009> take<00:05:33.190> a<00:05:33.219> few<00:05:33.310> practice<00:05:33.729> sessions<00:05:34.000> and

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
might take a few practice sessions and

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.490 
might take a few practice sessions and
all<00:05:35.530> if<00:05:35.830> you<00:05:35.919> need<00:05:36.039> me<00:05:36.219> I'll<00:05:36.370> be<00:05:36.900> I'll<00:05:37.900> be<00:05:38.199> here
