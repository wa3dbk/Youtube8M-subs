00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
little bit closer you can see the nails

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.900 
little bit closer you can see the nails
and<00:00:31.080> what<00:00:31.289> we've<00:00:31.470> done<00:00:31.769> we've<00:00:32.309> hammered<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and what we've done we've hammered the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.900 
and what we've done we've hammered the
nails<00:00:32.940> back<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.809> place<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.890> we've<00:00:35.070> also<00:00:35.309> put<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
nails back in place but we've also put a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.750 
nails back in place but we've also put a
screw<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:37.020> help<00:00:37.260> hold<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.649> sheetrock<00:00:38.399> tight

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
screw to help hold that sheetrock tight

against that stud that's behind the wall
what<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.710> right<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.510> have

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
what we have right here is that we have

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.040 
what we have right here is that we have
where<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.219> sheetrock<00:00:47.610> has<00:00:48.300> joined<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.899> other

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
where the sheetrock has joined the other

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.520 
where the sheetrock has joined the other
sheetrock<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.280> what<00:00:50.610> has<00:00:50.850> was<00:00:51.210> left<00:00:51.570> was<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
sheetrock and what has was left was a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.950 
sheetrock and what has was left was a
line<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.699> could<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.239> line<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.899> was

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
line and you could see that line it was

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.220 
line and you could see that line it was
very<00:00:55.289> visible<00:00:56.090> in<00:00:57.090> order<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> root

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
very visible in order to get to the root

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.840 
very visible in order to get to the root
of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> problem<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.160> repair<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
of the problem and to repair it a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.830 
of the problem and to repair it a
correct<00:01:00.270> way<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:01.350> needed<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.800> take<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.340> tape

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
correct way we needed to take this tape

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.890 
correct way we needed to take this tape
out<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.379> get<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.010> where<00:01:05.189> these<00:01:05.430> two<00:01:05.900> sheetrock

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
out and get to where these two sheetrock

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.520 
out and get to where these two sheetrock
joints<00:01:07.890> met<00:01:08.510> then<00:01:09.510> we<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> root

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
joints met then we can get to the root

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.469 
joints met then we can get to the root
of<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> problem<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:11.970> feel<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
of the problem and you can feel the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.800 
of the problem and you can feel the
problem<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.350> sheetrock<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.369> even<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.600> so

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
problem the sheetrock is not even and so

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.200 
problem the sheetrock is not even and so
what<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.200> must<00:01:16.470> do<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:17.009> build<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.820> out<00:01:18.000> with

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
what we must do is build it out with

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.810 
what we must do is build it out with
sheetrock<00:01:18.750> mud<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> correct

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
sheetrock mud but this is the correct

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.170 
sheetrock mud but this is the correct
way<00:01:21.380> that<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.650> want<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.100> repair<00:01:23.580> nail<00:01:23.850> pops

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
way that you want to repair nail pops

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.080 
way that you want to repair nail pops
what<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.220> take

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.399 

and<00:01:32.510> just<00:01:32.720> hit<00:01:32.930> that<00:01:33.520> sheetrock<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:35.170> nail<00:01:36.170> has

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
and just hit that sheetrock the nail has

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.950 
and just hit that sheetrock the nail has
went<00:01:36.650> back<00:01:36.860> in<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.909> you<00:01:38.060> just<00:01:38.299> take<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:38.750> dig

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
went back in and you just take and dig

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.899 
went back in and you just take and dig
that<00:01:39.310> that<00:01:40.310> loose<00:01:42.100> paint<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.369> loose

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
that that loose paint and loose

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.420 
that that loose paint and loose
sheetrock<00:01:44.810> mud<00:01:45.140> out<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.530> there<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:46.280> can

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
sheetrock mud out of there and you can

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.520 
sheetrock mud out of there and you can
see<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.820> nail<00:01:47.060> hit<00:01:47.360> right<00:01:47.930> there<00:01:47.960> in<00:01:48.409> the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
see the nail hit right there in the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.520 
see the nail hit right there in the
center<00:01:48.800> so<00:01:49.490> what<00:01:49.670> will<00:01:49.790> do<00:01:50.000> is<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:50.960> will<00:01:51.200> put

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
center so what will do is that will put

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.649 
center so what will do is that will put
mud<00:01:51.800> over<00:01:52.130> top<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:52.369> that<00:01:52.640> after<00:01:53.060> we<00:01:53.180> perhaps

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
mud over top of that after we perhaps

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.430 
mud over top of that after we perhaps
add<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.140> one<00:01:54.350> more<00:01:54.619> screw<00:01:55.009> to<00:01:55.220> that
