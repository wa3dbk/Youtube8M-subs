missing<00:02:21.489> so<00:02:22.239> that's<00:02:22.540> actually<00:02:23.019> bullcrap<00:02:23.739> that

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859 
missing so that's actually bullcrap that

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.099 
missing so that's actually bullcrap that
i<00:02:24.040> just<00:02:24.310> said<00:02:24.519> it's<00:02:25.090> definitely<00:02:25.660> not<00:02:25.810> how<00:02:26.049> many

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
i just said it's definitely not how many

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.050 
i just said it's definitely not how many
fear<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.680> have<00:02:26.859> its<00:02:27.130> how<00:02:27.370> many<00:02:27.400> health<00:02:27.850> is

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
fear you have its how many health is

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.330 
fear you have its how many health is
missing<00:02:29.310> just<00:02:30.310> by<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.519> way<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:32.069> this<00:02:33.069> look<00:02:33.250> at

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
missing just by the way so this look at

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.180 
missing just by the way so this look at
the<00:02:33.400> second<00:02:33.700> ability<00:02:33.880> that's<00:02:34.329> actually<00:02:35.190> what

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
the second ability that's actually what

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.520 
the second ability that's actually what
makes<00:02:36.430> impossible<00:02:36.819> to<00:02:37.269> be<00:02:37.600> played<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:38.200> the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
makes impossible to be played in the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.140 
makes impossible to be played in the
jungle<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.970> be<00:02:40.090> honest<00:02:40.980> because<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.970> only

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
jungle to be honest because you only

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.759 
jungle to be honest because you only
calculate<00:02:44.250> junglers<00:02:45.250> by<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.489> amount<00:02:45.790> of

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
calculate junglers by the amount of

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.530 
calculate junglers by the amount of
proper<00:02:47.769> ganks<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.340> can<00:02:48.519> get<00:02:48.730> from<00:02:48.970> them<00:02:49.180> and

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
proper ganks you can get from them and

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.590 
proper ganks you can get from them and
not<00:02:49.840> how<00:02:50.620> they<00:02:50.889> can<00:02:51.100> jungle<00:02:51.609> in<00:02:51.790> particular<00:02:52.150> so

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
not how they can jungle in particular so

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.430 
not how they can jungle in particular so
just<00:02:52.810> keep<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:52.989> in<00:02:53.139> mind<00:02:55.170> don't<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.260> wanna

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
just keep that in mind don't you wanna

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.680 
just keep that in mind don't you wanna
kill<00:02:56.709> these<00:02:56.950> which<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.579> pretty<00:02:58.150> hard<00:02:58.450> killing

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
kill these which is pretty hard killing

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.930

damage by 24 seconds and enemies with
their<00:03:42.730> backs<00:03:43.480> turned<00:03:45.239> very<00:03:46.239> important<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:47.110> you

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
their backs turned very important to you

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.530 
their backs turned very important to you
know<00:03:47.620> read<00:03:47.860> a<00:03:47.890> proper<00:03:48.310> your<00:03:48.610> stuff<00:03:48.910> backs

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
know read a proper your stuff backs

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.479 
know read a proper your stuff backs
turned<00:03:49.870> also<00:03:50.350> their<00:03:50.500> movement<00:03:50.920> speed<00:03:51.130> reduces

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
turned also their movement speed reduces

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.699 
turned also their movement speed reduces
by<00:03:51.760> thirty<00:03:52.030> percent<00:03:52.390> so<00:03:52.989> when<00:03:53.200> someone's<00:03:53.620> not

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
by thirty percent so when someone's not

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.500 
by thirty percent so when someone's not
looking<00:03:54.160> at<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.820> can<00:03:54.940> actually<00:03:55.239> slow

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
looking at you you can actually slow

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.000 
looking at you you can actually slow
them<00:03:55.690> as<00:03:55.900> well<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:57.959> instead<00:03:58.959> of<00:03:59.020> sub<00:03:59.590> people

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
them as well so instead of sub people

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.830 
them as well so instead of sub people
actually<00:04:00.520> running<00:04:00.790> away<00:04:01.090> from<00:04:01.150> Jenna<00:04:01.570> me<00:04:01.720> it's

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
actually running away from Jenna me it's

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.340 
actually running away from Jenna me it's
actually<00:04:02.260> more<00:04:02.410> safe<00:04:02.830> in<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.989> know<00:04:05.140> by

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
actually more safe in you know by

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.690 
actually more safe in you know by
reading<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.860> stuff<00:04:06.040> it's<00:04:06.220> actually<00:04:06.520> more

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
reading the stuff it's actually more

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.290 
reading the stuff it's actually more
safe<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:08.140> actually<00:04:08.650> face<00:04:09.010> tryndamere<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:09.970> try

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
safe to actually face tryndamere and try

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.720 
safe to actually face tryndamere and try
and<00:04:10.360> kill<00:04:10.630> him<00:04:10.780> instead<00:04:11.650> of<00:04:11.709> running<00:04:12.040> away<00:04:12.130> but

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
and kill him instead of running away but

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.520 
and kill him instead of running away but
when<00:04:13.480> he<00:04:13.570> is<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:14.459> when<00:04:15.459> he's<00:04:15.580> actually<00:04:15.820> you<00:04:16.209> know
