hey it's de Mercier and today have
something<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.400> bit<00:00:06.060> interesting<00:00:07.130> to<00:00:08.130> look<00:00:08.309> at

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
something a bit interesting to look at

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.480 
something a bit interesting to look at
with<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:12.090> figure<00:00:13.019> art<00:00:13.790> 0bo<00:00:14.790> Hancock

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
with this is the figure art 0bo Hancock

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.730 
with this is the figure art 0bo Hancock
looking<00:00:17.490> down<00:00:17.760> upon<00:00:18.170> version<00:00:19.760> this<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:21.090> an

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
looking down upon version this was an

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.080 
looking down upon version this was an
exclusive<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.430> can<00:00:23.670> see<00:00:23.880> there's<00:00:25.010> make<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.090> toy

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
exclusive you can see there's make a toy

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:36.500 
exclusive you can see there's make a toy
animation<00:00:28.369> shop<00:00:29.840> exclusive<00:00:31.700> so<00:00:34.520> it's<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.760> bit

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
animation shop exclusive so it's a bit

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.920 
animation shop exclusive so it's a bit
on<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.230> expensive<00:00:37.590> side<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.850> suppose<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:41.930> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
on the expensive side I suppose and the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:54.200 
on the expensive side I suppose and the
box<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.649> rather<00:00:44.550> small<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:46.910> but<00:00:51.620> let's<00:00:53.210> go

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
box is rather small really but let's go

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.779 
box is rather small really but let's go
through<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.930> figure<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:57.949> with<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.190> figure

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
through the figure and with this figure

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.660 
through the figure and with this figure
I<00:01:02.239> don't<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:04.430> care<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.659> much<00:01:06.659> about<00:01:07.670> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
I don't really care that much about the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.950 
I don't really care that much about the
detail<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.880> sculpt<00:01:11.880> or<00:01:12.060> anything<00:01:12.510> like

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
detail or the sculpt or anything like

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.390 
detail or the sculpt or anything like
that<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:14.689> care<00:01:15.689> about<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:18.030> fact<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
that I just care about the fact that

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.630 
that I just care about the fact that
this<00:01:20.400> figure<00:01:22.340> exists<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:24.860> is<00:01:25.860> doing<00:01:26.430> this

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
this figure exists and is doing this

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.789 
this figure exists and is doing this
pose<00:01:27.829> that's<00:01:28.829> pretty<00:01:29.400> much<00:01:29.670> enough<00:01:30.090> for<00:01:30.450> me

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
pose that's pretty much enough for me

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:39.760 
pose that's pretty much enough for me
because<00:01:32.930> that's<00:01:33.930> pretty<00:01:34.530> damn<00:01:35.369> awesome<00:01:38.240> but<00:01:39.240> I

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
because that's pretty damn awesome but I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.310 
because that's pretty damn awesome but I
suppose<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:41.009> should<00:01:41.390> look<00:01:42.390> at<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:45.320> details

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
suppose we should look at the details

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.460 
suppose we should look at the details
and<00:01:46.590> whatnot<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.200> pretty<00:01:51.470> pretty

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
and whatnot and it's pretty pretty

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.249 
and whatnot and it's pretty pretty
decent<00:01:54.049> didn't<00:01:55.049> see<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.950> lines<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.810> her

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
decent didn't see like the lines on her

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.330 
decent didn't see like the lines on her
shirt<00:02:01.259> there<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.659> on<00:02:03.659> her<00:02:04.439> cuffs<00:02:04.829> it's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
shirt there and on her cuffs it's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.520 
shirt there and on her cuffs it's
actually<00:02:07.670> somewhat<00:02:08.670> translucent<00:02:09.530> plastic

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
actually somewhat translucent plastic

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.920 
actually somewhat translucent plastic
like<00:02:11.190> with<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.640> peop<00:02:12.000> although<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.750> doesn't

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
like with the peop although it doesn't

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.490 
like with the peop although it doesn't
look

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
look

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.290 
look
is<00:02:13.740> good<00:02:14.010> because<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.460> doesn't<00:02:14.730> have<00:02:14.850> like<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
is good because it doesn't have like the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.410 
is good because it doesn't have like the
black<00:02:15.540> lines<00:02:15.960> on<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.350> but<00:02:16.970> it's<00:02:17.970> better<00:02:18.210> than<00:02:18.360> a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
black lines on it but it's better than a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.840 
black lines on it but it's better than a
lot<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.900> banpresto<00:02:19.770> figures<00:02:20.340> where<00:02:20.670> they

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
lot of the banpresto figures where they

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.960 
lot of the banpresto figures where they
just<00:02:21.090> painted<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.750> pink<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:26.310> skirt<00:02:26.670> looks

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
just painted it pink and the skirt looks

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.810 
just painted it pink and the skirt looks
pretty<00:02:27.390> nice<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:28.110> looks<00:02:28.320> fairly<00:02:29.130> comparable

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
pretty nice it looks fairly comparable

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.210 
pretty nice it looks fairly comparable
to<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.890> PLP<00:02:31.890> version<00:02:33.530> it's<00:02:34.530> got<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.980> same

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
to the PLP version it's got the same

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.930 
to the PLP version it's got the same
sort<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.820> shiny<00:02:36.390> paint<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.700> looks

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
sort of shiny paint to it so it looks

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.010 
sort of shiny paint to it so it looks
pretty<00:02:39.330> nice

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
pretty nice

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:48.710 
pretty nice
and<00:02:42.560> can<00:02:43.560> see<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.720> shoulder<00:02:46.380> pads<00:02:47.630> there's<00:02:48.630> a

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
and can see the shoulder pads there's a

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.199 
and can see the shoulder pads there's a
little<00:02:49.050> bit<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.350> paint<00:02:49.680> bleeding<00:02:50.250> there<00:02:50.520> but

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
little bit of paint bleeding there but

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.280 
little bit of paint bleeding there but
oh<00:02:52.310> well<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:54.030> Cape<00:02:54.650> could<00:02:55.650> be<00:02:55.800> standard<00:02:56.790> in

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
oh well the Cape could be standard in

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.449 
oh well the Cape could be standard in
the<00:02:58.290> hair<00:02:59.270> actually<00:03:00.270> there's<00:03:00.750> some<00:03:01.560> kind<00:03:02.340> of

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
the hair actually there's some kind of

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.540 
the hair actually there's some kind of
weird<00:03:04.190> moulding<00:03:06.020> lines<00:03:07.020> there<00:03:07.500> like<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:07.890> can

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
weird moulding lines there like you can

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.449 
weird moulding lines there like you can
see<00:03:08.850> there<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:13.500> face<00:03:13.770> is<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:14.040> little

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
see there and the face is a little

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.660 
see there and the face is a little
strange<00:03:15.739> her<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:16.950> think<00:03:17.100> her<00:03:17.459> eyes<00:03:17.700> are<00:03:18.180> like

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
strange her I think her eyes are like

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.620 
strange her I think her eyes are like
far<00:03:20.670> too<00:03:21.090> wide<00:03:21.510> open<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.290> looks<00:03:22.530> kind<00:03:22.860> of

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
far too wide open it looks kind of

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.350 
far too wide open it looks kind of
creepy<00:03:24.630> almost<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.769> don't<00:03:25.920> know<00:03:26.280> but<00:03:26.580> that

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
creepy almost I don't know but that

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.590 
creepy almost I don't know but that
doesn't<00:03:27.750> matter<00:03:27.900> because<00:03:29.150> with<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.330> figure

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
doesn't matter because with this figure

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.110 
doesn't matter because with this figure
you're<00:03:31.140> pretty<00:03:31.410> much<00:03:31.680> never<00:03:32.040> going<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.519> see

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
you're pretty much never going to see

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.259 
you're pretty much never going to see
the<00:03:33.390> face<00:03:33.840> anyways<00:03:34.799> unless<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.610> pick<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.150> up

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
the face anyways unless you pick it up

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.789 
the face anyways unless you pick it up
and<00:03:36.570> look<00:03:37.290> at<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:38.030> otherwise<00:03:39.320> it's<00:03:40.320> just<00:03:40.500> gonna

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
and look at it otherwise it's just gonna

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.640 
and look at it otherwise it's just gonna
be<00:03:41.070> this<00:03:41.310> way<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.790> whole<00:03:42.420> time<00:03:42.840> which<00:03:43.410> is

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
be this way the whole time which is

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.470 
be this way the whole time which is
pretty<00:03:43.980> much<00:03:44.190> how<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.579> should<00:03:44.850> be<00:03:45.030> anyway<00:03:45.329> so

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
pretty much how it should be anyway so

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.120 
pretty much how it should be anyway so
the<00:03:45.900> face<00:03:46.110> is<00:03:46.320> really<00:03:47.010> important<00:03:48.000> at<00:03:48.180> all<00:03:49.130> it's

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
the face is really important at all it's

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.270 
the face is really important at all it's
pretty<00:03:50.640> much<00:03:50.940> all<00:03:51.269> about<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.410> pose<00:03:52.650> with<00:03:53.040> this

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
pretty much all about the pose with this

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.620 
pretty much all about the pose with this
one<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:54.260> then<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:58.190> base<00:03:59.190> if<00:03:59.850> I<00:04:00.090> can<00:04:00.299> get<00:04:00.540> her

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
one and then the base if I can get her

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.550 
one and then the base if I can get her
off<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.200> it

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
off of it

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.270 
off of it
that<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:04.640> the<00:04:05.640> standard<00:04:06.180> base<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:07.680> got<00:04:07.920> the

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
that is is the standard base you got the

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.069 
that is is the standard base you got the
Kuja<00:04:09.440> pirates<00:04:10.670> Jolly<00:04:11.670> Roger<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.870> bull

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
Kuja pirates Jolly Roger and the bull

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.120 
Kuja pirates Jolly Roger and the bull
Hancock<00:04:13.410> dead<00:04:14.040> or<00:04:14.160> alive<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:16.130> something

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
Hancock dead or alive and something

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.190 
Hancock dead or alive and something
there<00:04:17.310> in<00:04:17.489> Japanese<00:04:18.060> I'm<00:04:18.419> sure<00:04:18.660> it's<00:04:18.840> quite

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
there in Japanese I'm sure it's quite

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.450 
there in Japanese I'm sure it's quite
amusing<00:04:19.560> but<00:04:20.510> you<00:04:21.510> know<00:04:21.660> whatever<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.590> it

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
amusing but you know whatever and it

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.659 
amusing but you know whatever and it
also<00:04:23.610> comes<00:04:24.060> with<00:04:24.210> this<00:04:24.690> thing<00:04:25.080> which<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:26.610> can

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
also comes with this thing which you can

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:36.950 
also comes with this thing which you can
attached<00:04:29.669> to<00:04:29.699> her<00:04:30.949> cape<00:04:33.349> like<00:04:34.349> so<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:35.689> then<00:04:36.689> it

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
attached to her cape like so and then it

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.129 
attached to her cape like so and then it
kind<00:04:37.199> of<00:04:37.289> helps<00:04:37.650> her<00:04:37.770> balance<00:04:38.099> a<00:04:39.030> bit<00:04:40.219> maybe<00:04:41.219> I

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
kind of helps her balance a bit maybe I

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.779 
kind of helps her balance a bit maybe I
don't<00:04:43.139> know<00:04:43.259> if<00:04:43.379> I<00:04:43.500> have<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:43.889> on<00:04:44.039> quite<00:04:44.430> right

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
don't know if I have it on quite right

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.879 
don't know if I have it on quite right
but<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:48.090> seemed<00:04:48.330> it<00:04:48.780> seems<00:04:49.080> like<00:04:49.409> it<00:04:49.560> almost

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
but it seemed it seems like it almost

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:55.869 
but it seemed it seems like it almost
works<00:04:50.669> better<00:04:51.000> without<00:04:51.330> it<00:04:51.930> but<00:04:52.500> I<00:04:54.620> don't<00:04:55.620> know

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:55.879 
works better without it but I don't know

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.499 
works better without it but I don't know
but<00:04:56.879> it's<00:04:57.150> it's<00:04:58.340> nice<00:04:59.340> it's<00:04:59.909> always<00:05:00.240> nice<00:05:00.479> that

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
but it's it's nice it's always nice that

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.709 
but it's it's nice it's always nice that
they<00:05:00.930> include<00:05:01.319> these<00:05:01.529> little<00:05:01.860> things<00:05:02.449> in<00:05:03.449> case

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
they include these little things in case

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.950 
they include these little things in case
you<00:05:03.960> want<00:05:04.199> to<00:05:05.000> display<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.150> figure<00:05:06.419> without

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
you want to display the figure without

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.779 
you want to display the figure without
the<00:05:07.199> base<00:05:07.580> although<00:05:09.680> it<00:05:10.680> does<00:05:10.949> stand<00:05:11.310> pretty

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
the base although it does stand pretty

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.240 
the base although it does stand pretty
well<00:05:12.180> without<00:05:12.599> it<00:05:12.870> with<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.199> Cape<00:05:13.409> as<00:05:13.680> support

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
well without it with the Cape as support

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.119 
well without it with the Cape as support
although<00:05:15.210> this<00:05:15.569> foot<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.080> little<00:05:16.650> bit<00:05:16.860> off

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
although this foot is a little bit off

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:22.189 
although this foot is a little bit off
of<00:05:17.189> the<00:05:17.550> ground<00:05:18.830> so<00:05:19.830> you<00:05:19.919> can<00:05:20.129> see<00:05:20.430> but<00:05:21.199> not

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
of the ground so you can see but not

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.269 
of the ground so you can see but not
that<00:05:22.439> big<00:05:22.710> of<00:05:22.740> a<00:05:22.949> deal<00:05:24.199> one<00:05:25.199> thing<00:05:25.469> and<00:05:25.830> that's

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:26.279 
that big of a deal one thing and that's

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:27.980 
that big of a deal one thing and that's
kind<00:05:26.699> of<00:05:26.789> disappointing<00:05:27.389> is<00:05:27.569> that<00:05:27.779> it's

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
kind of disappointing is that it's

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.469 
kind of disappointing is that it's
another<00:05:28.439> rather<00:05:28.830> small<00:05:29.340> one<00:05:29.669> again<00:05:29.699> as<00:05:30.330> you

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
another rather small one again as you

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.829 
another rather small one again as you
can<00:05:30.509> see<00:05:30.719> it's<00:05:31.199> pretty<00:05:31.469> much<00:05:31.650> the<00:05:32.460> same<00:05:32.839> size

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:33.839 
can see it's pretty much the same size

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:39.529 
can see it's pretty much the same size
more<00:05:34.319> or<00:05:34.349> less<00:05:34.620> as<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:37.680> Luffy<00:05:38.460> here<00:05:38.879> so

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
more or less as the the Luffy here so

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.369 
more or less as the the Luffy here so
it's<00:05:40.259> one<00:05:40.529> of<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:40.800> smaller<00:05:41.190> ones<00:05:41.669> really

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:42.379 
it's one of the smaller ones really

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.779 
it's one of the smaller ones really
although<00:05:43.379> she<00:05:43.500> is<00:05:43.680> a<00:05:43.770> bit<00:05:44.009> taller<00:05:44.339> than<00:05:44.669> in

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
although she is a bit taller than in

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.540 
although she is a bit taller than in
Luffy<00:05:45.349> but<00:05:46.349> that's<00:05:46.589> probably<00:05:47.039> more<00:05:47.339> because

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
Luffy but that's probably more because

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:56.629 
Luffy but that's probably more because
she's<00:05:48.199> really<00:05:49.199> tall<00:05:50.060> but<00:05:52.039> in<00:05:53.039> any<00:05:53.279> case<00:05:55.639> you

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
she's really tall but in any case you

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:03.529 
she's really tall but in any case you
know<00:05:56.759> it's<00:05:59.779> it's<00:06:01.400> decent<00:06:02.400> figure<00:06:03.029> I<00:06:03.300> mean

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
know it's it's decent figure I mean

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.959 
know it's it's decent figure I mean
really<00:06:03.930> you're<00:06:04.319> only<00:06:04.379> really<00:06:05.069> getting<00:06:05.460> it<00:06:05.639> for

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:05.969 
really you're only really getting it for

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:09.459 
really you're only really getting it for
the<00:06:06.060> novelty<00:06:06.569> factor<00:06:06.750> in<00:06:07.529> the<00:06:08.250> first<00:06:08.550> place<00:06:08.939> so

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469 
the novelty factor in the first place so

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:15.980 
the novelty factor in the first place so
if<00:06:11.300> that's<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.659> kind<00:06:13.259> of<00:06:14.419> thing<00:06:15.419> that<00:06:15.449> you

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
if that's the kind of thing that you

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.820 
if that's the kind of thing that you
want<00:06:16.439> that<00:06:17.159> you're<00:06:17.400> looking<00:06:17.819> for<00:06:18.120> then<00:06:18.830> maybe

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
want that you're looking for then maybe

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.980 
want that you're looking for then maybe
you'll<00:06:20.129> want<00:06:20.400> to<00:06:20.460> go<00:06:20.639> for<00:06:20.969> it<00:06:21.120> like<00:06:21.360> I<00:06:21.509> said<00:06:21.750> it

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
you'll want to go for it like I said it

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.040 
you'll want to go for it like I said it
it's<00:06:22.469> an<00:06:22.740> exclusive<00:06:23.370> so<00:06:24.060> you'll<00:06:24.270> have<00:06:24.479> to<00:06:24.839> pay

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
it's an exclusive so you'll have to pay

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:32.179 
it's an exclusive so you'll have to pay
a<00:06:25.729> fair<00:06:26.729> bit<00:06:27.000> more<00:06:27.419> for<00:06:27.900> it<00:06:27.930> but<00:06:30.620> in<00:06:31.620> the<00:06:31.800> end<00:06:31.830> it

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:32.189 
a fair bit more for it but in the end it

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:35.870 
a fair bit more for it but in the end it
was<00:06:32.339> worth<00:06:32.370> it<00:06:32.819> for<00:06:33.060> me<00:06:33.270> because<00:06:33.900> I<00:06:34.490> just<00:06:35.490> I

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
was worth it for me because I just I

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.949 
was worth it for me because I just I
just<00:06:36.209> like<00:06:36.750> this<00:06:36.990> pose<00:06:37.349> and<00:06:37.830> everything<00:06:38.959> it's

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:39.959 
just like this pose and everything it's

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:41.239 
just like this pose and everything it's

pretty

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:44.389 
pretty
I'm<00:06:41.339> using<00:06:42.229> and<00:06:43.229> I<00:06:43.379> just<00:06:43.619> like<00:06:43.799> to<00:06:43.949> have<00:06:44.159> it

I'm using and I just like to have it

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:48.459 
I'm using and I just like to have it
sitting<00:06:45.119> on<00:06:45.389> the<00:06:45.569> top<00:06:45.809> of<00:06:46.019> my<00:06:46.229> bookshelf<00:06:46.799> just
