00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.000 
I say we started very well we're moving
it<00:00:39.989> around<00:00:40.050> quite<00:00:40.350> well<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> picture<00:00:40.829> is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
it around quite well the picture is

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.889 
it around quite well the picture is
pretty<00:00:41.100> tricky<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.760> managed<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.510> create<00:00:42.719> for

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
pretty tricky but managed to create for

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.900 
pretty tricky but managed to create for
your<00:00:43.020> child<00:00:43.200> Susan<00:00:43.530> took<00:00:44.309> her<00:00:44.460> foot<00:00:44.640> off<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
your child Susan took her foot off the

your child Susan took her foot off the
gas<00:00:45.030> for<00:00:45.300> whatever<00:00:45.510> reason<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.440> know<00:00:46.559> get

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
gas for whatever reason and you know get

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.380 
gas for whatever reason and you know get
got<00:00:47.190> them<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> fold<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.969> game<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
got them a fold in the game and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.959 
got them a fold in the game and
obviously<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.620> gets<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> crowd<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
obviously that gets the crowd up and and

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.630 
obviously that gets the crowd up and and
the<00:00:51.840> most<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.199> ride<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.379> way<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:52.710> even

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the most to ride that way but even

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.639 
the most to ride that way but even
second<00:00:54.000> afternoon<00:00:54.510> 30<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.020> chances<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
second afternoon 30 in the chances and

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
second afternoon 30 in the chances and
you<00:00:55.860> know<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> panel<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.390> harsh<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.690> I

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you know the panel is so harsh and I

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.439 
you know the panel is so harsh and I
think<00:00:58.079> he's<00:00:58.230> two<00:00:58.680> yards<00:00:58.980> away<00:00:59.039> from<00:00:59.370> him<00:00:59.520> he's

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
think he's two yards away from him he's

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.500 
think he's two yards away from him he's
one<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.719> ours<00:01:00.930> would<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.940> wiser<00:01:02.940> disappointed

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
one of ours would be wiser disappointed

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
one of ours would be wiser disappointed
now<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:03.899> need<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.140> make<00:01:04.260> sure<00:01:04.290> look

the<00:01:35.820> circle<00:01:36.119> was<00:01:36.240> probably<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.570> book<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the circle was probably a book in a

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.319 
the circle was probably a book in a
caravan<00:01:37.170> brusa<00:01:37.530> first<00:01:37.710> one<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:39.210> know

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
caravan brusa first one but you know

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.219 
caravan brusa first one but you know
it's<00:01:39.420> always<00:01:39.509> gonna<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:39.780> tough<00:01:39.930> when<00:01:40.049> he<00:01:40.140> got

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it's always gonna be tough when he got

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.920

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
out at undetermined there and then the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.230 
out at undetermined there and then the
second<00:01:43.200> luck<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.530> he's<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> couple<00:01:44.850> yards<00:01:45.030> away

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
second luck so he's a couple yards away

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.800 
second luck so he's a couple yards away
from<00:01:45.360> his<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:47.250> know<00:01:47.399> any1<00:01:48.180> kicks<00:01:48.720> the
