what<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> shambler<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.670> apparently<00:00:21.420> George

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
what a shambler is apparently George

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.689 
what a shambler is apparently George
Romero<00:00:22.320> coined<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> term<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.340> I'm<00:00:23.400> degreeing

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
Romero coined the term and I'm degreeing

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.550 
Romero coined the term and I'm degreeing
this<00:00:23.850> off<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> wiki<00:00:24.359> page<00:00:24.570> well<00:00:24.960> not<00:00:25.170> actively

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
this off the wiki page well not actively

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.950 
this off the wiki page well not actively
but<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.800> read<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.359> slow<00:00:27.630> walking

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
but I read it and it's a slow walking

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.900 
but I read it and it's a slow walking
zombie<00:00:28.560> that's<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.640> apparently

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
zombie that's all it is so apparently

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.700 
zombie that's all it is so apparently
the<00:00:30.300> zombies<00:00:30.630> were<00:00:30.750> already<00:00:31.080> attacking<00:00:31.470> with

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the zombies were already attacking with

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.410 
the zombies were already attacking with
tougher<00:00:31.980> was<00:00:32.130> controlling<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> zombies<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
tougher was controlling the zombies and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.180 
tougher was controlling the zombies and
they<00:00:33.450> were<00:00:33.930> attacking<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.680> group<00:00:35.010> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
they were attacking this group and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.440 
they were attacking this group and
that's<00:00:35.340> why<00:00:35.520> they<00:00:35.760> refer<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.210> them<00:00:36.360> as

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that's why they refer to them as

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.420 
that's why they refer to them as
shambler<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.170> there's<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> quick<00:00:38.250> update

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
shambler so there's just a quick update

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.360 
shambler so there's just a quick update
and<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.809> seems<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.200> me<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.620> nuketown<00:00:41.100> is

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
and what seems to me is that nuketown is

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.850 
and what seems to me is that nuketown is
going<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.329> same<00:00:42.510> time<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.840> moon<00:00:43.079> which<00:00:43.739> is

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
going on at same time as moon which is

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.470 
going on at same time as moon which is
going<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.370> same<00:00:44.520> time<00:00:44.760> as<00:00:44.820> transit

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
going on at the same time as transit

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.819 
going on at the same time as transit
right<00:00:46.050> as<00:00:46.260> moon<00:00:46.800> ends<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.910> takes<00:00:48.210> over

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
right as moon ends and takes over

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.770 
right as moon ends and takes over
nuketown<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.890> happening<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.969> near<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.570> end

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
nuketown is happening and near the end

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.160 
nuketown is happening and near the end
of<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.190> end<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.850> newtown<00:00:54.329> transit

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
of and at the end of newtown transit

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.930 
of and at the end of newtown transit
begins<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.890> seems<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.309> our<00:00:56.399> storyline

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
begins that seems to be our storyline

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.389 
begins that seems to be our storyline
that<00:00:57.390> seems<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.379> line<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.859> progression

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that seems to be the line of progression

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.260 
that seems to be the line of progression
now<00:00:59.789> another<00:01:00.410> quote<00:01:01.410> yes<00:01:01.710> quote<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.520> had

earlier<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.960> about<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> flesh<00:01:04.619> where<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
earlier was about the flesh where the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.440 
earlier was about the flesh where the
guy<00:01:05.100> says<00:01:05.400> I'll<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.000> I'll<00:01:06.210> do<00:01:06.330> it

for<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> flesh<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.260> was<00:01:08.250> absent-minded

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
for the flesh and I was absent-minded

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.520 
for the flesh and I was absent-minded
during<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.390> commentary<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.080> did<00:01:10.350> not

Ben<00:01:42.299> did<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.729> he<00:01:44.729> was<00:01:44.820> showing<00:01:45.000> us<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
Ben did it and he was showing us in the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.030 
Ben did it and he was showing us in the
game<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.200> played<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> little<00:01:46.560> game<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.860> him

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
game I played a little game with him

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.139 
game I played a little game with him
probably<00:01:47.220> some<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> game<00:01:47.759> plays<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
probably some of the game plays in the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.700 
probably some of the game plays in the
background<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.540> hear<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.869> live<00:01:49.079> com<00:01:49.380> seems

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
background you hear that live com seems

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.649 
background you hear that live com seems
like<00:01:49.829> at<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> audio<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.909> zeroes

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
like at the audio for that and zeroes

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.240 
like at the audio for that and zeroes
apparently<00:01:52.079> sending<00:01:52.409> me<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> audio<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.220> his

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
apparently sending me the audio for his

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.940 
apparently sending me the audio for his
game<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.880> we're<00:01:54.030> gonna<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.329> audio<00:01:54.780> come<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.320> I

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
game so we're gonna have audio come on I

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.859 
game so we're gonna have audio come on I
could<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.189> more<00:01:56.399> videos<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.000> now<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.390> don't

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
could have more videos and now I don't

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.209 
could have more videos and now I don't
have<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.049> make<00:01:58.170> up<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.350> all<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.590> lost<00:01:58.770> video

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
have to make up for all that lost video

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.300 
have to make up for all that lost video
footage<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.119> once<00:02:00.420> had<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.840> that's<00:02:01.020> great

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310

by play the game and nowhere is there
any<00:02:32.700> extra<00:02:33.060> steps<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.900> easter<00:02:34.260> egg<00:02:34.380> inside

any extra steps of the easter egg inside
the<00:02:35.010> code<00:02:35.340> there<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.700> nothing<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.420> do<00:02:36.570> with<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
the code there is nothing to do with the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.600 
the code there is nothing to do with the
nav<00:02:36.990> cards<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.530> further<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.160> easter<00:02:38.490> egg

inside the coding the game coding is

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.350 
inside the coding the game coding is
final<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:41.340> what<00:02:41.550> we're<00:02:41.760> looking<00:02:42.000> at<00:02:42.150> is

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
final so what we're looking at is

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.220 
final so what we're looking at is
another<00:02:42.690> ascension<00:02:44.060> I'll<00:02:45.060> do<00:02:45.300> more<00:02:45.510> debunking
