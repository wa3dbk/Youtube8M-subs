00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:28.290
 and that there are many good youtube partners 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.180
 they were asking what and what was going on with 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.149
 about violence because I maintain 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.210
 activated and that is an answer 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.510
 I wanted to make a video for that and the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.329
 answer is that in the gears 2 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.910
 Well, I do not know if you noticed it, no, 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.230
 I do not know the truth but when I killed 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.300
 its coast waiting to find someone 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.170
 intrigue of many players were passing 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.940
 certain things how are you there bot tab 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.730
 blood that was exploding right now did not happen 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.730
 but it happened that you kill them 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.530
 kill the character that is treating me 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.840
 of pigeon good if you kill is not x 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.370
 people and this had there part where 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.670
 splashes you with all the blood and that 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.330
 Blood filled the screen 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.330
 stain goes all 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.119
 but it does not usually happen that that of that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.520
 thing and that's why the reason 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.460
 remove because I had to for example 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.800
 I was in a fight and by chance this one 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.660
 I did not get all killed one 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.790
 but it exploded and there was no other for the 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.820
 blood that was then was what 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.490
 I did from the violence so that I do not know 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.020
 they see march to the screen all of blood 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.380
 when I was fighting against a 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.700
 player will get 2x players that's the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.700
 true reason 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.020
 is the problem 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.100
 when I had never tried to explain 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.840
 but if it's the real reason and it's what 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.930
 unique by the violence games more 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.660
 because they do not leave me more for requirements and 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.510
 they invented nothing not after that's why it's 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.790
 by the reason of the blood that in 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.100
 the iron was getting in the way and in fact yesterday 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.500
 is the study when in times 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.130
 time with violence here is that I 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.010
 I liked it but I took it away because he 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.230
 it made me better like those who are 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:45.090
 reasons but he understood the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.239
 reason if I have explained myself well that is 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.850
 all 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:54.590
 videos but you liked it and you know 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.590
 do not do the next video until later
