00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.050
 hello how are you today we are going to prepare 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.420
 a great recipe for the days that 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.970
 we are more tired bored than not 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.679
 we want to do a lot and, above all, very 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.300
 recommended for teenagers who already 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.859
 you know they like sandwiches a lot 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.990
 and this is a very good option for 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.179
 replace it look let's prepare a 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.359
 corn tortilla with a little ham 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.710
 serrano and let's also put a little 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.130
 of mozzarella cheese that is going to give 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.980
 much juiciness to the plate and we're going to 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.200
 add a little bit of arugula and 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.650
 we will add a lot more fiber to the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.990
 we'll go to the plate and you'll see that 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.320
 have secrets let's light a 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.320
 bit 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.110
 the fire and let's start to heat the 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.090
 pancake 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.220
 What it is the secret for neither the 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.010
 true because we will simply sing the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.620
 once heated pancake we will put a 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.600
 little bit of mozzarella we will add the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.490
 ham and finally the arugula we will give 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.230
 a heat stroke and we will get a 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.710
 calentito bocata 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.710
 delicious 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.590
 so let's add the ham a little 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.140
 cut to pieces 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:22.340
 so that later it does not cost us 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.340
 chew it I cut the ham 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.990
 let's go for the mozzarella 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.030
 the mozzarella if it is very cold 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.310
 better because it will be juicier 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.700
 that is, we already distribute them by the 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.700
 sandwich 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.810
 As you can see, you can also take it 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.360
 outside 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.909
 It can be a very good option for 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.090
 take to work and finally we're going to 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.020
 put 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.020
 the null 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.890
 You see that the elaboration process is 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.730
 very simple and 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.350
 we already have it mounted 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:14.040
 and we would just have to turn it around 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.040
 close it by the sides 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.420
 for escapes 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.640
 we give you a little spin here 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:34.080
 and finally warm up again 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.080
 let's go there put it to the pan 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.379
 we wait for you to warm a little 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.379
 we will look 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.459
 I think that today very simple 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.459
 the fish is shown and is more 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.120
 we hold a little bit so that it does not 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.120
 open 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.260
 and already warm once we can put 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.269
 on the plate 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.670
 we can take the precaution of closing it 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.629
 so that we look good pretty 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.629
 we can put a toothpick 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.580
 and as a final touch 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.470
 to give a colored dot if you want 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.210
 present what is is a night of 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.500
 friends to watch football or some 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.150
 match 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.150
 we put a little bit of it 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.220
 more muscle to color the dish 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.220
 plus 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.470
 and a little salt 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.420
 a little of oil 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.950
 and great we would have a plate 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.820
 perfect for those nights that we do not 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.820
 fancy cooked
