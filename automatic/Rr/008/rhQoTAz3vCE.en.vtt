00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.320 

thin<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.680> lightweight<00:00:28.980> as<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:29.849> see<00:00:30.000> one

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
thin and lightweight as you can see one

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.010 
thin and lightweight as you can see one
piece<00:00:32.360> it's<00:00:33.360> got<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> wide<00:00:34.350> groove<00:00:35.840> which<00:00:36.840> isn't

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
piece it's got a wide groove which isn't

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.290 
piece it's got a wide groove which isn't
too<00:00:37.320> close<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> boot<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:39.000> far<00:00:39.180> as

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
too close to the boot because as far as

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.389 
too close to the boot because as far as
I'm<00:00:39.420> concerned<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.140> backslide<00:00:40.890> tricks<00:00:41.129> it's

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
I'm concerned for backslide tricks it's

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.770 
I'm concerned for backslide tricks it's
best<00:00:41.610> if<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.850> really<00:00:42.239> close<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> boot

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
best if it's really close to the boot

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.080 
best if it's really close to the boot
and<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.770> talks<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.370> tricks<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:44.789> bear<00:00:45.000> if

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
and for talks like tricks as bear if

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.880 
and for talks like tricks as bear if
it's<00:00:45.210> far<00:00:45.390> away<00:00:45.510> from<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.809> boot<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.289> we've

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it's far away from the boot so we've

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.709 
it's far away from the boot so we've
gone<00:00:47.070> exactly<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.090> between<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.879> I'm

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
gone exactly in between and so I'm

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.000 
gone exactly in between and so I'm
guessing<00:00:52.199> these<00:00:52.289> are<00:00:52.410> gonna<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.620> amazing<00:00:52.860> for

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
guessing these are gonna be amazing for

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.580 
guessing these are gonna be amazing for
talk<00:00:53.190> slides<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.640> amazing<00:00:53.969> for<00:00:54.090> back<00:00:54.239> slides

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
talk slides and amazing for back slides

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.750 
talk slides and amazing for back slides
wide<00:00:55.590> groove<00:00:55.860> which<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.160> good<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.460> savanna

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
wide groove which is good for savanna

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.900 
wide groove which is good for savanna
tricks<00:00:58.039> we<00:00:59.039> research<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.640> loads<00:00:59.820> of

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
tricks we research the loads of

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.069 
tricks we research the loads of
different<00:01:00.030> plastics<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.750> they're<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
different plastics so they're going to

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.460 
different plastics so they're going to
be<00:01:01.140> fast<00:01:01.410> faster<00:01:02.129> Souls<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.030> see<00:01:03.470> it's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
be fast faster Souls as you can see it's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.600 
be fast faster Souls as you can see it's
got<00:01:04.619> two<00:01:04.830> slightly<00:01:05.189> raised<00:01:07.490> parts<00:01:08.490> which

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
got two slightly raised parts which

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.600 
got two slightly raised parts which
means<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.150> soleplate<00:01:09.600> has

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.460 

see<00:01:13.210> salt<00:01:13.960> plates<00:01:14.110> gonna<00:01:14.260> have<00:01:14.440> a<00:01:14.470> longer<00:01:14.770> life

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
see salt plates gonna have a longer life

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.760 
see salt plates gonna have a longer life
also<00:01:17.470> it's<00:01:18.040> almost<00:01:18.310> flat<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:19.510> not<00:01:20.350> too<00:01:20.530> wide

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
also it's almost flat and not too wide

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.530 
also it's almost flat and not too wide
which<00:01:21.010> means<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:21.520> for<00:01:21.730> ledge<00:01:21.910> tricks<00:01:22.240> it's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
which means that for ledge tricks it's

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.420 
which means that for ledge tricks it's
gonna<00:01:22.750> you<00:01:23.020> can<00:01:23.170> hold<00:01:23.620> them<00:01:23.770> for<00:01:23.980> ages<00:01:24.070> because

standing up on your tricks and it's got
a<00:01:35.650> flat<00:01:35.890> edge<00:01:36.130> which<00:01:36.370> means<00:01:36.580> it's<00:01:36.700> gonna<00:01:36.790> be

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
a flat edge which means it's gonna be

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.370 
a flat edge which means it's gonna be
balanced<00:01:37.450> really<00:01:37.750> good<00:01:37.960> especially<00:01:38.200> for

ledge<00:01:38.650> tricks<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.280> flat<00:01:40.210> edge<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.660> not<00:01:41.260> too

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
ledge tricks and flat edge and not too

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.980 
ledge tricks and flat edge and not too
deep<00:01:41.710> groove<00:01:42.040> also<00:01:42.490> is<00:01:42.580> great<00:01:42.880> for<00:01:43.180> switch<00:01:43.750> ups

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
deep groove also is great for switch ups

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.100 
deep groove also is great for switch ups
like<00:01:44.910> rails<00:01:45.910> or<00:01:46.240> tricks<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:46.690> backslide

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
like rails or tricks and backslide

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.860 
like rails or tricks and backslide
tricks<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.680> talk<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:48.040> tricks<00:01:48.280> because<00:01:48.870> it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
tricks and talk to tricks because it

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.100 
tricks and talk to tricks because it
doesn't<00:01:50.140> have<00:01:50.260> to<00:01:51.540> look<00:01:52.540> out<00:01:52.750> stuff<00:01:55.110> basically

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
doesn't have to look out stuff basically

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.390 
doesn't have to look out stuff basically
I<00:01:56.140> reckon<00:01:56.500> this<00:01:56.620> is<00:01:56.650> going<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:56.920> be<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.070> perfect

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
I reckon this is going to be the perfect

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.650 
I reckon this is going to be the perfect
soleplate<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:57.970> now<00:01:58.119> I'm<00:01:58.180> going<00:01:58.300> to<00:01:58.360> test<00:01:58.510> it

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
soleplate and now I'm going to test it

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.300 
soleplate and now I'm going to test it
out<00:01:58.750> as<00:01:59.229> you<00:01:59.350> can<00:01:59.380> see<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.650> does<00:01:59.800> have<00:01:59.830> a<00:02:00.040> couple

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
grind okay basically I'm gonna explain

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.350 
grind okay basically I'm gonna explain
to<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.310> why<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:20.550> think<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:20.880> is<00:03:21.000> gonna<00:03:21.120> be<00:03:21.209> good

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
to you why I think this is gonna be good

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.020 
to you why I think this is gonna be good
on<00:03:21.480> ledges<00:03:21.860> it's<00:03:22.860> not<00:03:23.070> too<00:03:23.220> wide<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.820> it's

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
on ledges it's not too wide and it's

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.360 
on ledges it's not too wide and it's
flat<00:03:24.300> what<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.410> means<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.830> when<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.010> bend

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
flat what that means is when you bend

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.790 
flat what that means is when you bend
over<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.790> bone<00:03:27.030> over<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.480> touch<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.290> plate<00:03:28.530> on

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
over a bone over and touch the plate on

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.040 
over a bone over and touch the plate on
the<00:03:29.100> ledge<00:03:29.250> your<00:03:30.180> wheels<00:03:30.360> won't<00:03:30.540> be<00:03:30.720> rolling

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
the ledge your wheels won't be rolling

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.259 
the ledge your wheels won't be rolling
so<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:31.380> can<00:03:31.500> have<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:31.830> your<00:03:32.010> balance<00:03:32.370> back

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
so you can have all your balance back

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.680 
so you can have all your balance back
holding<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.310> weight<00:03:38.330> completely<00:03:39.330> on

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
holding on to the weight completely on

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.800 
holding on to the weight completely on
the<00:03:39.810> ledge<00:03:39.930> all<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.709> weight<00:03:40.860> at<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.190> back<00:03:41.810> and

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
the ledge all the weight at the back and

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.680 
the ledge all the weight at the back and
a<00:03:43.019> wheel<00:03:43.200> still<00:03:43.410> roll<00:03:44.900> that<00:03:45.900> means<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:47.690> that

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
a wheel still roll that means that that

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.120 
a wheel still roll that means that that
means<00:03:48.959> what<00:03:49.170> does<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.470> mean<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.950> means

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
means what does that mean that means

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.360 
means what does that mean that means
that<00:03:50.900> there<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:51.930> no<00:03:52.290> friction<00:03:52.590> which<00:03:53.130> means

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
that there is no friction which means

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.479 
that there is no friction which means
you<00:03:53.459> were<00:03:53.549> sliding<00:03:53.970> like<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.329> Mother<00:03:54.660> Hubbard
