like<00:04:53.530> this<00:04:53.680> open<00:04:54.220> playing<00:04:54.940> space<00:04:55.480> where

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
like this open playing space where

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.540 
like this open playing space where
developers<00:04:56.380> can<00:04:56.470> have<00:04:56.770> full<00:04:56.980> access<00:04:57.130> to

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
almost everything and that might sound a

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.020 
almost everything and that might sound a
bit<00:04:59.440> nerdy<00:04:59.740> but<00:04:59.980> actually<00:05:00.400> it<00:05:00.490> makes<00:05:00.669> a<00:05:00.850> great

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
bit nerdy but actually it makes a great

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.970 
bit nerdy but actually it makes a great
experience<00:05:01.540> for<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:01.930> consumer<00:05:02.110> because<00:05:02.830> it

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
experience for the consumer because it

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.980 
experience for the consumer because it
