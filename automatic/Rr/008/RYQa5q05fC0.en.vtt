00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.630 
was difficult for me at first I would
never<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.960> know<00:00:19.080> go<00:00:19.949> outside<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.490> house

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
would be a hundred and five degrees and

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.870 
would be a hundred and five degrees and
he's<00:00:27.029> like<00:00:27.210> why<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.420> he<00:00:27.660> wearing<00:00:27.869> sweats<00:00:28.380> I

he's like why is he wearing sweats I

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.400 
he's like why is he wearing sweats I
just<00:00:29.880> wouldn't<00:00:30.119> want<00:00:30.179> anybody<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.199> but

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
just wouldn't want anybody to see it but

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.160 
just wouldn't want anybody to see it but
you<00:00:31.470> know<00:00:31.619> now<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.700> find<00:00:32.930> what<00:00:33.930> wounds

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
you know now I so find what wounds

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.220 
you know now I so find what wounds
things<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.710> help<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.399> remember<00:00:36.140> where<00:00:37.140> you

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
things that help you remember where you

things that help you remember where you
came<00:00:37.410> from<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.160> obviously<00:00:38.430> where<00:00:38.579> I

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
came from and this is obviously where I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.069 
came from and this is obviously where I
had<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> hundred<00:00:39.230> staples<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.350> my<00:00:40.440> leg<00:00:40.670> here<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
had a hundred staples in my leg here and

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.470 
had a hundred staples in my leg here and
then<00:00:43.079> uh<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.500> know<00:00:43.680> had<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> tendon<00:00:44.250> transfer

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
then uh you know had a tendon transfer

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
then uh you know had a tendon transfer
transfer<00:00:45.480> whether<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.649> scar<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.370> my

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
transfer whether I have a scar on my

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.380 
transfer whether I have a scar on my
foot

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
foot

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.990 
foot
all<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.690> way<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:49.579> because<00:00:50.579> that's<00:00:50.789> where

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
all the way up here because that's where

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.700 
all the way up here because that's where
you<00:00:51.329> know<00:00:51.420> when<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.600> walk<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.379> was<00:00:52.500> probably

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
you know when I walk that was probably

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.119 
you know when I walk that was probably
the<00:00:52.890> most<00:00:54.140> hindering<00:00:55.140> injury<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> really<00:00:55.920> had

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the most hindering injury I really had

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
the most hindering injury I really had
even<00:00:56.969> though<00:00:57.030> my<00:00:57.180> knee<00:00:57.510> hurts<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.649> know

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
even though my knee hurts but you know

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.549 
even though my knee hurts but you know
when<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.460> dislocated<00:00:59.820> my<00:01:00.149> knee<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.719> tore<00:01:01.140> my

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
when I dislocated my knee I tore my

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.920 
when I dislocated my knee I tore my
peroneal<00:01:02.039> nerve<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:03.180> told<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.600> before

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
peroneal nerve and I told you before

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.870 
peroneal nerve and I told you before
that<00:01:03.960> nerve<00:01:04.530> gives<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.070> an<00:01:05.129> ability<00:01:05.220> not<00:01:05.640> only

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that nerve gives you an ability not only

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.840 
that nerve gives you an ability not only
does<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.030> work<00:01:06.360> out<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.500> outside

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
does it work out like this outside

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.800 
does it work out like this outside
muscle<00:01:08.850> your<00:01:09.060> leg<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> don't<00:01:09.689> have

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
muscle your leg that I don't have

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.280 
muscle your leg that I don't have
anymore

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
anymore

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.679 
anymore
it's<00:01:10.680> atrophied<00:01:11.159> away<00:01:11.580> because<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.479> nerve

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
it's atrophied away because that nerve

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.780 
it's atrophied away because that nerve
doesn't<00:01:12.930> activate<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:14.130> also<00:01:14.280> helps<00:01:14.700> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
doesn't activate it it also helps you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.179 
doesn't activate it it also helps you
pick<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.210> your<00:01:15.360> foot<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.890> know<00:01:17.009> they

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
pick up your foot so you know they

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.969 
pick up your foot so you know they
reattach<00:01:17.610> my<00:01:17.640> nerve<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.650> were<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.860> take

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
reattach my nerve so if I were to take

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.789 
reattach my nerve so if I were to take
my<00:01:20.040> foot<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.729> pull<00:01:21.570> my<00:01:21.720> foot<00:01:22.020> inward<00:01:22.560> like

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
my foot and pull my foot inward like

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.660 
my foot and pull my foot inward like
this<00:01:23.100> right<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:24.390> tendon<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.340> this<00:01:26.340> side<00:01:26.520> they

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
this right that tendon on this side they

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.330 
this right that tendon on this side they
cut<00:01:26.970> off<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.330> bone<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.900> they<00:01:28.770> transfer<00:01:29.220> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
cut off the bone and they transfer that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.450 
cut off the bone and they transfer that
to<00:01:29.579> top<00:01:29.970> my<00:01:30.270> foot<00:01:30.740> say<00:01:31.740> muscle<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.159> allows<00:01:32.310> you

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
to top my foot say muscle it allows you

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.010 
to top my foot say muscle it allows you
to<00:01:32.520> pull<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:32.850> foot<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:33.689> my<00:01:33.810> right

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
to pull your foot up so with my right

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.990 
to pull your foot up so with my right
foot<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.380> about<00:01:34.770> pulling<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.759> when<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
foot I think about pulling up when I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.550 
foot I think about pulling up when I
walk<00:01:36.270> with<00:01:36.509> my<00:01:36.570> left<00:01:36.900> foot<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.110> think<00:01:37.200> about

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
walk with my left foot I think about

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.429 
walk with my left foot I think about
pulling<00:01:37.950> inward<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> think<00:01:39.990> about<00:01:40.170> pulling

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
pulling inward so I think about pulling

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.560 
pulling inward so I think about pulling
this<00:01:40.590> way<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:40.829> essentially<00:01:41.369> when<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.610> walk<00:01:41.880> it's

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
this way so essentially when I walk it's

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.460 
this way so essentially when I walk it's
like<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.270> mean<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.810> retrain<00:01:46.350> yourself

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
like this so I mean to retrain yourself

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.590 
like this so I mean to retrain yourself
how<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.860> walk<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.119> then<00:01:48.210> let<00:01:48.360> alone

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
how to walk like that and then let alone

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.710 
how to walk like that and then let alone
try<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> run<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.240> then<00:01:51.390> just

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
try to run like that and then just

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
try to run like that and then just
before<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.740> becomes<00:01:53.070> secondhand<00:01:53.460> nature<00:01:53.790> it

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
before it becomes secondhand nature it

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.630 
before it becomes secondhand nature it
took<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.119> long<00:01:54.360> time
