 so we have tenshinhan here the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.090
 salesman told me that it may be a 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.900

 not mentioned here we have piccolo 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.230
 yamcha and sangoku and I do not think so 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.540

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.180

 form of Lego with a crystal ball 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.930
 it seems yard is what we can have 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.689
 so we'll all stop there 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.840
 crystal balls and that's so it's 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.290
 chris evans latest dragon ball dragon 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.970
 no we are likely to have balls 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.530

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.659
 passions with land so we'll see 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.049
 here we are going to suffer from having the trident 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.869
 we will leave the best for the end 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.659

 I built them that still 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.490

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.540
 update 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.940
 it gives more or less that so here I am 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.130
 want to move on to the next one which is the one 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:13.160
 from tenshinhan we find ourselves all the south 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:16.280
 we always have the same back on the 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.200
 little the cards so the map of 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.200
 testing and it will smile that 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.760
 always too map imagine so we 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:37.870
 try to tennisman still sung-hwan and 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:41.530
 the krill a weird here the figurine of 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.360
 trencin I 'm going to open that and we get 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.430
 find direct after the cut and the 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.340
 final customer finished with his little 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.560
 number 5 crystal ball 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.030
 hop a little update and so here 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.060
 we move on to the next one, which is 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.060
 san gohan to a resource and the sun 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.290
 is the video not too 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.670
 disgusting that exchanged camera I do 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.870
 a little of anything is 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:11.920
 but then you'll excuse me 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:21.160
 cards on three cards I imagine 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:24.670
 she's still here john terry jinan 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.760
 and again the crip so here is the solgan 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.100
 finished with his sword and we received 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.720
 still one of crystal so we have 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.370
 received the same so the number 5 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.830
 except with its little base a little 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.310
 different and in this box we received 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.500
 the card 2 sangohan of autumn shinhan and 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.690
 the price one in great turtle mode 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.100
 so here we go immediately to the 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.830
 next who's going to be the piccolo box 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.870
 go to all here is the head of piccolo 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.450
 who really has a weird head and I have 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.720
 found a thread 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.620
 look at his arms he has a color 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.200
 white 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.170
 so it's a bit of a fact my big part 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.420
 and was received with fireball 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.010
 number 3 and in poker we knew 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.440
 three more cards 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.230
 so we received the piccolo the sangohan and 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.060
 the supposedly vegetated and so here we go 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.010
 tackle the national tea box and 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.770
 we find everything is the figurine 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:26.230
 diam's finished that's pretty pretty I 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.240
 finds with his little sword set to 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.790
 point 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.580
 here and we received the crystal ball 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.650
 number 6 with another base so we get 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.960
 mocks a little harder 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.830
 years so I show you for now 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.990
 because we had 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:45.840
 hop hop and here we will tackle the top 3 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.870
 you are three best too so we 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.690
 will save this box first that of 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.050
 krill a modified mode with turtle 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.120
 great 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.840
 so I tell you all between the cards 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.500
 So we got Yam'Tcha senghor and green 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.970
 awesome ended with his stick his 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.030
 beard and its shell 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.970
 so I think it's pretty good 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.199
 but a little worry we received the same 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.000
 crystal ball we had already received 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.610
 so the number 2 3 so I both times 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.440
 and March 4th, it's always 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.449
 even the great tortoise yamcha and 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.740
 piccolo that these two cases so we're going 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.830
 start with the plant and we will 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.660
 finish with san goku here is up and has 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.849
 finished good there is a little weird he has 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.650
 a head a little chelou with a sword 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:32.729
 laser at price in hollow in star wars 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:34.380
 when they created and then we lifted 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:36.270
 throw with a new ball of 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.680
 crystal number two so I it's 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.160
 rather nice then again the same 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.919
 map 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.639
 so we have the so-called vegeta the 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:45.840
 sangoku and the weird funky turtle 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.099
 go we find ourselves for the last 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.229
 box which is that of saint bauzille 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:51.000
 adana figurines finished so that's the one 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:54.090
 of sangoku with his little stick behind 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.099
 and we received the number crystal ball 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.630
 one that you there so it's perfect 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:00.599
 shame we do not have the 4 but it's not 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.090
 serious and with that we received these three 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:04.039
 cards there so his piccolo goku and the 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.330
 vegetal 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:09.330
 I hope the video still has you 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:11.250
 more tell me in the comments of 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.099
 what you thought good I think 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.419
 that the editing is going to be a little weird 

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.320
 but well tell me in the comments 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:17.940
 and then it's been a long time since I 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.320
 no video on youtube 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.880
 so that was all for me that time 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.880
 and old charles everyone
