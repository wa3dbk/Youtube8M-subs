burns quickly and the front end feel is

burns quickly and the front end feel is
very<00:01:33.900> very<00:01:34.350> nice<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:38.280> front<00:01:38.610> suspension<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.330> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
very very nice the front suspension is a

WP suspension it's the same as on duke
390<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.810> travel<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.470> bike<00:01:43.680> has

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.040 
390 but then the travel on this bike has
been<00:01:44.040> reduced<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> most<00:01:45.270> differ<00:01:45.660> feel<00:01:45.900> at

been reduced for a most differ feel at

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.380 
been reduced for a most differ feel at

the front the rear suspension once again

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.480 
the front the rear suspension once again
it's<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.750> same<00:01:48.780> as<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.440> Duke<00:01:49.650> 390<00:01:49.920> but

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it's the same as on the Duke 390 but

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.340 
it's the same as on the Duke 390 but
then<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:51.000> gets<00:01:51.360> preload<00:01:51.840> adjustments

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
then this one gets preload adjustments

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.050 
then this one gets preload adjustments
even<00:01:52.650> though<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.250> front<00:01:53.520> forks<00:01:53.790> are<00:01:53.910> not

even though the front forks are not

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.630 
even though the front forks are not
adjustable<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.230> they<00:01:55.410> feel<00:01:55.620> very<00:01:55.830> planted<00:01:56.430> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
adjustable so they feel very planted and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.850 
adjustable so they feel very planted and
even<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.330> you<00:01:57.450> jam<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.050> brakes<00:01:58.230> since<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
even if you jam on the brakes since the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.250 
even if you jam on the brakes since the
front<00:01:59.130> end<00:01:59.340> dive<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.030> very<00:02:00.270> progressive<00:02:00.540> the

brakes on this bike they are most

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.730 
brakes on this bike they are most
definitely<00:02:02.910> very<00:02:03.630> adequate<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.410> sort<00:02:04.650> of

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
speeds that the bike can do and then of

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.530 
speeds that the bike can do and then of
course<00:02:06.750> there's<00:02:07.140> also<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.800> safety<00:02:08.040> net<00:02:08.340> of

MRF<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.010> bit<00:02:20.760> jittery<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.750> first<00:02:21.930> few

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
MRF so a bit jittery in the first few

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:31.890 
MRF so a bit jittery in the first few
laps<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.709> RC<00:02:23.520> 200

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.289 

this<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.260> gearbox<00:02:33.500> exactly<00:02:34.370> same<00:02:34.640> as<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.879> Duke

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
this this gearbox exactly same as a Duke

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.470 
this this gearbox exactly same as a Duke
390<00:02:35.569> okay<00:02:36.319> along<00:02:36.950> corners<00:02:37.310> like<00:02:37.909> one<00:02:38.239> care<00:02:38.450> is

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
390 okay along corners like one care is

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.030 
390 okay along corners like one care is
never<00:02:38.750> enough<00:02:39.079> no<00:02:39.110> matter<00:02:39.470> what<00:02:39.709> gear<00:02:39.920> you

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
never enough no matter what gear you

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.979 
never enough no matter what gear you
choose<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:40.730> have<00:02:40.939> to<00:02:41.120> shift<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
choose you have to shift it in the

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.890 
choose you have to shift it in the
corner<00:02:42.349> okay<00:02:42.739> that's<00:02:43.430> because<00:02:43.879> this<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.629> a

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
corner okay that's because this is a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.990 
corner okay that's because this is a
375cc<00:02:45.620> engine<00:02:46.250> which<00:02:46.459> has<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.700> lot<00:02:46.970> of

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
375cc engine which has a lot of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.270 
375cc engine which has a lot of
mid-range<00:02:47.569> but<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.319> believe<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.709> has<00:02:48.829> no<00:02:49.010> top

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
mid-range but I believe it has no top

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.839 
mid-range but I believe it has no top
end<00:02:49.519> of<00:02:49.670> race<00:02:50.299> bike<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:51.650> once<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:52.400> pass<00:02:52.670> the

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
end of race bike so once you pass the

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.460 
end of race bike so once you pass the
mid-range<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.329> might<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.989> might<00:02:54.140> have<00:02:54.349> to

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
mid-range you might you might have to

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.599 
mid-range you might you might have to
shift<00:02:54.620> obviously<00:02:54.980> what<00:02:55.129> you<00:02:55.250> mean

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
shift obviously what you mean

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.309 
shift obviously what you mean
yeah<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:56.480> foot<00:02:56.659> pegs<00:02:56.870> were<00:02:57.019> scraping

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
yeah the foot pegs were scraping

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.059 
yeah the foot pegs were scraping
sometimes<00:02:58.069> they're<00:02:58.640> like<00:02:59.680> you<00:03:00.680> just<00:03:00.859> need<00:03:01.010> a

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
sometimes they're like you just need a

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.350 
sometimes they're like you just need a
rear

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.940 

coming<00:03:08.110> over<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.440> front<00:03:08.710> you<00:03:08.920> have

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
coming over to the front you have

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.400 
coming over to the front you have
projector<00:03:09.640> headlamps<00:03:10.000> very<00:03:10.540> handy<00:03:10.960> and<00:03:11.110> then

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
projector headlamps very handy and then

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.620 
projector headlamps very handy and then
also<00:03:11.650> DRL<00:03:12.310> now<00:03:12.850> could<00:03:13.210> be<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.330> thing<00:03:13.510> about

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
also DRL now could be a thing about

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.390 
also DRL now could be a thing about
these<00:03:13.870> VR<00:03:14.170> else<00:03:14.350> is<00:03:14.500> that<00:03:14.650> they're<00:03:15.070> not<00:03:15.160> always

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
these VR else is that they're not always

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.000 
these VR else is that they're not always
on<00:03:15.730> because<00:03:16.270> they<00:03:16.390> are<00:03:16.450> always<00:03:16.690> on<00:03:17.050> if<00:03:17.230> you

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
on because they are always on if you

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:29.330 
on because they are always on if you
happen<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.400> switch<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.940> button<00:03:19.300> on

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
now aggressive steering geometry usually

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.900 
now aggressive steering geometry usually
comes<00:03:32.500> with<00:03:32.680> a<00:03:32.740> trade-off<00:03:32.980> sacrificing

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
comes with a trade-off sacrificing

straight-line stability in a pipe but

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.040 
straight-line stability in a pipe but
then<00:03:36.100> I<00:03:36.190> pass<00:03:36.400> your<00:03:36.610> bets<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.210> rc390

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
then I pass your bets that the rc390

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.630 
then I pass your bets that the rc390
