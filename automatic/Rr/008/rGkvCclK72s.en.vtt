00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.309
 This brings us a global graphic design with a Brazilian stamp to the 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.570
 our collection was released on the comic book schedule 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.570
 temperature 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:24.409
 It's kind of a dream to make comics and such bring about this difficulty of understanding 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.409
 because the zero tariff even the ones that are happening 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.180
 the final was a project that 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.380
 I want to see I want to stay in Brazil in February in São Lourenço 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.390
 and elected what I do the goal 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.760
 however independent 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.270
 so independent what we did as a great joke of friends 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.410
 without justice and unpretentious that he did and in the correct end the general indicator 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 it's good 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.050
 have to do when the image of the sport with each other never wanted to make a 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.250
 style 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.440
 even he is not the first some of comics then the decent thing or will 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.760
 to do more seems like 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.180
 all the work I've done in my life has been 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.230
 had a faculty of literature do my work of completion 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.740
 everyone to shrink to the other the project the adaptation 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.649
 in Brazil the result account is the difference between the price and the other already 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.720
 discouraged and we do not know if there will be any truth will not become a 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.740
 tv series heroes i'm a fan of sousa among others brazil sub-17 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.240
 production that I do not think is the guy who makes ten of them is not the guy 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.990
 who takes care of the whole mourning 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.200
 the project was 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.549
 inside the costume until the scary scenario the color of the film 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.240
 to adapt to this Brazilian has nevertheless shown 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.240
 in terms of cinema 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.199
 I think he needs to have much more than that in Brazil promised market 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.720
 still need enough dengue 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.720
 dedication went on to say that commitment 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:16.429
 to try to do 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:19.429
 What Brazil has a face? 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.869
 there is one of the most respected bands of the new crop also if it were not 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.999
 national base paste is the classic between cinema and music 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:32.279
 the guys can not bring a feature film the promotion of their new 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.279
 album 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.249
 during the seven days with 2 in the first speech had already gone 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:45.769
 eleven people with 100 during 11 days the recording does not accuse was branson 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.359
 accused in very difficult situation 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.009
 but I think it has a rhythm of work that we can yes I think the 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.099
 camera and gas relations so have no problem strangling over 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.099
 of recordings 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.689
 but what else can you eat of all and certain or even 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.079
 inside this house that tells their story the prices have do 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.439
 in the most structured part in three episodes of medium and in what makes the 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:16.479
 band 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.069
 after the goal the blocks of interviews 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.069
 but we also have how was the recording 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.759
 also a little more competence conservation of the birds of the world 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.519
 free within the area but we also have as aggravated 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:46.519
 we see what 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.129
 could have the possibility of making more than a documentary whose film 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.129
 about recording the disc 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.549
 the public chooses to be well satisfied just like we do 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.449
 and will not fall cause a strangeness 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.449
 is experienced but neither is the public deficit 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:15.179
 nash 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:23.989
 the deadline for this to occur they put the conversation in 

00:04:23.989 --> 00:04:27.850
 country was ready but with the new way of promoting the program 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.009
 are for professionals and high voltage students 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.210
 as it is tendentially more creative and innovative is a waste of time
