it straight out number 14 this is it

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.590 
it straight out number 14 this is it
compared<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:44.500> this<00:03:44.680> is<00:03:44.830> 27<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:47.620> is<00:03:47.770> 14

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
compared so this is 27 and this is 14

00:03:48.600 --> 00:04:00.700 
compared so this is 27 and this is 14
and<00:03:50.400> this<00:03:51.400> is<00:03:51.580> it<00:03:51.760> shot<00:03:52.030> with<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:52.330> flash

see so I finally found it

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.220 
see so I finally found it
I<00:04:07.970> believe<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.349> color<00:04:10.349> 14<00:04:10.920> is<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:12.720> perfect

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
I believe that color 14 is the perfect

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.869 
I believe that color 14 is the perfect
shade<00:04:13.409> of<00:04:13.590> blonde<00:04:13.860> whether<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.459> have<00:04:14.610> light

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879

brown<00:04:15.120> medium<00:04:16.280> brown<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.850> if<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.090> have<00:04:18.180> dark

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.509 
brown medium brown and if you have dark
brown<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.930> can<00:04:18.959> certainly<00:04:19.500> integrate<00:04:19.799> this

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
brown you can certainly integrate this

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.560 
brown you can certainly integrate this
color<00:04:22.100> with<00:04:23.100> some<00:04:23.130> darker<00:04:23.729> shades<00:04:24.000> or<00:04:24.330> if<00:04:24.449> you
