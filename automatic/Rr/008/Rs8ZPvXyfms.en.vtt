tutorial where she talked you through
some<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.210> her<00:00:21.420> personal<00:00:21.990> flow<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.680> she<00:00:22.890> does

some of her personal flow that she does
and<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.609> made<00:00:23.880> me<00:00:24.090> think<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.570> move<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.320> do

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and it made me think of a move that I do

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.400 
and it made me think of a move that I do
in<00:00:26.130> my<00:00:26.160> flow<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.119> haven't<00:00:27.480> really<00:00:27.869> seen

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
in my flow that I haven't really seen

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.769 
in my flow that I haven't really seen
anyone<00:00:28.800> else<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.429> maybe<00:00:29.939> because<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.599> not

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
anyone else do maybe because it's not

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.659 
anyone else do maybe because it's not
that<00:00:30.810> exciting<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.710> look<00:00:31.890> at<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.309> no<00:00:32.489> one's

weave<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.510> that's<00:00:43.350> basically<00:00:44.040> what<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
weave because that's basically what it

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.150 
weave because that's basically what it
is<00:00:45.050> prerequisite<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.440> move<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
is prerequisite for this move is the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.490 
is prerequisite for this move is the
reverse<00:00:47.579> weave<00:00:48.090> you'll<00:00:48.780> need<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.140> know<00:00:49.289> how<00:00:49.440> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
reverse weave you'll need to know how to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.170 
reverse weave you'll need to know how to
do<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.370> will<00:00:50.579> run<00:00:50.820> through<00:00:50.879> that

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
do that and I will run through that

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.459 
do that and I will run through that
really<00:00:51.449> quickly<00:00:51.570> if<00:00:52.020> you'll<00:00:52.170> want<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> use

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
really quickly if you'll want to use

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.590 
really quickly if you'll want to use
your<00:00:52.770> lightweight<00:00:53.100> off<00:00:53.489> body<00:00:53.820> hoops<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.449> this

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
your lightweight off body hoops for this

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.930 
your lightweight off body hoops for this
move<00:00:54.899> obviously<00:00:55.350> they're<00:00:56.190> gonna<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> lot

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
move obviously they're gonna be a lot

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.880 
move obviously they're gonna be a lot
easier<00:00:57.180> than<00:00:57.660> your<00:00:57.840> big<00:00:57.989> heavy<00:00:58.170> hoops<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
easier than your big heavy hoops to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.680 
easier than your big heavy hoops to
swing<00:00:59.399> through<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.670> air<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.180> do<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> reverse

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
swing through the air to do the reverse

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.240 
swing through the air to do the reverse
weave<00:01:00.960> you're<00:01:01.140> gonna<00:01:01.230> start<00:01:01.649> by<00:01:01.770> holding<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.230 
the hoop up and guide it in the
direction<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.159> your<00:01:32.310> opposite<00:01:32.670> shoulder<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
direction of your opposite shoulder and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.149 
direction of your opposite shoulder and
then<00:01:33.450> let<00:01:33.659> gravity<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.320> drop<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.950> hoop<00:01:35.100> down

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
then let gravity just drop the hoop down

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.910 
then let gravity just drop the hoop down
and<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:35.939> your<00:01:36.090> plane<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.780> even<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.560> means<00:01:37.770> if

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
and if your plane is even that means if

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.200 
and if your plane is even that means if
you're<00:01:38.040> dropping<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> hoop<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.880> straight

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
you're dropping the hoop in a straight

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.420 
you're dropping the hoop in a straight
line<00:01:39.240> as<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.200> running<00:01:40.560> parallel<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.220> a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
line as if it's running parallel to a

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.550 
line as if it's running parallel to a
wall<00:01:41.850> that's<00:01:42.150> right<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.020> momentum<00:01:43.470> of

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
wall that's right here the momentum of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.350 
wall that's right here the momentum of
the<00:01:43.680> hoop<00:01:43.860> will<00:01:44.009> automatically<00:01:44.880> start<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the hoop will automatically start the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.780 
the hoop will automatically start the
swing<00:01:45.750> back<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.009> other<00:01:47.130> direction<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
swing back in the other direction and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.399 
swing back in the other direction and
for<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.210> you're<00:01:48.420> gonna<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.960> kind<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.259> do

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
for that you're gonna have to kind of do

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.410 
for that you're gonna have to kind of do
this

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
this

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.300 
this
risk<00:01:50.750> maneuver<00:01:51.049> still<00:01:51.860> leading<00:01:52.159> with<00:01:52.280> your

risk maneuver still leading with your

risk maneuver still leading with your
pinky<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.820> hoop<00:01:52.939> is<00:01:53.060> going<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.360> come<00:01:53.540> up<00:01:53.810> and

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
pinky the hoop is going to come up and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:13.190 
pinky the hoop is going to come up and
back<00:01:54.770> around<00:01:55.009> to<00:01:55.939> your<00:01:56.090> original<00:01:56.299> side

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.690 

those<00:02:14.200> are<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.470> basics<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.190> if<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.550> can

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
those are the basics and if you can

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.340 
those are the basics and if you can
practice<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.150> then<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.660> can<00:02:16.870> do<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.170> rest

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
practice that then you can do the rest

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.620 
practice that then you can do the rest
of<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.620> move<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.130> start<00:02:18.610> out<00:02:18.730> usually<00:02:19.030> I've

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
of this move so I start out usually I've

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.590 
of this move so I start out usually I've
got<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.990> hoop<00:02:20.170> spinning<00:02:20.680> behind<00:02:21.160> me<00:02:21.940> it's<00:02:22.480> in

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
got the hoop spinning behind me it's in

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.510 
got the hoop spinning behind me it's in
my<00:02:22.750> right<00:02:22.930> hand<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.500> don't<00:02:23.590> do<00:02:23.950> clockwise

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
my right hand I don't do clockwise

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.059 
my right hand I don't do clockwise
counter<00:02:24.970> clockwise<00:02:25.000> my<00:02:25.900> brain<00:02:26.260> doesn't<00:02:26.709> think

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
counter clockwise my brain doesn't think

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.900 
counter clockwise my brain doesn't think
of<00:02:27.220> clocks

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
of clocks

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.250 
of clocks
I<00:02:27.940> think<00:02:28.569> of<00:02:28.750> forward<00:02:30.000> or<00:02:31.000> backward<00:02:31.750> or<00:02:31.930> word

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
I think of forward or backward or word

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.690 
I think of forward or backward or word
to<00:02:32.410> me<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.680> like<00:02:32.830> if<00:02:32.980> you're<00:02:33.100> pitching<00:02:33.430> a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
to me is like if you're pitching a

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.540 
to me is like if you're pitching a
baseball<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.540> backward<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.500> if<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.980> hoop<00:02:36.220> is

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
baseball and backward is if the hoop is

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.430 
baseball and backward is if the hoop is
swinging<00:02:36.970> towards<00:02:37.510> your<00:02:37.660> head<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.200> if<00:02:38.319> it

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
swinging towards your head like if it

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.050 
swinging towards your head like if it
we're<00:02:38.560> right<00:02:38.739> in<00:02:38.890> front<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.400> smack

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
we're right in front of you and smack

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.890 
we're right in front of you and smack
you<00:02:40.209> in<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.360> face

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
you in the face

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.449 
you in the face
and<00:02:41.110> if<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.530> were<00:02:41.620> going<00:02:41.769> forward<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.340> would

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
and if you were going forward it would

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.160 
and if you were going forward it would
smack<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.880> in<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.060> crotch<00:02:43.239> does<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.050> make

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
smack you in the crotch does that make

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.640 
smack you in the crotch does that make
sense

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
sense

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.530 
sense
Jeff's<00:02:45.190> terminology<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.239> hoop<00:02:46.390> is

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
Jeff's terminology so the hoop is

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.270 
Jeff's terminology so the hoop is
spinning<00:02:46.840> backwards<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.920> when<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.190> crosses

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
spinning backwards and when it crosses

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.820 
spinning backwards and when it crosses
your<00:02:48.550> palm<00:02:48.910> you're<00:02:49.420> gonna<00:02:49.570> go<00:02:49.989> into<00:02:50.500> your

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
your palm you're gonna go into your

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.160 
your palm you're gonna go into your
reversed<00:02:51.489> weave<00:02:51.850> when<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.360> hoop<00:02:52.510> drops<00:02:52.870> over

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
reversed weave when the hoop drops over

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.840 
reversed weave when the hoop drops over
to<00:02:53.290> your<00:02:53.380> opposite<00:02:53.769> shoulder<00:02:53.980> instead<00:02:54.700> of

to your opposite shoulder instead of

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.970 
to your opposite shoulder instead of

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
sending it back to the original side

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.100 
sending it back to the original side
you're<00:02:57.819> going<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.150> swing<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.989> your

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.199 

this<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.860> tricky<00:03:32.370> part<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.790> move<00:03:33.000> if

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
this is the tricky part of the move if

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.000 
this is the tricky part of the move if
you're<00:03:33.330> not<00:03:33.540> used<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.870> doing<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:34.709> what<00:03:34.860> you

you're not used to doing it but what you

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.690 
you're not used to doing it but what you
ultimately<00:03:35.160> want<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:36.060> one<00:03:36.950> big<00:03:37.950> leap<00:03:38.280> so

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
ultimately want is one big leap so

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.490 
ultimately want is one big leap so
you're<00:03:38.850> going<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.090> lead<00:03:39.660> with<00:03:39.990> your<00:03:40.020> pinkie
