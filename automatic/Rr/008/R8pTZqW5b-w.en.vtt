00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.559
 Faivre bomb could also have detonated in an airplane because 

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:10.330
 German airports are not sure Frankfurt airport for a week

 put your closed transparent bag to check out the 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.380
 Hand gave 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.079
 Strictly forbidden on board are flammable gases and liquids 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.730
 but exactly such gases are present in easily flammable hair present 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.019
 You can easily buy after the security check 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.730
 intuitively lie shanks 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.650
 There are also offered buy from and high percentage alcoholic beverages 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.460

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.309
 with up to 58 percent alcohol content and highly flammable 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.940
 literwise you can buy here the liquids not through 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.190
 to be in control 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.940
 the airports advertise even with the unchanged possible sees the hard 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.680
 shopping after checking the goods are just sealed 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.130
 the deeper the purchases within the EGU are still not a problem 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.110
 Door open the seal 1 to your destination one please 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.150
 the terrorists also wanted to comply 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.380
 Knut which car used to be the former head of the police department 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.510
 Special Forces GSG 9 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.610
 The Dirty Free practice is dangerous OK but are the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.550
 buy voracious snails shop worry 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.540
 from the north our goal 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.540
 and talks come vigorously every morning 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.770
 I would have to 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.090
 be controlled more and I would know that to be selected 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.230
 What happens in the duty-free shops in the other stores after customer 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.730
 to be bought 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.680
 This plastic bag contains ammonium nitrate ocher raw material for 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.260
 we want a bomb with it through the security lock at the airport 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.229
 the rotation with hidden camera 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.729
 the inspectors at the Frankfurt airport leave the bag with the money 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.119
 No one gets suspicious though according to regulations, nothing happens 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.119
 Airplane may not be clearly identifiable 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.789
 with the things that one now understands has brought as control 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:16.369
 like this one kilogram of ammonium nitrate and with the team 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.030
 I additionally order 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.920
 the deep the shock 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.850
 can acquire 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.439
 Can I steal horses? 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.439
 with the right protection and from the air or 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.399
 in the shallows area German airports we find more 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:32.209
 Ingredients for a bomb 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.069
 candles 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.580
 which together with the fertilizer yield the bomb substance we also discover 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.989
 Electrical appliances that can be used to process the bomb attack 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:45.579
 even the detonator with metal parts and wires we get despite the 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.619
 clear warnings unchecked by the security lock of a 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:51.509
 another German airport 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:52.900
 for legal reasons 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.890
 we have only a faithful dummy in the secured deduction 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.109
 Area brought 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.989
 on a blast place mixes a demolition master the airport 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.570
 purchased ingredients 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.659
 about 300 grams of crushed fertilizer together 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.290
 in an aluminum factory 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.569
 which also goes to him the Free Shop was bought 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.189
 is the effect of the bomb why it could also be made at the airport 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.699
 the mid-range car is almost completely destroyed 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.279
 What this bomb could do in an airplane describes the 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:32.439
 former Einsatzleiter of the GSG 9 Nutr ich Heerwagen 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.799
 there will be consequences following up the outer skin 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.479
 Read more differences today, they can not save more 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.719
 We ask Frankfurt Airport for an opinion 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:49.739
 Fraport GmbH declined an interview from orphaned 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.849
 to the Federal Interior Ministry also here no interview no opinion 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.229
 the danger of liquids for air traffic 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.429
 is recognized after the attacks of London 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:06.859
 why then can flammable few foresters and alcoholics in large quantities 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.639
 continue to be bought into the deep love kingdom 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.219
 The employee of a typical shop tells us about an internal 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.619
 Service instruction 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:18.880
 After that, by no means is all passengers the purchase of spirits and performance 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:22.309
 The employee does not want to be recognized 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:25.939
 for security reasons this is not allowed to travelers looking for 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:28.640
 Fly or fly from there 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.840
 liquid spirits and perfume for sale 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.230
 and direct flights to the US from Andy we are not allowed to liquid things 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.979
 Selling 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.450
 double standards in flight safety 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.310
 Passengers to the US and the UK are better protected 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.169
 Other eu partners let you travel further with dangerous liquids 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.169
 an instruction that the weaponry expert Wolfgang Spyker incomprehensible 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.169
 the line will find these instructions 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.270
 The damage the team has internally wants their tank on for all other flights 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.639
 this risk was assessed differently as a percentage 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.639
 for those flights to the UK or the US 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:12.499
 lower 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.680
 the violation of safety and race was present 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.230
 Here, safety ends for passengers a few meters behind the 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.610
 access control 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.509
 There would be a whole lot for the sale of Porsche and alcoholics 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.509
 simple solution 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.500
 the only ones who Tauss the further possibility with a poem 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.509
 has succeeded 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.509
 that one that the early slaughterers after the trip 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:42.620
 she can go 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.479
 but that would be less lucrative for the beauty free operators 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.550
 We wish you a good journey 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.919
 and so can travelers in the EU 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.550
 continue to bring dangerous goods on board 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.889
 unhindered and uncontrolled 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.040
 SOK there is no security 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.810
 back on the ground in the air
