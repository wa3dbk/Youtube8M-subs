00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.789 
a lawyer as well and so i see a lawyer
giving<00:03:04.670> testimony<00:03:05.269> giving<00:03:05.599> a<00:03:05.720> final<00:03:06.079> argument

a lot of ways this book is very similar

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.560 
a lot of ways this book is very similar
to<00:05:56.650> Paper<00:05:56.920> Towns<00:05:57.190> mainly<00:05:57.820> in<00:05:58.000> its<00:05:58.120> message

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
to Paper Towns mainly in its message

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.870 
to Paper Towns mainly in its message
which<00:05:58.750> is<00:05:58.870> basically<00:05:59.320> that<00:05:59.470> we<00:06:00.460> should<00:06:00.730> not

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
which is basically that we should not

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.550 
which is basically that we should not
just<00:06:01.090> make<00:06:01.240> assumptions<00:06:01.750> on<00:06:01.900> people<00:06:02.260> and<00:06:02.440> that

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
just make assumptions on people and that

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.900 
just make assumptions on people and that
we<00:06:02.710> should<00:06:02.950> try<00:06:03.130> to<00:06:03.190> see<00:06:03.430> things<00:06:03.610> from<00:06:03.760> their

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
we should try to see things from their

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.060 
we should try to see things from their
point<00:06:04.270> of<00:06:04.450> view<00:06:04.510> and<00:06:04.930> she<00:06:05.320> is<00:06:05.410> able<00:06:05.650> to<00:06:05.920> learn

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
point of view and she is able to learn

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.160 
point of view and she is able to learn
this<00:06:06.280> lesson<00:06:06.460> most<00:06:06.880> effectively<00:06:07.420> because<00:06:07.840> she

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.170 
this lesson most effectively because she

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.770 
this lesson most effectively because she
is<00:06:08.440> the<00:06:08.470> observer<00:06:09.400> of<00:06:09.760> everything<00:06:10.570> that<00:06:10.690> is

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
is the observer of everything that is

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.720 
is the observer of everything that is
happening<00:06:10.960> because<00:06:11.440> she<00:06:11.920> is<00:06:12.040> the<00:06:12.070> observer<00:06:12.610> of

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
happening because she is the observer of

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.340 
happening because she is the observer of
the<00:06:12.970> pain<00:06:13.210> that<00:06:13.240> everyone<00:06:13.720> is<00:06:13.840> going<00:06:14.020> through

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
the pain that everyone is going through

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.650 
the pain that everyone is going through
she<00:06:14.620> has<00:06:14.860> to<00:06:15.130> throughout<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.760> story<00:06:16.090> put

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
she has to throughout the story put

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.840 
she has to throughout the story put
herself<00:06:16.900> in<00:06:17.410> the<00:06:17.560> shoes<00:06:17.860> of<00:06:17.890> all<00:06:18.460> of<00:06:18.670> these

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
herself in the shoes of all of these

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.160 
herself in the shoes of all of these
different<00:06:19.060> characters<00:06:19.480> that<00:06:19.900> she<00:06:20.080> is

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
different characters that she is

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.110 
different characters that she is
observing<00:06:20.770> and<00:06:20.950> in<00:06:21.250> the<00:06:21.370> end<00:06:21.520> she<00:06:21.670> finally

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
observing and in the end she finally

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.900 
observing and in the end she finally
finally<00:06:22.690> finally<00:06:22.720> learns<00:06:23.560> how<00:06:24.220> to<00:06:24.250> do<00:06:24.640> that

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
finally finally learns how to do that

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.390 
finally finally learns how to do that
and<00:06:25.180> so<00:06:25.600> this<00:06:25.810> story<00:06:26.020> is<00:06:26.320> most<00:06:26.830> effective

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
and so this story is most effective

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.580 
and so this story is most effective
because<00:06:27.910> it<00:06:28.240> is<00:06:28.600> told<00:06:28.840> from<00:06:28.930> her<00:06:29.200> point<00:06:29.440> of

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
because it is told from her point of

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.350 
because it is told from her point of
view<00:06:29.650> not<00:06:30.040> from<00:06:30.280> anybody<00:06:30.730> else's<00:06:31.180> in<00:06:31.270> the

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
view not from anybody else's in the

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.790
