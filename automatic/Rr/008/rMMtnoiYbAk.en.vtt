 the entire process of initializing the program 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.210
 so it was used appears on the screen 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.810

 maximum setting is 100 items 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.880
 after this procedure 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.070
 being restricted 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.500
 the sun shines initialized 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.510
 after this process 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.470
 stand aside 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.970
 W 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.720
 I could say 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.460
 again program 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.840
 like this 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.800
 at the beginning of the session 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.290
 this is what we have 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.840
 all the commands used 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.270
 the programation 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.270
 at the moment we're just going 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.340
 interdicted 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.680
 and how to test the program 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.720
 for this 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.910
 selected 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.960
 he had the one who teaches 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.960
 no crato 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.420
 The button 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.140
 being in the program 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.230
 let's also select the button 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.410
 so at first 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.410
 We are going to edit the clip this is the first 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.730
 it will show up 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.950
 up here 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.950
 election 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.660
 and here is a program that has been edited 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.170
 is himself 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.170

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.130
 and he will open up the management this way 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.450
 that's where all the problems created so far 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.399
 for this we will select 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.799
 to orbit saved 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.369
 always always 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:14.709
 and right away 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.599
 program name is selected 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.849
 It's important to remember here. 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.269
 the kind of extension of our I want 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.269
 is counted 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:30.209
 the pastor indicated 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.109
 we have to exalt the claw 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.479
 this way 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:37.049
 Do you elect in Itiban? 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.160

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.259
 in the program footer 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.259
 and here it will appear 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.869
 Yes, they appeared humanitarian. 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:48.099
 click ok 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.509
 otherwise 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:51.269
 we will be serious 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.079
 something punctuated 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.549
 just below the bottom of the program 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.419
 clicking here 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.129
 we have here then 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.929
 the program at 21 points each 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:05.059
 click the screen on any good 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:06.479
 that is if a friend 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.509
 I did not even believe it. 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:11.509
 the name of the program 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.809
 I understand that it is clear 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.809
 right after the senate 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.069
 showing up I want to do a schedule 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.709
 was a colleague from our state 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.249
 will automatically open the block 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.499
 according to the note 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:35.379
 in our case 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.729
 but the pt is going 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.289
 in rio verde and they accepted 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:40.129
 the yen 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.139
 is one that is a small example of this 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.419
 programming 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.419
 our case now we have to create a 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.459
 according to the simple 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.189
 using 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.189
 my keyboard 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.139
 I will say that this blog 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.159
 not always be 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.159
 the 50m 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.519
 if you have any operations to do 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.409
 in this case you have a brother who 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.919
 ballad 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:16.989
 had 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.779
 on the right side 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.340
 visit again 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.830
 In addition, it was terminated 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.139
 in this case I go to the problem here because now our goal is to climb 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.009
 be the first 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.009
 then to test this program played 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.029
 this program 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:44.629
 automatically on top will appear the technical program 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.059
 appeared 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:51.059
 the program that was being tested and had merit 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.080
 to occur in that program 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.729
 just click beijing index again 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:03.309
 the problem in the list 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:07.089
 motto automatically appears on the leg 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:09.680
 we have the possibility 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.120
 victor abhisit ready 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.249
 in the second goal 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:17.580
 the winners 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.650
 maggi made the best 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.389
 for who knows 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.490

 I did not have external support 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.689
 click add 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:35.039
 riding a boat 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.039
 we have high 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.460
 and then after greeting a 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.460
 the program will fall 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.389
 just go on vacation 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.270

 And what could be happening? 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.919
 for this reason 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.319
 with the end of the year 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.319
