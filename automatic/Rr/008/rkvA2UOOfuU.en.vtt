the third tip because you want to try

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.040 
the third tip because you want to try
everything<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.369> even<00:01:51.240> if<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.539> looks<00:01:51.690> like<00:01:51.810> it

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
everything on even if it looks like it

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.760 
everything on even if it looks like it
might<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.409> fit<00:01:52.649> even<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.039> it's<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.399> your<00:01:53.580> size

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
might not fit even if it's not your size

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.279 
might not fit even if it's not your size
it<00:01:54.859> stinks<00:01:55.399> from<00:01:55.579> different<00:01:55.939> eras<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.929> sizes

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
it stinks from different eras the sizes

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.490 
it stinks from different eras the sizes
are<00:01:57.409> not<00:01:57.530> equal<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.549> our<00:01:58.880> sizes<00:01:59.299> today<00:01:59.500> so

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
are not equal to our sizes today so

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.380 
are not equal to our sizes today so
again<00:02:01.009> this<00:02:01.280> is<00:02:01.460> just<00:02:01.670> something<00:02:01.850> you<00:02:02.090> want<00:02:02.299> to

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
again this is just something you want to

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.060 
again this is just something you want to
keep<00:02:02.479> in<00:02:02.659> mind<00:02:02.840> when<00:02:03.320> trying<00:02:03.590> on<00:02:03.799> clothes
