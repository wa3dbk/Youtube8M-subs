00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:08.460
 Hi, it's me and we've decided to participate 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.920
 in the initiative that has made mayer 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.330
 ayamonte that is to make a list 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.470
 of reproduction where all the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.220
 Spanish good many of them 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.130
 We will recommend a book for these 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.439
 Christmas this initiative was created by 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.260
 clubs in Mexico and we have good 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.980
 adapted spain because it 's like that 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.650
 we copied my recommendations 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.690
 filled with rhythm robot is a novel of 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.730
 contemporary love tells the story of 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.280
 a girl who calls herself not much that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.130
 it's called park as it's logical they 're a bit 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.440
 different but in the end they fall in love 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.090
 as it is logical our spoiler what with in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.960
 the back cover is a story both 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.030
 somewhat peculiar because good then in 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.270
 1986 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.390
 how many elements of the time put 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.160
 like music in comics and good that to me 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.739
 like he added points because I 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.410
 I really like that you put things like that and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.930
 good also the style of the author 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.060
 I thought it was super nice to write 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.009
 that we would like for sure although it is a bit 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.430
 sad in some parts but good is 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.549
 beautiful and I think it will be cut and my 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.710
 recommendation is the trilogy file of 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.049
 sophie jordan is a fantasy story 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.080
 that mixes dragons and humans I'm not going to 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.580
 tell a lot because it is a story about each 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.280
 book because I recommend the trilogy 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.920
 I 'm not going to end up like that a little bit 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.259
 above is about a girl who is 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.760
 half of the human will are called 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.830
 free 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.560
 occurs a series of events that make 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.190
 have to flee from his own herd to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.780
 save your life and that of your family and love 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.180
 and despite the fact that I do not like 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.640
 stories of a second I fall in love as 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.950
 happens in this trilogy I do not know has been 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.170
 something that I liked it because 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.030
 love story unfolds is very 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.700
 real but have a happy holiday 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.020
 Then in Vienna and between you have a 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.490
 good entry 2014 and 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.619
 May the year go very well 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.929
 there are many books that are going to come out 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:14.939
 very many years are expected 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.939
 well, we do not play anything
