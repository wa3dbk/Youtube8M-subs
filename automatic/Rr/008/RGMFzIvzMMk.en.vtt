00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
aren't in here so you could say add a

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.650 
aren't in here so you could say add a
new<00:03:29.200> food<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:30.060> basically<00:03:31.060> what<00:03:31.300> it<00:03:31.360> does<00:03:33.660> you

new food and basically what it does you
have<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:35.590> have<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.800> add<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.000> category

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
have to you have to add it to a category

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.449 
have to you have to add it to a category
first<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:38.320> can't<00:03:38.530> just<00:03:38.620> have<00:03:38.860> it<00:03:39.040> all<00:03:39.220> by

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
first you can't just have it all by

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.250 
first you can't just have it all by
itself<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.360> if<00:03:40.420> i<00:03:40.510> added<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:42.900> dressing<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.050> i<00:03:44.110> can

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
itself so if i added a dressing so i can

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.210 
itself so if i added a dressing so i can
just<00:03:44.410> say<00:03:44.500> Amber's<00:03:44.920> dressing<00:03:45.370> i<00:03:46.890> have<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:48.040> look

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
just say Amber's dressing i have to look

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.080 
just say Amber's dressing i have to look
up<00:03:48.340> my<00:03:48.580> own<00:03:50.010> sugar<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.280> carb<00:03:51.489> content<00:03:51.760> of

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
up my own sugar and carb content of

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.110 
up my own sugar and carb content of
course<00:03:52.300> because<00:03:52.600> it<00:03:52.720> doesn't<00:03:53.020> know<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:57.090> i<00:03:58.090> can

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
course because it doesn't know and i can

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.800 
course because it doesn't know and i can
add<00:03:58.390> it<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:58.690> it'll<00:03:58.840> always<00:03:59.050> be<00:03:59.200> there<00:03:59.530> now

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.450 

one<00:04:04.810> of<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:04.960> things<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.290> does<00:04:05.440> is<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.650> doesn't

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
one of the things it does is it doesn't

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
one of the things it does is it doesn't
track<00:04:06.730> your<00:04:07.450> carbs<00:04:08.290> by<00:04:08.680> grams<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.480> tracks

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
track your carbs by grams that tracks

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.140 
track your carbs by grams that tracks
them<00:04:10.720> by<00:04:10.980> servings<00:04:11.980> which<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.580> something<00:04:13.060> that

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
them by servings which is something that

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.850 
them by servings which is something that
the<00:04:13.270> diet<00:04:13.480> does<00:04:13.690> to<00:04:14.050> supposedly<00:04:14.470> make<00:04:14.740> it

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
the diet does to supposedly make it

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.060 
the diet does to supposedly make it
easier<00:04:15.190> but<00:04:16.000> you<00:04:16.030> track<00:04:16.660> your<00:04:16.900> carbs<00:04:17.320> by<00:04:17.739> meal

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
easier but you track your carbs by meal

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.190 
easier but you track your carbs by meal
so<00:04:18.459> here<00:04:19.209> I've<00:04:19.300> just<00:04:19.420> entered<00:04:19.660> some<00:04:19.840> random

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
here all for breakfast but it counts

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.170 
here all for breakfast but it counts
each<00:04:32.290> item<00:04:32.740> individually<00:04:33.010> as<00:04:33.700> my<00:04:33.910> carb

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
each item individually as my carb

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.680 
each item individually as my carb
servings<00:04:34.660> so<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:36.280> counts<00:04:36.460> my<00:04:36.790> quarter<00:04:37.420> cup<00:04:37.570> of

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
servings so it counts my quarter cup of

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.110 
servings so it counts my quarter cup of
almonds<00:04:38.050> as<00:04:38.170> one<00:04:38.410> carb<00:04:38.710> serving<00:04:39.160> even<00:04:39.910> though

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
almonds as one carb serving even though

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.630 
almonds as one carb serving even though
there<00:04:40.690> are<00:04:40.780> only<00:04:40.870> six<00:04:41.290> carbs<00:04:41.740> so<00:04:42.010> everything

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
there are only six carbs so everything

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.280 
there are only six carbs so everything
else<00:04:42.790> I<00:04:42.940> should<00:04:43.000> have<00:04:43.270> I've<00:04:43.450> eaten<00:04:44.080> in<00:04:44.140> that

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
else I should have I've eaten in that

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.730 
else I should have I've eaten in that
meal<00:04:44.470> should<00:04:44.740> have<00:04:44.860> added<00:04:45.160> together<00:04:45.870> up<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:47.350> 20

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
meal should have added together up to 20

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.820 
meal should have added together up to 20
grams<00:04:48.250> of<00:04:48.460> carbs<00:04:48.820> to<00:04:49.300> be<00:04:49.480> one<00:04:49.660> serving<00:04:50.170> so<00:04:50.740> you

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
grams of carbs to be one serving so you

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:58.050 
grams of carbs to be one serving so you
can<00:04:51.010> count<00:04:51.190> along<00:04:51.460> here<00:04:51.850> and<00:04:52.030> see<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:57.060> you

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
can count along here and see that you

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.280 
can count along here and see that you
don't<00:04:58.240> really<00:04:58.390> know<00:04:58.570> how<00:04:58.690> many<00:04:58.870> carbs<00:04:59.170> you

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
don't really know how many carbs you

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.660 
don't really know how many carbs you
have<00:04:59.440> left<00:04:59.650> so<00:04:59.800> if<00:04:59.890> you<00:04:59.980> wanted<00:05:00.220> if<00:05:00.340> I<00:05:00.460> want<00:05:00.640> to

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
have left so if you wanted if I want to

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.070 
have left so if you wanted if I want to
have<00:05:00.820> chocolate<00:05:01.030> that<00:05:01.360> night<00:05:01.570> I<00:05:01.810> wouldn't

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
have chocolate that night I wouldn't

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.330 
have chocolate that night I wouldn't
know<00:05:02.230> what<00:05:02.440> I'd<00:05:02.530> have<00:05:02.680> left<00:05:02.950> I've<00:05:03.130> actually

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
know what I'd have left I've actually

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.400 
know what I'd have left I've actually
had<00:05:03.640> to<00:05:03.820> get<00:05:03.970> out<00:05:04.090> a<00:05:04.270> piece<00:05:04.660> of<00:05:04.720> paper<00:05:04.840> and<00:05:05.230> add

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
had to get out a piece of paper and add

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.710 
had to get out a piece of paper and add
it<00:05:05.560> up<00:05:05.710> this<00:05:06.370> looks<00:05:06.670> like<00:05:06.850> I<00:05:07.150> can't<00:05:07.510> have

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
it up this looks like I can't have

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.900 
it up this looks like I can't have
anymore<00:05:07.990> but<00:05:08.710> it's<00:05:08.950> perfectly<00:05:09.370> possible<00:05:09.460> that

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
anymore but it's perfectly possible that

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.070 
anymore but it's perfectly possible that
I<00:05:09.940> didn't<00:05:10.180> reach<00:05:10.330> my<00:05:10.510> hundred<00:05:10.780> and<00:05:10.870> twenty

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
I didn't reach my hundred and twenty

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.670 
I didn't reach my hundred and twenty
grams<00:05:11.260> of<00:05:11.500> carbs<00:05:11.830> and<00:05:12.010> I<00:05:12.100> still<00:05:12.400> have<00:05:12.610> room

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
grams of carbs and I still have room

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.630 
grams of carbs and I still have room
because<00:05:14.680> of<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:14.860> way<00:05:14.980> I<00:05:15.010> ate<00:05:15.280> them<00:05:15.490> with<00:05:15.610> a

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
because of the way I ate them with a

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.420 
because of the way I ate them with a
meal<00:05:15.970> so<00:05:16.510> the<00:05:17.260> back<00:05:17.440> would<00:05:17.650> be<00:05:17.680> better<00:05:18.130> in<00:05:18.310> my

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
meal so the back would be better in my

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.850 
meal so the back would be better in my
opinion<00:05:18.460> if<00:05:19.090> it<00:05:19.390> tracked<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:20.350> meal<00:05:20.620> that<00:05:20.650> you

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
opinion if it tracked the meal that you

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.830 
opinion if it tracked the meal that you
had<00:05:21.040> it<00:05:21.190> in<00:05:21.310> so<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.970> oatmeal<00:05:22.300> in<00:05:22.420> the<00:05:22.480> egg<00:05:22.600> were

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
had it in so the oatmeal in the egg were

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.840 
had it in so the oatmeal in the egg were
for<00:05:23.020> breakfast<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.920> almonds<00:05:24.280> were<00:05:24.400> for<00:05:24.580> snack

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
for breakfast the almonds were for snack

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.050 
for breakfast the almonds were for snack
the<00:05:25.360> cucumber<00:05:25.930> and<00:05:26.080> lettuce<00:05:26.290> and<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:27.760> salmon

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
the cucumber and lettuce and the salmon

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.790 
the cucumber and lettuce and the salmon
were<00:05:28.390> for<00:05:28.600> dinner<00:05:28.780> for<00:05:29.110> example<00:05:29.440> like<00:05:29.560> that

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
were for dinner for example like that

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.260 
were for dinner for example like that
and<00:05:30.010> then<00:05:30.190> it<00:05:30.400> groups<00:05:30.610> them<00:05:30.730> together<00:05:31.090> and

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
and then it groups them together and

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.210 
and then it groups them together and
adds<00:05:31.450> together<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:31.870> carbs<00:05:32.260> that<00:05:32.770> is<00:05:32.950> how<00:05:33.190> you

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
adds together the carbs that is how you

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.950 
adds together the carbs that is how you
count<00:05:33.580> your<00:05:33.700> carb<00:05:33.940> servings<00:05:34.270> on<00:05:34.390> the<00:05:34.480> diet<00:05:34.690> and

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
count your carb servings on the diet and

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.960 
count your carb servings on the diet and
it's<00:05:35.380> even<00:05:35.530> explained<00:05:36.100> when<00:05:36.490> you<00:05:36.580> go<00:05:36.700> to<00:05:36.760> the

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
it's even explained when you go to the

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.720 
it's even explained when you go to the
diet<00:05:37.180> here<00:05:37.540> it<00:05:37.990> says<00:05:38.260> it<00:05:38.440> there<00:05:38.620> so<00:05:38.890> the<00:05:39.610> app

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
diet here it says it there so the app

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.190 
diet here it says it there so the app
doesn't<00:05:40.000> count<00:05:40.300> it<00:05:40.480> that<00:05:40.630> way<00:05:40.780> it<00:05:41.050> doesn't

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
doesn't count it that way it doesn't

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.510 
doesn't count it that way it doesn't
really<00:05:41.410> make<00:05:41.560> that<00:05:41.710> big<00:05:41.770> a<00:05:41.920> difference<00:05:42.010> it's

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
really make that big a difference it's

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.440 
really make that big a difference it's
actually<00:05:42.880> less<00:05:43.180> restrictive<00:05:43.960> then<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:46.300> other

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
actually less restrictive then the other

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.330 
actually less restrictive then the other
way<00:05:46.570> to<00:05:46.630> count<00:05:46.900> it<00:05:47.050> but<00:05:47.470> I<00:05:47.680> just<00:05:48.070> find<00:05:48.250> it

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
way to count it but I just find it

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.170 
way to count it but I just find it
annoying<00:05:48.580> because<00:05:48.790> you<00:05:48.940> can't<00:05:49.120> have

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
annoying because you can't have

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:56.070 
annoying because you can't have
everything<00:05:49.420> that<00:05:49.720> you<00:05:50.020> might<00:05:50.260> want<00:05:50.470> it<00:05:55.080> does

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
everything that you might want it does

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.050 
everything that you might want it does
track<00:05:56.290> your<00:05:56.470> progress<00:05:56.590> but<00:05:57.340> what<00:05:57.610> is<00:05:57.700> tracking

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
track your progress but what is tracking

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.390 
track your progress but what is tracking
is<00:05:58.180> your<00:05:58.330> sugar<00:05:58.600> in<00:05:58.750> your<00:05:58.780> carbs<00:05:59.350> over<00:06:00.160> weeks

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
is your sugar in your carbs over weeks

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.720 
is your sugar in your carbs over weeks

it'd<00:06:22.180> be<00:06:22.210> really<00:06:22.300> useful<00:06:22.599> to<00:06:23.020> track<00:06:23.289> your<00:06:23.440> wait
