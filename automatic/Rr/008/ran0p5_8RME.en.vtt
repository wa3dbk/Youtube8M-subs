00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.990
 friends i am waldo garcÃ­a champion 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.600
 world bodybuilding what good 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.090
 that are in our youtube channel and 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.780
 in this segment I'm going to talk a little 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.670
 on 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.950
 supplementation we all look for the 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.880
 protein that will make us very sucked 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:31.700
 if the product that will lower us the 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.120
 percentage of fat the star product 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.280
 what 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.980
 I'm sorry to disappoint the non-existent 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.110
 we need a set of things from 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.170
 nutrition from the food that is 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.530
 the base obviously if it's the most 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.540
 important and there are some supplements that 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.790
 we can use as 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.339
 tools for our training 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.030
 and to obviously improve our physique 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:03.839
 I suggest you talking about protein 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.700
 example that you consume very low problems 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.710
 low in carbohydrates or without 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.180
 carbohydrates these are the best 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.390
 proteins that you can consume 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.140
 I'm not going much to the weight winners 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.870
 because they have a lot of sugar a lot of fat and 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.540
 it's not what we're looking to go up from 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.150
 weight but rise in muscle mass 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.450
 then I suggest this kind of 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.100
 Protein fast proteins 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.800
 absorption such as whey 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.080
 we also have good meat not 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.720
 calcium caseinate we can also 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.450
 occupy egg albumin any of 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.550
 these proteins low in carbohydrates or 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.300
 without carbohydrates would be what I 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.540
 I would recommend 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.540
 can not miss in our 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.540
 supplementation 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.450
 are the vitamins and minerals this 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.450
 will help have better health 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.020
 metabolic if we comply with the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.159
 requirement of vitamins and minerals 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.039
 our body's diary we are not going to 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.680
 be able to analyze in a good way then 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.209
 I suggest you obviously consume 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.970
 vitamins and minerals 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.460
 apart from the food 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.950
 anyway, if we had any 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.100
 vitamin only we discard it and without 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.740
 no problem 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.390
 in your organism 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.260
 talking about other supplements to me 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.260
 like a lot 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.769
 china for example that is an amino acid 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.120
 that will help us recover 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:45.390
 muscle helps us a lot for 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.239
 recoveries in three sessions I'll 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.890
 I recommend that you use 5 grams before 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.010
 of your training 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.650
 the vitamin is also another of the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.459
 amino acids that I can recommend 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.470
 which is very good to avoid the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.830
 catabolism I recommend it 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.520
 after controlling 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.260
 before sleep 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:15.110
 a thermogenic also that is not 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.110
 have ephedrine ephedrine remember that 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.460
 central nervous system stimulant 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.860
 which is not suitable for many people 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.500
 I recommend thermogenic that you have 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.980
 caffeine green tea for example that's going 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.420
 to help besides causing a carmo 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.820
 genesis 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.510
 by elevation 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.820
 pulsations or to increase a 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.610
 little your heart rate and this is going to 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:48.130
 help to have our body prepared 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:53.820
 for for the oxidation of fat 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.820
 On the other hand we have this product that 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.240
 many people do not know what is the 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.610
 clan 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.720
 conjugated linoleic acid that the truth 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.850
 I find it excellent gives us muscle tone 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.690
 and it helps us lower the percentage of 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.170
 grease 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.840
 they are fatty acids that work very well 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.630
 especially in the abdominal area and I want 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.810
 say only there but helps us 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.840
 lower the percentage of fat a lot 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.870
 of more obviously amino acid kids 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.600
 you want us to help us recover 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.030
 muscular 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.620
 I recommend that if they are powdered, 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.249
 Sundays after your training 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.529
 to recover 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:39.199
 position in tablets you can consume us 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.059
 after each meal one or two 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:45.610
 tablets depending on the level that 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:48.780
 you have and your goals too 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.780
 on the other hand 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.900
 another supplement that is the imagine that 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.150
 help us is a protector explained that 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.190
 can help us maintain 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.130
 in good condition also our 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.050
 our liver especially if we are 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.480
 using some type of drug or 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.420
 help with genetics I recommend you 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.400
 use one every 12 hours 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.389
 we are connected 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:20.259
 mini carnitine another amino acid for me 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:24.100
 the best for burning fat this is not 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:28.000
 must be missing in your in your supplementation 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.690
 you can take from 1.5 grams to 2 grams 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.090
 newspapers 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.970
 if I recommend you obviously be 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.070
 before your training these are 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.310
 some of the supplements that should not 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.410
 of missing in our in our kits 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:46.710
 to be 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:50.039
 complete and maintain a healthy 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:53.940
 first muscle obviously and 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.380
 that we can get to build a little 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.660
 plus 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:02.580
 the physicist that we want remember that the 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:05.550
 discipline is the basis of any success 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.349
 if I wait for you on our YouTube channel 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:13.130
 and I hope these tips follow you
