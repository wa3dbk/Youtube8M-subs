00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
you're gonna move rotate it so that that

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.680 
you're gonna move rotate it so that that
one<00:02:59.190> will<00:02:59.370> dip<00:02:59.489> into<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.880> guy<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.300> gonna<00:03:00.510> move

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
one will dip into this guy is gonna move

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.690 
one will dip into this guy is gonna move
to<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.140> left<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:04.140> know<00:03:04.430> like<00:03:05.430> if<00:03:05.459> it

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
the only one that we're missing is to

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.569 
the only one that we're missing is to
move<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:46.110> front<00:03:46.890> face<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:49.400> there<00:03:50.400> are

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
move the front face like this there are

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.170 
move the front face like this there are
two<00:03:50.970> ways<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.420> do<00:03:51.570> one<00:03:52.530> way<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.190> with<00:03:53.910> these

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
two ways to do one way is to with these

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.780 
two ways to do one way is to with these
fingers<00:03:54.600> you're<00:03:55.079> gonna<00:03:55.230> move<00:03:55.560> hold<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.489> cube

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
fingers you're gonna move hold the cube

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.990 
fingers you're gonna move hold the cube
with<00:03:57.299> these<00:03:57.540> two<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.019> your<00:03:58.320> thumb<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:59.000> make

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
with these two and your thumb and make

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.880 
with these two and your thumb and make
it<00:04:00.470> just<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:04.820> and<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:07.110> other<00:04:07.260> way<00:04:07.560> is

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
it just to you and and the other way is

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.430 
it just to you and and the other way is
that<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:09.060> face<00:04:09.299> that's<00:04:09.540> looking<00:04:10.079> to<00:04:10.110> you

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
that the face that's looking to you

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.029 
that the face that's looking to you
looks<00:04:11.220> up<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:12.709> it's<00:04:13.709> exactly<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.400> same<00:04:14.760> what

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
looks up and it's exactly the same what

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.520 
looks up and it's exactly the same what
the<00:04:17.039> different

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
the different

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.700 
the different
precision<00:04:19.370> which<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:19.700> have<00:04:19.940> your<00:04:20.299> key<00:04:20.590> so<00:04:22.150> and

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
precision which you have your key so and

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.680 
precision which you have your key so and
to<00:04:24.710> move<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:24.980> one<00:04:25.160> at<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.400> back<00:04:25.640> you're<00:04:26.510> gonna

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
to move the one at the back you're gonna

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.790 
to move the one at the back you're gonna
make<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:28.060> thing<00:04:29.060> is<00:04:29.180> you<00:04:29.270> wanna<00:04:29.480> make<00:04:29.720> look<00:04:30.350> to

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
make the thing is you wanna make look to

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.090 
make the thing is you wanna make look to
the<00:04:30.950> sky<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:32.830> move<00:04:33.830> it<00:04:34.010> like<00:04:34.520> this<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:36.710> you're

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
the sky and move it like this and you're

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.310 
the sky and move it like this and you're
moving<00:04:37.460> this<00:04:38.000> cage<00:04:38.240> among<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.750> yellow<00:04:38.960> face

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
moving this cage among the yellow face

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.460 
moving this cage among the yellow face
oh<00:04:39.710> it's<00:04:40.220> moving<00:04:40.400> perfect

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
oh it's moving perfect

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.460 
oh it's moving perfect
then<00:04:43.070> that's<00:04:43.880> all<00:04:44.180> for<00:04:44.630> speed<00:04:44.840> cubing<00:04:45.290> it's

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
then that's all for speed cubing it's

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.050 
then that's all for speed cubing it's
real<00:04:45.680> easy<00:04:46.510> not<00:04:47.510> too<00:04:47.660> hard

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
real easy not too hard

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.490 
real easy not too hard
remember<00:04:50.060> to<00:04:50.240> lubricate<00:04:50.720> your<00:04:50.780> cube<00:04:51.200> if<00:04:51.380> you

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
remember to lubricate your cube if you

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.160 
remember to lubricate your cube if you
want<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.950> especially<00:04:52.760> rubik's<00:04:53.600> cube<00:04:53.810> because

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
want to especially rubik's cube because

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.320 
want to especially rubik's cube because
it's<00:04:54.830> really<00:04:55.040> hard<00:04:55.460> if<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.150> have<00:04:56.300> a

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
it's really hard if you have a

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.660 
it's really hard if you have a
lubricated<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.230> it's<00:04:57.410> gonna<00:04:57.560> be<00:04:57.740> really

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
lubricated and it's gonna be really

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.640 
lubricated and it's gonna be really
really<00:04:58.850> hard<00:04:59.540> to<00:05:00.790> to<00:05:01.790> speed<00:05:02.540> cube<00:05:02.780> with<00:05:03.110> these

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
really hard to to speed cube with these

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.800 
really hard to to speed cube with these
