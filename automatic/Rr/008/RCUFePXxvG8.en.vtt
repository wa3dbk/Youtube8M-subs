in the same time you're trying to get
your<00:03:28.520> timing<00:03:28.910> back<00:03:28.940> in<00:03:29.300> your<00:03:29.420> head<00:03:29.540> back<00:03:30.350> to

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
your timing back in your head back to

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.040 
your timing back in your head back to
reading<00:03:31.310> plays<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:31.940> making<00:03:32.210> decisions<00:03:32.690> and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
reading plays and making decisions and

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.780

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
you know for me I think that was

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.890 
you know for me I think that was
probably<00:03:34.910> one<00:03:35.150> of<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.270> biggest<00:03:35.420> challenges

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
probably one of the biggest challenges

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.630 
probably one of the biggest challenges
was<00:03:35.960> just<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.830> know<00:03:36.890> reading<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.400> flow<00:03:37.610> of

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
was just you know reading the flow of

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.160 
was just you know reading the flow of
the<00:03:37.790> game<00:03:37.820> and<00:03:38.030> seeing<00:03:38.540> plays<00:03:38.780> as<00:03:39.050> they

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
the game and seeing plays as they

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.130 
the game and seeing plays as they
develop<00:03:39.350> it<00:03:39.770> and<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:41.180> know<00:03:41.270> it's<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:42.020> was

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
develop it and you know it's it was

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.610

something<00:03:42.530> that<00:03:43.030> for<00:03:44.030> me<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.750> felt<00:03:45.200> better<00:03:45.350> as

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
something that for me I felt better as

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.290 
something that for me I felt better as
the<00:03:45.800> year<00:03:46.010> went<00:03:46.130> on<00:03:46.310> unfortunately<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.090> year

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
right now so it's uh it is it's uh it's

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.450 
right now so it's uh it is it's uh it's
the<00:06:04.680> league<00:06:05.460> is<00:06:06.439> you<00:06:07.439> know<00:06:07.560> transition<00:06:08.189> or<00:06:08.279> has

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460
