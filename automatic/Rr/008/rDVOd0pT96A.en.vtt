strong<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> end<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.689> wasn't<00:01:52.020> playing<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.470> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
strong in the end I wasn't playing it a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.010 
strong in the end I wasn't playing it a
bad<00:01:52.950> opponent<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.729> fair<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.240> he<00:01:54.720> wasn't

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
bad opponent to be fair and he wasn't

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
bad opponent to be fair and he wasn't
too<00:01:55.140> bad<00:01:55.350> he<00:01:55.530> tries<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.770> head<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.159> against<00:01:56.520> me

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
too bad he tries to head it against me

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
too bad he tries to head it against me
and<00:01:56.850> then<00:01:56.969> gets<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.390> lucky<00:01:57.659> rebound<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
and then gets that lucky rebound and a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.170 
and then gets that lucky rebound and a
fairly<00:01:58.740> nice<00:01:58.860> finish<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.490> fair<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.090> I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
fairly nice finish to be fair and I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.789 
fairly nice finish to be fair and I
think<00:02:00.420> he<00:02:00.540> went<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:00.960> bit<00:02:01.140> mental<00:02:01.530> as<00:02:01.619> he

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
think he went a little bit mental as he

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.830 
think he went a little bit mental as he
did<00:02:01.979> score<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:02.880> crespo<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:03.450> another

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
did score it but crespo then another

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.719 
did score it but crespo then another
head<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.290> slacking<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.829> against<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.280> bar<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
head of slacking it against the bar and

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.119 
head of slacking it against the bar and
but<00:02:06.509> just<00:02:06.780> comes<00:02:07.049> out<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.530> rebounds<00:02:08.039> it

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
but just comes out and just rebounds it

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.219 
but just comes out and just rebounds it
in<00:02:08.250> right<00:02:08.489> there<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.390> then<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.690> add<00:02:09.840> some<00:02:10.080> more

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
in right there and then to add some more

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.150 
in right there and then to add some more
headed<00:02:10.590> goals<00:02:10.830> in

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
headed goals in

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.770 
headed goals in
this<00:02:11.310> game<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:11.730> could<00:02:11.880> call<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.270> match<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
this game we could call this match the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.030 
this game we could call this match the
game<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.230> headers<00:02:13.560> he<00:02:13.950> does<00:02:14.160> get<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:15.740> 32<00:02:16.740> goal

game of headers he does get that 32 goal

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.280 
game of headers he does get that 32 goal
and<00:02:17.310> then<00:02:17.460> in<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.700> 43<00:02:18.240> 5th<00:02:18.630> minute<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.110> give

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
and then in the 43 5th minute we give

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.960 
and then in the 43 5th minute we give
away<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.710> ridiculous<00:02:20.340> penalty<00:02:20.730> look<00:02:20.880> at

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.270 
away this ridiculous penalty look at
this<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.300> slide<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:22.050> Vertonghen<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.890> he

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
this I slide with Vertonghen and he

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.340 
this I slide with Vertonghen and he
gives<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.670> penalty<00:02:24.060> for<00:02:24.300> an<00:02:24.390> impact<00:02:24.870> engine

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
gives the penalty for an impact engine

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.430

fail<00:02:25.560> with<00:02:25.860> Pepe<00:02:26.250> Wow<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.020> foot<00:02:28.290> to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
fail with Pepe Wow and I get a foot to

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.050 
fail with Pepe Wow and I get a foot to
it<00:02:28.560> as<00:02:28.650> well<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.190> still<00:02:29.460> goes<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> back

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
it as well but it still goes in the back

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.430 
it as well but it still goes in the back
of<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.270> net<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.540> at<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.780> point<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.200> thought<00:02:31.380> I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
of the net and at that point I thought I

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.830 
of the net and at that point I thought I
was<00:02:31.740> stressed<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.700> tried<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.060> case<00:02:33.210> I<00:02:33.510> think

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
was stressed so I tried the case I think

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.600 
was stressed so I tried the case I think
and<00:02:34.020> we<00:02:34.110> went<00:02:34.380> straight<00:02:34.560> back<00:02:34.950> into<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.430> lead

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
and we went straight back into the lead

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.060 
and we went straight back into the lead
there<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.300> 4<00:02:36.630> 3<00:02:36.660> at<00:02:37.200> half<00:02:37.230> time<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.980> an

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
there is a 4 3 at half time to an

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.890 
there is a 4 3 at half time to an
absolute<00:02:38.550> goal<00:02:38.910> fest<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.420> match<00:02:39.690> has<00:02:39.870> been

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
interesting and it's fun to watch but I

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.180 
interesting and it's fun to watch but I
was<00:02:45.780> sort<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.020> dominating<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.650> first<00:02:46.950> half

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
was sort of dominating that first half

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.680 
was sort of dominating that first half
even<00:02:47.550> though<00:02:47.610> he's<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.790> fairly<00:02:48.090> decent<00:02:48.210> player

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
even though he's a fairly decent player

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.230 
even though he's a fairly decent player
and<00:02:48.960> add<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:50.010> headers<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.460> this<00:02:50.640> game<00:02:50.880> he<00:02:51.030> does

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
and add the headers in this game he does

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.450 
and add the headers in this game he does
manage<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.630> equalize<00:02:52.140> therefore<00:02:52.710> all<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.340> my

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
manage to equalize therefore all and my

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.550 
manage to equalize therefore all and my
defense<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:54.150> sort<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.450> went<00:02:54.630> nowhere<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:55.260> few

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
defense just sort of went nowhere a few

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.070 
defense just sort of went nowhere a few
minutes<00:02:55.860> later<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.460> he<00:02:56.640> goes<00:02:56.850> 54<00:02:57.450> up<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:57.900> this

our first hybrid squad that we've built

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.270 
our first hybrid squad that we've built
I'm<00:04:57.810> I<00:04:57.990> definitely<00:04:58.350> would<00:04:58.650> class<00:04:58.890> this<00:04:59.070> as<00:04:59.250> a

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
I'm I definitely would class this as a

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.409 
I'm I definitely would class this as a
hybrid<00:04:59.520> there's<00:04:59.880> loads<00:05:00.120> of<00:05:00.270> different

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
hybrid there's loads of different

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.150 
hybrid there's loads of different
leagues<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.110> nations<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:01.590> stuff<00:05:01.800> in<00:05:01.979> there

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
leagues and nations and stuff in there

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.040 
leagues and nations and stuff in there
and<00:05:02.370> it's<00:05:02.640> difficult<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.270> build<00:05:03.450> around<00:05:03.660> the

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
and it's difficult to build around the

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.719 
and it's difficult to build around the
legends<00:05:04.470> especially<00:05:05.039> with<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.280> chemistry's

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
legends especially with the chemistry's

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.640

that earth that the chemistry like

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.740 
that earth that the chemistry like
balances<00:05:08.610> this<00:05:08.789> year<00:05:09.000> it's<00:05:09.120> really<00:05:09.450> really
