00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
stitch you know how knitting makes the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.190 
stitch you know how knitting makes the
v-stitch<00:00:12.210> instead<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.660> just<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.960> built

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
v-stitch instead of just the built

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.230 
v-stitch instead of just the built
bubbly<00:00:13.620> stuff<00:00:13.920> if<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:14.700> did<00:00:15.000> all<00:00:15.120> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
bubbly stuff if you just did all the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.540 
bubbly stuff if you just did all the
knit<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:16.020> would<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.260> all<00:00:16.379> bubbly<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:16.830> if<00:00:17.490> you

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.900 
did all pearl it would be bubbly but if
you<00:00:19.529> combine<00:00:19.890> knit<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.279> purl<00:00:20.340> then<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.730> get

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
you combine knit and purl then you get

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.640

that you know that chevron V that knit

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.859 
that you know that chevron V that knit
looks<00:00:22.859> like<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> right<00:00:23.699> side<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.720> now

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
looks like on the right side so now

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.540 
looks like on the right side so now
we're<00:00:25.019> going<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.199> purl<00:00:25.439> all<00:00:25.890> right<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.490> you

we're going to purl all right so you

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.580 
we're going to purl all right so you
remember<00:00:27.000> knit<00:00:27.330> when<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.840> knit<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.230> go<00:00:28.380> in

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
remember knit when you knit you go in

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.400 
remember knit when you knit you go in
straight<00:00:29.070> when<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.519> pearl<00:00:30.080> you're<00:00:31.080> going<00:00:31.320> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
straight when you pearl you're going to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.959 
straight when you pearl you're going to
go<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.769> you're<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.130> go<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.640> front

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
go and you're going to go in the front

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.400 
go and you're going to go in the front
of<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.270> stitch<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.840> how<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.989> went<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
of the stitch see how I went in the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.870 
of the stitch see how I went in the
front<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> stitch<00:00:34.980> there<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.520> kind<00:00:35.790> of

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
front of the stitch there and I kind of

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.760 
front of the stitch there and I kind of
hold<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.110> i<00:00:37.290> know<00:00:37.380> i'm<00:00:37.649> not

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
hold on just so that i know i'm not

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.530 
hold on just so that i know i'm not
going<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.040> lose<00:00:38.190> anything<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.270> go<00:00:39.390> in

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
going to lose anything so you go in

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.920 
going to lose anything so you go in
through<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> front<00:00:40.070> around<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.309> front<00:00:41.579> and

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
through the front around the front and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.160 
through the front around the front and
back<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.140> out<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.640> slide<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.700> off<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.300> think

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
back it out and slide it off I think

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.750 
back it out and slide it off I think
pearls<00:00:46.410> actually<00:00:46.800> easier<00:00:47.399> than<00:00:47.460> knitting

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
pearls actually easier than knitting

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.729 
pearls actually easier than knitting
because<00:00:48.360> when<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> knit<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.170> know<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> knit<00:00:49.590> in

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
because when I knit you know I knit in

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.250 
because when I knit you know I knit in
here<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:51.090> look<00:00:51.390> at<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> stitch<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.170> it's

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
here and I look at the stitch and it's

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.810 
here and I look at the stitch and it's
done<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.800> don't<00:00:53.010> know<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.280> some<00:00:53.399> reason<00:00:53.430> it's

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
done I don't know for some reason it's

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.279 
done I don't know for some reason it's
look<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.449> division<00:00:54.899> i<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.199> is

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
look it's like division i think is

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.170 
look it's like division i think is
easier<00:00:55.649> than<00:00:55.710> multiplication<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.850> anyway

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
easier than multiplication but anyway

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.420 
easier than multiplication but anyway
that's<00:00:57.360> another<00:00:57.570> story<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.440> now<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:58.980> put<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
that's another story so now you put the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.889 
that's another story so now you put the
needle<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.180> front<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.469> stitch<00:01:02.899> you

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
needle in the front of the stitch you

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.440 
needle in the front of the stitch you
wrap<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.229> around<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.670> yarn<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.270> ball

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
wrap it around the the yarn the ball

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.560 
wrap it around the the yarn the ball
yarn<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.619> pull<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.979> back<00:01:08.159> through<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.450> we

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
yarn and you pull it back through so we

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.750
