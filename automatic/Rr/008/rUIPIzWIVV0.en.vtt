00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.160
 hi to all of you guys then how 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.080
 promised I also make a video about mine 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.969
 channel regarding the event where 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.430
 i am now in new york and the 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.890
 official presentation of the long 1020 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.490
 that practically new camera phone by 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.990
 nokia 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.119
 in this way we begin inaugurate 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.460
 in short, those who are the most videos 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.699
 not only related to component hardware 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.040
 so lumia 1020 here it is a lot 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:37.739
 similar let's say just like size and 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.479
 also weighing about 50 grams a lumia 920 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.309
 while the memory that there is no longer 25 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:43.960
 thin and a little more stylish with 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.400
 the aluminum profile while this is more 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.110
 similar to courage the characteristic 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.659
 main product of this product is 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.119
 clearly the big camera 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:57.070
 goal you see back here is a 

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:59.830
 41 megapixel sensor capable of 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.000
 capture photos at practically 38 34 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.799
 megapixel based on the source of form 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.869
 then sixteen ninths or four pieces in 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.729
 truth then the photo results for the 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.340
 the highest quality is obviously that of 5 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.829
 practically 5 megapixel megapixels in 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.259
 over sampling means that the 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.759
 sensor captures a photo making solution 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.890
 much higher very detailed then 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.560
 compress I'm trying to trivialize a 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.749
 little bit talks about it to give you an understanding 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.490
 function compresses all 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:30.159
 the big resolution resolution 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.439
 the lowest getting pixels is a lot 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.890
 more detailed then with a quality 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.659
 higher 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.819
 the result is a very very image 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.960
 defined but not only there is also another 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.240
 very feature 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.860
 very interesting that is to be able to 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.810
 make real zooms though 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.580
 they look like tari judges we try to 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.610
 understand the photo that is taken and a lot 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.610
 very big and you can though 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.920
 cut out a portion of that photo 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.560
 so have a sort of zoom and why 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.759
 I know it's nothing but a big one 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.610
 image please take a detail 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.530
 so the zoom results in this one 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.869
 will be a resolution of 5 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.459
 full megapixel therefore still of one 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.650
 very high quality equal to that of 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.450
 many other smartphones something else cia 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.250
 a xenon flash 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.830
 so nothing to do with flashes 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.180
 led and therefore the distance and effectiveness 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.030
 the flash is definitely much higher 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.680
 optical carl zeiss 6 sensor lenses 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.630
 backlit so in short, all 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.670
 features that make this 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.250
 smartphone which I launch this windows poses 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.610
 because based on windows phone 8 one 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.530
 of smartphones with better camera 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.970
 on the market no doubt as to 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.160
 regards the other features is a 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.019
 terminal as said a windows phone is 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.280
 quite similar to those that history of 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.140
 end the eyes long then yes 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.600
 call from 4 5-inch resolution with 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.130
 that strange made 15 noni form from 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:58.100
 1280 x 768 pixels is an amoled screen 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.519
 a dual core platform and always in the 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.680
 know needle at 1.5 ghz 2 gb of ram memory 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.470
 32 GB of storage space and then 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.360
 all features clearly of the 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.820
 world windows phone nokia 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.730
 precisely in this regard 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.580
 just 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.549
 the windows phone world and are present e 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.530
 nokia especially all are present 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.049
 various applications of the service on 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.190
 more smartphones someone will have 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:29.400
 more dedicated to photography as 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.500
 the nokia pro kahn that is desco vi 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.810
 I'll show you my hand behind me now 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.000
 clearly not seen much anyway 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:42.420
 allows you to group on the one 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.700
 screen all the tools we say 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.870
 to act on the flash balancing of the 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.040
 white liso the exposure time was 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.829
 also the trial set up so as to create 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.609
 of creative shots and so it is 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.620
 obviously creative but of high quality 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:01.079
 when it came out on the market it didn't have 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.590
 yet confirmation however stephen elop on 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.730
 stage said he will arrive by the end 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.829
 of this quarter therefore means 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.540
 by September price even here not 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.540
 however definitely defined a price of 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.609
 high end ie 599 699 euros 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.700
 at least in this gap it should be 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:21.000
 inside then guys with a new york guide 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.300
 with the nokia lumia 1020 I would say that everything 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.680
 here this is a kind of let 's say not 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.950
 both a boxing but a presentation 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.620
 they also start doing these on the canal 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.440
 so we go more and more into detail e 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.139
 if there will always be trouble to touch 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.440
 then with hand to see the technology 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.650
 boys 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.110
 for now it is all I repeat lumia milleventi 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.830
 from new york it's all see you there 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.830
 next we do
