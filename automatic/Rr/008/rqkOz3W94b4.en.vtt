00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.339
 hi girls my name is Larisa 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.269
 and this video will be a short review on 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.090
 the order of the shade from ombres in the color 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.530
 of these shadows 1 and 2 grams and so they walked 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.710
 here in this package 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.310
 such a case for them to go 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.490
 Here is such a little book instruction about how 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.750
 better make up these shadows themselves 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 shadows about to summit is not the only 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.579
 minus boxes what she is 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.329
 glossy and she does not advise typos 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.190
 fingers but in principle it does not concern 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.680
 quality so I guess not so 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.160
 stylish problem so here with you shadow 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:50.129
 the colors of the shadows themselves are very versatile 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.219
 You can do as a daily makeup 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.309
 and the evening ones here are these three perfect ones 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.399
 suitable for daytime makeup that is, 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.500
 different combination and if you add 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.660
 a little bit of this color is already obtained 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.960
 more so evening more catchy 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:13.020
 makeup and so now I will make my checks 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.460
 such pigmented shadows are pretty 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:22.979
 racks and all go and a little bit 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.580
 with nacre with such glitter here i am 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.540
 love this color and this one 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.700
 the first and the last like this 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.479
 minus it that i didn't really like in 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.670
 what's in the shadow brush 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:44.149
 almost impossible they begin 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:47.100
 strong dusting and the color itself is not typed 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.600
 in sufficient quantities and accounts 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.670
 enjoy these will be sponzhikami 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.219
 they, too, are already falling more or less with us 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.990
 it is better 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.920
 pretty convenient to impose shadows and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.259
 shadows with pandas and still have to 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.990
 brush with a brush in principle i'm not 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.129
 I think that such a big problem and 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.459
 Naturally a little bit of shadow here 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.230
 all plyatt but it seems to me it's in 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.220
 Basically there is nothing so terrible 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.060
 need to define everything so my first 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.580
 impressions 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.010
 when i started using it 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:28.019
 the first layer that was his was at all 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.670
 unreal how to put on anything he 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.620
 it will be just like a stone and like that 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.560
 here you are erasing but now they are already 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.370
 the second layer there went on already 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.620
 recruited more or less normal so 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.390
 Basically, this is all I wanted for you. 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.510
 tell the shadows are very good 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.480
 quality keeps pretty long 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.010
 colors are universal if someone will 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.829
 opportunity or desire can 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.480
 I get a good denyuzhku further 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:02.750
 I think to purchase from the same collection 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.510
 any shadows probably and either 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.859
 purple shades somewhere there either 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.599
 blue and that's probably all for everyone 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.599
 thanks for watching everyone bye
