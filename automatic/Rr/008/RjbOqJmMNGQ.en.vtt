00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
to the horizon I'm going to lighten off

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.810 
to the horizon I'm going to lighten off
my<00:01:35.610> pressure<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.960> brush<00:01:37.369> which<00:01:38.369> means<00:01:38.640> if

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
my pressure on the brush which means if

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.370 
my pressure on the brush which means if
there's<00:01:38.970> any<00:01:39.090> sort<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.390> residue<00:01:39.869> blue<00:01:40.229> in

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
there's any sort of residue blue in

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.190 
there's any sort of residue blue in
there<00:01:40.619> less<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.520> look<00:01:41.729> like<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.210> then<00:01:42.689> you

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
there less and look like that then you

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020 
there less and look like that then you
want<00:01:43.380> less<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.799> less<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.189> come<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.490> as

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
want less and less of it to come out as

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.120 
want less and less of it to come out as
we<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:45.960> towards<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> horizon<00:01:46.470> there<00:01:46.950> don't

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
we get towards the horizon there don't

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.560 
we get towards the horizon there don't
worry<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> darker<00:01:48.149> blue<00:01:48.329> patch

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
worry if you get a darker blue patch

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.200 
worry if you get a darker blue patch
there<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.020> everything<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.590> corrected

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
there we get everything can be corrected

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.580 
there we get everything can be corrected
okay

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
okay

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.399

backward and forward let us start the

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.500 
backward and forward let us start the
bottom<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.100> work<00:03:26.250> out<00:03:26.459> it's<00:03:26.700> always<00:03:26.880> start

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
the top and work down okay so it's

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.780 
the top and work down okay so it's
starting<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.769> I'm<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.190> stepping<00:03:35.430> back<00:03:35.670> and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
starting to I'm just stepping back and

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.030 
starting to I'm just stepping back and
having<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.090> closer<00:03:36.840> look<00:03:37.079> here<00:03:37.380> but<00:03:37.799> I<00:03:37.829> think

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
having a closer look here but I think

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.580 
having a closer look here but I think
it's<00:03:38.160> starting<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.970> take<00:03:39.450> on<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.750> right<00:03:39.959> feel

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590

it's starting to take on the right feel
but<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:41.760> wonder<00:03:42.030> when<00:03:42.299> it'll<00:03:42.450> touch<00:03:42.750> more

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989
