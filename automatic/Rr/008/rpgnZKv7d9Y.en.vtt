00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.040
 am owner of two dogs and 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.750
 I live very close to Buttes Chaumont 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.760
 and I would have liked to know what is your 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.930
 opinion on the possibility of making a 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.930
 canine space 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.040
 a dog park here in the big sound 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.930
 hello philippe and thank you for asking 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.600
 this question comes up regularly 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.379
 first of all definition what is a 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.500
 dog park 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.720
 it is a large fenced area dedicated to 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.430
 dog owners in which they 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.370
 can go and release their 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.130
 companions behind me you can see 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.500
 business park we thongs 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.060
 we were t four years ago then 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.590
 let's see together what are the benefits 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.890
 and the disadvantages of such 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.890
 installation 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.920
 an anne park quite noisy for not 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.690
 have a general petition of the inhabitants 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.670
 of the neighborhood against his presence 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.740
 they must be located far from 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.050
 dwellings wherever they are in a 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.659
 extremely noisy environment for 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.819
 what is the other parks d'asnières 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.130
 just look next for 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.909
 understand why there is no 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.750
 complaints from residents 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.270
 he ay ay 6-3 double track and a subway 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.679
 aerial passing next to the park anne 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.990
 so at the noise level no problem 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.400
 then on the other hand 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.170
 given the density of the 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.360
 population of a bet given the influx 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.829
 obvious that it would spawn a park 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.810
 canine received mounds chaumont by 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.390
 example would generate barking 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.120
 permanent conflict of use between 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.349
 dog owners and a maximum of 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.349
 complaints from surrounding people 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.040
 in theory 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.200
 in theory only a dog park is 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.239
 a friendly place where meet the 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.040
 dog owners and cadors of 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.650
 all kinds that can run and 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.080
 play fun so this principle does not 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.790
 applies only if the dogs that are there 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.340
 find are sociable and who are 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.660
 perfectly educated unfortunately the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.830
 users by cana are not 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.769
 always at the forefront in this area 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.019
 many consider their dog as 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.600
 nice who nice baby who does not 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.850
 seek only to play then the experience 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.730
 shows us that many dogs 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.350
 can in just a few days 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.239
 own this fenced space to have 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.640
 behaviors not always 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.980
 appropriate even aggressive that's why 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.050
 so that he remains friendly he is 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.030
 essential 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.550
 for y &amp; r handles their dogs properly 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.110
 and a minimum of ability to drive them 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.450
 that's why we 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.940
 organize another dog park 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.300
 free canine education classes each 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.300
 week 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.030
 some indelicate owners do not 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.890
 sees the dog park that as a place 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.260
 where they can do needs 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.239
 their dogs these 100 young people come 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.280
 when there is nobody and leaves us 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.680
 the poop of their dogs as a souvenir 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.209
 result even though the majority of people 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.190
 pick up there may be in this 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.760
 space a maximum of excrement at the end 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.650
 a few hours 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.450
 today we have found by 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.450
 misfortune ask the question you will see 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.450
 well 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:04.050
 at the top level pickup level 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.220
 droppings today 48 do there 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.260
 for example in the dog park 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.910
 while the majority of people pick up 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.560
 of easter to all these people pick up there 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.610
 need education course with us but 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.820
 we had anyway 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.140
 in a few days 48 droppings that have 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.910
 been left in the dog park 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.560
 that is to say that the principle of 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:25.080
 pickup even in a place like this 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.750
 it's not about winning any of the problems 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.140
 parks Canada is also that we have 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.610
 tendency to want to divide for not 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.470
 to have problems in the city 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.990
 that is, we tend to want 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.540
 to make parks for children parks 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.060
 for elderly dogs courses 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.320
 it is clear that for us the important 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.090
 is that dogs are accepted 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.250
 everywhere in the city ie 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.680
 me who have children for example I 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.540
 will be able to go for a walk with my 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.880
 dogs my children everywhere I 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.230
 pick up my dog ​​well educated why 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.610
 have a dog park obligation 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.020
 as the saying goes 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.460
 hell is paved with a good holiday 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.169
 those who believe that dog parks 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.490
 on the panacea for the dog be 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.280
 appreciated are mistakenly 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:10.470
 a dog park is an alternative that has 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.470
 some benefits is by name 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.310
 1
