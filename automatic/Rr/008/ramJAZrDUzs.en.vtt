00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.109
 nice guys here advanced leek and they are 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.960
 here in this time with for a tutorial 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.299
 not for gameplay of amnesia or 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.039
 minecraft are here for a tutorial that 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:21.380
 we say in Italian on youtube not 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.449
 found or at least not not personally 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.180
 the topic that I will treat you today and how 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.390
 overclock a video card 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.000
 then this we say in quotation marks the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.520
 Overclocking problem is a topic 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.940
 which really plagues many people who 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.860
 in practice they do not know to place one 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.469
 video card including me indeed not 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.020
 I still knew I don't know why I care for one 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.940
 video card through the bios for who e 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.590
 through the bios 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.600
 how to say a very proceeding 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.199
 risky and also risks 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.070
 irreversibly damage 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:01.129
 flexibly the video card and then 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.430
 set to take the pc and throw it away 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:08.299
 I informed myself so I found this 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.970
 program called msi afterburner 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.920
 which in practice allows overclocking 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.920
 the video card only by installing 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.400
 this little program then we pass 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.299
 immediately to the tutorial to download it is 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.390
 easy just go to google 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.420
 would write 6 after burner and download it 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.360
 here from softonic overclocking sales of the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.770
 graphic card you download it and start at 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.540
 this will show you the file of 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.210
 installation of another program yes 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.600
 call msi with bookstore 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.450
 in practice this msi afterburner server 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.299
 overclock the video card while msi 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.850
 with a horror bust, it's so called 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.420
 serves to measure the performance of the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.500
 video card through a kind of video 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:05.040
 let's say an animation and measure fps 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.069
 measuring all in practice fps with i 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.509
 graphic details you want then you 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.510
 this applies to all types of cards 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:17.819
 video in particular mine 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.590
 ie an ati mobility radeon hd 5470 from 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.220
 512 thousand 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.180
 I know that doing the 3rd lousy I know 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.180
 in fact I have a laptop 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.500
 in practice my values 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:35.700
 my values and these are those 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.849
 normal the core clock 7 50 and memory 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.069
 fire 800 while the maximum overclock 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.500
 what can I do for my video card and 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.659
 of a jive is not to the body that I have 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.870
 wrong to write 850 m died clock 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.900
 of 960 more than this is better not 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.459
 overcome because you could too 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.940
 risk compromising the card 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.690
 video while still setting the 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.750
 temperature go from 60 to maximum 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.420
 normal and 60 65 while for share from 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.030
 even reach 70 75 but no more 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.769
 I also played for quite a while 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.500
 of time to bad company 2 and did not have me 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.949
 given no type of problem played for 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.359
 an hour and a half is all normal 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:21.000
 the nice thing also about this 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.620
 program program that opens it 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.699
 appears from this screen 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.500
 the beautiful thing because we can 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.129
 overclock the video card when 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.799
 we want 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.930
 and for example I have already saved mine 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.180
 profile 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.549
 now by name, don't forget me 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.180
 maximum values I informed myself and I am 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:46.319
 I am saved in the 850 notepad 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:54.660
 core clock the maximum is 960 m 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:56.699
 died clock no 60 ok it's kobe 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.190
 once done here is the screen 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:01.650
 of the temperature of the use of the people 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.780
 for new retouching once done we are 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.269
 of those changes 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.530
 just upload and watch 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:12.490
 automatically i 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.100
 the maximum of flop memories rises to 960 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.250
 precisely it is the maximum of the oxa le body 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:22.630
 850 exactly as we set one 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:26.320
 once done, make save select the 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:31.600
 profile always selects 1 and profile 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.310
 saved and when we say I waited 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:39.280
 I advise you to do this overclock 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.140
 only when we say do you have to play that 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.080
 you have to play at so I need a 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.200
 more use of video card and in 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.690
 so let's say not to compromise it 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.520
 also because I tested it for maximum 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.169
 an hour and a half no more and he didn't 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.240
 furthermore no problem whatsoever 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:59.410
 temperature after it becomes enough 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.260
 so warmly there is around 70 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.080
 75 no more 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.610
 once done that you don't want to 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.760
 return the default values ​​is enough 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.270
 do reset and then return to the values 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.430
 defaults look indeed fell 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.960
 immediately when you want or for 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:23.979
 bring her back from video is enough 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:26.740
 making one is going to immediately go up if maybe cases 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:29.289
 make applique appropriately yet a 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.160
 in fact it immediately goes to reset immediately 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.390
 comes down and this is a good method for 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.840
 temporarily overclock the card 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.060
 video or let's say when you want you can 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.950
 also keep it for coppata forever 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.330
 its still not discourage me 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.450
 because you can never know 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.539
 the damage it causes I repeat myself with 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.800
 I never have these settings 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:55.810
 no errors found for 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:00.850
 this I repeat for a video card ati 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:05.560
 mobility radeon hd 5470 from 512 thousand here 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.880
 forget a series of 5,400 and I 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.729
 I'm informed on the internet I found 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.260
 these maximum values inform yourself about 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:16.000
 Internet the maximum values 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:19.480
 or write a return a t 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.220
 bush does not write them the core clock 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.830
 maximums of your card 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:30.110
 video and memory koch at most e 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:32.420
 set easy values to how it was 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.190
 said on the net we also try 1 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.800
 people up cover clocking the system 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.870
 start up will open the over cro lover 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.690
 fire when you start the system 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.640
 personally I keep it disabled 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:47.660
 once done before doing this you 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:50.540
 I recommend using that bus program 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.730
 I come back I remember the name well do a test 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.790
 of benefits and come to how many f 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:58.070
 how many frames per second does the la 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.900
 your overclocked video card you make it 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.750
 another test and see how many frames 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:07.670
 I personally get minimal details 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:10.580
 if I'm not mistaken I arrived about 45 50 fps 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:16.070
 while overclocking also came to 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:17.630
 65 70 we say is not a is not very high 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.160
 then anyway it depends on your card 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:23.360
 life of my life is not suitable for 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:27.050
 however, however, there was a play 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.100
 slight drop in palomar a slight 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.340
 fps increase 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.440
 I was really very happy 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.240
 nothing this tutorial ends here though 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.870
 video that was useful click me 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:41.960
 like to comment to let me know 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:45.790
 any errors or doubts and write 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.790
 live it a beautiful girl video that
