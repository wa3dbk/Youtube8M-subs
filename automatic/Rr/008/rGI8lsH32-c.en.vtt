00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.680
 a new video of this video goes 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.530
 it's a really cool aluminum case 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.099
 for the iphone 5 from the home mirror 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.099
 have fun 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.600
 because here is the line lightning case 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.630
 from Spiegel and here they see for the first time 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.680
 the scope of delivery and that consists of 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.140
 share three 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.140
 the back here the backplate is off 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.610
 100 percent aluminum made and that 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.350
 shows later still are really 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.270
 really cool from now we look 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.930
 first something else changes here 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.590
 box, this is also very high quality 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.000
 designed as I think 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.230
 and yes, we have one in the back 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.940
 how to install the 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.450
 church can put on here 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.129
 iphone 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.180
 and then we have a little one 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.860
 we have a lot of stuff with all sorts of stuff 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.260
 here once home button 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.989
 one can here on the homebutton from 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.850
 glue iphone and then you still have to 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.909
 Protection for the home button 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.530
 Furthermore , there is one more 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.590
 screen protector cloth around one 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.020
 screen protector for this the front 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.970
 side is iphones is also with 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.240
 they are already very many 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.290
 ZugehÃ¶r thing still in the process is still such a 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.850
 Prospect about mirror 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.520
 if I do not keep up with it now 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.189
 deal and yes com is like that 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.020
 actual case worst case on iphone 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.790
 I recommend you to install before 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.549
 again the back of the iphone 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.079
 to clean up that he does not 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.939
 dust particles on the back 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.310
 then on it are then possibly 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.530
 can lead to that the iphone one 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.119
 I could get some scratch so have 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.219
 all now indeed been made 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.439
 and then you go next 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.119
 this part here and the buttons that 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.430
 course on the right side of 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.659
 it can be iphone here 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.960
 shove 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.979
 and then this is the aluminum 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.439
 back here and then keeps it that way here 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.679
 firmly so that looks like last 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.530
 you have to this good plastic ones as 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.150
 bottom and then reinstetten so here 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.280
 leave yes and I have to say the whole 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.440
 really really good from the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.840
 Aluminum back cover fits the case 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.700
 really very good to the iphone and 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.160
 as well as this route edge here 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.020
 The bottom looks really nice too 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.940
 out has a very nice contrast to 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.659
 iphone and we will also look up again 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.970
 the back of the lettering may linear 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.730
 yes to the line lightning case of 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.650
 We now come to the mirror 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.730
 recesses and let's start with the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.860
 page on 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.989
 Here we have for the 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.030
 newspush this can be really synonymous 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.830
 very good we are doing here 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.750
 and then we have the buttons here 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.450
 this one is not spared one 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.879
 recess for and that is 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.069
 namely here for extra bartels 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.810
 hard plastic and these can be 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.900
 have back really very very good 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.110
 a very good pressure point and just like that 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.290
 it is also up here with the button for 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.659
 The power button come to the camera 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.250
 Save on the back of the case 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.239
 this really very much more precise 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.010
 cut out 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.129
 you do not see a strip of 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.409
 graphite back of the iphone and man 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.390
 then has no problem with photos 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.330
 and the lightning and so on is everything 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.150
 very fitting now come to expand 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.090
 for the bottom case here is too 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.340
 All very well cut out headphones 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.799
 and the dock connector speaker 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.900
 Microphone at the headphones with one 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.180
 larger plastic jacket down here 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.739
 or with larger sheathing for the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.480
 probably it could be here 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.269
 there are a few problems there 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.220
 recess not quite so made for it 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.349
 but is for the normal headphones for 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.360
 the airports and so on 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.250
 do not have such a big casing down 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.519
 the jack plug here really 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.069
 wonderful here are at samuel top 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.170
 with the display and you have a whole 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.060
 his small label ii 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.610
 that is when the iphone with the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.400
 display is first on the table or 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.470
 so then this is all on this one 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.599
 edge of the case and not directly on the case 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.939
 display what, of course, for protection 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.680
 the display is here at your side 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:18.769
 we have again the lettering of 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.380
 mirror and there is already to 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.000
 conclusion of this case I find this case 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.090
 really good that are easy 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.920
 awesome on the black iphone 5 out there 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.160
 it altogether in three different 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.700
 colors on the website costs the case 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.500
 31 dollars 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.969
 but at Amazon you can find them too 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.459
 already for 24 euros 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.769
 this, together with as always below in 

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:42.389
 the video description at the first 

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:45.299
 I already heard that version there 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.459
 it probably a few problems with the wifi 

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:50.129
 but then play has to respond 

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:52.769
 then has a second version of this case 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:55.529
 rausgebracht and here there is this 

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:57.269
 No more problems and would be considered tests 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.069
 As I said, I could not do any 

00:04:57.269 --> 00:05:00.209
 problems with the wifi notice 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.329
 Here I have now again a 

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:05.639
 screenshot where it once without cases and 

00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:07.619
 once with case and the difference is 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.129
 very very low that is also quite 

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:12.899
 normal so other damage to the 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.579
 I could not do that either 

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:16.499
 notice that there are any scratches 

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:17.099
 caused by the aluminum 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:19.829
 or so 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.689
 That's really not the case if you are 

00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:22.729
 The case does not decrease every day 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.499
 and then it actually happens 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.269
 nothing if you use the case but every day 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:30.029
 update there can ever be that one 

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:31.889
 few small scratches can arise there 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:34.199
 here are around sharp edges of 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.989
 aluminum and so on is why 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.729
 but otherwise I find her case 

00:05:36.989 --> 00:05:39.659
 really very good you can 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.569
 just recommend 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.849
 and yes take a look at the website 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.800
 and otherwise that's it 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.509
 again from this video as always though 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.339
 you like it too 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:53.249
 thumb up or subscribe me 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:53.939
 below simply no further videos 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:55.499
 to miss 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:57.269
 I'm actually too much for you 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:58.259
 wish you a nice day and there 

00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:01.459
 We see ourselves again in 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.459
 next video bye
