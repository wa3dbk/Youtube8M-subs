00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.420
 for me it was always the most beautiful in 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.280
 the workshop stand that this 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.639
 welding popp was not 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.639
 Of course 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:23.270
 per day are still measured necessarily 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.270
 know how my life actually is 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:34.640
 that's just so familiar between me 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.750
 try your first switzerland and today 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.300
 Lying around 30 years have learned 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.660
 robert and stefan k welding from 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:51.199
 father and how are the two 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:53.210
 actually, every artist has to do with technology 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.530
 that actually nothing at all 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.449
 to the gate for what made 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.340
 the weld is out 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:05.089
 use creative line that 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.460
 for our main features the two are 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.410
 Grown up with welding torches and in front 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.970
 all robert structures are 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.539
 meanwhile also quite big 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.539
 become 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.940
 The lettering love and peace will 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:19.060
 five and a half meters high and is for one 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.990
 park in shanghai definitely 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:30.470
 sweaty project is on everyone 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:34.130
 exhausting with mask on and drove 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.289
 his point of view is the eight hours around 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.530
 200 working hours are stuck in the 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:43.149
 sculpture is the working style of the brothers 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.149
 anything but straightforward 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.060
 various blanks before 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.580
 materials and that to black 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.649
 the heat transfer shortens and 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.989
 in that different ready for 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.599
 actually shimmer and it works 

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:58.340
 Of course, it also has to be a lot 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:01.310
 more work of this matthiesen groth 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.520
 cut it still can it is far 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.920
 less work 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.190
 the brothers are for more work and more 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.190
 are multifaceted and pass the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.890
 Motto welds are constructed and 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.629
 Once again the ideas are destroyed 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.629
 almost from the two artists 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.170
 actually finished objects my head and 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.170
 what you are looking forward to that again never 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.110
 Again, sitting outside is really like that 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.110
 that something is safe 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.030
 next to limited brain it is coming 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.090
 I'm very thankful for that somewhere 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.480
 that's the nicest thing of mine 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.670
 live that creativity and that 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.920
 can live this way 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.930
 Stefan is the master of the cup already 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.190
 third time finished the handball 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.450
 Champions league cup 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.599
 he is proud of it only gives up 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.280
 this symbol of victory and for milieus 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.209
 artist reports best it is one 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.069
 folie it is also in the museum is the 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.170
 Brothers' work is worldwide 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.650
 distributed from the bar in bischofshofen 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.340
 to the park in china and they are always 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.280
 different again 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.519
 the fascination with welding, however, remains 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.519
 the same 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:24.970
 noise while the brain somewhere in the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.250
 space or passed around on 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.980
 In the sweat of her face arises 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.350
 great but artistic 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.310
 altitude flights are the brothers even on 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.310
 ground remained 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.340
 where the mountains are such 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.340
 war 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.150
 usually make the biggest and puke
