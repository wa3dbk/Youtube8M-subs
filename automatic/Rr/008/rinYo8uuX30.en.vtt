00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
scientific paper on it and they very few

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.039 
scientific paper on it and they very few
people<00:02:35.590> swim<00:02:35.980> at<00:02:36.129> night<00:02:36.159> in<00:02:36.670> deep<00:02:36.700> water<00:02:37.180> if

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
people swim at night in deep water if

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.990 
people swim at night in deep water if
more<00:02:38.560> people<00:02:38.739> swim<00:02:39.099> at<00:02:39.250> night<00:02:39.400> if<00:02:39.640> we<00:02:39.760> had<00:02:39.879> like

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
more people swim at night if we had like

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.520 
more people swim at night if we had like
a<00:02:40.060> Waikiki<00:02:40.299> mob<00:02:40.780> out<00:02:40.989> there<00:02:41.019> in<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.379> deep

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
a Waikiki mob out there in the deep

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.349 
a Waikiki mob out there in the deep
water<00:02:41.799> at<00:02:41.980> night<00:02:42.010> there<00:02:42.790> would<00:02:42.909> be<00:02:42.939> more<00:02:43.150> bites

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
water at night there would be more bites

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.580 
water at night there would be more bites
because<00:02:43.780> they're<00:02:43.959> an<00:02:44.019> extremely<00:02:44.500> aggressive

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
because they're an extremely aggressive

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.780 
because they're an extremely aggressive
shark<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.989> it<00:02:47.440> there<00:02:48.129> is<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> scientific

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
shark and so it there is a scientific

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.399 
shark and so it there is a scientific
paper<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.239> was<00:02:49.299> just<00:02:49.510> written<00:02:49.629> on<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:49.989> well
