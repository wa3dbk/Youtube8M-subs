00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
attachments it's very simple this is the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.380 
attachments it's very simple this is the
hair<00:00:38.670> dryer<00:00:39.440> can<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.620> recognize<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.730> this

hair dryer can you recognize it and this

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.430 
hair dryer can you recognize it and this
is<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.690> hairbrush

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
is the hairbrush

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.889 
is the hairbrush
now<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:44.010> written<00:00:44.340> as<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.670> roller<00:00:44.940> brush<00:00:45.360> so

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
now it's written as the roller brush so

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.389 
now it's written as the roller brush so
I<00:00:45.930> thought<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.680> would<00:00:46.890> actually<00:00:46.950> be

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
I thought that this would actually be

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.170 
I thought that this would actually be
rotating<00:00:48.210> when<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.570> applied<00:00:49.610> onto<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
rotating when it's applied onto the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.000 
rotating when it's applied onto the
styler<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> thought<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.140> would<00:00:52.289> be<00:00:52.440> rotating

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
styler I thought it would be rotating

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.670 
styler I thought it would be rotating
like<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.789> doesn't<00:00:54.149> rotate

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
like that but it doesn't rotate

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.080 
like that but it doesn't rotate
so<00:00:55.680> why<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.129> called<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> roller<00:00:56.610> brush<00:00:56.910> I

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
so why it's called the roller brush I

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.700 
so why it's called the roller brush I
