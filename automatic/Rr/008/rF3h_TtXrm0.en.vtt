00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.310
 the tree there to give him guys 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.549

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.340
 i realize if in my that a 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.130

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:26.170
 already for nothing and more when I want 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.869

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.230
 redo continues in combat and that three 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.960
 cards seconds later it's going to be the 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.210
 end of my turn and that suddenly there is 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.880
 Saving the flavor is suddenly 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.590

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.620
 I remain serious when I arrive in front of a 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.750
 dungeon that I enter all my characters 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.420

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.420
 kind when you go to heavenly court that 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.380

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.460
 that there are no more prisms for tp and 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.410

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.380
