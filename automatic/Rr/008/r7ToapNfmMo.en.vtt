I<00:02:07.799> got<00:02:07.950> oh<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.580> then<00:02:08.959> this<00:02:09.959> was<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.619> think<00:02:10.649> I

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
I got oh and then this was I think I

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.460 
I got oh and then this was I think I
lost<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.270> receipt<00:02:12.720> I

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
lost the receipt I

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.040 
lost the receipt I
I<00:02:13.560> think<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.280> threw<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.580> away<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:16.700> heard<00:02:17.700> nice

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
I think I threw it away but I heard nice

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.750 
I think I threw it away but I heard nice
this<00:02:19.050> was<00:02:19.260> two<00:02:19.500> dollars<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.070> seventy<00:02:20.520> cents

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
this was two dollars and seventy cents

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.550 
this was two dollars and seventy cents
and<00:02:21.680> then<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:24.030> think<00:02:24.200> was<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.260> little<00:02:25.470> bit

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and then this I think was a little bit

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.260 
and then this I think was a little bit
more<00:02:25.740> expensive<00:02:25.950> because<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.760> made<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
more expensive because it is made of the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.380 
more expensive because it is made of the
goats<00:02:27.480> hair<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.500> think<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:28.830> was<00:02:28.950> maybe<00:02:29.390> 450

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
goats hair and I think it was maybe 450

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.720 
goats hair and I think it was maybe 450
