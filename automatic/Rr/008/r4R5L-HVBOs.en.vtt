kind of into the consumer end of it
which<00:02:22.790> helped<00:02:23.060> me<00:02:23.390> transition<00:02:23.870> away<00:02:24.200> from

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
which helped me transition away from

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.679 
which helped me transition away from
racing<00:02:25.189> and<00:02:25.400> guests<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.670> little<00:02:25.849> bit<00:02:26.000> and

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
racing and guests a little bit and

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.390 
racing and guests a little bit and
Tucker<00:02:26.900> started<00:02:27.200> race<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.769> of<00:02:27.859> course<00:02:28.069> I<00:02:28.189> was

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
Tucker started race and of course I was

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.170 
Tucker started race and of course I was
still<00:02:28.609> heavy<00:02:29.390> in<00:02:29.599> my<00:02:29.629> racing<00:02:30.170> career<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:32.090> know

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
still heavy in my racing career you know

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.119 
still heavy in my racing career you know
as<00:02:32.299> soon<00:02:32.480> as<00:02:32.599> I<00:02:32.720> was<00:02:32.870> old<00:02:33.170> enough<00:02:33.349> to<00:02:33.680> realize

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
as soon as I was old enough to realize

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.369 
as soon as I was old enough to realize
what<00:02:34.159> racing<00:02:34.879> was<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.510> just<00:02:35.689> new<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.260> know

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
what racing was and just new you know

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.199 
what racing was and just new you know
instantly<00:02:36.859> that's<00:02:37.280> what<00:02:37.489> I<00:02:37.519> wanted<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.849> do<00:02:38.030> and

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
instantly that's what I wanted to do and

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.960 
instantly that's what I wanted to do and
I<00:02:38.269> think<00:02:38.480> that's<00:02:38.659> why<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.870> started<00:02:39.290> kind<00:02:39.620> of

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
I think that's why I started kind of

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.250 
I think that's why I started kind of
fabricating<00:02:40.970> these<00:02:41.120> races<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.659> my<00:02:41.780> mind<00:02:42.019> when

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
fabricating these races in my mind when

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.410 
fabricating these races in my mind when
I<00:02:42.290> was<00:02:42.469> driving<00:02:42.680> around<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.280> yard<00:02:43.459> just<00:02:43.849> it

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
I was driving around the yard just it

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.720 
I was driving around the yard just it
was<00:02:44.540> always<00:02:44.719> a<00:02:44.870> race<00:02:45.139> and<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:45.920> from<00:02:46.370> then<00:02:46.549> on<00:02:46.579> I

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
was always a race and so from then on I

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.820

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
you know I think the demands that are

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.250 
you know I think the demands that are
out<00:04:22.370> there<00:04:22.400> now<00:04:22.610> are<00:04:22.790> so<00:04:23.180> much<00:04:23.240> more<00:04:23.990> and

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
out there now are so much more and

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.930 
out there now are so much more and
different<00:04:24.440> than<00:04:24.800> what<00:04:25.010> my<00:04:25.280> dad<00:04:25.490> dealt<00:04:25.760> with

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
different than what my dad dealt with

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.840 
different than what my dad dealt with
that<00:04:26.750> it<00:04:26.900> just<00:04:27.080> forced<00:04:27.410> us<00:04:27.560> to<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:28.400> make<00:04:28.639> this

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
that it just forced us to to make this

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.550 
that it just forced us to to make this
sled<00:04:29.120> work<00:04:29.300> better<00:04:29.540> and<00:04:29.750> make<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:29.990> suspension

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
sled work better and make the suspension

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.110 
sled work better and make the suspension
better<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.130> company<00:04:31.430> like<00:04:31.610> Fox<00:04:31.880> has

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
better and the company like Fox has

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.330 
better and the company like Fox has
stepped<00:04:32.389> up<00:04:32.570> and<00:04:32.780> been<00:04:33.139> there<00:04:33.380> every<00:04:33.740> every

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
stepped up and been there every every

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
part of that you know just figuring out

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.659 
part of that you know just figuring out
ways<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.320> make<00:04:36.560> everything<00:04:36.950> better<00:04:37.220> and<00:04:37.520> work
