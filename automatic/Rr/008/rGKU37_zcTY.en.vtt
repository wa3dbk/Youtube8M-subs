play<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.880> absolute<00:01:54.210> best<00:01:54.479> way<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.840> you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
play so the absolute best way that you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.690 
play so the absolute best way that you
can<00:01:55.079> do<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.439> get<00:01:55.649> yourself<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> zone<00:01:56.520> as

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
can do that get yourself in the zone as

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.249 
can do that get yourself in the zone as
they<00:01:56.850> call<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.299> get<00:01:57.479> yourself<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> flow

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
they call it get yourself in the flow

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.139 
they call it get yourself in the flow
the<00:01:58.799> best<00:01:59.040> way<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.189> do<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.880> put<00:02:00.000> on

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
the best way to do that is to put on

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.569 
the best way to do that is to put on
some<00:02:00.420> songs<00:02:00.689> thing<00:02:00.930> yeah<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.350> may<00:02:01.619> want<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.490> be

some songs thing yeah you may want to be

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.209 
some songs thing yeah you may want to be
able<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.820> play<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:04.350> maybe<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.009> can't

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219

wanting to play guitar I certainly did

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.400 
wanting to play guitar I certainly did
not<00:02:11.260> spend<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.130> majority<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.760> my<00:02:13.150> youth<00:02:13.660> sort

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.000 
not spend the majority of my youth sort
of<00:02:14.650> with<00:02:15.430> guitar<00:02:15.850> being<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.360> best<00:02:17.170> part<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.740> my

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
of with guitar being the best part of my

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.550 
of with guitar being the best part of my
day<00:02:18.360> by<00:02:19.360> just<00:02:19.660> playing<00:02:19.870> scales<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.410> whole

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
day by just playing scales the whole

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.530 
day by just playing scales the whole
time<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.040> had<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.400> spend<00:02:21.670> some<00:02:21.910> amount<00:02:22.240> of<00:02:22.360> my

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
time I had to spend some amount of my

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.800 
time I had to spend some amount of my
practice<00:02:23.020> routine<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:24.300> getting<00:02:25.300> myself<00:02:25.450> into

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
practice routine and getting myself into

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.240 
practice routine and getting myself into
it<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.170> I'd<00:02:26.260> be<00:02:26.380> playing<00:02:26.560> songs<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.160> know

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
it so I'd be playing songs that I know

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.310 
it so I'd be playing songs that I know
sums<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.000> enjoyed<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.720> songs<00:02:29.230> that

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
sums that I enjoyed and songs that

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.590 
sums that I enjoyed and songs that
really<00:02:29.709> got<00:02:29.890> me<00:02:30.040> into<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.430> zone<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.910> if<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.480> was

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
really got me into the zone and if I was

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.580 
really got me into the zone and if I was
smart<00:02:31.959> about<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.320> I'd<00:02:33.190> be<00:02:33.840> playing<00:02:34.840> songs<00:02:35.230> that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
smart about it I'd be playing songs that

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.430 
smart about it I'd be playing songs that
would<00:02:35.680> also<00:02:35.890> I'd<00:02:36.430> be<00:02:37.330> working<00:02:37.750> on<00:02:37.870> as<00:02:38.020> well

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
would also I'd be working on as well

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.440 
would also I'd be working on as well
that<00:02:38.500> maybe<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:38.950> could<00:02:39.220> see<00:02:39.430> used<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:40.240> major

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
that maybe I could see used the major

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.360 
that maybe I could see used the major
scale<00:02:40.870> or<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.230> pentatonic<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.040> could<00:02:42.220> see

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
scale or the pentatonic and I could see

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.520 
scale or the pentatonic and I could see
the<00:02:42.520> shapes<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.910> was<00:02:43.030> using<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.540> help<00:02:43.720> me<00:02:43.900> but

guitar sized ukulele four strings and

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.920 
guitar sized ukulele four strings and
that<00:03:12.070> were<00:03:12.190> doubled<00:03:12.580> up<00:03:12.760> with<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.269> octaves<00:03:13.690> so

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
that were doubled up with the octaves so

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.800 
that were doubled up with the octaves so
kind<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.350> like<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.470> twelve<00:03:14.799> string<00:03:15.010> but<00:03:15.880> yeah

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
kind of like a twelve string but yeah

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.140 
kind of like a twelve string but yeah
the<00:03:17.019> tuning<00:03:17.530> was<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.799> same<00:03:17.980> as<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.190> ukulele<00:03:18.760> and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
the tuning was the same as a ukulele and

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.759 
the tuning was the same as a ukulele and
I<00:03:19.299> do<00:03:19.360> have<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.720> ukulele<00:03:20.140> so<00:03:20.320> I<00:03:20.440> could<00:03:20.620> have<00:03:20.739> a

little<00:03:20.980> play<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.549> but<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.760> was<00:03:21.850> very

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
little play of it but it was very

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150 
little play of it but it was very
different<00:03:22.420> than<00:03:22.750> having<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.440> little<00:03:23.709> Jam<00:03:23.980> with

those<00:03:30.250> kind<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.820> situations<00:03:31.060> but<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.840> was<00:03:32.019> the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
those kind of situations but it was the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.039
