00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
in this way something to be careful of

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.590 
in this way something to be careful of
is<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.540> make<00:03:31.750> sure<00:03:31.780> these<00:03:32.140> Leafs<00:03:32.590> on<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.010> side

right<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:38.980> don't<00:03:39.670> grab<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:42.519> it's<00:03:42.670> just<00:03:42.880> a

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
right and don't grab so it's just a

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.729 
right and don't grab so it's just a
matter<00:03:43.060> of<00:03:43.299> pushing<00:03:43.600> back<00:03:43.900> into<00:03:44.170> place

problem with that but it's a great thing

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.939 
problem with that but it's a great thing
to<00:07:23.830> have<00:07:24.069> the<00:07:24.370> plastic<00:07:25.319> plastic<00:07:26.319> on<00:07:26.710> there

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:26.949 
to have the plastic plastic on there

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:29.309 
to have the plastic plastic on there
just<00:07:27.189> to<00:07:27.310> prevent<00:07:27.750> for<00:07:28.750> example<00:07:29.080> if<00:07:29.169> your

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:29.319 
just to prevent for example if your

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:32.189 
just to prevent for example if your
child<00:07:29.349> was<00:07:29.740> to<00:07:29.860> bring<00:07:30.009> it<00:07:30.159> a<00:07:30.250> shower<00:07:30.490> and<00:07:31.199> they

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 
child was to bring it a shower and they

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:34.529 
child was to bring it a shower and they
whipped<00:07:32.469> it<00:07:32.620> right<00:07:32.800> over<00:07:33.330> they<00:07:34.330> could

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:34.539 
whipped it right over they could

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:36.450 
whipped it right over they could
possibly<00:07:34.750> get<00:07:35.080> burnt<00:07:35.349> having<00:07:36.189> that<00:07:36.310> little

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.460 
possibly get burnt having that little

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.260 
possibly get burnt having that little
plastic<00:07:37.409> mechanism<00:07:38.409> on<00:07:38.500> there<00:07:38.710> prevents<00:07:39.129> that

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.270 
plastic mechanism on there prevents that

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.089 
plastic mechanism on there prevents that
so<00:07:40.270> that's<00:07:40.780> it<00:07:41.050> for<00:07:41.319> Moen

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:42.099 
so that's it for Moen

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:44.550 
so that's it for Moen
cartridges<00:07:43.060> are<00:07:43.240> guaranteed<00:07:43.629> for<00:07:43.659> life<00:07:43.900> have
