00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.389
 Hakata Ori 

00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:04.389
 Same day referendum 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.390
 To the customer 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.759
 It's time to write 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.009
 The thin film which received the same afternoon afternoon is also good 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.960
 So this time 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.799
 A little points to customers 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.159
 It was important to eat raw 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.579
 In the sense that we will bring to our customers 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.179
 Actually complete 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.319
 What to bring 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:27.849
 This time the corresponding switch is on 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.710
 In this state, even if the customer hand-in-hand 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.289
 Even if you have an eyerom for the first time because the inside is very small 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.610
 I think I can use it without feeling a little scary. 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.319
 After going through a computer, one company at three o'clock 

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:46.409
 At first I learn how to use my left hand 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.030
 As it is area now, we can do short thing 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.280
 It can not be done alone 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.690
 It enters even if it goes to whichever circle changes by that 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.990
 It's hard to say that the sun can be ml Can customers also come 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.479
 is 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:02.780
 In that 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.540
 Sometimes I received a request to come to jta first 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.330
 Let's give a lecture 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.280
 Always comment or tie up 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.020
 Tell me how to hold it again when you get it 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.470
 If you are using-api like now 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.470
 I will say concretely 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.890
 Environmental station can not 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.060
 Please accept the power of business 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.990
 Get a thumbs up 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.260
 Update this clip art 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.899
 Focus on being closed or closed 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.020
 Open if the survey dollar is alive 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.840
 How much gently brings in and from this point 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.270
 Well, I've also got another subway 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.130
 Then it will open if you fly around with the strength you want to sing 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.050
 First of all 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.000
 Next is the appearance of the above 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.310
 Right front 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.760
 Own 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.010
 Let's have a hair tip 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.010
 Therefore I had a remittance destination 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.210
 As it is 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.210
 First in 45 years b class 4 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:11.029
 8. os 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.959
 Bad even if the same horse's father or switch is on 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.189
 There is no customer so relieved 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.089
 Can support 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.389
 While shifting little by little 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.009
 Let's rotate 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.189
 That's right 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.539
 I agree 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:27.849
 Let's accumulate there 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.549
 Therefore 1 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.009
 By not being turned on like this 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:38.049
 Acquisition of grid iron and the timing to make it slide 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.119
 Even customers can understand 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.629
 The next point is the switch 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.539
 I had a low London 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.959
 If it's coming, it will be on the night of the 19th 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.550
 Behavioral targeting 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.330
 It is important for you to teach customers how to teach 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.639
 I think it will be 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.309
 Next is back net 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.249
 I think it is this, but it is quite good that I received the unquestioned question 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:02.089
 welcome 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:03.359
 In such a case 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.119
 You need to have a lecture on pacnet and open it 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.289
 I think there is 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.439
 Saito Kazuo 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.970
 Or at the clinic 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.029
 It seems that I ate once 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:18.029
 Update Kanno Aya- 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.879
 Make sure you use power steadily 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.879
 I used it with my right hand 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.729
 Just around the middle 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:36.039
 Then hold your right hand 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:37.319
 License 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.649
 That way 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:40.219
 Hold your hand 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.189
 12 flying in the middle 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.009
 Let's continue 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:47.499
 Because 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:50.499
 Let's rotate while shifting little by little 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.019
 Let's rotate it 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.839
 Let's start in this state 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:58.419
 in this way 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.069
 If the switch is not turned on or if you request it slowly and 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.719
 became 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.099
 If there is time, it is time
