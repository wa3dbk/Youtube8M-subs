00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.830
 hello everyone I'm mendizábal and today I 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:19.000
 like to talk about charles pulsates thorium 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.310
 of the technique punta punta de charles is 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.200
 a resource that by relieving tension from 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.820
 arm allows us to touch more things 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.220
 fast in a much more relaxed way and 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.380
 being able to last longer and without hardening the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.790
 forearm and on the other hand also 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.910
 it also gives another air another feeling to 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.309
 many things that we can touch normal 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.460
 well what is this technique when 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.680
 we usually have eighth notes and 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.390
 three if in the charles we can give the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.390
 equal in strength 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.199
 or we could alternate a singing blow 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.059
 with a sharp blow to get a 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.430
 internal balance and that the rhythm sounds 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.350
 another way and also as I said before 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.350
 to play faster for both 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.670
 some examples of employment of this 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.670
 technique can be the funk and for example 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.390
 it can be for the blast 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.560
 it can be for punt 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.480
 by the way said is also for this 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.020
 fast roll on the right hand and the 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.070
 left also if you use relax 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.740
 but as I say it's also a question 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.700
 of 'feeling' here for example we will take 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.700
 an example in rock 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.900
 but it is also a matter of 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.930
 'feeling' for example rock does not sound 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.930
 same 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.959
 that I have touched in this other way 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.150
 and it will depend on the context but in my 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.340
 opinion gets much more feeling from this 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.970
 second way there are more mechanical styles 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.970
 the rap 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.920
 it tends to emulate more the rhythm boxes 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.280
 and for that reason he tends to use more 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.690
 it leaves much more rigid constant but the 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.100
 other styles I like that balance that 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.570
 it is left when we use the pulse 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.080
 turia or group how is this done 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.250
 technique and also what I like is 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.710
 take the pieces piece by piece then 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.870
 I start this in this way 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.840
 I put the ramrod so the arm dropped 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.430
 against the body totally relaxed and 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.970
 let's say a kind of whiplash 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.970
 down 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.250
 this movement looks like a whiplash 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.600
 It also looks like when we have 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.690
 flat stones beside a river by 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.440
 example we try to give that effect to 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.270
 that bounce on the water 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.280
 would be a would be a very movement 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.810
 similar in this case instead of a 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.460
 horizontal plane a more vertical plane 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.320
 we are not up and down in the charles 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.230
 the kind of mind is the same you can 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.860
 apparently also a I I never played 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.790
 a lot to him but 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.830
 so in the story and to try to 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.530
 perfect this the good thing is for me 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.250
 take the series a kind of series that 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.380
 consist, for example, in 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.750
 a little phrase of three blows a phrase 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.209
 little phrase with three strokes and one more phrase 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.209
 long seven laps and this would be 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.780
 always paying attention that the 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.300
 palm of the hand lives down below yes 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.569
 very important and that oscillates up and 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.979
 down without the arm working 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.190
 the arm wants to be completely 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.050
 relaxed and the forearm moves but not 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.840
 it is who makes the force moves by 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.449
 effect to create better an effect 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.250
 of whip we use its inertia but not 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.330
 we must harden none of this really 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.330
 it's a matter of the doll 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.890
 Another common mistake is to pull forward 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.680
 and back even if it is a fault what 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.490
 you can do a small measure but 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.580
 generally that implies a movement 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.439
 of the upper arm 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.860
 and it's just less efficient we have 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.689
 moving mass 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.750
 I recommend a roll up and 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.850
 down 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.890
 Another common mistake is simply to exaggerate 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.210
 the movement although this is not bad at 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.310
 principle is fine for us to take 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.960
 then you really have to give my 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.340
 understand at least the right touch are 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.770
 all high speeds the right touch 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.890
 of displacement the one that is needed 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.720
 so it does not have to be like that my tip 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.960
 it has to be like that 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.700
 this is tip and this can be singing to 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.860
 principle you can exaggerate the most for 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.630
 make sure that pegáis as as 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.070
 it has to be pointed and singing but 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.070
 the displacement is not very big 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.590
 yes I would like to say that it is a question 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.790
 really more strength despite 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.750
 we talk about singing and rush is a 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:57.669
 question more of forces than of position 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.669
 I can touch all this on tip 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.979
 this charm 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.449
 as you learn is forcing yourself to 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.819
 differentiate singing and point but then it 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.050
 can play all of singing but give that 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:12.240
 movement at hand 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.620
 I would also say at the time of the rhythms of 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.919
 rock first was only the 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.919
 hands 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.699
 there will be time to square the drums and 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.590
 counting together and 3 and 4 and placing in 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.320
 when the drums so are we 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.300
 know if the drums fall with singing or 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.889
 they fall in a blow of strut remember 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.440
 talk this very slowly and never 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.789
 sacrifice technique for speed 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.110
 you have to go slow and try to make the 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.539
 technique is always correct and not 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.470
 suppose really a relaxation in the 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:48.130
 arm 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.600
 so nothing to continue with it and I 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:53.850
 I will try to continue with another reaction 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.850
 soon soon greetings
