00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 and ten good reasons to adopt a 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.049
 nightmare so I made a list about - 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.859
 do so I tell you sorry if I 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.280
 look at my phone 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.700
 so I did it like that it is 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.580
 the one that gives reason to be that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.560
 I would have thought sure that I too 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.430
 do the 10 good reasons not to 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.289
 buy 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.740
 that his soul I want to do it for 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.630
 crime tata I do not know who this is so 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.010
 that's the highlight of this little bar 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.260
 the weak points in a next 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.280
 video 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:38.489
 dornach is number 1 it's a pet km 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.950
 1 parenthesis of a sense that it needs 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.809
 a lot of affection for sure that the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.489
 better to have two but if 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.390
 you really warn is precisely the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.920
 house ben it's possible these yes 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.149
 it's easy but you really need him 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.590
 give a lot of attention 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.789
 because this animal they need it 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.590
 anyway so number to salem m² 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.210
 so number two he is not very 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.049
 expensive good for sure that has let go like 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.189
 any animal that does it's it 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.960
 there are a lot of costs anyway at 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.030
 to pay but it's not what it is 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.250
 we want to throw on the mail poverty 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.049
 things that it's useless to buy at 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.280
 the high cost and things that it is 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.689
 really useful it's like vitamin 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.939
 sun and stuff like that that I 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.950
 to talk again soon but that's it 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.960
 it is not very expensive if technically 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.759
 are stalled favorable vet visit 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.159
 budget to be able to see the pig but 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.079
 it's like any animal because we 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.780
 try to buy an animal he must 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.210
 think long because there are a lot 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.509
 constraints that make them think 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.159
 were yes it's fun but you have to 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.020
 say he's going a lot of friendship that can 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.060
 pass for the guinea pig or that 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.430
 love to calais tomorrow 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.810
 so but technically it is not very 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.689
 expensive thirdly he lives pretty 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.740
 long these sands between 5 and 8 years 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:00.049
 technically I have a little height 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.549
 theoretically it comes between 5 and 8 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.530
 so it's hard made solid cardboard 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.030
 but I doubt it for that but I have 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.759
 rated but less than wagering on you 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.130
 simply leave 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.170
 but that 's part of the game so 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.010
 that they are adopting mavs which 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.360
 they are valid must must 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.769
 live with the fact that they are going to us 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.890
 leave one day but it's enough 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.060
 long he can cohabit and this swap 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.500
 with does not have that it's really not 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.799
 recommended but I would like with a 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.250
 other sales competitor 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:36.709
 good I was what it is part but 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.220
 I saw at the campsite and two dead 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.560
 then a woman dies together then lens 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.650
 and troyes mahmoud ben ayed al ahmar 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.109
 technically but if they sake pee themselves 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.160
 invited well then it was not nothing 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.030
 but that's sure it did not say 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.859
 still time guinea pigs 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.200
 if they are like us, we are each one 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.980
 character makes that these are gregarious 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.870
 greger I would like it said but 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.760
 know that our 40 years so announced this 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.250
 that you have to think so 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.840
 fifth it is not bad smelling 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.459
 that's for sure 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.220
 change the litter at least two to three 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.049
 once a week change lp clean to 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.569
 bottom the cage and every week but 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.069
 if we stood at the burn 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.980
 dard is much less present than if 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.359
 we would give up in his corner 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.030
 is good these are some who have 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.950
 bought a valve we try to pollen it 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.819
 in the nose helping sarafina sir 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.590
 and 6 he's big enough for the field 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.739
 dry but small enough not to you 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.090
 understood so I give an example if there is 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.500
 some people who do not like them 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.769
 dogs for me I had enriched but 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.250
 joseph not hold the dogs and they 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.750
 be group tea party cantreau place 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.569
 pie ix 1 2 who do not like ours at 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.299
 small as soups 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.060
 williams time because because you 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.639
 know too little sas base sas is a little 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.709
 his power and a notice on our either 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.389
 that there were mice or I do not know what 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.359
 that the potentates who want to stay on 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.409
 we for tax collectors but that's the 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.450
 canton but that's not bad and he 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.790
 is of these two animals the beak of these 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.849
 two categories again the because 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.969
 it's caucus we can stay with 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.669
 sleeping hook to listen to the TV there 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:17.880
 lying down eating stilts or can I 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:20.359
 keep the cake squeaks the stuff 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.380
 like that do not worry cellphone they 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.050
 do they do not tell each other a fight 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.660
 no longer our good flour a good 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.070
 can especially his arrival two worlds of 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.650
 maïwenn we do not know everyone that the 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.410
 place to better be a bit of a voice 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.680
 in his little love house of kung-fu 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.789
 wade but without thinking but has been 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.800
 technically it's not really that we 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.270
 will compare two big dogs with his 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.550
 reads his food all 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.580
 so if what is possible to do 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.610
 a good performance for pokemon found 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.289
 and seven islands to day a lot of happiness 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.490
 in a house then that's true it's 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.990
 like a therapy do they belong 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.349
 mask therapy in the cage 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.620
 adds a lot of happiness and 8 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:05.430
 he is is clubbed diplomat so this is 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.380
 rare as two banderillas in 138 max 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.419
 and his 2000 questionnaire indicates that yi 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.430
 really here like karate it's like 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.860
 everyone 9 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.509
 he communicates a lot so having given 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.240
 than in the newspaper who does not know who 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.630
 communicate for ben yeah but as 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.880
 I was there i come on 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.590
 he communicates what makes a mother of 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.540
 now and then but that's for sure 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.040
 two days that I him but I'm going 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.230
 give time to adapt at least 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.470
 three to four days tens of meters 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.480
 if I dared asked who it is who take 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.630
 place his territory to him his hunger 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.880
 street front but it was technical 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.310
 national mall gramat quiet so what 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.030
 trial it's worth my postulate their cash there 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.100
 will be two and then as an ecologist 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.000
 author because I surely 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.850
 but he communicates a lot 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.280
 then there is too sweet and close too much 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.720
 sweet really knows how can I 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.030
 find this murder to millions then 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.490
 it's a good reason for the field 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.940
 so here's the picture of a rate of 10 so 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.410
 if you also like pigs 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.900
 from India who had my presentation 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.630
 ten good reasons to buy a 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.100
 asshole should make up then click on 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.610
 i like and in boston 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.610
 my doctor
