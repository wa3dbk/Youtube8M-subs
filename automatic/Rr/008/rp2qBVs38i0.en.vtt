00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.179 
you will need are paper clips pens the
pen<00:00:24.720> should<00:00:24.930> be<00:00:25.080> larger<00:00:25.529> than<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.830> size<00:00:25.980> of

needle that you are using

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.089 
needle that you are using
I<00:00:27.420> recommend<00:00:27.840> pens<00:00:28.140> instead<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.619> pencils

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
I recommend pens instead of pencils

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.729 
I recommend pens instead of pencils
because<00:00:29.820> pencils<00:00:30.570> indent<00:00:32.149> and<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.320> wire

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
