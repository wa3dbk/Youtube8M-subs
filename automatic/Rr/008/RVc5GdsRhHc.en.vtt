00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.870 
back something like that you probably
wouldn't<00:01:19.560> know<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:19.950> xbox<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.430> or<00:01:20.460> xbox

wouldn't know if it's xbox one or xbox
360<00:01:21.390> genuinely<00:01:22.290> because<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.950> fact<00:01:23.130> that

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
360 genuinely because of the fact that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.370 
360 genuinely because of the fact that
there's<00:01:23.640> no<00:01:23.820> absolute<00:01:24.090> difference<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.259> this

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
there's no absolute difference and this

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.859 
there's no absolute difference and this
is<00:01:25.500> why<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.650> think<00:01:25.950> they<00:01:26.070> are<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> joke<00:01:26.460> because

is why I think they are a joke because

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.819 
is why I think they are a joke because

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
very small differences I mean the map

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.010 
very small differences I mean the map
might<00:02:17.580> change<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:18.090> bit<00:02:18.210> more<00:02:18.390> on<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.480> Xbox<00:02:18.840> one

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020

about but I'm physically saying that you
just<00:03:17.430> can't<00:03:17.610> tell<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> difference<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.269> this

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
just can't tell the difference and this

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
just can't tell the difference and this
is<00:03:18.959> why<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.110> think<00:03:19.230> they<00:03:19.410> are<00:03:19.440> do<00:03:19.650> because

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
is why I think they are do because

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.890 
is why I think they are do because
generally<00:03:20.370> for<00:03:21.000> games<00:03:21.180> like<00:03:21.300> Call<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.570> Duty

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
generally for games like Call of Duty

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.720 
generally for games like Call of Duty
entitled<00:03:22.500> they<00:03:22.650> are<00:03:22.800> no<00:03:23.010> different<00:03:23.519> there<00:03:23.640> is

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
entitled they are no different there is

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.040 
entitled they are no different there is
no<00:03:23.910> point<00:03:24.090> picking<00:03:24.300> up<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.540> new<00:03:24.630> console<00:03:24.959> to

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
no point picking up the new console to

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.120 
no point picking up the new console to
play<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.200> new<00:03:25.350> game<00:03:25.560> because<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.800> will<00:03:25.980> be

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
play the new game because you will be

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.910 
play the new game because you will be
actually<00:03:26.430> let<00:03:27.060> down<00:03:27.300> by<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.080> lack<00:03:28.890> of

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
actually let down by the lack of

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.280 
actually let down by the lack of
innovation<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.730> gameplay<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.450> basically

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
innovation in the gameplay and basically

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.259 
innovation in the gameplay and basically
it's<00:03:31.590> just<00:03:31.680> over<00:03:32.100> pointless<00:03:32.489> as<00:03:32.640> know<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:33.090> may

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
it's just over pointless as know it may

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.729 
it's just over pointless as know it may
be<00:03:33.330> brighter<00:03:33.690> maybe<00:03:33.959> more<00:03:34.110> colorful<00:03:34.530> all<00:03:34.620> out

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
be brighter maybe more colorful all out

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.050 
be brighter maybe more colorful all out
you<00:03:34.980> know<00:03:35.100> blahdy<00:03:35.370> blahdy<00:03:35.580> blah<00:03:35.850> but

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
you know blahdy blahdy blah but

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.640 
you know blahdy blahdy blah but
generally<00:03:36.720> there's<00:03:36.840> no<00:03:36.959> difference<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.500> this

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
generally there's no difference and this

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.110 
generally there's no difference and this
is<00:03:37.800> why<00:03:37.980> i<00:03:38.010> think<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.790> next-gen

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
is why i think that the next-gen

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.880 
is why i think that the next-gen
consoles<00:03:39.480> are<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.600> joke<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.560> be<00:03:40.680> honest<00:03:40.800> if

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
consoles are a joke and to be honest if

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.080 
consoles are a joke and to be honest if
you're<00:03:41.010> thinking<00:03:41.130> of<00:03:41.340> picking<00:03:41.519> them<00:03:41.790> up<00:03:41.880> yet

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
you're thinking of picking them up yet

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.030 
you're thinking of picking them up yet
don't<00:03:42.600> bother<00:03:42.840> wait<00:03:43.170> until<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:43.620> year's<00:03:43.830> Call
