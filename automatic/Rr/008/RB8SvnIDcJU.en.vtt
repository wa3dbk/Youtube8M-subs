00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
all the way down to your fine foot clock

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.010 
all the way down to your fine foot clock
widget<00:03:46.890> simply<00:03:47.610> turn<00:03:47.880> that<00:03:48.090> widget<00:03:48.330> on<00:03:48.630> and

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
widget simply turn that widget on and

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.810 
widget simply turn that widget on and
you're<00:03:49.230> good<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.530> go<00:03:49.650> pull<00:03:50.520> down<00:03:50.700> the

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
you're good to go pull down the

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.280 
you're good to go pull down the
notifications<00:03:51.480> here<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.900> as<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:52.140> can<00:03:52.260> see

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
notifications here and as you can see

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.710 
notifications here and as you can see
right<00:03:52.620> here<00:03:53.280> is<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.459> actual<00:03:54.030> widget<00:03:54.570> itself

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
right here is the actual widget itself

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.320 
right here is the actual widget itself
so<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.620> basically<00:03:55.890> gives<00:03:56.250> us<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.640> time<00:03:56.850> but<00:03:57.180> it

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
so it basically gives us the time but it

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330 
so it basically gives us the time but it
looks<00:03:57.480> like<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.690> retro-style<00:03:58.470> clock<00:03:58.800> within

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
looks like a retro-style clock within

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.430 
looks like a retro-style clock within
the<00:03:59.550> Notification<00:04:00.180> Center<00:04:00.209> really<00:04:00.990> handy<00:04:01.410> a

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
the Notification Center really handy a

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.660 
the Notification Center really handy a
little<00:04:01.650> tweak<00:04:01.890> if<00:04:02.100> you<00:04:02.250> want<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.459> know<00:04:02.550> what

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
little tweak if you want to know what

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.070 
little tweak if you want to know what
the<00:04:02.700> time<00:04:02.880> is<00:04:02.940> instead<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.510> looking<00:04:03.600> at<00:04:03.930> the

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
the time is instead of looking at the

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.960 
the time is instead of looking at the
status<00:04:04.380> bar<00:04:04.410> gives<00:04:04.740> you<00:04:04.860> nice<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.100> big<00:04:05.459> display

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
status bar gives you nice a big display

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.210 
status bar gives you nice a big display
and<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.600> do<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.870> few<00:04:07.140> options<00:04:07.320> within<00:04:07.830> the

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
and you do a few options within the

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.820 
and you do a few options within the
actual<00:04:08.400> settings<00:04:09.090> itself<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:10.200> let's<00:04:10.560> scroll

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
actual settings itself so let's scroll

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.890 
actual settings itself so let's scroll
down<00:04:11.070> so<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:11.400> find<00:04:11.640> foot<00:04:12.060> clock<00:04:12.360> now<00:04:12.570> inside

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
down so you find foot clock now inside

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.170 
down so you find foot clock now inside
be<00:04:13.080> able<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.350> show<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.530> date<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.040> time<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.610> as

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
be able to show the date and time and as

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.060 
be able to show the date and time and as
you<00:04:15.360> can<00:04:15.450> see<00:04:15.480> right<00:04:15.600> there<00:04:16.020> it<00:04:16.140> is<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.530> then

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
you can see right there it is and then

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.860 
you can see right there it is and then
we<00:04:17.190> also<00:04:17.340> have<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.730> red<00:04:17.970> second<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:18.540> we<00:04:18.570> turn

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
we also have the red second so we turn

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.599 
we also have the red second so we turn
that<00:04:18.989> on<00:04:19.049> as<00:04:19.320> well<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.890> it<00:04:20.070> basically<00:04:20.280> gives

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
that on as well and it basically gives

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.310 
that on as well and it basically gives
you<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.940> red<00:04:21.120> seconds<00:04:21.570> instead<00:04:21.930> of<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.169> all

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
you the red seconds instead of it all

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.250 
you the red seconds instead of it all
matching<00:04:22.800> which<00:04:23.280> looks<00:04:23.520> kind<00:04:23.790> of<00:04:23.850> nice

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
matching which looks kind of nice

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.440 
matching which looks kind of nice
get<00:04:24.380> that<00:04:24.500> little<00:04:24.680> flip<00:04:25.070> animation<00:04:25.760> there<00:04:25.970> you

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
get that little flip animation there you

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.450 
get that little flip animation there you
can<00:04:26.570> even<00:04:26.840> turn<00:04:26.990> off<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.410> bounce<00:04:27.680> effect<00:04:27.920> and

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
can even turn off the bounce effect and

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.860 
can even turn off the bounce effect and
then<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:28.910> can<00:04:29.060> actually<00:04:29.210> have<00:04:29.480> the<00:04:29.630> red

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
then you can actually have the red

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.470 
then you can actually have the red
sundays<00:04:30.380> on<00:04:30.650> or<00:04:31.220> off<00:04:31.370> then<00:04:31.850> you<00:04:31.940> have<00:04:32.090> a<00:04:32.120> glass

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
sundays on or off then you have a glass

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.180 
sundays on or off then you have a glass
effect<00:04:32.720> as<00:04:33.200> well<00:04:33.470> so<00:04:33.710> you<00:04:33.800> can<00:04:33.920> have<00:04:34.040> the

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
effect as well so you can have the

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.730 
effect as well so you can have the
actual<00:04:34.430> glass<00:04:35.300> right<00:04:35.870> there<00:04:36.110> which<00:04:36.290> looks

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
actual glass right there which looks

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.680 
actual glass right there which looks
kind<00:04:37.010> of<00:04:37.040> nice<00:04:37.190> but<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.520> likely<00:04:37.850> no<00:04:38.030> reflection

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
kind of nice but I likely no reflection

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.690 
kind of nice but I likely no reflection
in<00:04:38.840> a<00:04:38.930> way<00:04:39.110> that's<00:04:39.620> pretty<00:04:39.980> much<00:04:40.130> all<00:04:40.370> foot

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
in a way that's pretty much all foot
