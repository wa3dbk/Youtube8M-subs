00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
just a quick rundown on the structure of

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.450 
just a quick rundown on the structure of
candles<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.840> basically<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.619> four

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
candles you basically have four

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.660 
candles you basically have four
components<00:01:21.200> your<00:01:22.200> wax<00:01:22.470> your<00:01:22.830> dye<00:01:23.040> your

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
components your wax your dye your

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.749 
components your wax your dye your
fragrance<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.570> wick<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.549> if<00:01:26.549> you're

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
fragrance and your wick and if you're

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.520 
fragrance and your wick and if you're
thinking<00:01:27.119> about<00:01:27.210> getting<00:01:27.930> into<00:01:28.080> candle

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
thinking about getting into candle

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.210 
thinking about getting into candle
making<00:01:29.240> there's<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:31.280> pretty<00:01:32.280> much<00:01:32.430> simple

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
making there's the pretty much simple

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.219 
making there's the pretty much simple
sciences<00:01:35.220> involved<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.630> your<00:01:36.900> wax

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
sciences involved that your wax

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.800 
sciences involved that your wax
fragrance<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.280> dye<00:01:38.549> ratio<00:01:39.299> has<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.689> be

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
fragrance and dye ratio has to be

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.020 
fragrance and dye ratio has to be
critical<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:41.460> also<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.939> have

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
critical and you also have to have

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.889 
critical and you also have to have
material<00:01:42.960> compatibility<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.450> place

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
material compatibility that is in place

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.700 
material compatibility that is in place
so<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.640> your<00:01:47.640> candles<00:01:48.360> mix<00:01:49.020> together<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
so that your candles mix together and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.810 
so that your candles mix together and
when<00:01:49.860> they<00:01:49.979> set<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.399> they<00:01:50.850> look<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:52.399> smell<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
when they set up they look and smell and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.700 
when they set up they look and smell and
work<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.270> way<00:01:54.390> they're<00:01:54.509> supposed<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
work the way they're supposed to so the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.999 
work the way they're supposed to so the
whole<00:01:55.860> wax<00:01:56.250> fragrance<00:01:57.060> dye<00:01:57.860> ratio<00:01:58.860> is

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
whole wax fragrance dye ratio is

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.649 
whole wax fragrance dye ratio is
critical<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.610> once<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.909> get<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.090> down<00:02:00.390> you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
critical and once you get that down you

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.889 
critical and once you get that down you
can<00:02:00.840> make<00:02:01.159> good<00:02:02.159> candles<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.909> then<00:02:03.030> as<00:02:03.420> you

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
can make good candles and then as you

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.630 
can make good candles and then as you
get<00:02:04.079> better<00:02:04.259> at<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.890> make<00:02:05.070> candles<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
get better at you can make candles the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.910 
get better at you can make candles the
way<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.820> want<00:02:06.030> them<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> be

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
way you want them to be

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.270 
way you want them to be
the<00:02:07.920> wax<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.340> critical<00:02:08.880> main<00:02:09.660> waxes<00:02:10.290> two<00:02:10.979> types

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
the wax is critical main waxes two types

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.320 
the wax is critical main waxes two types
are<00:02:11.550> naturally<00:02:12.450> occurring<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.110> synthetic

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
are naturally occurring and synthetic

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.930 
are naturally occurring and synthetic
you<00:02:15.330> have<00:02:15.540> beeswax<00:02:16.350> which<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.460> think<00:02:17.730> here

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
you have beeswax which I think here

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.150 
you have beeswax which I think here
where<00:02:18.270> where<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.600> comes<00:02:18.840> from<00:02:18.960> soy<00:02:19.890> wax

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
where where that comes from soy wax

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.460 
where where that comes from soy wax
comes<00:02:20.580> from<00:02:20.790> soybeans<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.630> palm<00:02:21.870> wax<00:02:22.170> comes

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
comes from soybeans and palm wax comes

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.010 
comes from soybeans and palm wax comes
from<00:02:22.710> palm<00:02:22.860> trees<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.760> then<00:02:24.270> paraffin<00:02:24.750> wax

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
from palm trees and then paraffin wax

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.230 
from palm trees and then paraffin wax
which<00:02:25.740> is<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.280> wax<00:02:26.520> it's<00:02:26.730> used<00:02:26.940> for

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
which is the kind of wax it's used for

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.590 
which is the kind of wax it's used for
sealing<00:02:27.720> mason<00:02:28.290> jars<00:02:28.530> etc<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.850> man-made

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
sealing mason jars etc is a man-made

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.680 
sealing mason jars etc is a man-made
kind<00:02:30.960> of<00:02:31.050> wax<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.740> if<00:02:31.980> you're<00:02:32.190> using<00:02:32.970> natural

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
kind of wax so if you're using natural

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.080 
kind of wax so if you're using natural
ingredients<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.620> want<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.860> keep<00:02:35.040> into<00:02:36.000> the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
ingredients you want to keep into the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.870 
ingredients you want to keep into the
beeswax<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:36.930> when<00:02:37.080> palm<00:02:37.380> wax<00:02:37.680> if<00:02:38.100> you're<00:02:38.610> using

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
beeswax so when palm wax if you're using

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.090 
beeswax so when palm wax if you're using
man-made<00:02:39.380> materials<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.500> want<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.770> work<00:02:40.890> with

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
man-made materials you want to work with

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.600 
man-made materials you want to work with
paraffin<00:02:41.490> wax<00:02:42.440> with<00:02:43.440> quality<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:43.920> location

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
paraffin wax with quality and location

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.550 
paraffin wax with quality and location
just<00:02:45.240> real<00:02:45.540> quick<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.959> think<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.230> know<00:02:46.350> what<00:02:46.530> a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
just real quick I think you know what a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.980 
just real quick I think you know what a
wick<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:48.120> wick<00:02:48.300> is<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.750> thing<00:02:48.959> that

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
wick is but the wick is the thing that

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.130 
wick is but the wick is the thing that
the<00:02:49.580> flame<00:02:50.580> burns<00:02:50.910> on<00:02:51.180> it's<00:02:51.450> actually<00:02:51.600> for<00:02:52.050> the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
the flame burns on it's actually for the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.500 
the flame burns on it's actually for the
most<00:02:52.350> part<00:02:52.620> braided<00:02:53.040> cotton<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:54.120> it's

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
most part braided cotton and it's

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.440 
most part braided cotton and it's
actually<00:02:54.870> treated<00:02:55.430> chemically<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.360> it

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
actually treated chemically so that it

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.330 
actually treated chemically so that it
won't<00:02:57.600> burn<00:02:57.930> too<00:02:58.230> fast<00:02:58.530> because<00:02:58.890> if<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.130> burns

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
won't burn too fast because if it burns

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.910 
won't burn too fast because if it burns
too<00:02:59.580> fast<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.000> candle<00:03:00.300> goes<00:03:00.450> up<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.800> way

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
too fast the candle goes up and the way

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.949 
too fast the candle goes up and the way
a<00:03:01.950> candle<00:03:02.520> actually<00:03:02.970> works<00:03:03.209> is<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:03.660> through

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
a candle actually works is it's through

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.420 
a candle actually works is it's through
capillary<00:03:04.620> action<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:06.360> wick<00:03:06.570> itself

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
capillary action and the wick itself

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.130 
capillary action and the wick itself
sucks<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.700> fuel<00:03:08.970> up<00:03:09.209> through<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.750> bottom<00:03:10.050> of

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
sucks the fuel up through the bottom of

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.800 
sucks the fuel up through the bottom of
the<00:03:10.230> candle<00:03:10.470> up<00:03:10.769> into<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.130> flame<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.810> that's

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
the candle up into the flame and that's

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.509 
the candle up into the flame and that's
a<00:03:12.900> concept<00:03:13.260> called<00:03:13.470> wicking<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.340> goes

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
a concept called wicking and that goes

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.610 
a concept called wicking and that goes
back<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.300> know<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.420> definition<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.290> wick

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
back to you know the definition of wick

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.540 
back to you know the definition of wick
so<00:03:17.040> that's<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:18.350> reaction<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.680> goes<00:03:19.830> on<00:03:20.070> at<00:03:20.370> the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
so that's a reaction that goes on at the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.050 
so that's a reaction that goes on at the
flame<00:03:21.090> wick<00:03:21.630> interface<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:23.280> pulls<00:03:23.550> up<00:03:23.820> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
flame wick interface and it pulls up the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.509 
flame wick interface and it pulls up the
the<00:03:24.660> wax<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.290> fragrance<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.890> burn<00:03:26.100> and

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
the wax and the fragrance to burn and

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.300 
the wax and the fragrance to burn and
the<00:03:27.420> location<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.140> wick<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.470> critical<00:03:29.010> to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
the location of the wick is critical to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.470 
the location of the wick is critical to
how<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.720> candle<00:03:31.350> burns<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:33.030> fact<00:03:33.360> that

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
how the candle burns and the fact that

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.750 
how the candle burns and the fact that
it<00:03:33.630> burns<00:03:33.870> correctly<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:34.800> wick<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.489> pretty

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
it burns correctly so wick is pretty

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.330 
it burns correctly so wick is pretty
important<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.209> candles<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:37.620> type<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:38.010> candle

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
important to candles the type of candle

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.009 
important to candles the type of candle
there's<00:03:38.519> many<00:03:38.760> different<00:03:39.030> types<00:03:39.299> of<00:03:39.570> candles

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
there's many different types of candles

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.990 
there's many different types of candles
