 or that after three years ago 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:18.489
 for this you of course need the bike I have you about 100 to 150 

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:20.349
 gram per person 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:21.769
 to the premiere 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.769
 pepper and salt 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.480
 however, you can add other herbs 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.480
 since the oil has to be taken over at home 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.480
 and a pile around the fish stock 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.270
 that starts with seasoning the fish I always use p percent but you can also 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.500
 other malicious

 in addition, flowers grow on the plate 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.750
 and you are on the bike for the source

 you do this to try to get a nice crispy goat suspension 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.120
 we are going to pack more 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.730
 the pan on a high heat 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.820

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.940
 the leader from the jupiler league 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.120

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.820

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.280
 throw a piece of club costume 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.409

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.140
 for four lessons i usually took four to six minutes unpacked 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.530
 that means two to three minutes per side 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.740
 the baking time depends on the thickness of the us 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.530
 the total baking time contributes approximately 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.530
 th minute per millimeter thickness of the us 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.770
