00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
challenge route again which doesn't

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.680 
challenge route again which doesn't
really<00:03:44.790> matter<00:03:45.030> because<00:03:45.299> this<00:03:45.420> is<00:03:45.540> actually

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
really matter because this is actually

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.479 
really matter because this is actually
the<00:03:46.170> end<00:03:46.319> of<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.500> first<00:03:46.739> stage<00:03:46.920> all<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.310> got<00:03:47.400> to

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
the end of the first stage all I got to

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.180 
the end of the first stage all I got to
do<00:03:47.579> is<00:03:47.700> fly<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.239> end<00:03:48.359> of<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.569> Rings<00:03:48.810> and

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
do is fly to the end of the Rings and

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.979 
do is fly to the end of the Rings and
then<00:03:50.190> we'll<00:03:50.370> finally<00:03:50.819> get<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.090> see<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.450> end<00:03:51.540> of

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
then we'll finally get to see the end of

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.099 
then we'll finally get to see the end of
the<00:03:52.169> first<00:03:52.410> stage<00:03:52.709> is<00:03:52.889> Superman<00:03:53.220> 64<00:03:53.989> which<00:03:54.989> I

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
the first stage is Superman 64 which I

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.360 
the first stage is Superman 64 which I
don't<00:03:55.169> think<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.500> lot<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.859> have<00:03:55.980> actually

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
don't think a lot of you have actually

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.270 
don't think a lot of you have actually
seen<00:03:57.019> not<00:03:58.019> how<00:03:58.230> many<00:03:58.410> videos<00:03:58.739> online<00:03:58.919> actually

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
seen not how many videos online actually

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.589 
seen not how many videos online actually
of<00:03:59.519> people<00:03:59.760> beating<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.090> game<00:04:00.269> which<00:04:00.450> is

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
of people beating the game which is

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.839 
of people beating the game which is
funny<00:04:00.870> because<00:04:01.190> after<00:04:02.190> certain<00:04:02.400> people<00:04:02.730> have

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
funny because after certain people have

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.569 
funny because after certain people have
like<00:04:03.150> slayed<00:04:04.079> through<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.380> game<00:04:04.560> ever<00:04:05.430> heard

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
like slayed through the game ever heard

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.470 
like slayed through the game ever heard
about<00:04:05.639> the<00:04:05.819> game<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:05.970> think<00:04:06.269> there<00:04:06.359> be<00:04:06.450> a

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
about the game you think there be a

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.729 
about the game you think there be a
flood<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.989> most<00:04:07.169> like

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739

to people maybe beaten this day in video
format<00:04:12.379> that<00:04:13.379> may<00:04:13.560> be<00:04:13.620> doing<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.069> world<00:04:14.250> a

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.479 

the<00:04:19.410> weird<00:04:19.590> thing<00:04:19.650> you'll<00:04:19.859> notice<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:20.280> we're

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
the weird thing you'll notice that we're

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.120 
the weird thing you'll notice that we're
underwater<00:04:20.850> obviously<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.500> nice<00:04:22.680> wall

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
underwater obviously the the nice wall

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.430 
underwater obviously the the nice wall
we<00:04:23.370> have<00:04:23.580> here<00:04:24.030> if<00:04:24.570> you<00:04:24.750> can't<00:04:24.960> see<00:04:25.110> anything

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
we have here if you can't see anything

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.800 
we have here if you can't see anything
through<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.800> top<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.270> bottom<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.690> can

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
through the top to the bottom you can

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.420 
through the top to the bottom you can
see<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.020> line<00:04:28.229> splitting<00:04:28.710> on<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:29.100> screen

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
see the line splitting on the screen

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.240 
see the line splitting on the screen
here<00:04:30.080> but<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.169> game<00:04:31.350> actually<00:04:31.650> runs<00:04:31.800> smoother

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
here but the game actually runs smoother

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.760 
here but the game actually runs smoother
when<00:04:32.340> you're<00:04:32.490> underwater<00:04:33.530> probably<00:04:34.530> cuz<00:04:34.650> it's

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
when you're underwater probably cuz it's

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.710 
when you're underwater probably cuz it's
not<00:04:34.889> displaying<00:04:35.729> all<00:04:36.090> these<00:04:36.270> extra<00:04:36.539> like

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
not displaying all these extra like

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.540 
not displaying all these extra like
lights<00:04:37.050> and<00:04:37.289> polygons<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.039> everything<00:04:38.340> but

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
lights and polygons and everything but

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.640 
lights and polygons and everything but
game<00:04:39.300> runs<00:04:39.509> a<00:04:39.660> lot<00:04:39.930> faster<00:04:39.960> if<00:04:40.470> you're

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
game runs a lot faster if you're

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.080 
game runs a lot faster if you're
underwater<00:04:40.949> sometimes<00:04:41.610> too<00:04:41.910> fast<00:04:44.090> but

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
underwater sometimes too fast but

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.279 
underwater sometimes too fast but
anything<00:04:45.660> that<00:04:45.690> gets<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.930> get<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.110> Rings

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
anything that gets to get the Rings

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.240 
anything that gets to get the Rings
faster<00:04:48.650> water's<00:04:49.650> gonna<00:04:49.770> play<00:04:49.949> an<00:04:50.009> integral

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
faster water's gonna play an integral

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.159 
faster water's gonna play an integral
part<00:04:50.639> later<00:04:50.849> on<00:04:51.030> we<00:04:51.240> actually<00:04:51.449> have<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.870> figure

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
part later on we actually have to figure

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.010 
part later on we actually have to figure
out<00:04:52.199> where<00:04:53.099> the<00:04:53.220> Rings<00:04:53.400> are<00:04:53.660> when<00:04:54.660> they<00:04:54.780> start

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
out where the Rings are when they start

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.469 
out where the Rings are when they start
hiding<00:04:55.430> yes<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.580> Rings<00:04:56.789> actually<00:04:57.270> start

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
hiding yes the Rings actually start

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.779 
hiding yes the Rings actually start
hiding<00:04:57.750> later<00:04:58.080> on<00:04:58.259> but<00:04:59.190> that's<00:04:59.310> not<00:04:59.490> important

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
hiding later on but that's not important

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.029 
hiding later on but that's not important
because<00:04:59.849> Superman<00:05:00.240> won<00:05:00.599> that's<00:05:01.259> it<00:05:01.620> game<00:05:02.009> over

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
because Superman won that's it game over
