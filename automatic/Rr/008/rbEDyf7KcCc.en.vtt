00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
like the whole planet this is what was

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.310 
like the whole planet this is what was
satisfied<00:00:52.670> to<00:00:52.699> me

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.099 

we<00:00:57.829> all<00:00:58.010> currents<00:00:58.370> always<00:00:58.579> telling<00:00:58.910> you<00:00:59.109> don't

go<00:01:00.320> too<00:01:00.679> close<00:01:00.829> to<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:01.250> edge<00:01:01.339> but<00:01:02.059> later<00:01:02.300> on<00:01:02.390> I

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
go too close to the edge but later on I

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:24.620 
go too close to the edge but later on I
found<00:01:02.539> out<00:01:02.930> it<00:01:03.109> feels<00:01:03.260> natural

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.350 

sometimes<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> ask<00:01:26.100> myself<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:27.299> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
sometimes they have to ask myself is it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.960 
sometimes they have to ask myself is it
really<00:01:27.810> worth<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.140> risk<00:01:28.430> because<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.700> know<00:01:29.759> it

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
really worth the risk because I know it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.270 
really worth the risk because I know it
all<00:01:30.090> comes<00:01:30.360> with<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> price

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.460 

in<00:01:36.730> a<00:01:36.850> que<00:01:37.030> if<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:37.240> go<00:01:37.390> from<00:01:37.630> daylight<00:01:38.020> into

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
in a que if you go from daylight into

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.830 
in a que if you go from daylight into
the<00:01:38.830> darkness<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.580> this<00:01:40.270> is<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.480> total

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
the darkness and this is a total

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.050 
the darkness and this is a total
different<00:01:41.170> program<00:01:41.530> so<00:01:41.830> danger<00:01:42.760> is<00:01:42.850> still

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
different program so danger is still

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.310 
different program so danger is still
there

at the very last moment before you go up
that's<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.740> scariest<00:01:49.130> one<00:01:49.400> because<00:01:49.790> you<00:01:50.390> know

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660
