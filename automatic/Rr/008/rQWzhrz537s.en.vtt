00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 here I am face washed without lens 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.880
 The color of my eyes is Brown 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.580
 of course and here I am comparing two 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.400
 contact lenses the left pain I 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.859
 I'm using a lens called Decio is 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.840
 an Italian and the eye contact lens 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.359
 right to one of those lenses that you 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.430
 find in any store then with this 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.300
 video I'll make the comparison of the two 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.710
 products 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.340
 if you have continued interest 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.679
 connected to brazil teams I'm here 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.620
 for the first time good second principle 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.510
 Instead, as a video in Portuguese, I was 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.640
 starting with a new friend of mine there at 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.280
 brazil is called andrÃ© gomes who has a 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.379
 button and channel and mustache and gave me a 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.390
 very important touch he spoke you already 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.280
 is seen here in Brazil and the staff are 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.870
 knowing that you are Brazilian but the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.039
 Most of your videos are English 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.059
 Why do not you do something in 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.070
 Portuguese 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.440
 so then I had the idea of doing this 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.199
 video I decided to start and if this series 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.260
 of videos in Portuguese with a review 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.719
 about these fantastic lenses if you 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.080
 You've never heard of her, I'll show you 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.850
 that the difference of a common one that you 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.960
 find in any supermarket your 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.420
 blue lenses 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.310
 the clearest I've got and I 'll compare 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.320
 with ten I 'm going to put this eye and 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.619
 you will notice the difference and then 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.240
 I will show the next lenses is set 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.229
 you really see the difference of a 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.479
 to the other 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.680
 I think it's one of the best lenses 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.890
 what's on the market 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.439
 they come from Italy and it takes more or less 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.860
 a week and a half two weeks to 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.350
 arrive and they do not fail to deliver 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.630
 do not charge to send it too but you 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.210
 will check all that in the link that I 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.180
 I will put here the official link below 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.790
 I'm going to put the glasses on the good 10th now. 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.329
 contacts and return here to show the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.729
 difference then taking is really is 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.070
 The difference is incredible, I'm going now. 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.500
 show the two lenses one near the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.200
 and you will notice how the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.350
 design from one to the other to ten and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.030
 use a white tone to form them 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.220
 while the other will use a tone 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.520
 bluish and that 's the difference 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.220
 contact lenses so let's go good 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.480
 how can you perceive this lens 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.810
 common you find in any 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.830
 supermarket she is drawn airs is 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:29.270
 formed by a blue coloration were 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.520
 some shades of brown but what 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.090
 dominance is the blue 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.580
 so this is what I think it does not give 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.790
 when you put your brown eyes 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.390
 a truly bluish tone 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.300
 already here with you can see adcio is 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.970
 practically white gives an impression that 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.230
 You 'll look white, but then the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.160
 their secret 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.700
 the design and the way that white is 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.709
 placed when it is combined with your 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.110
 eyes that it is they especially 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.160
 designed for those with dark eyes 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.950
 all this will make your in 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.010
 actually turn a blue eye're 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.290
 then the secret of the good 10 is that 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.940
 Guys, I hope you liked it. 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.519

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.230
