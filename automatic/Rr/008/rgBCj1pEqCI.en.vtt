00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
you take his helmet and you put it on it

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.190 
you take his helmet and you put it on it
gets<00:04:01.790> its<00:04:02.060> really<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:02.540> doesn't<00:04:02.840> look<00:04:03.020> like

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
gets its really it doesn't look like

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.120 
gets its really it doesn't look like
this<00:04:03.440> he<00:04:03.709> more

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
this he more

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.310 
this he more
it<00:04:04.400> gets<00:04:04.670> all<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.060> forms<00:04:05.510> if<00:04:05.720> his<00:04:05.870> head<00:04:06.050> is<00:04:06.170> so

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
it gets all the forms if his head is so

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.280 
it gets all the forms if his head is so
big<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:06.850> that's<00:04:07.850> exactly<00:04:08.510> how<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.720> Captain

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
big and that's exactly how the Captain

I'm<00:04:14.450> sure<00:04:14.900> Hasbro<00:04:15.530> noticed<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.310> I'm

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
I'm sure Hasbro noticed that and I'm

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.020 
I'm sure Hasbro noticed that and I'm
sure<00:04:16.730> they<00:04:17.000> didn't<00:04:17.330> care<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:19.340> not<00:04:19.580> cool

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
sure they didn't care and it's not cool

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.060 
sure they didn't care and it's not cool
it<00:04:20.330> ruined<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.019> figure<00:04:21.350> for<00:04:21.560> me<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:21.859> now<00:04:22.040> I

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
it ruined the figure for me and now I

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.370 
it ruined the figure for me and now I
can<00:04:22.370> only<00:04:22.520> pose<00:04:22.760> him<00:04:23.000> with<00:04:23.870> his<00:04:23.960> helmet<00:04:24.169> off

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
can only pose him with his helmet off

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.659 
can only pose him with his helmet off
because<00:04:24.680> I<00:04:24.710> think<00:04:24.830> it's<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.220> only<00:04:25.310> way<00:04:25.520> he
