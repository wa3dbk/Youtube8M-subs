00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.950
 hello friends let's show how we are 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.799
 he is for a puncture 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.480
 worth the puncture would be repaired with this 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.360
 team that can sell it in any 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.610
 replacement type is worth 11 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.099
 let's say pieces of rubber that gets into 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.130
 this tool and we have a skewer 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.270
 for what is to enlarge the gap a bit 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.800
 of the gap here we have a screw 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.989
 nailed as you can see we are going to 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.700
 remove we use a cutting pliers 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.890
 to get them out 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.670
 first what we are going to do would be 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.150
 hide some glue in the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.150
 patch that we are going to put 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.140
 we remove the screw 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.450
 Enlarged screw hole for 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.730
 unleash this tool here what 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.750
 We put in the same location and put 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.430
 inward 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.520
 as you can see is this tool has 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.510
 like a small little lines that 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.750
 have there to plant what is the 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.750
 screw 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:30.909
 we put it to the bottom 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:33.909
 and now we are enlarging what we have 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.909
 here 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.040
 we have already gotten what the pass now 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.900
 simply put up with this tab 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.180
 here we pull back here is false 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.190
 it stays put the let's check 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.780
 that you do not have for it, we are a 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.270
 little soapy water in the hole 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.980
 as you can see, not that bubble wants 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.230
 say that the bread stays totally 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.160
 introduced into the hole and the puncture 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.160
 Well, it would be repaired
