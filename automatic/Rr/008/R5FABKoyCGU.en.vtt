00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello beauties i wanted today 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.540
 I really like my morning beauty 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.810
 So routine shows skincare and make 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.099
 up 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.110
 I have quite a lot 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.300
 changed over what the products I am 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.620
 I read a lot about gravel I am 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.389
 far from the perfect one 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.430
 routine arrived but she is 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.630
 definitely different from before and me 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.580
 I wanted quite like today as a 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.180
 kind of intervening show what's up 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.340
 currently I'm the first to use in 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.680
 cancer filmpalast shot the racist 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.420
 series I punctuate a point 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.630
 On the wet face you look at it 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.640
 a game that's off again and almost bitter 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.469
 on that your skin is always careful 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.690
 dab dry and do not conflict with it 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.760
 her as little as possible in typical damage 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.980
 makes an alternative from the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.469
 The drugstore is the flood of oil 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.090
 I thank coupe dia de discovered from 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.489
 that should also be very mild and it around 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.530
 what happens is great because there drive 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.750
 is considered irritating and even if you 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.579
 so often the skin does not notice me 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.120
 Try more perfumed products too 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.789
 avoid 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.390
 as facial water to the layering 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.789
 moisturizer I use the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.070
 moskitos toner from paula's choice den 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.080
 I had practically so directly on mine 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.000
 Skin on without cotton pads containing 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.619
 many antioxidants like for example 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.619
 an extract of green tea and the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.210
 vitamins c and e and you will find it 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.220
 rarely such a face water with such 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.670
 Ingredients was also in the toner 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.070
 in it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.090
 this is considered one of the best 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.100
 humectant and it is the ingredient of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.020
 Skin has anti-inflammatory and helps 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.420
 to maintain the skin barrier 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.250
 I can see you below in the infobox 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.950
 a few sources to link if he 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.259
 myself like to read because I like me 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.960
 that's all for the first time 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.700
 read it, so to speak, I am God knows no 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.979
 expert and this video too no 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.869
 Dermatological consultation I thought 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.490
 Share with you what I like this piece 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.189
 somehow then for pie together 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.790
 I wear too much 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.049
 that meant a rating of scans that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.939
 are holding uwe lorenz yours 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.680
 humectant that 1000 times 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.719
 to bind water to its own weight 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.280
 so that its dry environment 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.079
 However, the moisture is not out of the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.430
 skin dries and it should dry out 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.259
 Do it with an aggressive one 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.909
 ingredient connect ocloo siwe 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.069
 ingredients like pedro date or 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.840
 silicones prevent water 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.660
 evaporates and thus protects against the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.820
 dry out 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.160
 he skin is a cheap alternative 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.990
 the higher booster of galea i do 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.970
 but rather use evening because of 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.430
 in the morning with me and pick up 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.320
 I did not use Christ next 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.940
 I the vérité cream of estée lauder 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.130
 they have a nice light texture and 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.600
 I love you to layer this is one 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.720
 good base moisturizer with 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.730
 silicones petroleum as more aggressive and 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.230
 it contains cholesterol for ami de 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.840
 which ingredients of the skin barrier 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.400
 are and a healthy skin barrier it 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.870
 among other things important and the skin 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.970
 Keep the screen moisturized 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.530
 careful election day dreamy and have 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.330
 applied much as much of her 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.940
 actually not thinner layer 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.680
 I use it in the morning with my spf 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.290
 to defend a little better lets the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.090
 But it is rather something for dry skin 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.580
 it follows my sunscreen and that 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.330
 the highlight spf 30 of paula's choice 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:05.620
 it irritates free mineral filters are 6% 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.360
 zinc oxide and 23 2% of itanium dioxide around 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.130
 you should be sufficiently protected 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.020
 orderly product apply far 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.280
 more than a thin comfortable layer like 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.830
 Personally, honestly I prefer 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.450
 but we would not be with you 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.430
 which I will add more videos 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.650
 because this theme is always so huge 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.750
 i'm just thinking that sunscreen 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.140
 as a prevention of sun damage and 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.520
 aging is important to 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.050
 I have vitamin D discussion 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.520
 contradictory things you read 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.130
 you have to decide for yourself whether 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.600
 wanted to wear her daily sunscreen 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.580
 my skin looks again from the hydro 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.160
 quite white from there comes right on 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.630
 make-up over it and with that my spf itself 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.730
 I can wear something already 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.470
 I have mascara on as a mascara 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.690
 now the waterproof max factor 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.610
 you bring back special effects 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.440
 For the first time after the purchase she uses 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.660
 I do not like it as good as 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.709
 But once that happens 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.080
 maybe even if the tube is one 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.150
 a little older my spf would have 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.520
 then on while I was still alive 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.980
 tea drink or get dressed ever 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.770
 and I do not know make earrings pure 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.290
 my very decorative mascara pater 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.030
 remove the mörike boys from lancome 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.459
 I really like the hydra 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.459
 because then the color is not so dark 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.200
 for me is so in itself without white spf 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.090
 so to speak 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.190
 who the too dark has a nice one 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.990
 glory finish and spoke a very complete 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.090
 thin layer and I think on the skin 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.100
 she looks really nice i can 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.600
 times in the infobox in review of 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.220
 Link to it has one 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.140
 whole video about this foundation 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.210
 made as far as I know and holds her 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.800
 no alcohol the night was mine 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.050
 become very important it 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.790
 many foundations will contain it 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.800
 construct from highlight and cuddle make 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.240
 up can be a bit sticky what me 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.950
 actually not that disturbed because 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.840
 I try a little face me 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.430
 to take hold of my skin a few ago 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.630
 I was there with them even more dry weeks 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.610
 we also got along better 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.410
 for my everyday look then movies 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.270
 actually only eyebrows use 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.940
 I need to be by anastacia I 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.500
 absolutely love and behind it say so 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.020
 that works better and times 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.020
 worse with the eyebrows of the juko 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.850
 That's how I look then I like to vary 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.470
 times the products I use in the morning 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.180
 and test myself through sunscreen 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.280
 if you are a bit practiced then 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.050
 lasts as a product line is routine 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.730
 not so long now 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.040
 Write me what topics we 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.450
 would like to see what he what I would see 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.000
 again so what should you discuss 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.620
 interested and otherwise we will see each other 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.020
 until the next video on twitter or 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.730
 on Instagram and I wish you one 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.260
