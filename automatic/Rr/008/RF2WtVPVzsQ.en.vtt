00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.310 
darice the original map now a lot of
people<00:01:30.210> are<00:01:30.420> wondering<00:01:30.540> what<00:01:30.840> exactly<00:01:30.930> is

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
people are wondering what exactly is

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.420 
people are wondering what exactly is
going<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.470> happen<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> storyline

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
going to happen now as a storyline

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.730 
going to happen now as a storyline
completely<00:01:33.329> over<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.930> exactly<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.560> on

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
completely over what exactly is going on

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.740 
completely over what exactly is going on
because<00:01:35.009> young<00:01:35.520> Greek<00:01:35.670> often<00:01:36.060> did<00:01:36.240> kill<00:01:36.450> older

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
because young Greek often did kill older

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.450 
because young Greek often did kill older
brick<00:01:36.930> oven<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.770> don't<00:01:37.979> know<00:01:38.130> well

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
brick oven and now we don't know well

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.190 
brick oven and now we don't know well
exactly<00:01:39.030> what<00:01:39.299> does<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.750> mean<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
exactly what does this mean for the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.810 
exactly what does this mean for the
storyline<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.159> disappearing<00:01:41.640> it's

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
storyline is it just disappearing it's

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.210 
storyline is it just disappearing it's
it<00:01:42.000> completely<00:01:42.930> new<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.890> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
it completely new what is going on and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.190 
it completely new what is going on and
to<00:01:44.280> put<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.030> very<00:01:45.420> simple<00:01:45.810> term

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
to put it in a very simple term

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.830 
to put it in a very simple term
basically<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.549> as<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:48.570> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
basically think of this as just a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.800 
basically think of this as just a
progression<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.280> don't<00:01:50.670> think<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.210> it

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
progression so don't think of this as it

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.899 
progression so don't think of this as it
cut<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.439> off<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.950> suddenly<00:01:53.220> what<00:01:53.610> happened

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
cut this off and suddenly what happened

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.090 
cut this off and suddenly what happened
before<00:01:54.030> never<00:01:54.540> existed<00:01:55.049> or<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.290> never<00:01:55.649> going

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
before never existed or it's never going

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.520 
before never existed or it's never going
to<00:01:56.159> happen<00:01:56.219> again<00:01:56.640> don't<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
to happen again don't think of it as the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.560 
to happen again don't think of it as the
events<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.310> new<00:01:59.610> remake<00:02:00.149> being

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
events of this new remake being

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.330 
events of this new remake being
something<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.229> completely<00:02:01.530> cuts<00:02:01.950> off<00:02:02.130> and

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
something that completely cuts off and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.950 
something that completely cuts off and
makes<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> previous<00:02:03.030> storyline<00:02:03.420> irrelevant

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
makes the previous storyline irrelevant

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.600 
makes the previous storyline irrelevant
that<00:02:04.080> is<00:02:04.200> not<00:02:04.409> true<00:02:04.620> what<00:02:04.979> exactly<00:02:05.430> is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
that is not true what exactly is

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.609 
that is not true what exactly is
happening<00:02:05.850> here<00:02:06.119> guys<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.479> think<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.229> as<00:02:07.409> if

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
happening here guys is think of it as if

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.230 
happening here guys is think of it as if
you<00:02:07.799> were<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.100> roller<00:02:08.399> coaster<00:02:08.520> so

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
you were on a roller coaster so

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.150 
you were on a roller coaster so
essentially<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.289> know<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> roller<00:02:10.740> coaster

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
essentially you know a roller coaster

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.440 
essentially you know a roller coaster
when<00:02:11.280> you're<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.520> through<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.880> loop<00:02:12.060> right

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
when you're going through the loop right

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.809 
when you're going through the loop right
you<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.959> kind<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.290> go<00:02:13.590> backwards<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:14.730> then

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
you you kind of go backwards but then

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.220 
you you kind of go backwards but then
you<00:02:14.910> continue<00:02:15.090> forward<00:02:15.569> so<00:02:15.840> even<00:02:16.140> though

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
you continue forward so even though

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.540 
you continue forward so even though
you're<00:02:16.410> going<00:02:16.709> backwards<00:02:17.010> you're<00:02:17.370> not

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
you're going backwards you're not

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.160 
you're going backwards you're not
eliminating<00:02:18.390> anything<00:02:18.780> you're<00:02:19.020> basically

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
eliminating anything you're basically

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.410 
eliminating anything you're basically
just<00:02:19.680> kind<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.010> going<00:02:20.250> back<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.850> reverse<00:02:21.180> and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
just kind of going back in reverse and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.420 
just kind of going back in reverse and
then<00:02:21.540> continuing<00:02:22.200> on<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:22.980> honestly<00:02:23.340> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
then continuing on that is honestly the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.040 
then continuing on that is honestly the
easiest<00:02:23.880> way<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.239> can<00:02:24.300> explain<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.900> so

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
easiest way that I can explain it so

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.170 
easiest way that I can explain it so
we're<00:02:25.290> not<00:02:25.440> eliminating<00:02:26.280> anything<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.940> track

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
we're not eliminating anything the track

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.910 
we're not eliminating anything the track
isn't<00:02:27.390> suddenly<00:02:27.690> going<00:02:28.140> back<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.590> cutting

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
isn't suddenly going back and cutting

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.500 
isn't suddenly going back and cutting
into<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.459> creating<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:29.910> separate<00:02:30.270> track

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
into it and creating a separate track

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.930 
into it and creating a separate track
basically<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.560> story<00:02:31.770> line<00:02:31.980> continues<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
basically the story line continues the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.699 
basically the story line continues the
events<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.480> happen<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.140> new<00:02:34.200> remake

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
events that happen on this new remake

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.130 
events that happen on this new remake
are<00:02:34.950> not<00:02:35.160> going<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.550> be<00:02:35.640> possible<00:02:35.880> unless<00:02:36.420> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
are not going to be possible unless the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.020 
are not going to be possible unless the
previous<00:02:37.769> storyline<00:02:38.190> happened<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:38.880> then

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
previous storyline happened so then

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.550 
previous storyline happened so then
being<00:02:39.180> able<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.480> return<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.080> reefs<00:02:40.260> would

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
being able to return to the reefs would

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.500 
being able to return to the reefs would
not<00:02:40.769> be<00:02:40.890> possible<00:02:41.100> if<00:02:41.550> they<00:02:41.730> weren't<00:02:41.970> going<00:02:42.360> to

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
not be possible if they weren't going to

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.150 
not be possible if they weren't going to
bury<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.019> if<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.260> events<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.590> black<00:02:43.769> ops<00:02:43.980> 2

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
bury it if the events of black ops 2

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160 
bury it if the events of black ops 2
didn't<00:02:44.430> happen<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.269> events<00:02:45.570> on<00:02:45.690> Origin

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
didn't happen if the events on Origin

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.470 
didn't happen if the events on Origin
didn't<00:02:46.500> happen<00:02:46.850> basically<00:02:47.850> think<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.269> this<00:02:48.420> as

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
didn't happen basically think of this as

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.840 
didn't happen basically think of this as
a<00:02:48.660> continuation<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:49.980> they<00:02:50.459> went<00:02:50.670> through

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
a continuation so they went through

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.640 
a continuation so they went through
everything<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.570> then<00:02:51.900> I'm<00:02:51.989> going<00:02:52.140> back<00:02:52.440> in

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
everything and then I'm going back in

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.170 
everything and then I'm going back in
time<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.070> now<00:02:53.190> they're<00:02:53.340> continuing<00:02:54.000> on

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
time and now they're continuing on

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.210 
time and now they're continuing on
forward<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.900> storyline<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.650> not<00:02:55.800> cut<00:02:56.070> off

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
forward so the storyline is not cut off

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.009 
forward so the storyline is not cut off
this<00:02:56.700> doesn't<00:02:57.060> make<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.269> previous<00:02:57.660> events

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
this doesn't make the previous events

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.960 
this doesn't make the previous events
are<00:02:58.110> relevant<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:58.830> just<00:02:59.070> continues<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.580> story

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
are relevant this just continues a story

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.850 
are relevant this just continues a story
line<00:03:00.180> from<00:03:00.390> there<00:03:00.570> in<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.840> new<00:03:01.050> direction<00:03:01.290> so

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
line from there in a new direction so

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.710 
line from there in a new direction so
just<00:03:02.190> think<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.550> as<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.760> roller<00:03:03.120> coaster<00:03:03.540> so

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
just think of it as a roller coaster so

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.449 
just think of it as a roller coaster so
you<00:03:03.810> went<00:03:03.989> in<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.170> loop<00:03:04.350> but<00:03:04.620> its<00:03:04.739> continuing<00:03:05.340> so

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
you went in a loop but its continuing so

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.160 
you went in a loop but its continuing so
it's<00:03:05.580> not<00:03:05.730> ending<00:03:06.209> it's<00:03:06.390> not<00:03:06.630> just<00:03:06.900> gone

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
it's not ending it's not just gone

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.110 
it's not ending it's not just gone
suddenly<00:03:07.500> it's<00:03:08.040> not<00:03:08.190> an<00:03:08.310> infinite<00:03:08.700> loop<00:03:08.820> it's

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
suddenly it's not an infinite loop it's

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.699 
suddenly it's not an infinite loop it's
a<00:03:09.209> continuation<00:03:09.660> this<00:03:10.079> storyline<00:03:10.500> and

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
a continuation this storyline and

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.350 
a continuation this storyline and
honestly<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.519> kind<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.880> think<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.209> pretty

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
honestly I kind of think it's pretty

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.670 
honestly I kind of think it's pretty

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
itself they mentioned that they needed

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.009 
itself they mentioned that they needed
to<00:03:22.320> awaken<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.220> old<00:03:23.459> crew<00:03:23.850> or<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> old<00:03:24.630> test

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
to awaken the old crew or the old test

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.020 
to awaken the old crew or the old test
subjects<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.769> this<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.459> old<00:03:26.579> crew<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:26.940> we

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
subjects and this is the old crew so we

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.160 
subjects and this is the old crew so we
don't<00:03:27.150> know<00:03:27.209> if<00:03:27.269> they're<00:03:27.360> going<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.540> pop<00:03:27.750> up<00:03:27.930> as

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
don't know if they're going to pop up as

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.630 
don't know if they're going to pop up as
like<00:03:28.290> an<00:03:28.410> easter<00:03:28.799> egg<00:03:28.829> where<00:03:29.160> they're<00:03:29.280> talking

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
like an easter egg where they're talking

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.890 
like an easter egg where they're talking
to<00:03:29.670> their<00:03:29.760> older<00:03:30.209> versions<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.720> themselves

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
to their older versions of themselves

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.900 
to their older versions of themselves
but<00:03:31.440> it's<00:03:31.950> gonna<00:03:32.040> be<00:03:32.130> very<00:03:32.370> interesting<00:03:32.430> to

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
but it's gonna be very interesting to

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.699 
but it's gonna be very interesting to
see<00:03:33.090> where<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.450> storyline<00:03:33.870> heads<00:03:34.140> from<00:03:34.380> here

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
see where the storyline heads from here

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.410 
see where the storyline heads from here
I<00:03:34.890> doubt<00:03:35.310> it's<00:03:35.489> going<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.730> continue<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.239> same

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
I doubt it's going to continue the same

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.120 
I doubt it's going to continue the same
linear<00:03:36.810> one<00:03:37.019> where<00:03:37.200> they<00:03:37.350> went<00:03:37.530> from<00:03:37.739> to

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
linear one where they went from to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.710 
linear one where they went from to
restore<00:03:38.579> something<00:03:38.760> else<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.269> think<00:03:39.630> it's

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
restore something else I think it's

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.640 
restore something else I think it's
going<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.870> be<00:03:39.959> something<00:03:40.110> completely

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
going to be something completely

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.140 
going to be something completely
different<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:41.250> bet<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.579> knew<00:03:41.700> his<00:03:41.790> guys<00:03:41.940> think
