00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.089
 and here on earth it is already possible to walk 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.950
 car without getting irritated by traffic 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.740
 our special envoys milestones 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.280
 losekann and sérgio gilz went to germany 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.800
 to know this novelty a taxi is 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.170
 powered by a computer 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.840
 the vehicle leaves the parking lot 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.480
 make the race the car arrives 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.109
 passengers board and proceed to the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.859
 destination without anyone behind the wheel 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.540
 science fiction otherworldly thing 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:37.980
 not in Germany where this is already possible 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.680
 whoever walks in this position is literally 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.070
 in the hands of technology 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.250
 in fact he does not need a non -driver 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.469
 because whoever drives the vehicle is a 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.500
 set of computers connected to the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.649
 radars there is a laser beam system 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.350
 there are video cameras and also a gps 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.020
 satellite-guided apparatus 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.250
 computers interpret the data and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.860
 allow the vehicle to accelerate frei 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.080
 park in any situation above all 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.049
 with safety 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.780
 paraphernalia installed in 22 points 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.810
 windscreen wiper in the bumper and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.130
 even the ceiling makes a constant sweep 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.740
 around the vehicle 360 ​​degree view 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.930
 it runs right inside the tracks in the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.020
 asphalt and keeps distance from other 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.990
 vehicle also perceives the signs of 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.729
 traffic to the red light and only 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.280
 advance in the green 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.409
 we are one of the main avenues of 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.509
 berlin and the two scientists who 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.090
 developed the autonomous car will 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.159
 seats in the front seats but only 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.290
 to give us an interview 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.490
 note that the hands of the project manager 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.829
 which range in right or touch the steering wheel 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.570
 the professor raul mouths of the university 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.850
 free of berlin where the project was 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.439
 explained explains that the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.170
 science is done 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.810
 now traffic laws need to be 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.179
 adapted to this technology so that the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.800
 invention can normally be used in the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.800
 capital the legal situation 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.890
 the car can be produced in 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.900
 two versions completely autonomous or 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.420
 guided by thought 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.570
 the driver uses a kind of crown with 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.360
 16 sensors that pick up brain signals 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.720
 the first tests showed that the 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.220
 Blessing car is the people aboard it 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.220
 the future is right there
