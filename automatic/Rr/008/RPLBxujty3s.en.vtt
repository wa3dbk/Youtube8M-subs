they<00:03:40.170> smell<00:03:40.560> really<00:03:40.590> season<00:03:41.220> there's<00:03:41.550> not<00:03:41.670> a

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
they smell really season there's not a

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.970 
they smell really season there's not a
lot<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.360> season<00:03:42.810> flavor<00:03:43.110> it's<00:03:43.770> like

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980

chickpea<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.520> hot<00:03:44.760> yeah<00:03:45.380> for<00:03:46.380> me<00:03:46.530> like<00:03:47.160> the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
chickpea and hot yeah for me like the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.450 
chickpea and hot yeah for me like the
texture<00:03:47.730> there's<00:03:48.390> there's<00:03:48.720> too<00:03:48.900> much<00:03:49.080> there

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 
texture there's there's too much there

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.650 
texture there's there's too much there
for<00:03:50.460> the<00:03:50.550> amount<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.880> seasoning<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.420> Heather

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
for the amount of seasoning like Heather

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.450 
for the amount of seasoning like Heather
been<00:03:51.960> more<00:03:52.230> seasoning<00:03:52.740> to<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:52.950> i<00:03:53.160> think<00:03:53.370> i

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
been more seasoning to it i think i

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.390 
been more seasoning to it i think i
could<00:03:53.640> get<00:03:53.730> past<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.180> texture<00:03:54.620> mm-hmm<00:03:55.620> but

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
could get past the texture mm-hmm but

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.640 
could get past the texture mm-hmm but
like<00:03:56.580> they<00:03:56.870> they<00:03:57.870> don't<00:03:58.020> do<00:03:58.170> one<00:03:58.410> another

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
like they they don't do one another

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.470 
like they they don't do one another
justice<00:03:59.130> I<00:03:59.280> think<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.700> perfect<00:03:59.850> way<00:04:00.150> would<00:04:00.330> be

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
justice I think the perfect way would be

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.630 
justice I think the perfect way would be
this<00:04:00.720> seasoning<00:04:01.410> on<00:04:01.560> these<00:04:01.860> things<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.550> are

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
this seasoning on these things that are

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.630 
this seasoning on these things that are
we<00:04:02.730> add<00:04:02.970> latin<00:04:03.390> women<00:04:03.530> yeah<00:04:04.530> definitely<00:04:04.800> I'll

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
we add latin women yeah definitely I'll

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.160 
we add latin women yeah definitely I'll
give<00:04:05.880> these<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> 5<00:04:06.360> a<00:04:06.390> half<00:04:08.600> i'm<00:04:09.600> gonna<00:04:09.780> drop<00:04:09.990> it

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
give these a 5 a half i'm gonna drop it

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.300 
give these a 5 a half i'm gonna drop it
down<00:04:10.260> to<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.470> forward<00:04:10.860> is<00:04:10.950> because<00:04:11.100> i<00:04:11.160> don't

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
down to the forward is because i don't

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.480 
down to the forward is because i don't
like<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.520> texture<00:04:11.850> yeah<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:13.650> know<00:04:13.740> they<00:04:14.160> they

do have a good bit of flavor behind him

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.430 
do have a good bit of flavor behind him
with<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.430> seasoning<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.540> can't<00:04:18.989> quite<00:04:19.140> put<00:04:19.410> my

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
with that seasoning I can't quite put my

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
but there's a very strong taste of

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.850 
but there's a very strong taste of
seasoning<00:04:23.449> at<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.990> beginning<00:04:24.259> and<00:04:24.530> it's<00:04:24.650> not
