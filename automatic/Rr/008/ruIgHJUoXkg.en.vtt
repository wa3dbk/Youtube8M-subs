00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.490 
I just got the phone all dried off and
everything<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.880> perfect<00:02:27.209> order<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.900> checked

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
everything is in perfect order I checked

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.570 
everything is in perfect order I checked
to<00:02:28.620> make<00:02:28.650> sure<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.099> water<00:02:29.250> on<00:02:29.489> the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
to make sure that the water on the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.729 
to make sure that the water on the
inside<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.390> still<00:02:30.599> works<00:02:30.810> fine<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.560> only

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
inside and it still works fine the only

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.150 
inside and it still works fine the only
thing<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.519> can't<00:02:32.970> touch<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.110> screen<00:02:34.500> or<00:02:34.980> the

thing you can't touch the screen or the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.970 
thing you can't touch the screen or the
screen<00:02:35.580> has<00:02:35.670> no<00:02:35.730> response<00:02:36.450> when<00:02:36.810> it's<00:02:36.989> wet<00:02:37.290> so

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
screen has no response when it's wet so

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.380 
screen has no response when it's wet so
I<00:02:38.010> had<00:02:38.160> did<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.459> trouble<00:02:38.580> stopping<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
I had did have trouble stopping the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.759 
I had did have trouble stopping the
video<00:02:40.010> but<00:02:41.010> other<00:02:41.730> than<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.510> was<00:02:42.569> good<00:02:43.230> it

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
video but other than that it was good it

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.420 
video but other than that it was good it
was<00:02:43.920> surprisingly<00:02:44.430> clear<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.310> my

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
was surprisingly clear and so that is my

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.050 
was surprisingly clear and so that is my
underwater<00:02:47.940> tests<00:02:48.600> for<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.610> lifeproof<00:02:50.610> case
