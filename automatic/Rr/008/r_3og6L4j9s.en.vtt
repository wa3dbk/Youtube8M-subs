every game plus Asus does design their
own<00:02:12.470> cooling<00:02:12.890> system<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.400> doesn't<00:02:13.640> come

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
own cooling system so it doesn't come

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.370 
own cooling system so it doesn't come
with<00:02:13.880> stop<00:02:14.060> cooling<00:02:14.300> well<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.110> sounds

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
with stop cooling well that sounds

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.680 
with stop cooling well that sounds
really<00:02:15.530> good<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:16.340> system<00:02:17.300> like<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:17.569> would

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
really good a system like that would

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.630 
really good a system like that would
probably<00:02:17.870> be<00:02:18.319> awesome<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.069> play<00:02:19.220> around<00:02:19.459> I

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
probably be awesome to play around I

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.860 
probably be awesome to play around I
think<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.910> only<00:02:20.060> other<00:02:20.180> place<00:02:20.360> I'd<00:02:20.510> consider

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
think the only other place I'd consider

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.750 
think the only other place I'd consider
