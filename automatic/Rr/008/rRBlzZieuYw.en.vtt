that pipe perfectly they're both in
great<00:00:17.550> shape<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:19.039> I<00:00:20.039> decided<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.520> check<00:00:21.300> valve

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
great shape and I decided to check valve

locks lash adjustment well we got the
motor<00:00:24.150> out<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:25.199> can't<00:00:25.439> do<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.740> when<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.920> motor

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
motor out you can't do it when the motor

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.250 
motor out you can't do it when the motor
is<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.640> thought<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.449> might<00:00:27.689> want<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.019> show<00:00:28.199> you

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
is in I thought I might want to show you

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.970 
is in I thought I might want to show you
what<00:00:28.529> valves<00:00:28.980> look<00:00:29.160> like<00:00:30.080> with<00:00:31.080> no<00:00:31.289> springs<00:00:31.740> on

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
what valves look like with no springs on

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.540 
what valves look like with no springs on
them<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.840> rockers<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.469> top<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.040> pushes<00:00:35.399> them

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
them the rockers on top that pushes them

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.150 
them the rockers on top that pushes them
down<00:00:35.809> when<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> cam<00:00:37.200> goes<00:00:37.469> around<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.950> hits

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
down when the cam goes around and hits

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.090 
down when the cam goes around and hits
that<00:00:38.370> pad<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:39.899> then<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.260> look<00:00:40.440> far<00:00:40.770> back

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
that pad and then if you look far back

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.459 
that pad and then if you look far back
down<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> left<00:00:41.969> you'll<00:00:42.300> see<00:00:42.390> another<00:00:42.840> arm

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
down to the left you'll see another arm

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.889 
down to the left you'll see another arm
that<00:00:43.770> looks<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> rocker<00:00:44.489> arm<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.629> that's

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that looks like a rocker arm and that's

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.600 
that looks like a rocker arm and that's
the<00:00:46.110> little<00:00:46.379> finger<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.890> lifts<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> valves

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the little finger that lifts the valves

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.790 
the little finger that lifts the valves
up<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.969> keeps<00:00:48.149> them<00:00:48.360> closed<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:49.500> this

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
up and keeps them closed because this

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.369 
up and keeps them closed because this
has<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:51.230> shaft<00:00:52.230> back<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.219> torsion<00:00:54.000> bar

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
has a shaft back in there a torsion bar

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.110 
has a shaft back in there a torsion bar
it<00:00:55.379> twists<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> shaft<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.579> does<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.760> some

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
it twists the shaft like it does on some

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.750 
it twists the shaft like it does on some
cars<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.600> torsion<00:00:57.960> bars<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:59.280> that's<00:00:59.550> what

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
cars with torsion bars and that's what

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.700 
cars with torsion bars and that's what
gives<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.719> springiness<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.289> fold<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
gives it the springiness to fold the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.160 
gives it the springiness to fold the
belt<00:01:01.890> back<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> keep<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.670> tight<00:01:03.170> really

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
belt back up to keep it tight really

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
belt back up to keep it tight really
unique<00:01:04.500> designed<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.280> doubt<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.970> would<00:01:06.060> wear

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
unique designed I doubt it would wear

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.350 
unique designed I doubt it would wear
out<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.979> I<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.250> other<00:01:08.460> unique<00:01:08.939> design<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
out and I really other unique design is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.460 
out and I really other unique design is
the<00:01:10.130> adjustment<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.310> valves<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:12.470> little

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the adjustment for the valves a little

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.120 
the adjustment for the valves a little
lock<00:01:13.950> nut<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> set<00:01:14.640> screw<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:16.130> looks

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
lock nut and set screw and that looks

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.560 
lock nut and set screw and that looks
like<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.460> goes<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.950> shaft<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
like it goes to the shaft that the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.249 
like it goes to the shaft that the
rocker<00:01:21.570> pivots<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.790> must<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.259> cam

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
rocker pivots on and it must be a cam

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.620 
rocker pivots on and it must be a cam
shaped<00:01:25.799> or<00:01:26.009> eccentric<00:01:26.430> shaped<00:01:26.880> shaft<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
shaped or eccentric shaped shaft so that

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.090 
shaped or eccentric shaped shaft so that
when<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.840> rotate<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.350> little<00:01:28.560> shaft<00:01:28.799> it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
when you rotate that little shaft it

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.749 
when you rotate that little shaft it
must<00:01:29.310> raise<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.240> lower<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.780> pivot<00:01:31.079> point

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
must raise and lower the pivot point

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.580 
must raise and lower the pivot point
sweet<00:01:33.829> no<00:01:34.829> play<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> timing<00:01:35.700> chain<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> no

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
sweet no play in the timing chain so no

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.910 
sweet no play in the timing chain so no

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.090 
redneck repairs here and they're going
to<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> ones<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.850> backside<00:01:43.100> that's

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
to do the ones on the backside that's

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.179 
to do the ones on the backside that's
for<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> intake<00:01:45.049> now<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> adjust<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.860> intake
