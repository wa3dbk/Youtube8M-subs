00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.350
 hello friends welcome to this new 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.450
 video of the clash of class guide where 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.970
 I'm going to show you how to play the pc to this 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.770
 game if you can play on pc using a 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.980
 program that is called bluestacks and that 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.810
 we can download it for free 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.750
 looking for it in google bluestacks here what 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.640
 you see and you put in the application 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.420
 quiet that has no virus and what 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.190
 download for pc 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.769
 apart you will see it because it is going to 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.350
 check my antivirus as soon as 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.789
 download the installer and this is 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.969
 application will allow us to play 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.370
 clash of class in our in our pc 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.680
 well you see that it is a safe file 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.199
 as the antivirus norton says and there would be 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.059
 to install it and good when installed 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.039
 then I continue explaining how to create 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.109
 How to download the game within 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.409
 the application and you will also have to 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.839
 create an account and if you do not have to 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.210
 google + to play this game well here 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.920
 you come the conditions you mark that 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.170
 accept the terms you give to 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.240
 next well then let's give it 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.610
 that works with these applications 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.860
 installed since it says it's better if 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.840
 we install those applications I have to 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.789
 tell you that this program is going to get a 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.220
 moment that is going to ask you or money 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.619
 or install applications then on that 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.119
 case then what you do is install some 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.220
 programs that the bad guys are going to 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.399
 consume some computer resources 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.459
 but hey you can play for free 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.200
 program install those programs that you 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:39.300
 they ask is not a very serious thing either 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.180
 you need to pay to use this program 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.130
 and 15 minutes later if it takes one 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.840
 eternity is a punch that they have to 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.360
 wait a lot to be able to play 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.870
 clash of plants I started but 15 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.430
 minutes later we got that 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.600
 install the blues tags and from this 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.310
 time will not wait much longer 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.020
 to play the clash of clan will be 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.600
 practically immediate but the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.400
 installation is very very slow this is what 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.440
 I explain because if the wall you install 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.820
 the blues tags maybe you think that the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.440
 computer has been blocked and that the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.170
 installation has failed but that's not it 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.630
 but simply that it is very very slow 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.720
 installation and now we have two options 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.700
 one would be to pay money for using this 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.490
 program that I already told you is 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.840
 free so there's no need to press the 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.820
 option on the left but simply 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.830
 install the applications that go to us 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.240
 asking for the program and it will be installed 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.610
 in the computer and it will occupy the space 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.800
 but in exchange we will not pay anything and 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.660
 here we would have this screen from the 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.120
 which we can install the clash of plants 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.550
 in our pc clicking on the face of 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.470
 barbarian or looking for clash of plants in the 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.640
 seeker as I am teaching myself already 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.590
 I have the game installed so I 'm not going 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.690
 and install it and you will also have to 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.410
 put your gmail user if you do not 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.080
 you have 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.970
 you would have to create one and I 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.740
 as I have also gotten it 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.709
 directly I load the game and here 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.220
 You can see my village and how I'm playing 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.170
 the pc and nothing else that is all that you 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.600
 I wanted to tell you already know if you have doubts 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.270
 leave it in comments and I remind you that 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.660
 a like I am happy the day a greeting and 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.660
 see you later 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.160
