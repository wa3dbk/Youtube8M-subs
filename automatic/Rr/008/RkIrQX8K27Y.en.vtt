4<00:02:37.350> so<00:02:38.350> let's<00:02:38.620> open<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:38.980> up<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:40.510> will<00:02:40.660> say

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
4 so let's open that up and it will say

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.200 
4 so let's open that up and it will say
processing<00:02:41.620> firmware<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.490> let's<00:02:42.760> just<00:02:42.820> let<00:02:43.090> it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
processing firmware so let's just let it

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.270 
processing firmware so let's just let it
process<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.990> doesn't<00:02:44.440> usually<00:02:44.530> take<00:02:44.710> too<00:02:45.100> long

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
process it doesn't usually take too long

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.000 
process it doesn't usually take too long
all<00:02:46.210> right<00:02:46.360> then<00:02:46.600> we'll<00:02:46.780> say<00:02:47.020> ipsw

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
all right then we'll say ipsw

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.150 
all right then we'll say ipsw
successfully<00:02:48.760> identified<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:50.290> click<00:02:50.620> Next

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
successfully identified just click Next

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.600 
successfully identified just click Next
and<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:52.630> will<00:02:52.780> say<00:02:53.110> preparing<00:02:53.890> jailbreak<00:02:54.340> data

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
and it will say preparing jailbreak data

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.720 
and it will say preparing jailbreak data
so<00:02:55.270> let's<00:02:55.540> just<00:02:55.690> let<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:55.900> prepare<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.730> it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
so let's just let it prepare and it

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.250 
so let's just let it prepare and it
doesn't<00:02:58.030> usually<00:02:58.120> take<00:02:58.300> too<00:02:58.600> long<00:02:58.750> now

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
doesn't usually take too long now

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.500 
doesn't usually take too long now
