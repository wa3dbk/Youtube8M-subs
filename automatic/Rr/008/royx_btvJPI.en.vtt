pre<00:02:07.009> applied<00:02:07.310> with<00:02:07.489> a<00:02:07.520> thermal<00:02:07.940> grease<00:02:08.149> so

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
pre applied with a thermal grease so

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.089 
pre applied with a thermal grease so
that's<00:02:08.690> gonna<00:02:08.840> save<00:02:09.110> you<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.259> step<00:02:09.349> right<00:02:09.800> there

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
that's gonna save you a step right there

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.710 
that's gonna save you a step right there
you<00:02:10.220> don't<00:02:10.399> have<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:10.670> worry<00:02:11.120> about<00:02:11.360> that<00:02:11.540> one

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
you don't have to worry about that one

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.380 
you don't have to worry about that one
just<00:02:11.900> careful<00:02:12.260> don't<00:02:12.440> touch<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:14.180> ring

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
just careful don't touch it and the ring

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.589 
just careful don't touch it and the ring
and<00:02:14.660> bracket<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.590> already<00:02:16.069> good<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.060> go<00:02:17.209> so

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
and bracket is already good to go so

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.170 
and bracket is already good to go so
that's<00:02:17.780> gonna<00:02:18.050> make<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.319> easy<00:02:18.830> again<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.430> save

that's gonna make it easy again and save

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.000 
that's gonna make it easy again and save
you<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.330> step<00:02:20.420> there's<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.469> ring<00:02:21.739> that<00:02:21.920> it

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
you a step there's that ring that it

looking at the orientation the the fan
flow<00:02:37.739> you<00:02:38.370> want<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.670> make<00:02:38.790> sure<00:02:38.819> that<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.239> look

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
flow you want to make sure that you look

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.570 
flow you want to make sure that you look
into<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.200> figure<00:02:40.769> out<00:02:40.890> how<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.129> want<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.459> do

into that figure out how you want to do
it<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.879> my<00:02:42.209> case<00:02:42.510> I'm<00:02:42.750> gonna<00:02:42.870> be<00:02:43.049> blowing<00:02:43.349> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
it in my case I'm gonna be blowing the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.220 
it in my case I'm gonna be blowing the
hot<00:02:43.890> air<00:02:44.220> out<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.269> case<00:02:45.510> outside

hot air out of the case outside
throughout<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.069> top<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:48.000> I've<00:02:48.390> already

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
throughout the top so I've already

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.330 
throughout the top so I've already
positioned<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.590> fence<00:02:49.860> they're<00:02:50.069> gonna<00:02:50.190> be

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
positioned the fence they're gonna be

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.660 
positioned the fence they're gonna be
like<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:52.019> I've<00:02:52.410> put<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.920> screws

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
like this and I've put in the screws

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.130 
like this and I've put in the screws
that<00:02:53.849> it<00:02:53.970> comes<00:02:54.180> with<00:02:54.360> these<00:02:54.480> long<00:02:54.750> screws

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
that it comes with these long screws

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.770 
that it comes with these long screws
attach<00:02:55.860> them<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.610> radiator<00:02:57.030> through<00:02:57.360> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
attach them to the radiator through the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.440 
attach them to the radiator through the
holes<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.829> fans<00:02:59.099> of<00:02:59.340> course<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.849> that's

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
holes of the fans of course and that's

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.960 
holes of the fans of course and that's
the<00:03:00.720> first<00:03:00.930> step<00:03:01.290> for<00:03:01.560> me<00:03:01.739> whenever<00:03:02.310> you

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
the first step for me whenever you

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.330 
the first step for me whenever you
install<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.599> CPU<00:03:04.079> cooler<00:03:04.349> like<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.890> now

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
install a CPU cooler like this now

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.789 
install a CPU cooler like this now
here's<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.970> case<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.480> BitFenix<00:03:06.720> phenom<00:03:07.500> case

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
here's the case the BitFenix phenom case

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.000 
here's the case the BitFenix phenom case
that<00:03:08.220> i've<00:03:08.630> got<00:03:09.630> i've<00:03:10.049> chosen<00:03:10.349> basically<00:03:10.890> this

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
that i've got i've chosen basically this

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.890 
that i've got i've chosen basically this
one<00:03:11.190> because<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:11.610> easy<00:03:11.910> it's<00:03:12.120> modular<00:03:12.329> I<00:03:12.629> can

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
one because it's easy it's modular I can

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.710 
one because it's easy it's modular I can
gut<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.260> very<00:03:13.950> very<00:03:14.370> nicely<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:15.060> take<00:03:15.569> out

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
gut it very very nicely and take out

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.750 
gut it very very nicely and take out
things<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.650> can<00:03:16.920> have<00:03:17.040> lots<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.489> space

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
things so that I can have lots of space

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.360 
things so that I can have lots of space
and<00:03:18.030> believe<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.900> or<00:03:18.959> not<00:03:19.079> this<00:03:19.739> fits

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
and believe it or not this fits

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.490 
and believe it or not this fits
beautifully<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:21.360> there<00:03:21.629> doesn't<00:03:22.140> touch

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
beautifully in there doesn't touch

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.619 
beautifully in there doesn't touch

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
matter of planning ahead you know

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.050 
matter of planning ahead you know
figuring<00:03:55.829> out<00:03:56.040> what<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.790> want

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
figuring out what it is that you want

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.059 
figuring out what it is that you want
can<00:03:57.389> it<00:03:57.510> fit<00:03:57.720> in<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.930> case<00:03:58.169> look<00:03:58.859> at<00:03:58.980> the

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
can it fit in the case look at the

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.460 
can it fit in the case look at the
dimensions<00:03:59.700> pick<00:04:00.329> your<00:04:00.510> parts<00:04:00.810> appropriately

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
dimensions pick your parts appropriately

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.470 
dimensions pick your parts appropriately
and<00:04:01.650> then<00:04:01.859> it'll<00:04:02.280> look<00:04:02.489> beautiful

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
and then it'll look beautiful

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.449 
and then it'll look beautiful
here's<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.989> system<00:04:04.410> up<00:04:04.799> and<00:04:05.010> running<00:04:05.099> we're

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
again AMD machine in this case but it

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.670 
again AMD machine in this case but it
can<00:04:12.239> be<00:04:12.329> an<00:04:12.419> Intel<00:04:12.780> okay<00:04:13.319> it<00:04:13.380> doesn't<00:04:13.560> matter

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
can be an Intel okay it doesn't matter
