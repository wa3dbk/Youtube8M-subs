start with the negative terminal first

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.690 
start with the negative terminal first
so<00:03:43.760> disconnect<00:03:44.269> your<00:03:44.360> negative<00:03:44.690> terminal

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
battery and the reason we do that is if

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.199 
battery and the reason we do that is if
we're<00:04:04.220> going<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.489> try<00:04:04.640> and<00:04:04.670> disconnect<00:04:05.180> the
