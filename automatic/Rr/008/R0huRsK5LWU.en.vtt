00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
you run off then you'll of course have

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.750 
you run off then you'll of course have
to<00:02:54.870> wait<00:02:55.019> for<00:02:55.049> fun<00:02:55.470> time<00:02:55.709> Frank<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.220> catch<00:02:56.430> up

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
to wait for fun time Frank to catch up

when it comes to streaming is because

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.809 
when it comes to streaming is because
fun<00:03:04.409> time<00:03:04.620> Frank<00:03:04.890> will<00:03:05.010> actually<00:03:05.340> be<00:03:05.430> doing<00:03:05.670> a
