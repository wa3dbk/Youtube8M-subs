00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.109
 welcome two more case will be 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.660
 all the video on my video today times 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.980
 again in the web app and until the first one 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.389
 Concerts already expected and yes to it 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.740
 would like to come back now 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.810
 I first was made 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.550
 So I have now only times everything 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.100
 Sold what I need we go 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.330
 just on transfer list 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.760
 and there I have all the players 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.650
 Simply all have I pulled sold 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.029
 but then a few very cheap 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.199
 you can bid and you have too 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.630
 again sells some silver here 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.300
 player then we have to for more 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.820
 fierce at 4,000 I have for 2200 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.930
 sold because I also have 4100 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.600
 I had sold the same player 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:49.050
 pulled usa because here for the 3300 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.110
 other country for 750 and so I had 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.670
 then we have been able to get 15,000 here 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.960
 looks 15 1869 contract could be more 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.210
 but I do not have it that much yet 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.760
 I'm done now in the process slower 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.650
 look yes that I have a few cheap 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.600
 Players can sell while doing so 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.520
 but here there are people who by 65,000 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.049
 coins but there are also some of them 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.220
 We already bought many fans 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.689
 sold quickly and have them sold 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.869
 somehow swapped came from 1 million 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.310
 already and after two days so nice 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.040
 brutal but I do not want me first 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.150
 Buy fifa points 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.830
 but I will check who is there 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.439
 a few coins he plays for that is 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.340
 the first episode episode of road to 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.869
 dream team 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.369
 I already had it on facebook yesterday 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.720
 I wrote a policy 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.680
 who will do it and what it will look like 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.630
 he is now so that's my team that 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.159
 I imagine someday 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.270
 to have 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.280
 but you can see it's getting pretty 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.530
 expensive so it will not be cheap and you 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.520
 have to trade a lot and play and something 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.659
 have luck and the whole team 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.430
 build 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.380
 but I am firmly convinced that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.909
 I'll get the biggest part of it someday 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.460
 Maybe everyone will have it 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.490
 Do not play games on info ag 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.170
 system 4-2-3-1 in goal of course manual 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.659
 new i'm bavarian fan and he for me 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.210
 the best part of the bundesliga 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.710
 also in fifa good can be absolutely 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.060
 shown better performance but still 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.789
 I think the cool fifa because of that 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.810
 I also packed in the gate 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.069
 Timely I have pisczek then 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.150
 taken from dortmund has pretty good 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.609
 for the right-back is too 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.959
 fast with 85 ps lame has synonymous 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.480
 pretty good but only one 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.680
 a bit too slow at 79 paces and up 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.450
 the outside needs between right 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.420
 fast players are good too 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.700
 defense will have in defense 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.799
 consists of mats hummels from the bvb and 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.349
 dante are not the fastest ones 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.750
 with 65 and 68 , it is much faster 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.730
 in the bundesliga for example by 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.090
 santana sokratis and so on and so on 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.040
 on 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.480
 but I put a lot of emphasis on 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.889
 defense values ​​here 86 84 85 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.260
 header he 81 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:50.180
 So I think with mine 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.069
 full-backs and with the 26 cent 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.629
 did not appreciate too many 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.699
 have problems because of the pace but if 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.680
 I have problems as I said 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.629
 I can swap myself left 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.939
 on the left of course defends david alaba 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.849
 better defender on this position 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:07.310
 be from the Bundesliga then to the 26 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.459
 so I once gustavo to bayern 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.659
 changed to wolfsburg is easy 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:16.879
 tickets for 1 675-670 will fit then 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.560
 83 more defenses and 70 heads 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.599
 white towering so that can 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.159
 I only recommend it for a long time 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.019
 think about it when I'm second six 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.000
 next to possibly bands of dortmund or 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.669
 of leverkusen I have to because but 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.900
 opted for gündogan from bvb 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:34.579
 because he has pretty good 82 ps 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.169
 then 84 can fit as well 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.769
 sixth to distribute the balls nicely 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:41.780
 good dribbling with four skills and 48 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.540
 foot outrageous further the area 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.609
 can and indeed will 74 defense, 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.889
 sieber show now less head 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.650
 strongest but if definitely run 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.939
 then ten years old, I've got Mario 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.000
 from dortmunder to bavaria has changed 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:59.329
 is very good it is also 44 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.810
 So 4 skills and 4 feet 90 dribbling 80 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.129
 I would say or optimized to 82 ps 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.930
 on the outside come with the most expensive 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.900
 player once I'm right arjen 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.959
 robben from bavaria is also really horny 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.750
 so soon 92 ps 290 dribbling 85 shot 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.609
 and 80 of course fit a lot but that is true 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.469
 only two within the left in 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.449
 right ear now has a goal 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:22.570
 I scored against Nuremberg but 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.099
 not in spite of just holding his left 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.150
 but for that we have left here 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.850
 Ribery 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.639
 Europe's footballer of the year has on 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.750
 five skills has four feet and I think so 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.690
 that we are the most expensive player 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.030
 is ever in my team then think 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.770
 I get a word and then think 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.389
 I'm newer and to godfather and the 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.560
 remaining players we think you 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.130
 I'm for a solid price 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.860
 welcome 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.910
 At least I'm glad if 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.190
 I'm lucky if I could 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.590
 get the good alternative for ribéry 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.620
 Of course marco is also right 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.449
 really cool red for all groups there 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.180
 of course thomas müller or shaqiri 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.590
 or blasczykowski so I have to go 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.090
 I think I'll start looking , of course 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.370
 to take other players on the outside 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.020
 but with luck I will 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.360
 maybe a classy topic 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.330
 modern ribery in chair robert 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.949
 lewandowski from bvb 86 of the total 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.930
 is just really horny for me 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.120
 striker a really good one 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.130
 played together last year and 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.990
 also deserves 86 welcome and what me 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.120
 Most of all, four skills and 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.949
 fourfold I was in favor of it 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.800
 decided instead for mandzukic because 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:30.169
 he has four skills as I said and in 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.599
 fifa old team tricks one from time to time 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.620
 gladly taken with her because of that 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.389
 I already have him in the demo 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.479
 played 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:40.330
 and yes the case pretty good off the team 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.560
 was we want to build now 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.060
 Of course, in the beginning, something has to be done 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.130
 Bake smaller rolls 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.470
 but I think I already have 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.690
 thousands 15,000 is forgiving the 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:54.919
 world but with the content I can 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.090
 to release some more and you play 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.370
 can write a comment 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.240

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.620
