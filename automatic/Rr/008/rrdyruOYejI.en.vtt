00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.300 

I<00:00:01.199> try<00:00:02.199> to<00:00:02.230> make<00:00:02.469> a<00:00:02.500> decision<00:00:02.889> when<00:00:03.189> I'm

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.310 
I try to make a decision when I'm

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.839 
I try to make a decision when I'm
drawing<00:00:03.699> as<00:00:03.960> to<00:00:04.960> whether<00:00:05.680> I<00:00:05.800> could<00:00:05.979> take<00:00:06.519> this

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:06.849 
drawing as to whether I could take this

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:11.270 
drawing as to whether I could take this
out<00:00:07.059> or<00:00:07.769> whether<00:00:08.769> I<00:00:08.980> need<00:00:09.940> to<00:00:09.969> create<00:00:10.900> a<00:00:10.929> tone

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
out or whether I need to create a tone

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.759 
out or whether I need to create a tone
but<00:00:12.280> every<00:00:12.549> time<00:00:12.759> I<00:00:13.030> segment<00:00:13.660> the<00:00:14.139> tone<00:00:14.469> in<00:00:14.740> the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:14.769 
but every time I segment the tone in the

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.060 
but every time I segment the tone in the
forehead<00:00:15.309> I'm<00:00:16.090> going<00:00:16.539> to<00:00:16.780> end<00:00:17.140> up<00:00:17.500> by<00:00:17.710> maybe

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
forehead I'm going to end up by maybe

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.550 
forehead I'm going to end up by maybe
not<00:00:18.310> matching<00:00:18.640> enough<00:00:18.850> as<00:00:19.050> well<00:00:20.050> as<00:00:20.170> I<00:00:20.290> could

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
not matching enough as well as I could

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.580 
not matching enough as well as I could
so<00:00:21.250> often<00:00:21.910> what<00:00:22.090> I'll<00:00:22.210> do<00:00:22.450> is<00:00:22.750> I<00:00:22.810> will<00:00:23.080> draw

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
so often what I'll do is I will draw

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.810 
so often what I'll do is I will draw
this<00:00:23.950> in<00:00:24.280> here<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:26.230> lightly<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:26.890> then<00:00:27.610> I'll

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
this in here just lightly and then I'll

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.720 
this in here just lightly and then I'll
go<00:00:28.060> through<00:00:28.480> and<00:00:29.010> create<00:00:30.010> my<00:00:30.310> value<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:33.550> it's

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
go through and create my value if it's

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.040 
go through and create my value if it's
important<00:00:34.179> for<00:00:34.239> me<00:00:34.359> to<00:00:34.449> know<00:00:34.570> where<00:00:34.690> the<00:00:34.809> hair

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
important for me to know where the hair

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.099 
important for me to know where the hair
is<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.999> most<00:00:36.999> often<00:00:37.449> as<00:00:37.570> you<00:00:37.690> all<00:00:37.839> know<00:00:38.079> I

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:38.109 
is and most often as you all know I

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:43.439 
is and most often as you all know I
don't<00:00:38.649> put<00:00:38.769> it<00:00:38.890> on<00:00:38.920> until<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.339> last<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:43.210> it's

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
don't put it on until the last if it's

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:44.579 
don't put it on until the last if it's
important<00:00:43.809> for<00:00:43.899> me<00:00:44.019> to<00:00:44.109> know<00:00:44.199> where<00:00:44.350> it<00:00:44.469> is

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
important for me to know where it is

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.209 
important for me to know where it is
though<00:00:44.920> so<00:00:45.159> that<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:46.149> can<00:00:46.649> make<00:00:47.649> sure<00:00:47.679> that<00:00:47.949> I'm

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
though so that I can make sure that I'm

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.099 
though so that I can make sure that I'm
not<00:00:48.249> creating<00:00:48.909> another<00:00:49.149> problem<00:00:49.239> I<00:00:51.929> will<00:00:52.929> go

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
not creating another problem I will go

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.069 
not creating another problem I will go
ahead<00:00:53.229> and<00:00:53.829> just<00:00:54.460> account<00:00:54.909> for<00:00:55.179> this<00:00:55.359> so<00:00:55.960> I'll

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
ahead and just account for this so I'll

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.869 
ahead and just account for this so I'll
never<00:00:56.319> lose<00:00:56.530> track<00:00:56.829> of<00:00:57.159> it<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.729> that<00:01:00.729> would<00:01:00.819> be

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
never lose track of it and that would be

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.340 
never lose track of it and that would be
part<00:01:01.179> of<00:01:01.269> the<00:01:01.389> layout<00:01:01.719> of<00:01:01.749> my<00:01:01.899> whole<00:01:02.199> entire

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
part of the layout of my whole entire

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.209 
part of the layout of my whole entire
portrait<00:01:03.100> I<00:01:04.649> always<00:01:05.649> want<00:01:05.829> to<00:01:05.890> try<00:01:06.009> and<00:01:06.159> get

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:06.219 
portrait I always want to try and get

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:07.950 
portrait I always want to try and get
the<00:01:06.340> proportions<00:01:06.640> down<00:01:07.090> know<00:01:07.659> where<00:01:07.810> the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
the proportions down know where the

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.270 
the proportions down know where the
outside<00:01:08.590> perimeter<00:01:08.829> of<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.250> head<00:01:09.430> is<00:01:09.670> any<00:01:11.280> any

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
outside perimeter of the head is any any

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.300 
outside perimeter of the head is any any
detail<00:01:13.149> mm-hmm<00:01:14.049> that<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:15.009> going<00:01:15.159> to<00:01:15.219> be

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
detail mm-hmm that is going to be

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.200 
detail mm-hmm that is going to be
important<00:01:15.790> like<00:01:15.939> where<00:01:16.149> the<00:01:16.270> hair<00:01:16.570> falls<00:01:17.530> down

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
important like where the hair falls down

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.779 
important like where the hair falls down
maybe<00:01:19.210> get<00:01:19.780> my<00:01:19.930> my<00:01:20.590> hair<00:01:20.979> direction<00:01:21.549> you<00:01:21.670> may

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
maybe get my my hair direction you may

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.639 
maybe get my my hair direction you may
not<00:01:21.939> be<00:01:22.060> able<00:01:22.119> to<00:01:22.299> see<00:01:22.479> this<00:01:22.719> well<00:01:23.049> but<00:01:23.439> I'm

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
not be able to see this well but I'm

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.109 
not be able to see this well but I'm
going<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:24.640> have<00:01:25.329> it<00:01:25.619> coming<00:01:26.619> back<00:01:27.130> into<00:01:27.610> the

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
going to have it coming back into the

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.670 
going to have it coming back into the
scalp<00:01:28.990> like<00:01:29.740> a<00:01:29.770> normal<00:01:30.479> scalp<00:01:31.479> line<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:32.079> not

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
scalp like a normal scalp line and not

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.700 
scalp like a normal scalp line and not
just<00:01:32.979> be<00:01:33.219> a<00:01:33.430> line<00:01:33.909> here<00:01:34.509> like<00:01:34.659> she<00:01:35.289> has<00:01:35.439> a<00:01:35.469> wig

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
just be a line here like she has a wig

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.480 
just be a line here like she has a wig
on<00:01:35.890> or<00:01:35.979> something<00:01:39.899> okay<00:01:40.899> so<00:01:40.960> now<00:01:41.439> let's<00:01:42.070> come

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
on or something okay so now let's come

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.340 
on or something okay so now let's come
up<00:01:42.520> here<00:01:44.909> now<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:46.060> get<00:01:46.270> my<00:01:46.420> stroke<00:01:46.810> I<00:01:46.990> think<00:01:47.259> I

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
up here now to get my stroke I think I

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.779 
up here now to get my stroke I think I
had<00:01:47.530> enough<00:01:47.649> on<00:01:48.039> here<00:01:48.280> that<00:01:48.429> I<00:01:48.490> could<00:01:48.549> at<00:01:48.759> least

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
had enough on here that I could at least

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.419 
had enough on here that I could at least
start<00:01:49.149> getting<00:01:49.420> some<00:01:49.659> value<00:01:50.439> and<00:01:51.100> like<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.369> said

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
start getting some value and like I said

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:52.740 
start getting some value and like I said
is<00:01:51.700> this<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:51.939> going<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.119> be<00:01:52.240> totally<00:01:52.600> accurate

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
is this it going to be totally accurate

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.719 
is this it going to be totally accurate
but<00:01:53.229> at<00:01:53.320> least<00:01:53.409> it'll<00:01:53.649> get<00:01:53.859> us<00:01:53.979> something<00:01:54.490> that

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
but at least it'll get us something that

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.179 
but at least it'll get us something that
we<00:01:55.299> can<00:01:55.450> start<00:01:55.929> feeling<00:01:56.200> comfortable<00:01:56.350> about

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
we can start feeling comfortable about

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.940 
we can start feeling comfortable about
using<00:01:57.700> our<00:01:58.289> tapered<00:01:59.289> stroke<00:01:59.530> for<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.770> hair

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
using our tapered stroke for the hair

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:13.440 
using our tapered stroke for the hair
and<00:02:00.299> committing<00:02:01.299> a<00:02:01.359> little<00:02:01.570> bit<00:02:01.689> more

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.600 

still<00:02:14.450> my<00:02:14.599> just<00:02:14.870> my<00:02:14.989> sketchy<00:02:15.349> stroke<00:02:15.800> although

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
still my just my sketchy stroke although

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.260 
still my just my sketchy stroke although
I<00:02:16.640> am<00:02:16.970> again<00:02:17.599> using<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:18.440> type<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.250> taper<00:02:19.819> because

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
I am again using a type of taper because

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.350 
I am again using a type of taper because
I<00:02:20.390> want<00:02:20.599> to<00:02:20.630> land<00:02:20.989> on<00:02:21.349> it<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.709> not<00:02:22.190> go<00:02:22.459> kerplunk

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
I want to land on it and not go kerplunk

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.640 
I want to land on it and not go kerplunk
and<00:02:23.650> create<00:02:24.650> that<00:02:24.890> skidmark<00:02:25.360> or<00:02:26.360> even<00:02:26.930> even<00:02:27.350> a

and create that skidmark or even even a

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.160 
and create that skidmark or even even a
scouring<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.790> paper<00:02:29.000> because<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.660> hit<00:02:29.989> the

scouring of the paper because I hit the
paper<00:02:30.709> too<00:02:31.130> heavy<00:02:35.200> account<00:02:36.200> for<00:02:36.500> some<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.220> this

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
paper too heavy account for some of this

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.910 
paper too heavy account for some of this
in<00:02:37.640> here<00:02:37.940> that's<00:02:38.180> changing<00:02:38.569> directions<00:02:38.920> past

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
in here that's changing directions past

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.340 
in here that's changing directions past
the<00:02:40.370> front<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.880> hair<00:02:41.150> I'm<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.050> going<00:02:42.500> to

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.140 

try<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.470> get<00:02:48.560> some<00:02:48.769> value<00:02:49.130> in<00:02:49.310> there<00:02:49.549> I'm

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
try and get some value in there I'm

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.720 
try and get some value in there I'm
still<00:02:50.299> drawing<00:02:50.660> very<00:02:51.019> lightly<00:02:51.319> because<00:02:51.730> it's

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
still drawing very lightly because it's

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.309 
still drawing very lightly because it's
gonna<00:02:52.850> be<00:02:53.030> really<00:02:53.239> important<00:02:53.810> for<00:02:53.870> me<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.230> be

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
gonna be really important for me to be

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.740 
gonna be really important for me to be
able<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.680> remove<00:02:54.980> something<00:02:58.480> over<00:02:59.480> here<00:02:59.900> and

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
able to remove something over here and

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.180 
able to remove something over here and
now<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:02.810> guess<00:03:03.049> there's<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.319> space<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:03.650> here

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
now I guess there's a space in here

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.250 
now I guess there's a space in here
sometimes<00:03:04.970> I'll<00:03:05.180> make<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.569> decision<00:03:06.049> as<00:03:06.230> to

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
sometimes I'll make the decision as to

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.349 
sometimes I'll make the decision as to
whether<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.620> want<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.100> space<00:03:07.340> or<00:03:07.580> not<00:03:07.640> I<00:03:08.650> I

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
whether I want that space or not I I

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.300 
whether I want that space or not I I
sometimes<00:03:11.359> will<00:03:11.989> close<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.290> gap<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.920> don't<00:03:13.130> need

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
sometimes will close a gap I don't need

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.410 
sometimes will close a gap I don't need
to<00:03:13.489> show<00:03:13.670> every<00:03:14.390> single<00:03:15.670> fissure<00:03:16.670> or<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.299> know

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
to show every single fissure or you know

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.390 
to show every single fissure or you know
space<00:03:17.780> in<00:03:18.019> between<00:03:18.140> maybe<00:03:18.980> I'll<00:03:19.220> eliminate

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
space in between maybe I'll eliminate

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.099 
space in between maybe I'll eliminate
that<00:03:19.790> one<00:03:19.910> I<00:03:19.970> can<00:03:20.150> always<00:03:20.209> add<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.510> later<00:03:20.720> and

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
that one I can always add it later and

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.800 
that one I can always add it later and
I'll<00:03:21.739> just<00:03:22.040> go<00:03:22.340> with<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.269> thing<00:03:23.480> that's<00:03:23.660> not

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
I'll just go with the thing that's not

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.210 
I'll just go with the thing that's not
going<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.019> interrupt<00:03:24.230> my<00:03:24.470> stroke<00:03:24.799> any<00:03:25.010> more

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
going to interrupt my stroke any more

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.860 
going to interrupt my stroke any more
than<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.430> have<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.750> then<00:03:27.620> come<00:03:27.920> back<00:03:27.950> in<00:03:28.400> and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
than I have to and then come back in and

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.400 
than I have to and then come back in and
decide<00:03:31.180> how<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:32.209> need<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.630> modify<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:33.109> but<00:03:33.350> I

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
decide how I need to modify it but I

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.920 
decide how I need to modify it but I
don't<00:03:33.620> want<00:03:33.799> to<00:03:33.890> become<00:03:34.130> confusing

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
don't want to become confusing

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.630 
don't want to become confusing
simplicity<00:03:35.980> detail<00:03:36.980> is<00:03:37.160> great<00:03:37.310> the

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
simplicity detail is great the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.080 
simplicity detail is great the
simplicity<00:03:38.480> how<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.440> reads<00:03:39.739> is<00:03:40.459> going<00:03:40.820> to<00:03:40.940> make

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
simplicity how it reads is going to make

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.400 
simplicity how it reads is going to make
a<00:03:41.120> big<00:03:41.390> difference<00:03:41.750> on<00:03:41.840> how<00:03:41.989> much<00:03:42.170> information

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
a big difference on how much information

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:49.449 
a big difference on how much information
there<00:03:42.769> is<00:03:42.920> in<00:03:43.070> there<00:03:43.280> that's<00:03:43.820> maybe<00:03:44.060> confusing

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.559 

Carroll's<00:03:50.459> asking<00:03:50.879> if<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.120> would<00:03:51.330> have<00:03:51.390> gone

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
Carroll's asking if I would have gone

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.360 
Carroll's asking if I would have gone
ahead<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.560> created<00:03:53.340> my<00:03:54.530> these<00:03:55.530> strands

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
ahead and and created my these strands

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.910 
ahead and and created my these strands
over<00:03:57.360> that<00:03:57.569> darker<00:03:57.959> value<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.439> forehead

over that darker value of the forehead

over that darker value of the forehead
with<00:03:59.370> my<00:03:59.579> eraser<00:03:59.819> I<00:04:00.209> would<00:04:01.019> if<00:04:01.170> I<00:04:01.290> could<00:04:01.519> this

with my eraser I would if I could this
is<00:04:02.579> going<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.209> make<00:04:03.360> a<00:04:03.420> difference<00:04:03.959> that<00:04:04.110> the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
is going to make a difference that the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
thing that's going to make a difference

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.220

whether you have pressed too hard and

you<00:04:12.870> want<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.110> be<00:04:13.200> able<00:04:13.319> to<00:04:13.470> remove<00:04:13.829> it<00:04:14.010> that's

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
you want to be able to remove it that's

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.449 
you want to be able to remove it that's
why<00:04:14.610> I'm<00:04:14.760> stressing<00:04:15.269> so<00:04:15.690> often<00:04:16.169> on<00:04:16.350> in<00:04:16.979> so<00:04:17.340> many

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
why I'm stressing so often on in so many

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.029 
why I'm stressing so often on in so many
ways<00:04:17.729> I<00:04:18.239> want<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:18.930> be<00:04:19.019> able<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.380> remove<00:04:19.739> the

ways I want to be able to remove the
graphite<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:20.820> so<00:04:21.479> if<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:21.780> come<00:04:22.019> in<00:04:22.169> here<00:04:22.410> into<00:04:22.620> a

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
graphite and so if I come in here into a

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.640 
graphite and so if I come in here into a
value<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.850> I<00:04:24.030> want<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.360> be<00:04:24.479> able<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.750> show<00:04:25.350> a

line I want to be able to remove it well
you<00:04:29.160> can<00:04:29.310> see<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.580> just<00:04:29.699> made<00:04:30.120> a<00:04:30.150> hair<00:04:30.600> there<00:04:32.750> and

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
you can see I just made a hair there and

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.900 
you can see I just made a hair there and
I'm<00:04:34.350> glad<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.860> can<00:04:35.070> do<00:04:35.370> that

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
I'm glad I can do that

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.730 
I'm glad I can do that
although<00:04:36.510> maybe<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:37.020> wasn't<00:04:37.289> necessarily

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
although maybe it wasn't necessarily

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.129 
although maybe it wasn't necessarily
right<00:04:38.039> there<00:04:38.400> but<00:04:38.940> that<00:04:39.120> just<00:04:39.330> shows<00:04:39.449> you<00:04:39.630> can

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
right there but that just shows you can

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.310 
right there but that just shows you can
take<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.590> out<00:04:40.800> if<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:41.910> make<00:04:42.150> sure<00:04:42.180> that<00:04:42.780> you

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
take it out if you make sure that you

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.920 
take it out if you make sure that you
practice<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:44.190> practice<00:04:44.370> not<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:44.910> go<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:45.419> not

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
and remove it the more graphite that's

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.850 
and remove it the more graphite that's
on<00:04:56.639> there<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.900> more<00:04:58.229> it's<00:04:58.530> going<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.740> have

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099

up<00:05:02.400> my<00:05:02.639> edge<00:05:02.940> my<00:05:03.419> blade<00:05:03.750> on<00:05:04.020> my<00:05:04.229> on<00:05:04.440> my<00:05:05.300> kneaded

up my edge my blade on my on my kneaded

up my edge my blade on my on my kneaded
eraser<00:05:06.690> here<00:05:07.020> is<00:05:07.169> often<00:05:07.979> as<00:05:08.099> I<00:05:08.220> can<00:05:08.280> because<00:05:09.090> it

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
eraser here is often as I can because it

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.450 
eraser here is often as I can because it
also<00:05:09.449> helps<00:05:09.870> me<00:05:10.229> maybe<00:05:10.650> I'll<00:05:10.830> just<00:05:11.039> bend<00:05:11.310> it

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
also helps me maybe I'll just bend it

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.240 
also helps me maybe I'll just bend it
over<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:12.180> I'll<00:05:12.750> create<00:05:13.139> a<00:05:13.229> whole<00:05:13.650> new<00:05:13.680> blade

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
over and I'll create a whole new blade

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.820 
over and I'll create a whole new blade
because<00:05:15.060> that<00:05:15.270> takes<00:05:15.630> that<00:05:15.900> extra<00:05:16.260> graphite

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
because that takes that extra graphite

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.529 
because that takes that extra graphite
that's<00:05:17.070> collected<00:05:17.490> on<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.729> eraser<00:05:18.150> as<00:05:18.300> well

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
that's collected on the eraser as well

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.839 
that's collected on the eraser as well
and<00:05:19.169> keeps<00:05:19.500> from<00:05:19.830> just<00:05:20.160> smearing<00:05:20.699> it<00:05:20.729> around

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
and keeps from just smearing it around

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.779 
and keeps from just smearing it around
and<00:05:21.440> sometimes<00:05:22.440> that<00:05:22.680> will<00:05:22.860> even<00:05:23.220> bury<00:05:23.580> it

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
and sometimes that will even bury it

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.210 
and sometimes that will even bury it
into<00:05:23.970> the<00:05:24.090> pigment<00:05:24.570> of<00:05:24.690> your<00:05:25.490> of<00:05:26.490> your<00:05:27.240> paper

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
into the pigment of your of your paper

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.339 
into the pigment of your of your paper
into<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.490> texture<00:05:29.849> the<00:05:30.660> pigment<00:05:31.110> will<00:05:31.199> go

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
into the texture the pigment will go

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.580 
into the texture the pigment will go
down<00:05:31.560> into<00:05:32.159> the<00:05:32.460> texture<00:05:32.789> of<00:05:33.090> your<00:05:33.780> paper<00:05:34.229> and

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
down into the texture of your paper and

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.830 
down into the texture of your paper and
you<00:05:35.220> can't<00:05:35.460> get<00:05:35.610> it<00:05:35.699> out<00:05:35.789> almost<00:05:36.300> like<00:05:36.510> if<00:05:36.690> you

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
you can't get it out almost like if you

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.570 
you can't get it out almost like if you
had<00:05:36.930> just<00:05:37.139> drawn<00:05:37.380> it<00:05:37.530> in<00:05:37.650> there<00:05:37.860> but<00:05:38.430> you<00:05:38.550> can

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
had just drawn it in there but you can

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.279 
had just drawn it in there but you can
see<00:05:38.880> what<00:05:39.030> I<00:05:39.060> just<00:05:39.300> did<00:05:39.449> here<00:05:39.690> now<00:05:39.840> I<00:05:39.870> want<00:05:40.229> to

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
see what I just did here now I want to

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.500 
see what I just did here now I want to
modify<00:05:40.620> it<00:05:40.770> so<00:05:41.039> that<00:05:41.070> it<00:05:41.220> isn't<00:05:41.490> so<00:05:41.610> bright<00:05:41.789> at

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
modify it so that it isn't so bright at

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.469 
modify it so that it isn't so bright at
the<00:05:42.720> top<00:05:42.990> but<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:43.740> have<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.280> opportunity<00:05:44.940> to

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
the top but I have the opportunity to

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.689 
the top but I have the opportunity to
come<00:05:45.720> in<00:05:45.930> even<00:05:46.229> in<00:05:46.590> these<00:05:46.710> places<00:05:47.070> let's<00:05:47.490> just

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
come in even in these places let's just

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
say if I wanted to maybe show a strand

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.740 
say if I wanted to maybe show a strand
