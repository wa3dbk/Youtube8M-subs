in<00:01:31.410> this<00:01:31.590> guy<00:01:31.850> same<00:01:32.850> thing<00:01:33.090> same<00:01:33.200> battery

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
in this guy same thing same battery

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.820 
in this guy same thing same battery
solution<00:01:34.590> we're<00:01:34.770> calling<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.220> Moga<00:01:35.880> boost

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
solution we're calling it the Moga boost

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.670 
solution we're calling it the Moga boost
this<00:01:37.830> also<00:01:38.100> will<00:01:38.460> come<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:39.050> with<00:01:40.050> two<00:01:40.260> Rumble

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
this also will come with with two Rumble

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.770 
this also will come with with two Rumble
motors<00:01:40.800> so<00:01:41.640> you'll<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.090> able<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
motors so you'll be able to get that a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.980

more immersive gameplay and it's Rumble

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.240 
more immersive gameplay and it's Rumble
motors<00:01:46.110> by<00:01:46.380> immersion<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.160> the<00:01:47.220> same

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
motors by immersion so it's the same

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.950 
motors by immersion so it's the same
ones<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.790> show<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.510> in<00:01:48.930> your
