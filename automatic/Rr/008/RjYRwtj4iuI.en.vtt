give you a couple of tips to make your
experience<00:00:08.130> in<00:00:08.970> Snapseed<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.750> great<00:00:10.200> one<00:00:10.380> let's

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
experience in Snapseed a great one let's

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.160 
experience in Snapseed a great one let's
talk<00:00:10.920> about<00:00:11.040> rotate<00:00:11.969> versus<00:00:12.480> transform<00:00:12.929> two

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
talk about rotate versus transform two

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.079 
talk about rotate versus transform two
filters<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.799> both<00:00:14.190> can<00:00:14.490> rotate<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.910> picture

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
filters that both can rotate the picture

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.630 
filters that both can rotate the picture
but<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> big<00:00:15.719> difference<00:00:16.020> between<00:00:16.320> them<00:00:16.640> when

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
but a big difference between them when

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.689 
but a big difference between them when
you<00:00:17.850> rotate<00:00:18.630> with<00:00:18.900> rotate<00:00:19.400> you<00:00:20.400> can<00:00:20.430> rotate

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
you rotate with rotate you can rotate

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.849 
you rotate with rotate you can rotate
the<00:00:20.880> picture<00:00:21.029> up<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.420> 45<00:00:21.810> degrees<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.350> as<00:00:22.710> you

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
the picture up to 45 degrees and as you

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.950 
the picture up to 45 degrees and as you
see<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.100> will<00:00:23.340> lose<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> lot<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.060> picture

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
see you will lose a lot of picture

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.019 
see you will lose a lot of picture
surface<00:00:25.439> when<00:00:25.680> rotating<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.220> way<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
surface when rotating that way the

upside of the rotating field
rotate<00:00:28.349> filter<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.890> can<00:00:29.010> do<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.369> 45

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
rotate filter is it can do up to 45

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.359 
rotate filter is it can do up to 45
degrees<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.779> transform<00:00:31.320> filter<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.980> do<00:00:32.130> less

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
degrees the transform filter can do less

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.180 
degrees the transform filter can do less
however<00:00:33.300> when<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.350> rotate<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
however when I do rotate in the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.310 
however when I do rotate in the
transform<00:00:35.670> filter<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.600> will<00:00:36.780> see<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
transform filter you will see that the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.080 
transform filter you will see that the
software<00:00:37.649> magically<00:00:38.219> fills<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> corners

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
software magically fills in the corners

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.450 
software magically fills in the corners
so<00:00:39.290> you're<00:00:40.290> not<00:00:40.559> making<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> picture<00:00:41.280> any

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
so you're not making the picture any

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.729 
so you're not making the picture any
smaller<00:00:41.850> when<00:00:42.180> you're<00:00:42.300> rotating<00:00:42.739> sometimes

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
smaller when you're rotating sometimes

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.260 
smaller when you're rotating sometimes
creating<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.340> special<00:00:44.820> look<00:00:44.940> inside<00:00:45.149> of

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
creating that special look inside of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.000 
creating that special look inside of
Snapseed<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.809> great<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.739> want<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> be

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
Snapseed is great and you want to be

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.619 
Snapseed is great and you want to be
able<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.160> apply<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.730> another<00:00:47.969> image<00:00:48.270> let

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
able to apply that to another image let

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.270 
able to apply that to another image let
me<00:00:48.690> show<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.840> how<00:00:49.050> here<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> image

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.469 
large turn brushes so when I brush now
while<00:01:38.220> zoomed<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.880> will<00:01:39.030> see<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.329> have

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
while zoomed in you will see that I have

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.200 
while zoomed in you will see that I have
a<00:01:39.509> lot<00:01:39.780> finer<00:01:40.290> brush<00:01:40.680> reversely<00:01:41.670> when<00:01:41.909> i<00:01:41.939> zoom

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
a lot finer brush reversely when i zoom

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.889 
a lot finer brush reversely when i zoom
out<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.780> will<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:44.460> brush<00:01:44.640> gets

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
out you will see that the brush gets

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.929 
out you will see that the brush gets
disproportionately<00:01:45.899> larger<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.759> now

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
disproportionately larger so I can now

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.179 
disproportionately larger so I can now
make<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.840> huge<00:01:49.200> brushstroke<00:01:49.680> over<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> sky

and you will see that I've darkened the
sky<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.079> brushstroke<00:01:52.320> there<00:01:52.920> are<00:01:53.009> times
