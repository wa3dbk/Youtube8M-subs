00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 we do not have a fault in that line 505 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.799
 that comes because it turns on only to 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.870
 Sometimes the entrance to the battery vibrates 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.389
 The company logo appears on this 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.580
 case he declared it and it comes back and it goes off and 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.970
 so constantly it's sometimes turned off 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.289
 no longer receives order on the power button 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.570
 when we have the failure of these by 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.160
 example that the phone that totally 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.740
 blocked alone 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.680
 the screen illuminates when they enter 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.720
 calls or when we take out the battery the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.880
 vibrates and turns on and off and on or off 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.800
 when we connect the charger and also 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.780
 appear the logo and turn off as much 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.210
 Chances are that the power button on the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.000
 of power is failing what we are going to 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.670
 do is we're going to in this case we're going 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.500
 to check how it is if it is doing wrong 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.059
 contact if you are a soldier and you are 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.629
 making contact with a part of 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.090
 earth and if everything is fine then 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.090
 it will definitely play 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 replace it 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.960
 here we are looking at the button 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.839
 power looks good is not soldier not 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.850
 you see sulfate here is not wet 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.100
 light to the capacitor and to these circuits 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.690
 what is here then what we are going to 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.700
 do is the following here I already have a 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.750
 power button or a button to 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.580
 replace it and we see it because the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.320
 customer will be delivered was made 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.649
 clean is delivered and returned and you 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.119
 bothered 3 and if they have had that flaw what 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.520
 most likely it is the button 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.060
 turned on the power button only 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.070
 replace it and ready 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.070
 then we apply light here 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.810
 to the button 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.020
 l 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.580
 this is that we have applied 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.240
 to the heat from the bottom 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.860
 and we're going to have the other shot is close 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.310
 so that one single 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.310
 to warm 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.530
 and we are doing that because 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.220
 we have done cleaning and in the fault 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.220
 following 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.599
 the day 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.810
 here we see that nothing is left welded 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.239
 the end 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.709
 analyze further back that they are not short 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.840
 neither of these two of the sides 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.500
 neither side can touch the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.500
 negative part 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.849
 well the only one who can knock on the door 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.590
 negative is this can not continue the 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.620
 part of the search that would be oppressing 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.049
 the button would only be short already 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.250
 we fall after the button change the 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.250
 phone on 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.290
 and now if it happens if the logo and 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.990
 I would pay again or there would be a 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.820
 suspended then it is already on the button 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.570
 of ignition if the charger counts 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.000
 turn on the logo and go back and off it 's the 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.190
 power button if the phone is 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.320
 working and you do not want to unblock 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.660
 calls come in but can not do anything 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.220
 is the service power button the 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.870
 arauca lycee professional technician in 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.870
