and<00:02:16.770> this<00:02:17.770> drain<00:02:18.040> was<00:02:18.250> still<00:02:18.520> not<00:02:18.700> ready<00:02:18.880> to

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
and this drain was still not ready to

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.180 
and this drain was still not ready to
come<00:02:19.210> out<00:02:19.330> but<00:02:19.930> they<00:02:20.080> did<00:02:20.260> take<00:02:20.500> my<00:02:20.740> stitches

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
come out but they did take my stitches

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.440 
come out but they did take my stitches
out<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.370> my<00:02:21.900> armpit<00:02:23.130> incisions<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.400> those<00:02:25.270> are

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
out of my armpit incisions so those are

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.420 
out of my armpit incisions so those are
out<00:02:25.600> so<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.320> only<00:02:26.470> thing<00:02:26.680> I'm<00:02:26.800> really<00:02:26.830> waiting

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
out so the only thing I'm really waiting

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.640 
out so the only thing I'm really waiting
on<00:02:27.550> now<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:28.000> for<00:02:28.630> this<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.930> slow<00:02:29.170> down<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.590> get

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
on now is for this to slow down and get

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.610 
on now is for this to slow down and get
slowed<00:02:29.950> down<00:02:29.980> today<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:31.510> don't<00:02:32.170> know<00:02:32.260> why<00:02:32.440> I'm

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
slowed down today I don't know why I'm

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.910 
slowed down today I don't know why I'm
blody<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.610> but<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.959> might<00:02:35.200> recall<00:02:35.650> if<00:02:35.830> you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
blody and but you might recall if you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.740 
blody and but you might recall if you
watch<00:02:36.070> my<00:02:36.280> other<00:02:36.310> videos<00:02:36.820> I'm<00:02:37.150> not<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.360> sweater

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
watch my other videos I'm not a sweater

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.920 
watch my other videos I'm not a sweater
I<00:02:38.260> don't<00:02:38.709> sweat<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.940> retain<00:02:40.330> water<00:02:40.360> like

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
I don't sweat and I retain water like

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.770 
I don't sweat and I retain water like
crazy<00:02:41.610> especially<00:02:42.610> around<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.270> time<00:02:43.570> of<00:02:43.720> the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
crazy especially around that time of the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.630 
crazy especially around that time of the
month<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.560> think<00:02:44.830> that's<00:02:45.220> why<00:02:45.580> I'm

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
month so I think that's why I'm

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.120 
month so I think that's why I'm
retaining<00:02:46.000> fluid<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.530> fact<00:02:47.770> that<00:02:47.980> I'm<00:02:48.100> in

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
retaining fluid and the fact that I'm in

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.449 
retaining fluid and the fact that I'm in
the<00:02:48.340> healing<00:02:48.700> process<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:49.860> just<00:02:50.860> causes<00:02:51.100> me

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
the healing process that just causes me

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.180 
the healing process that just causes me
to<00:02:51.550> retain<00:02:51.880> water<00:02:52.209> even<00:02:52.600> more<00:02:52.739> but<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:53.860> wasn't

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
to retain water even more but it wasn't

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.070 
to retain water even more but it wasn't
just<00:02:54.340> in<00:02:54.459> my<00:02:54.489> arms<00:02:55.000> it<00:02:55.180> was<00:02:55.270> in<00:02:55.420> my<00:02:55.540> legs<00:02:55.780> and

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
just in my arms it was in my legs and

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.600 
just in my arms it was in my legs and
everywhere<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:56.770> he<00:02:56.920> told<00:02:57.070> me<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.220> could<00:02:57.430> take<00:02:57.550> a

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
everywhere so he told me I could take a

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.910 
everywhere so he told me I could take a
the<00:02:58.090> usual<00:02:58.450> water<00:02:58.660> pill<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.260> take<00:02:59.500> about

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
the usual water pill that I take about

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.759 
the usual water pill that I take about
once<00:03:00.310> or<00:03:00.459> twice<00:03:00.520> a<00:03:00.760> month<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.780> we'll<00:03:02.500> see<00:03:02.650> what

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
once or twice a month and we'll see what

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.650 
once or twice a month and we'll see what
happens<00:03:03.130> so<00:03:03.250> I'm<00:03:03.580> hopeful<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.150> get<00:03:04.300> this<00:03:04.450> out

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
happens so I'm hopeful to get this out

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.420 
happens so I'm hopeful to get this out
sometime<00:03:05.140> this<00:03:05.170> week<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.800> she<00:03:05.980> said<00:03:06.250> that

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
sometime this week that she said that

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
every once in a while they have somebody

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.479 
every once in a while they have somebody
that<00:03:07.930> wears<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.440> drains<00:03:08.709> for<00:03:09.010> up<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.250> four

that wears the drains for up to four

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.720 
that wears the drains for up to four
weeks<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:11.860> did<00:03:12.790> point<00:03:13.120> out<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.890> getting<00:03:15.640> a

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.480 
right after surgery and I was still kind
of<00:04:10.170> out<00:04:10.290> of<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:10.590> or<00:04:10.710> maybe<00:04:10.920> it<00:04:11.070> was<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.310> next

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
of out of it or maybe it was the next

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.240 
of out of it or maybe it was the next
day<00:04:11.640> at<00:04:11.850> my<00:04:12.000> 24<00:04:12.570> hour<00:04:12.690> post-op<00:04:13.680> appointment

day at my 24 hour post-op appointment

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.600 
day at my 24 hour post-op appointment
but<00:04:15.120> he<00:04:15.180> said<00:04:15.620> he<00:04:16.620> took<00:04:16.800> out<00:04:16.980> about<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.370> same

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
but he said he took out about the same

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.030 
but he said he took out about the same
one<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.690> half<00:04:18.810> pounds<00:04:19.080> on<00:04:19.380> each<00:04:19.530> arm

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
one and a half pounds on each arm

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.570 
one and a half pounds on each arm
but<00:04:20.550> one<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:20.910> them<00:04:21.209> was<00:04:21.480> more<00:04:22.070> skin<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.370> one

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
but one of them was more skin and one

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.280 
but one of them was more skin and one
had<00:04:23.790> more<00:04:24.000> tissue<00:04:24.300> in<00:04:24.600> it<00:04:24.750> or<00:04:24.900> something<00:04:25.140> like

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
had more tissue in it or something like

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.110 
had more tissue in it or something like
that<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:25.860> remove<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:26.250> don't<00:04:26.430> remember<00:04:26.700> exactly

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
that to remove I don't remember exactly

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.000 
that to remove I don't remember exactly
what<00:04:27.330> he<00:04:27.390> said<00:04:27.630> but<00:04:27.810> that's<00:04:28.470> why<00:04:28.620> he<00:04:28.800> had<00:04:28.980> to

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
what he said but that's why he had to

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.740 
what he said but that's why he had to
make<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.400> incision<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:29.970> little<00:04:30.210> bit<00:04:30.330> different

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
make the incision a little bit different

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.970 
make the incision a little bit different
in<00:04:30.930> one<00:04:31.650> arm<00:04:31.830> than<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.160> other<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:33.980> guess

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
in one arm than the other so I guess

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.430 
in one arm than the other so I guess
we'll<00:04:35.220> see<00:04:35.400> when<00:04:35.550> they<00:04:35.670> heal<00:04:36.020> how<00:04:37.020> they<00:04:37.200> look

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
we'll see when they heal how they look

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.980 
we'll see when they heal how they look
I'm<00:04:38.340> excited<00:04:38.880> for<00:04:38.910> this<00:04:39.180> to<00:04:39.330> get<00:04:39.450> out<00:04:39.600> so<00:04:39.870> that

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
I'm excited for this to get out so that

I'm excited for this to get out so that
I<00:04:40.020> can<00:04:40.880> put<00:04:41.880> on<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.120> same<00:04:42.360> shirt<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.320> I<00:04:43.350> had

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590

to compare to the before pictures but

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.140 
to compare to the before pictures but
there's<00:04:49.080> a<00:04:49.170> huge<00:04:49.500> difference<00:04:49.530> in<00:04:50.160> what<00:04:50.340> hangs

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
there's a huge difference in what hangs

week before I figured that out I

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.730 
week before I figured that out I
remember<00:05:12.360> when<00:05:12.750> she<00:05:12.780> wrapped<00:05:13.350> it<00:05:13.470> at<00:05:13.620> the

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
remember when she wrapped it at the
