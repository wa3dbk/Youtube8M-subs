in<00:01:12.770> a<00:01:12.860> way<00:01:13.040> so<00:01:13.700> let's<00:01:13.880> go<00:01:13.970> ahead<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.390> load<00:01:14.570> it

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
in a way so let's go ahead and load it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.740 
in a way so let's go ahead and load it
up<00:01:14.870> here<00:01:16.420> I'm<00:01:17.420> already<00:01:17.720> on<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:17.990> level<00:01:18.440> 3<00:01:19.750> so

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
up here I'm already on the level 3 so

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.260 
up here I'm already on the level 3 so
we'll<00:01:20.900> start<00:01:21.170> that

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.630 

now<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.840> trick<00:01:29.110> is<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.380> get<00:01:29.710> however<00:01:30.220> many

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
now the trick is to get however many

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.080 
now the trick is to get however many
points<00:01:30.909> before<00:01:31.270> they<00:01:31.570> say<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:32.020> time<00:01:32.260> is<00:01:32.650> up<00:01:33.490> so

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
points before they say the time is up so

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.170 
points before they say the time is up so
just<00:01:34.869> get<00:01:35.110> that<00:01:38.190> you<00:01:39.190> have<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.490> line<00:01:39.820> them<00:01:40.030> up

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
just get that you have to line them up

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.380 
just get that you have to line them up
and<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:42.070> be<00:01:42.190> honest<00:01:42.460> I'm<00:01:42.640> quite<00:01:42.880> terrible<00:01:43.180> at
