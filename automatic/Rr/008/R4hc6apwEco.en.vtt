 eterno interno.it and to keep going 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.340
 ahead we have some difficulties because 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.609
 I don't hear much about the ascent lines 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.099
 discounted the part passed 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.189
 left to allow for margins of law 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.189
 co 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.730

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.810
 we go forward we arrive below the area 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.240
 of the hill where there are canals st 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.760
 leads we have some decisions of 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.760
 managing the oriental for a stupid crap 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.700
 eni like this point we try first 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.340
 show this way 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.000

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.000
 a man inside 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.960

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.500
 hallucinatory exposure 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.060

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.350
