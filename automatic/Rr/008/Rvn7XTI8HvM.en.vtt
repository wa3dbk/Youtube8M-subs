fixed the whole bunch of stuff and added
a<00:02:20.400> couple<00:02:20.580> features<00:02:20.910> not<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.420> many<00:02:21.570> but<00:02:21.690> you

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
a couple features not that many but you

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.080 
a couple features not that many but you
know<00:02:22.110> it's<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.500> guess<00:02:22.740> it's<00:02:22.920> worth<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.310> for<00:02:24.060> a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
know it's I guess it's worth it for a

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.700 
know it's I guess it's worth it for a
minor<00:02:24.300> update<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.050> think<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.410> going<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.560> be

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710
