one<00:01:59.950> tends<00:02:00.219> to<00:02:00.250> crease<00:02:00.520> a<00:02:00.549> little<00:02:00.640> bit<00:02:00.909> more

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
one tends to crease a little bit more

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.690

this<00:02:01.840> one<00:02:02.170> doesn't<00:02:02.739> really<00:02:02.770> crease<00:02:03.099> at<00:02:03.250> all<00:02:03.399> so

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
this one doesn't really crease at all so

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.249 
this one doesn't really crease at all so
if<00:02:03.819> you're<00:02:03.969> really<00:02:04.209> big<00:02:04.869> on<00:02:05.049> that
