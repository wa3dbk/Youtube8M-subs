00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
about 18 inches to make the line first

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.200 
about 18 inches to make the line first
of<00:00:15.240> all<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.540> put<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.929> about<00:00:16.550> four<00:00:17.550> or<00:00:17.699> five<00:00:17.939> inch

hole in the center roll through make

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.930 
hole in the center roll through make
sure<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.450> don't<00:00:57.660> roll<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.870> too<00:00:58.140> far<00:00:58.380> and<00:00:58.940> that

sure we don't roll it too far and that

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.160 
sure we don't roll it too far and that
will<00:01:00.210> make<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.540> lion's<00:01:00.989> face<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:02.190> main<00:01:04.100> then

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
will make the lion's face and main then

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.010 
will make the lion's face and main then
we'll<00:01:07.170> take<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.679> quarter<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:09.869> balloon

we'll take one quarter of the balloon
that<00:01:10.319> we<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.009> that<00:01:11.159> much<00:01:11.369> half

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:11.819 
that we see so we have that much half

that we see so we have that much half
quarter<00:01:12.679> that's<00:01:13.679> going<00:01:14.009> to<00:01:14.069> be<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.249> front<00:01:14.490> leg

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
quarter that's going to be the front leg

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.959 
quarter that's going to be the front leg
we<00:01:14.969> do<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.509> make<00:01:15.780> an<00:01:15.960> itch<00:01:16.579> do<00:01:17.579> we<00:01:17.700> make

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
we do not make an itch do we make

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.830 
we do not make an itch do we make
another<00:01:18.240> bubble<00:01:18.539> the<00:01:18.749> same<00:01:18.990> size<00:01:20.569> there's<00:01:21.569> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
another bubble the same size there's the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.300 
another bubble the same size there's the
front<00:01:22.049> legs<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.530> our<00:01:22.770> line<00:01:24.439> within<00:01:25.439> make<00:01:26.130> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
front legs of our line within make a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.399 
front legs of our line within make a
small<00:01:26.999> bubble<00:01:27.210> about<00:01:28.109> an<00:01:28.409> inch<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:29.630> half<00:01:30.630> of

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
small bubble about an inch a half of

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.389 
small bubble about an inch a half of
what<00:01:31.619> we<00:01:31.770> see<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.319> doubt<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.770> back<00:01:38.039> legs

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
what we see so if in doubt the back legs

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.449 
what we see so if in doubt the back legs
should<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:39.090> slightly<00:01:39.509> shorter<00:01:40.319> than<00:01:40.459> the

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459 
should be slightly shorter than the

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.539 
should be slightly shorter than the
front<00:01:41.670> legs<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:43.889> have<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.249> do<00:01:44.369> this

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
front legs you do not have to do this

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.690 
front legs you do not have to do this
but<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.209> this<00:01:45.560> giving<00:01:46.560> tap<00:01:47.279> the<00:01:47.429> balloon

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
but I like this giving tap the balloon

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.519 
but I like this giving tap the balloon
and<00:01:48.539> you<00:01:48.689> blow<00:01:48.929> the<00:01:49.289> tail<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.889> one<00:01:50.130> two<00:01:50.369> three

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:51.529 
and you blow the tail so one two three

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:53.959 
and you blow the tail so one two three
you<00:01:52.529> should<00:01:52.829> time<00:01:53.039> not<00:01:53.310> from<00:01:53.429> here<00:01:53.700> when<00:01:53.880> I

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
you should time not from here when I
