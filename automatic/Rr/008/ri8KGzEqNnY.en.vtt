00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.730
 hello everybody it was adequate 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.910
 gamers 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.180
 episode be 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.610
 haunted 11 nuclear kraft mode then 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.039
 before 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.210
 started there are a lot of kraft not bad 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.289
 of stuff to detail just a few 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.720
 small ads to do so the effect 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.259
 very very quickly and then after 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.060
 can start so what start 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.160
 yes already I record more with keystroke 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.320
 I record with the cap camera 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.520
 stasiak finally the trick that helps 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.890
 filming of like stasia so if the 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.420
 quality not great at the level of 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.600
 fps that's okay I'm going to take that off 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.129
 Moreover it needs it more so 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.510
 it's just that my fraps do not 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.719
 walk more like this and there decide who 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.860
 would walk more and suddenly it's con 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.240
 because I had planned a lot of videos 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.340
 in advance but the sound market more no 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.710
 more and there it definitely me Steel 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.300
 so if someone still has the link for 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.780
 the keys which can record 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:03.160
 totally uninterrupted I am 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.500
 taker waiting ben I hope that the 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.909
 quality of the fps will suit you and we 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.189
 we will make our mode nuclear 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.110
 kraft mahood is a modder very 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.820
 talented who is one who built this 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.649
 fashion among us him very long series of 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.329
 mode that I will surely test the 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.520
 most finally I've tested a lot 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.590
 I think about fifty 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.390
 fashion having swimmers a fortnight who 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.640
 are interesting that I will test 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.140
 but we start by following the stiff neck 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.310
 nuclear kraft mode 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.170
 so you may have understood 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.850
 it's a mode that adds bombs 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.610
 nuclear that finally the nuclear bomb 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.310
 what do you see here and the c4 but there is a 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.049
 kraft sawmill but incalculable for 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.460
 finally arrive at a single bank 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.830
 which is in the end is pretty disappointing 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.049
 but but it's worth it 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.490
 present anyway so we have 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.750
 first of all the base is the ore 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.189
 of uranium that you can find the 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.140
 tanners break it or that you can 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.580
 build and then mine where we will see 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.900
 afterwards a combination for the twink 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.670
 but you see it is quite expensive 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.850
 four diamonds 4 heston and a compass 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.799
 to see it and from that it goes 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.210
 leave full of kraft as we go 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.130
 see everything in a row because otherwise 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.399
 that for the bomb they do not really have 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.230
 of interest in an oven you're cooking 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.360
 this Iranian to get the ingot 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.590
 of uranium and only 1 go and is not used to 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.379
 make tools or anything there 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.090
 serves to make a 1 g uranium ball 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.970
 tell you the exact name to not say of 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.820
 foolery 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.320
 it's the rpt find your eyes no more and 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.750
 refined uranium in the form of balls 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.100
 and this ball 28 you use it with 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.700
 ice cream all to get the 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.890
 plutonium 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.010
 so I do not know if it's chemically 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.870
 okay but that's how it's done is 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.980
 this rather well you take 5 I know 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.990
 not if you realize but that 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.600
 already made 20 diamond to get a 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.060
 refined uranium and this refined uranium 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.710
 you still need the handset with stuff 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.760
 and still we do not even do it 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.590
 in fact much more 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.810
 well, that's a lot 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.690
 kind about and a few to get 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.770
 a yes I know to get the body 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.480
 finally their fine uranium corp so that's it 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.430
 will go into the manufacturing eventually 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.680
 of the nucleus to make the bomb 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.040
 then another series of enough kraft 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.140
 particular there the granite the craf the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.709
 craft it or something like that the 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.900
 graphite 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.480
 the graffiti that is done by cooking 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.970
 flint finally another utility to flint 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.540
 this is only you skip 9 for 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.850
 get granite rod graphite 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.340
 ra granit name or the ax will arrive 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.230
 and I'm not good at writing August 3 in 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.230
 it was simple you take 3 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.260
 to get the nuclear caiz rod nuclear 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.690
 kaÃ¯s reactor and you take 4 ingots of 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.970
 to get the nuclear rings 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.370
 reactor and you combine the thou art 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.050
 you combine you take 4 graphite 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.209
 take two cats pony 2 rod take a 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.660
 burst the uranium brodes to get the 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.980
 nuclear reactor body so that's a 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.980
 most important elements for 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.480
 get our good one well then continue 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.100
 normally these pieces of furniture are made for 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.640
 the 1.4 so that normally it's 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.380
 aluminum 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.660
 but you see the textured males but 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.610
 it still works properly 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.410
 so you burned iron for 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.360
 to get aluminum in not either 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.660
 and it's chemically correct but it's 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.120
 not serious 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.070
 so you put 5 to get one 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.269
 uranium block that this time is gray 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.299
 it's weird almost normally it's 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.070
 a gray texture very close to fat 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.150
 so want some gravelly mass but 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.200
 what is it in France is serious 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.090
 it is 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.639
 I am ashamed of the gravel 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.330
 oh it was complicated in fact and 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.440
 finally you put yourself in and I 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.660
 believe that I was wrong by kraft 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.490
 no no that's it so you know that 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.380
 keep that you keep it and you do 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.650
 also a kraft like this with 6.6 that's 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.650
 what already 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.389
 gone not smell it's powder to 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.669
 gun 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.990
 if gunpowder and three recent for 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.350
 get I got it wrong in the kraft 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.940
 to get the c4 the c4 that I'm going 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.460
 go out right away who's in the 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:03.400
 decoration blocks normally the c4 the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:07.000
 c4 the c4 funes the ckd way to the and i 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.650
 go out the neck to the passage so good that's it 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.669
 the bizarre c4 that does not activate 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.950
 remote but it's still good 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.380
 level of damage so you take it all 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.080
 this assembly like this you take 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.900
 the four aluminum blocks c4 and the 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.040
 nuclear reactor body in the middle that I 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.520
 not put I do not know why he has 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.780
 faded away 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.880
 that's it to get the nuclear one 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.030
 the nuclear bomb right now 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.320
 so I hope all the kraft have been 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.430
 correct way if I did myself 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.570
 somewhere you will tell me in the 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.460
 comments because I'm not enough 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.110
 lifted to realize I'm going to do 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.580
 a little demonstration because it's 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.320
 what are you waiting for you like 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.860
 boom demonstrations have by cons it's 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.320
 instantaneous 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.580
 so you see it's a bit of a pity 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.789
 be it one year stand especially for 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.970
 c4 finally good interest or the 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:53.410
 little bugs no it's good no that the 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.640
 ccac still the interest is weird 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.520
 it's about the presentation anyway at 10 years 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.979
 but it explodes like that so good 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.510
 we are not going to deprive ourselves of it and finally the 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.490
 nape for finally I'm told but 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.100
 with so many diamonds expenses etc. 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.539
 but it's going to be awesome actually no and in 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.220
 does not good you'll see that when 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.510
 even it's small effect I did not do it 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.800
 you were there I'm going to fart the 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.210
 sheep that over there that's looking at me 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.919
 just now they are spying on you or 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.169
 current eh ben it will happen in cost 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.690
 it will pay the fees palm 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.400
 so here is little lag is normal and 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.020
 you still see the explosion is 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.389
 not hyper hyper either 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.889
 explosively precisely but that when 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.840
 even those little effects and that ultimately 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:30.620
 it's nice with something that 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.440
 does so much damage 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:36.009
 good I was talking about the uranium left 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.379
 radioactive just now to re there 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:41.150
 it's okay so I was talking about 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:42.650
 uranium that was actually radioactive 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.300
 we promised but it takes a combination 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.039
 who is not hyper expensive who 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.860
 ab-so-lu-ment which pretty much 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:52.069
 iron resistance but here it is necessary 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.960
 there kraft and so you will follow for 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:55.460
 kraft and the helmet simply he 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.919
 need wool on what I showed 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:02.060
 so see 5 aisne in water as 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:04.729
 these a glass in the middle here and 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.139
 ingots to do downstairs so I hope 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:07.610
 that you see if we will see you 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:09.229
 on the forum which is very very well done 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.479
 finally on the forum where the topic is a 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:15.050
 so do the plastron you see it here 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:17.300
 the leggings you see it here in 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.009
 legs yesterday upside down or there I knew 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.979
 not that we could do that finally good 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:23.389
 here are people well upside down here and 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:26.629
 finally the boots that was easy 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:27.740
 it's wool here and here and doing it 

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:29.599
 here and here 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.069
 that's it and with this combination that 

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:32.719
 is not texture is also it's 

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:35.030
 pity so you will appear anyway 

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:37.130
 big white blocks but hey that makes you 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.889
 still the effects so here you are 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.360
 can mine quiet uranium 

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:42.860
 so that's pretty much all for this 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.729
 I think I've done the trick 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.710
 otherwise you will tell me in the 

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:47.150
 comments the time I will have the 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.069
 problem is hitting it so I hope there 

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.229
 will really have a charitable soul for me 

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:53.029
 to say to give me the keystroke 

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:54.440
 otherwise I will be forced to 

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:56.210
 look for it will take three lead 

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.440
 otherwise if everything goes well we get 

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.969
 find tomorrow for a new video 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:04.599
 it was at the lockers march near all the 

00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:04.599
 world beats less and less we went
