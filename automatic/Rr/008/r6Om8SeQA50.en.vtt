a very interesting week I've worked with
Ella<00:00:08.760> farmer<00:00:09.320> almost<00:00:10.320> every<00:00:10.620> day<00:00:11.150> in<00:00:12.150> my

Ella farmer almost every day in my
opinion<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:12.960> does<00:00:13.139> have<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> place<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.679> the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
opinion it does have a place in the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.760 
opinion it does have a place in the
vector<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.340> nitrate<00:00:14.790> market<00:00:15.590> it's<00:00:16.590> been<00:00:16.740> a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
vector of nitrate market it's been a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.320 
vector of nitrate market it's been a
learning<00:00:16.980> curve<00:00:17.279> for<00:00:17.340> me<00:00:18.260> haven't<00:00:19.260> had<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:20.330> lot

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
learning curve for me haven't had a lot

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.900 
learning curve for me haven't had a lot
of<00:00:21.359> time<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:22.250> research<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.490> develop<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
of time to research and develop the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.730 
of time to research and develop the
products<00:00:24.359> but<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:25.109> I've<00:00:25.230> seen<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
products but what I've seen of the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.460 
products but what I've seen of the
product<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.849> really<00:00:27.180> decent<00:00:27.470> its

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
product is it is really decent its

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.970 
product is it is really decent its
structural<00:00:29.070> strengths<00:00:29.490> are<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:29.910> incredible

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
structural strengths are just incredible

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.970 
structural strengths are just incredible
especially<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.520> foam<00:00:33.270> applications<00:00:34.050> it's

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
especially for foam applications it's

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.370 
especially for foam applications it's
it's<00:00:35.280> excellent<00:00:35.730> I'm<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.960> continue<00:00:37.230> to

whole lot you can do with it from from a
sculpting<00:01:01.500> perspective<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.550> because<00:01:03.270> it's

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
sculpting perspective so because it's

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.440 
sculpting perspective so because it's
such<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> thin<00:01:04.229> application<00:01:05.090> you're<00:01:06.090> pretty

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
such a thin application you're pretty

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.870 
such a thin application you're pretty
much<00:01:06.920> going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.010> want<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> use<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.670> or

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
much going to want to use it or

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.380 
much going to want to use it or
texturising<00:01:09.720> stamping<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.909> type<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.210> a

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
keep in mind when you are using it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.930 
keep in mind when you are using it
because<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:32.030> is<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:32.480> sticky<00:01:33.490> make<00:01:34.490> sure<00:01:34.730> that

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
because it is so sticky make sure that

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.230 
because it is so sticky make sure that
you<00:01:35.650> use<00:01:36.650> plenty<00:01:37.010> of<00:01:37.160> release<00:01:37.550> agents<00:01:38.060> and

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
you use plenty of release agents and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.470 
you use plenty of release agents and
regular<00:01:39.050> gloves<00:01:39.550> I<00:01:40.550> don't<00:01:41.060> think<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:41.330> should

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
regular gloves I don't think you should

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.170 
regular gloves I don't think you should
try<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.660> necessarily<00:01:42.230> trowel<00:01:42.710> it<00:01:43.000> unless<00:01:44.000> you

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
try to necessarily trowel it unless you

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.960 
try to necessarily trowel it unless you
spray<00:01:44.420> your<00:01:44.570> trowel<00:01:44.870> as<00:01:45.140> well<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.340> plenty<00:01:46.940> of

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
spray your trowel as well so plenty of

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.810 
spray your trowel as well so plenty of
release<00:01:47.720> agents<00:01:48.260> on<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.980> product<00:01:49.370> doesn't

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
release agents on the product doesn't

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.630 
release agents on the product doesn't
affect<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.300> strength<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:50.780> all<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.550> one<00:01:52.550> of

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
affect the strength and all and one of

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.780 
affect the strength and all and one of
the<00:01:52.700> best<00:01:52.940> methods<00:01:53.180> that<00:01:53.690> I<00:01:54.530> have<00:01:55.040> found<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.550> to

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
the best methods that I have found is to

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.240 
the best methods that I have found is to
slick<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.240> out<00:01:56.390> or<00:01:56.990> it's<00:01:57.170> basically<00:01:57.740> rub<00:01:58.010> down

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
slick it out or it's basically rub down

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.970 
slick it out or it's basically rub down
a<00:01:58.280> lot<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.970> fiber<00:01:59.570> is<00:02:00.170> just<00:02:00.410> by<00:02:00.530> using<00:02:00.740> the

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
a lot of the fiber is just by using the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.280 
a lot of the fiber is just by using the
palm<00:02:01.160> of<00:02:01.370> my<00:02:01.400> hand<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:02.000> just<00:02:02.360> kind<00:02:03.080> of<00:02:03.140> going

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
palm of my hand and just kind of going

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.710 
palm of my hand and just kind of going
over<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:03.970> nothing<00:02:04.970> sticks<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.300> your<00:02:05.480> palm<00:02:05.690> but

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
over it nothing sticks to your palm but

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.030 
over it nothing sticks to your palm but
that<00:02:06.020> release<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.590> just<00:02:06.740> kind<00:02:06.950> of

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
that release and you just kind of

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.550 
that release and you just kind of
feather<00:02:07.250> everything<00:02:07.760> out<00:02:07.940> so<00:02:08.270> that<00:02:09.260> was<00:02:09.380> kind

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
feather everything out so that was kind

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.580 
feather everything out so that was kind
of<00:02:09.619> nice<00:02:09.770> also<00:02:10.480> it's<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.660> good<00:02:11.780> idea<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:12.290> spray

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
of nice also it's a good idea to spray

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.580 
of nice also it's a good idea to spray
release<00:02:12.980> down<00:02:13.630> before<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.720> put<00:02:14.930> any<00:02:15.080> plastic

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
release down before you put any plastic

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.770 
release down before you put any plastic
on<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:16.790> could<00:02:16.970> rub<00:02:17.120> out<00:02:17.420> with<00:02:17.660> your

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
on it you could rub out with your

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.090 
on it you could rub out with your
platform<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:20.020> even<00:02:21.020> trowel<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.560> out<00:02:21.740> on

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
platform and of even trowel it out on

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.070 
platform and of even trowel it out on
the<00:02:22.460> plastic<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.270> was<00:02:23.390> another<00:02:23.630> method<00:02:24.050> that

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
the plastic that was another method that

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.710 
the plastic that was another method that
I<00:02:24.200> tried<00:02:24.590> was<00:02:24.620> putting<00:02:25.580> release<00:02:26.239> down<00:02:26.480> on<00:02:26.660> the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
I tried was putting release down on the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.510 
I tried was putting release down on the
plastic<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.170> then<00:02:27.290> putting<00:02:27.530> reliefs<00:02:28.100> on<00:02:28.280> top

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
plastic and then putting reliefs on top

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.130 
plastic and then putting reliefs on top
of<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.730> plastic<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.239> my<00:02:29.390> trowel<00:02:29.690> would<00:02:29.870> easily

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
of the plastic so my trowel would easily

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.320 
of the plastic so my trowel would easily
glide<00:02:30.709> over<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.220> surface<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.850> hang<00:02:32.150> up

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
glide over the surface and that hang up

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.850 
glide over the surface and that hang up
that<00:02:32.570> was<00:02:33.080> another<00:02:33.290> good<00:02:33.470> method<00:02:33.830> for

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
that was another good method for

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.830 
that was another good method for
crawling<00:02:34.520> out<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.970> smoothing<00:02:35.570> of<00:02:35.690> the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
crawling out and smoothing of the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.150 
crawling out and smoothing of the
surface

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
surface

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.990 
surface
fissures<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.030> cracks<00:02:39.100> really<00:02:40.100> don't<00:02:40.400> work

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
fissures and cracks really don't work

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.110 
fissures and cracks really don't work
very<00:02:41.030> well<00:02:41.770> unless<00:02:42.770> you<00:02:43.160> take<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.790> piece<00:02:44.090> of

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
very well unless you take a piece of

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.600 
very well unless you take a piece of
plastic<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:45.500> know<00:02:45.590> do<00:02:45.950> all<00:02:45.980> your<00:02:46.370> crack

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
plastic and you know do all your crack

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.220 
plastic and you know do all your crack
work<00:02:46.850> with<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.120> plastic<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:49.390> that's<00:02:50.390> one<00:02:50.990> good

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
work with the plastic so that's one good

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.800 
work with the plastic so that's one good
thing<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.770> discovered<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:53.330> know<00:02:53.360> with<00:02:53.660> it

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
thing that I discovered you know with it

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.370 
thing that I discovered you know with it
as<00:02:53.930> far<00:02:54.140> as<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:56.330> cracking<00:02:56.810> because<00:02:57.020> that's

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
as far as the cracking because that's

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.110 
as far as the cracking because that's
such<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.620> big<00:02:57.860> part<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.220> what<00:02:58.340> we<00:02:58.430> do<00:02:58.580> especially

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
such a big part of what we do especially

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.600 
such a big part of what we do especially
for<00:02:59.270> our<00:02:59.480> efficient<00:02:59.810> ride<00:02:59.990> but<00:03:00.890> getting<00:03:01.100> away

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
for our efficient ride but getting away

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.030 
for our efficient ride but getting away
from<00:03:01.670> artificial<00:03:02.390> rock<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:03.020> think<00:03:03.620> one<00:03:03.770> of<00:03:03.800> its

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
from artificial rock I think one of its

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.390 
from artificial rock I think one of its
benefits<00:03:04.250> could<00:03:04.670> easily<00:03:04.940> be<00:03:05.330> in<00:03:06.400> the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
benefits could easily be in the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.750 
benefits could easily be in the
furniture<00:03:07.820> industry<00:03:08.000> or<00:03:08.960> tables<00:03:09.590> but<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.550> is

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
furniture industry or tables but it is

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.760 
furniture industry or tables but it is
polished<00:03:11.240> well<00:03:11.450> because<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.900> gets<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:12.350> hard

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
polished well because it gets so hard

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.550 
polished well because it gets so hard
you're<00:03:13.670> talking<00:03:14.060> about

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
you're talking about

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.390 
you're talking about
it<00:03:15.980> upwards<00:03:16.520> to<00:03:16.730> six<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.120> eight<00:03:17.270> thousand<00:03:17.720> psi

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
it upwards to six to eight thousand psi

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.100 
it upwards to six to eight thousand psi
so<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:19.430> can<00:03:19.730> polish<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.569> it<00:03:20.690> will<00:03:20.870> polish

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
so you can polish it and it will polish

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.650 
so you can polish it and it will polish
up<00:03:21.380> very<00:03:21.590> nicely<00:03:21.830> so<00:03:22.550> very<00:03:22.819> thin<00:03:23.090> applications

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
up very nicely so very thin applications

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.229 
up very nicely so very thin applications
well<00:03:26.660> can<00:03:27.470> easily<00:03:27.950> be<00:03:28.069> polished<00:03:28.550> it<00:03:29.000> does

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
well can easily be polished it does

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.440 
well can easily be polished it does
receive<00:03:29.660> color<00:03:29.959> very<00:03:30.290> well<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.940> think<00:03:32.330> it's

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
receive color very well and I think it's

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.620 
receive color very well and I think it's
gonna<00:03:32.599> be<00:03:32.780> kind<00:03:33.080> of<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.230> neat<00:03:33.440> addition<00:03:34.630> so

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
gonna be kind of a neat addition so

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.509 
gonna be kind of a neat addition so
there<00:03:35.900> are<00:03:36.019> bakery<00:03:36.349> they're<00:03:36.709> very<00:03:36.920> excited

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
there are bakery they're very excited

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.660 
there are bakery they're very excited
about<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:37.880> potential<00:03:38.800> for<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:39.920> product<00:03:40.310> and

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
about the potential for the product and

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.670 
about the potential for the product and
we're<00:03:41.300> excited<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:41.870> try<00:03:42.050> to<00:03:42.110> test<00:03:42.380> it<00:03:42.560> out<00:03:42.620> and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
we're excited to try to test it out and

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.059 
we're excited to try to test it out and
try<00:03:42.980> it<00:03:43.040> out<00:03:43.190> so<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.470> lot<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.680> stuff<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:45.920> I

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
try it out so a lot of the stuff that I

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.710 
try it out so a lot of the stuff that I
did<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:46.489> last<00:03:46.700> week<00:03:46.910> was<00:03:47.239> pretty<00:03:47.420> much<00:03:47.660> just

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
did this last week was pretty much just

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.970 
did this last week was pretty much just
a<00:03:48.319> continuation<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:49.310> R&amp;D<00:03:50.709> didn't<00:03:51.709> have<00:03:51.830> any

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
a continuation of R&amp;D didn't have any

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.940 
a continuation of R&amp;D didn't have any
kind<00:03:52.220> of<00:03:52.310> grand<00:03:52.580> scheme<00:03:53.030> in<00:03:53.209> mind<00:03:53.950> there's

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
kind of grand scheme in mind there's

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.309 
kind of grand scheme in mind there's
many<00:03:55.190> artists<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:55.850> we're<00:03:56.000> here<00:03:56.269> that<00:03:57.049> put

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
many artists that we're here that put

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.780 
many artists that we're here that put
things<00:03:57.470> together<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:58.040> they're<00:03:58.190> just<00:03:58.370> they're

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
things together and they're just they're

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.949 
things together and they're just they're
just<00:03:58.970> wonderful<00:03:59.299> I'm<00:03:59.510> going<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.690> get<00:03:59.780> some

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
just wonderful I'm going to get some

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.890 
just wonderful I'm going to get some
pictures<00:04:00.080> of<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:00.410> later<00:04:00.739> on<00:04:00.860> today<00:04:01.480> but<00:04:02.480> it

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
pictures of that later on today but it

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.979 
pictures of that later on today but it
was<00:04:03.349> a<00:04:03.380> good<00:04:03.620> week<00:04:04.150> one<00:04:05.150> disappointing<00:04:05.810> thing

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
was a good week one disappointing thing

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.229 
was a good week one disappointing thing
overall<00:04:06.349> at<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:07.069> world<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.370> concrete<00:04:07.790> is<00:04:07.940> the

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
overall at the world of concrete is the

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.240 
overall at the world of concrete is the
vertical<00:04:08.690> industry<00:04:09.200> is<00:04:09.380> not<00:04:09.560> really<00:04:10.040> being

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
vertical industry is not really being

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.500 
vertical industry is not really being
represented<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:13.220> that's<00:04:14.180> kind<00:04:14.450> of

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
represented and that's kind of

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.150 
represented and that's kind of
frustration<00:04:14.989> so<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.260> do<00:04:15.319> want<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.680> give<00:04:15.830> a<00:04:15.860> big

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
frustration so I do want to give a big
