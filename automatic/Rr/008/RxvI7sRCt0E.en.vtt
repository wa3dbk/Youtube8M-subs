00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.670
 Hello friends, I welcome you 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:11.179
 a new video of me here on one 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.769
 I want you today 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:18.500
 brother lowepro or whatever the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.500
 Company hot one can pocket 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:31.740
 110 markets present and equal 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:35.760
 Let's start directly and that is this 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.579
 bag super suitable as I said for 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.890
 beginner of the digital 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.430
 mirror-reflex photography because it offers 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:50.309
 enough space for a camera 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.920
 as I said 600d and yes I imagine 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.460
 in front of what is what is drum and what 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.559
 reinpasst 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.090
 yes, we just catch here with the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.410
 Foremost subject and indeed rag the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.270
 somehow not quite the function 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:10.729
 has he is there and that was not why 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.729
 then we have a small barrel here 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:21.689
 then we find it inside 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:26.040
 once such a nice one for one 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:29.159
 memory card or what not then then 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:35.100
 even that's just as good just did not work 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.299
 from net needs to yes because that was it 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.170
 even something is in there I have 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:48.030
 down once this all weather aw cover 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:50.830
 wind and sun against the sometimes as 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.010
 secured by two velcro straps 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:58.360
 and the third, we easily find such a 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.830
 overlap the one here on the pocket 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:07.260
 can pull over it 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.260
 but never done it anyway 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.300
 then you'll just find one upstairs 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.390
 nice things padded handle where the 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.390
 card can really carry far 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.930
 then we have this side of this 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:54.910
 Hook here so this helps solve this 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:57.420
 Ties History are here 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.769
 Sewn clean I think that works 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.269
 you have to put this bag up there 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.640
 down below so really everything is here 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.010
 distributed there you need me yes 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.620
 said do not worry that out here 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:23.080
 Plastic is made with it 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:29.410
 this short moment really enormously long 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:31.090
 good with two such hard ones here 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.340
 biggest adjustment the super light 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.239
 I find that very much 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.360
 practical and a big none big 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.700
 blame pad quite thin and over it 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.470
 Common is the whole thing here 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.470
 again a bit yes 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.310
 Let's come back to the bag then 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.010
 we here at the bag a big one 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.020
 zipper it is in two 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.590
 zips and thus one 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.590
 practical thing 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:17.570
 This lamp is here to clean the 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:24.620
 camera times and so we find a lot of space 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:24.620
 only then come with the bag 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.660
 such an insert here with it one 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.610
 I can divide that up a bit 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.320
 that as wal fortification because I the 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:42.120
 Camera does not show you that later 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:44.280
 again deposits is with it and how 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.200
 said this lamp is solid here 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.650
 created so that you actually 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:56.550
 always further by net grid again 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:58.530
 for filter or whatever here around much 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.540
 small net kita subjects for 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.360
 memory cards or for example if 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.950
 you such a small quick release plate 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.620
 Do not you need the camera 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.140
 For example , the ta could be very clean 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.980
 practically as I said here is inside 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:21.560
 Everything is nicely upholstered and right 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:21.560
 yes, then her square still needs that 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.479
 okay the name of the bag i 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.060
 you can say right here are one 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:35.540
 belt loop and on the sides had 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.979
 I forget these neoprene here 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.380
 exchange 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:43.490
 very nice, so show it now 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.490
 I you the camera is 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:52.520
 so there I am again and so I have 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.520
 i said yes this thing is here 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.919
 So actually the distribution sender 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.110
 I sometimes, too 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:04.280
 I'm not that funny or less funny 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.780
 did it differently and yes as I said 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.590
 now have one or the whalers 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.900
 kindness owns the camera yet 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.289
 Not so long ago that's why I am doing now 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:19.090
 Here is just this insert to the 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:23.840
 page simply with the velcro in there and 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:26.810
 as my 600d can now easily here 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:34.940
 take and prefers only at 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:37.840
 to do those lamps here in between so 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:41.690
 in order that I have the objective here 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:45.080
 could be here practically after 50 mm or 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.520
 Whatever you have to do then if 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.810
 I somehow hopp around the bag or something 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.849
 easy access to the camera here 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.889
 get you out just as it has in 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:55.639
 the hand 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:57.889
 and yes , for example, the sd 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:00.280
 Card slot simply open sd card 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:11.770
 rausholen 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:20.060
 or what the camera is good for the consumer 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:25.610
 is now super packed so zac camera 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:29.569
 and I hope you can with the review 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:32.599
 with the show so far what show 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:37.819
 start the thing is called air per 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:40.969
 level pro reet so 101 aw I guess
