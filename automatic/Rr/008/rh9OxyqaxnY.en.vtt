00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
million accounts means a successful game

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.760 
million accounts means a successful game
I<00:00:54.420> guess<00:00:56.180> really<00:00:57.180> impressive<00:00:57.390> 200<00:00:58.320> million<00:00:58.649> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
I guess really impressive 200 million to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.290 
I guess really impressive 200 million to
think<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.070> 200<00:00:59.430> million<00:00:59.789> accounts<00:01:00.059> have

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
think that 200 million accounts have

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.930 
think that 200 million accounts have
been<00:01:00.329> created<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.469> game<00:01:01.620> that's<00:01:01.940> pretty

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
been created on this game that's pretty

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.350 
been created on this game that's pretty
crazy<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.359> think<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:04.880> especially<00:01:05.880> since<00:01:06.119> back

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
crazy to think of especially since back

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.840 
crazy to think of especially since back
in<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> day<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.780> used<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.640> not<00:01:08.640> even

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
in the day it used to be like not even

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.140 
in the day it used to be like not even
close<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> any<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.840> obviously<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:11.220> this

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
close to any of that obviously but this

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.750 
close to any of that obviously but this
game<00:01:12.299> wasn't<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.750> well<00:01:12.990> known<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:14.340> clearly

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
game wasn't that well known and clearly

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.999 
game wasn't that well known and clearly
it<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.330> 200<00:01:15.810> million<00:01:16.020> accounts<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.979> I

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it is now 200 million accounts so I

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.050 
it is now 200 million accounts so I
guess<00:01:17.159> that's<00:01:17.250> all<00:01:17.430> about<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.030> wasn't

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
guess that's all about that one I wasn't

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.820 
guess that's all about that one I wasn't
I<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.930> wasn't<00:01:19.200> prepared<00:01:19.320> for<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.590> guy

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
I have it I wasn't prepared for this guy
