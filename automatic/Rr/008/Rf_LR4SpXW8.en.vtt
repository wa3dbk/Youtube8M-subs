how<00:00:02.370> much<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.760> difference<00:00:02.909> can<00:00:03.210> your

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
how much of a difference can your

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.599 
how much of a difference can your
monitor<00:00:03.840> make<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.230> your<00:00:04.350> PC<00:00:04.740> gaming<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.250> need<00:00:05.520> an

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
monitor make to your PC gaming I need an

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.130 
monitor make to your PC gaming I need an
acronym<00:00:05.970> we're<00:00:06.120> here<00:00:06.240> take<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.450> look<00:00:06.569> an<00:00:06.750> Nvidia

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
acronym we're here take a look an Nvidia

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.910 
acronym we're here take a look an Nvidia
g-sync<00:00:07.670> technology<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:10.170> new<00:00:10.620> approach

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
g-sync technology this is a new approach

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.220 
g-sync technology this is a new approach
from<00:00:11.190> Nvidia<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:12.150> basically<00:00:12.719> says<00:00:12.929> we're

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
from Nvidia that basically says we're

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.539 
from Nvidia that basically says we're
going<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.440> take<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.740> video<00:00:14.009> card<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.370> you

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
going to take the video card that you

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.730 
going to take the video card that you
have<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:15.000> your<00:00:15.089> gaming<00:00:15.420> PC<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.080> we're<00:00:16.590> going

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
have in your gaming PC and we're going

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.609 
have in your gaming PC and we're going
to<00:00:16.770> allow<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> talk<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.930> one<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.109> handful<00:00:19.529> of

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
to allow to talk to one of a handful of

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.099 
to allow to talk to one of a handful of
new<00:00:19.800> monitors<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.490> have<00:00:20.570> Nvidia<00:00:21.570> technology

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
new monitors that have Nvidia technology

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.720 
new monitors that have Nvidia technology
built<00:00:22.439> into<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.340> basically<00:00:23.460> does

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
built into it and what it basically does

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.730 
built into it and what it basically does
is<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.300> takes<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.660> refresh<00:00:25.380> rate<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
is it takes the refresh rate of the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.429 
is it takes the refresh rate of the
monitor<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.789> frame<00:00:27.449> rate<00:00:27.480> from<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
monitor and the frame rate from the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.349 
monitor and the frame rate from the
video<00:00:28.680> card<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:28.980> your<00:00:29.070> computer<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.640> allows

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
video card in your computer and allows

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.569 
video card in your computer and allows
those<00:00:30.779> two<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.380> sync<00:00:31.679> up<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.009> basically<00:00:32.130> your

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
those two to sync up so basically your

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.160 
those two to sync up so basically your
computer<00:00:33.030> no<00:00:33.270> matter<00:00:33.300> how<00:00:33.600> powerful<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
computer no matter how powerful the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.290 
computer no matter how powerful the
video<00:00:34.380> cards<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.920> will<00:00:35.489> only<00:00:35.820> kick<00:00:36.120> out<00:00:36.270> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
video cards in it will only kick out a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.049 
video cards in it will only kick out a
full<00:00:36.719> frame<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.230> new<00:00:37.350> mana<00:00:37.530> mayshen<00:00:37.980> when<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
full frame of new mana mayshen when the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.150 
full frame of new mana mayshen when the
monitor<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.690> ready<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.110> receive<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> full<00:00:40.890> frame

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
monitor is ready to receive a full frame

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.069 
monitor is ready to receive a full frame
what<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.879> does<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.300> eliminates<00:00:42.899> what

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
what that does is that eliminates what

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.080 
what that does is that eliminates what
we<00:00:43.170> call<00:00:43.320> tearing<00:00:43.890> where<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.670> sort<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> see<00:00:44.969> a

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
we call tearing where you sort of see a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.380 
we call tearing where you sort of see a
half<00:00:45.420> drawn<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.289> frame<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> screen<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
half drawn a frame on the screen so that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.970 
half drawn a frame on the screen so that
this<00:00:49.050> kind<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.469> see<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> whole<00:00:49.829> picture

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
this kind of you see the whole picture

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.650 
this kind of you see the whole picture
but<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.340> sort<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.610> some<00:00:51.090> horizontal<00:00:51.360> lines

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
but this sort of some horizontal lines

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.450 
but this sort of some horizontal lines
across<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.440> worked<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:53.100> bit<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.309> of

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
across it worked a little bit out of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.420 
across it worked a little bit out of
sync<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.510> effect<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.989> without<00:00:55.350> that

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
sync so the in effect is without that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.189 
sync so the in effect is without that
tearing<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.030> image<00:00:57.329> will<00:00:57.510> seem<00:00:57.719> smoother<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
tearing the image will seem smoother you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.420 
tearing the image will seem smoother you
almost<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.530> illusion<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.070> having<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
almost get the illusion of having a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.459 
almost get the illusion of having a
higher<00:00:59.670> framerate<00:01:00.090> than<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.050> actually<00:01:01.199> do

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
higher framerate than you actually do

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.049 
higher framerate than you actually do
from<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> game<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> first<00:01:02.730> thing<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:02.940> do

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
from the game so the first thing we do

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.670 
from the game so the first thing we do
is<00:01:03.180> enable<00:01:03.390> g-sync<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.379> we've<00:01:04.500> got<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
is enable g-sync right here we've got a

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.039 
is enable g-sync right here we've got a
really<00:01:04.830> big<00:01:05.250> powerful<00:01:05.820> main<00:01:06.210> gear<00:01:06.540> desktop

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.450 
not exactly in sync with a refresh rate
of<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.020> monitor<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.920> over<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.340> this

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
of the monitor and over here on this

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.760 
of the monitor and over here on this
side<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:30.030> looks<00:01:30.180> completely<00:01:30.869> smooth<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.500> even

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
side it looks completely smooth so even

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.050 
side it looks completely smooth so even
though<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> frame<00:01:32.220> rate<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.549> exactly<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
though the frame rate is exactly the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.630 
though the frame rate is exactly the
same<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.450> these<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:34.320> looks<00:01:34.680> nicer<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
same on these this looks nicer and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.399 
same on these this looks nicer and
smoother<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.420> almost<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.170> more

smoother and almost like you have a more

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.920 
smoother and almost like you have a more
powerful<00:01:37.650> computer<00:01:38.009> driving<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.750> can

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
powerful computer driving it and I can

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.010 
powerful computer driving it and I can
even<00:01:40.670> spin<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.820> camera<00:01:42.030> around<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.869> you

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
even spin the camera around here and you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.960 
even spin the camera around here and you
can<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.560> effect<00:01:43.860> happening<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
can see that effect happening on the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.030 
can see that effect happening on the
pillars<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:45.899> well<00:01:46.110> here<00:01:46.470> very<00:01:46.680> smooth

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
pillars here as well here very smooth

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.889 
pillars here as well here very smooth
and<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.090> get<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.420> little<00:01:48.659> bit<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.840> a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and here you get a little bit of a

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.990 
and here you get a little bit of a
tearing<00:01:49.290> right<00:01:49.439> there<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.820> much<00:01:50.970> more

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
tearing right there so it's much more

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.340 
tearing right there so it's much more

and of course they cost more than
regular<00:02:45.540> monitors<00:02:46.110> they'll<00:02:46.290> be<00:02:46.410> up<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.680> to

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.600 
decide whether or not this smoother look
is<00:02:49.260> worth<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.800> it'll<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.040> really<00:02:50.220> interesting

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
is worth it it'll be really interesting
