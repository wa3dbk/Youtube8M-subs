00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
Batman and Batgirl who should be wearing

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.110 
Batman and Batgirl who should be wearing
armor<00:01:35.840> because<00:01:35.960> they're<00:01:36.200> fighting<00:01:36.560> hand<00:01:36.740> hand

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
armor because they're fighting hand hand

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.450 
armor because they're fighting hand hand
the<00:01:38.320> different<00:01:39.320> texture<00:01:39.710> there<00:01:40.010> makes<00:01:40.310> it

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
the different texture there makes it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.690 
the different texture there makes it
look<00:01:40.610> like<00:01:40.640> its<00:01:41.650> armor<00:01:42.650> on<00:01:42.770> top<00:01:42.979> of<00:01:43.100> bodysuit

look like its armor on top of bodysuit

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.090 
look like its armor on top of bodysuit
so<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:43.940> has<00:01:44.060> flexibility<00:01:44.659> for<00:01:44.869> moving<00:01:47.799> this<00:01:48.799> is

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
so it has flexibility for moving this is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.530 
so it has flexibility for moving this is
something<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:49.549> don't<00:01:49.729> like<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.119> this<00:01:50.180> I<00:01:50.360> guess

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
something I don't like and this I guess

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.990 
something I don't like and this I guess
is<00:01:50.720> just<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.290> design<00:01:51.650> of<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.369> statue<00:01:52.640> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
is just the design of the statue the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.030 
is just the design of the statue the
cape<00:01:53.210> looks<00:01:53.479> way<00:01:53.990> narrow<00:01:54.409> right<00:01:54.710> there<00:01:54.890> it's

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
cape looks way narrow right there it's

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.480 
cape looks way narrow right there it's
almost<00:01:55.220> as<00:01:55.520> narrow<00:01:55.729> as<00:01:55.820> her<00:01:56.090> waist<00:01:56.470> which<00:01:57.490> is

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
almost as narrow as her waist which is

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.289 
almost as narrow as her waist which is
pretty<00:01:59.180> narrow<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.580> then<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:01.670> flares<00:02:01.850> out<00:02:02.090> so

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
pretty narrow and then it flares out so

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.240 
pretty narrow and then it flares out so
big<00:02:02.479> down<00:02:02.689> there<00:02:02.720> just<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.290> looks<00:02:03.439> weird<00:02:03.770> it

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
big down there just it looks weird it

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.240 
big down there just it looks weird it
was<00:02:04.700> kind<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:05.000> folded<00:02:05.330> over<00:02:05.420> here<00:02:06.070> but<00:02:07.070> so

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
was kind of folded over here but so

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.789 
was kind of folded over here but so
that's<00:02:07.430> just<00:02:07.520> where<00:02:07.759> he<00:02:07.820> should<00:02:07.939> not

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
that's just where he should not

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.369 
that's just where he should not
shouldn't<00:02:09.799> scoop<00:02:09.979> in<00:02:10.159> that<00:02:10.310> much<00:02:10.519> i<00:02:11.200> like<00:02:12.200> the

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
shouldn't scoop in that much i like the

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.380 
shouldn't scoop in that much i like the
pose<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:13.610> looks<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.879> little<00:02:14.030> weird<00:02:14.180> from

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
pose it looks a little weird from

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.289 
pose it looks a little weird from
certain<00:02:14.720> angles<00:02:15.700> but<00:02:16.700> Lex<00:02:16.970> you're<00:02:17.090> getting

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
certain angles but Lex you're getting

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.129 
certain angles but Lex you're getting
ready<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.569> throw<00:02:17.659> the<00:02:17.930> batarang<00:02:18.110> I<00:02:18.620> like<00:02:19.189> it

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:20.139 
ready to throw the batarang I like it

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.300 
ready to throw the batarang I like it

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
the only other thing I really have a

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.069 
the only other thing I really have a
problem<00:02:22.549> with<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:22.849> is<00:02:22.909> it's<00:02:23.269> really<00:02:23.510> loose

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
problem with this is it's really loose

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:24.550 
problem with this is it's really loose
it<00:02:24.290> just

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
it just

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.280 
it just
pops<00:02:24.770> right<00:02:25.040> out<00:02:25.099> of<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.370> base<00:02:25.780> super<00:02:26.780> easy<00:02:26.959> so

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
pops right out of the base super easy so

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.110 
pops right out of the base super easy so
if<00:02:27.440> i<00:02:27.530> go<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.680> move<00:02:27.950> her<00:02:28.099> which<00:02:28.550> I<00:02:28.730> don't<00:02:28.970> do

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
if i go to move her which I don't do
