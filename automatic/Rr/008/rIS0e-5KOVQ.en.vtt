00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.440
 Hello everyone, Bono Channel 5 and I am Vika 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.660
 by your numerous requests, we 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.840
 today we will prepare a french cake 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:21.610
 macaroni and timed so three years 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.140
 of our project let's say this is not the most 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.449
 simple recipe that we had 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.449
 cook but it's worth it 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.219
 Let's start with the fact that we sift together 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.219
 almond flour and powdered sugar 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.789
 now dry the powdered sugar powder in 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.719
 oven preheated to 150 degrees 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.719
 for five to seven minutes 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.540
 the flour we got out of the oven completely 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.780
 have cooled 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.950
 now add cocoa there and sift more 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.950
 all together 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.190
 the absence of lumps of the mixture is very 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.380
 important factor therefore it is better not 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.380
 to spare time for extra sifting 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.060
 dry pasta mix is ready therefore 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.220
 now we set aside the word 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.340
 if in your city and difficult to find 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.229
 almond flour then use our 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.159
 advice because how to make it in 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.590
 home conditions 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:59.810
 and now we will proceed to one of the most 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.700
 the crucial stages of our preparation 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.070
 pasta is whipping proteins 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.070
 the dishes should be clean, dry and 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.070
 fat free 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.000
 we beat the whites to foam 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:19.879
 after which we begin to pour 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.140
 powdered sugar and we will wait for those 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.140
 the most stable peaks 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.299
 in order to check whether it is enough 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.329
 well whipped whites we make here 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.670
 such a simple trick squirrels do not fall out 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:38.560
 it means they got off well I am very 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.060
 good sign now two or three approaches 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.260
 we introduce a dry mix in our proteins and 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.260
 knead homogeneous dough 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.190
 instead of pastry bag can 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.220
 use plastic bag 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:05.129
 which for convenience we put on 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.129
 glass and shift the dough there 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.170
 now we will lay our dough on 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.170
 parchment paper 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.040
 now we leave our preparations for minutes 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.849
 30-40 for the right one to appear 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.849
 us crust 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.620
 in the meantime, make chocolate cream 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.050
 which we will then use for 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.690
 fillings we pour hot chocolate 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.100
 cream and let stand approximately 30 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.100
 seconds and then shuffle 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.400
 I touching the surface of the workpiece 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.000
 the dough does not stick so you can safely 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.000
 send in the oven 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:31.020
 our blanks were baked right away 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.660
 we shift them to the grid so that they 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.510
 completely cooled as soon as ours 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.340
 the blanks have cooled we will start to connect them 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.430
 and fasten together the chocolate 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.430
 cream 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.490
 our chocolate macaroni with ready a 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.520
 Now we will repeat several important 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.970
 moments first use kitchen 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.610
 Libra 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.250
 accuracy is the key to success 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.379
 sift and dry all dry 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.479
 Ingredients 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:12.759
 3 for the perfect meringue need 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.770
 use room proteins only 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.599
 temperatures and they should not be 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.750
 no other substances besides 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.759
 squirrel and fourth 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.470
 it's important to let your pieces stand for 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.960
 In order to form a crust 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.909
 before sending in advance 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.780
 preheated oven that too by the way 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.780
 very important
