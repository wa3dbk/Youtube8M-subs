00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
happening I mean people are clearly very

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.830 
happening I mean people are clearly very
worried<00:02:12.130> about<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.430> increase<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.600> not

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
worried about the increase in this not

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.559 
worried about the increase in this not
just<00:02:13.870> in

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
just in

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.119 
just in
but<00:02:14.689> in<00:02:14.810> other<00:02:14.900> big<00:02:15.469> cities<00:02:15.769> around<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
but in other big cities around the

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.470 
but in other big cities around the
country<00:02:16.159> as<00:02:16.519> well<00:02:16.700> why<00:02:16.939> do<00:02:16.999> you<00:02:17.120> think<00:02:17.209> it's

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
country as well why do you think it's

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.509 
country as well why do you think it's
suddenly<00:02:17.780> getting<00:02:17.959> worse<00:02:18.370> what's<00:02:19.370> getting

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
suddenly getting worse what's getting

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.699 
suddenly getting worse what's getting
worse<00:02:19.849> because<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.569> basically<00:02:21.439> there<00:02:21.680> are

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
worse because of basically there are

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.399 
worse because of basically there are
things<00:02:21.920> like<00:02:22.069> computer<00:02:22.730> games<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.239> media<00:02:23.659> a

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
things like computer games the media a

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.379 
things like computer games the media a
lot<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.859> kids<00:02:25.099> you<00:02:25.489> know<00:02:25.609> trying<00:02:25.969> to<00:02:26.060> emulate

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:26.389 
lot of kids you know trying to emulate

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:28.089 
lot of kids you know trying to emulate
things<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.959> they<00:02:27.049> see<00:02:27.109> on<00:02:27.409> the<00:02:27.499> TV<00:02:27.709> and

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
things that they see on the TV and

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.099 
things that they see on the TV and
things<00:02:28.370> like<00:02:28.579> that<00:02:28.639> and<00:02:28.969> and<00:02:29.629> really<00:02:29.989> it's

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
things like that and and really it's

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.580 
things like that and and really it's
getting<00:02:30.349> out<00:02:30.439> of<00:02:30.499> hand<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:31.959> just<00:02:32.959> think<00:02:33.200> it's<00:02:33.379> is

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
getting out of hand I just think it's is

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.379 
getting out of hand I just think it's is
something<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.159> has<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.519> be<00:02:34.549> resolved<00:02:34.670> and

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
something that has to be resolved and

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:36.759 
something that has to be resolved and
and<00:02:35.599> that's<00:02:35.689> what<00:02:35.930> we're<00:02:36.260> basically<00:02:36.379> trying

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
and that's what we're basically trying

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.069 
and that's what we're basically trying
to<00:02:36.950> do<00:02:37.159> it's<00:02:37.639> about<00:02:37.909> it's<00:02:38.209> about<00:02:38.329> parents<00:02:38.989> as

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
to do it's about it's about parents as

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.780 
to do it's about it's about parents as
well<00:02:39.109> an<00:02:39.379> individual<00:02:39.799> responsibility<00:02:40.549> too

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
well an individual responsibility too

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.819 
well an individual responsibility too
isn't<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:41.359> course<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.049> is<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.319> do<00:02:42.379> feel<00:02:42.500> that

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:45.499
