so Spode the other day my brother was
playing<00:00:12.990> 3d<00:00:13.769> gaming<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.400> his<00:00:14.969> glasses<00:00:15.360> like

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
playing 3d gaming and his glasses like

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.140 
playing 3d gaming and his glasses like
the<00:00:15.780> battery<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.260> his<00:00:16.350> glasses<00:00:16.619> ran<00:00:16.949> out<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:18.029> I

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
the battery on his glasses ran out and I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.279 
the battery on his glasses ran out and I
didn't<00:00:18.390> get<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.600> because<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.990> other<00:00:19.080> day<00:00:19.260> I

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
didn't get it because the other day I

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.710 
didn't get it because the other day I
was<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> cinema<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.240> had<00:00:21.480> plastic

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
was in the cinema and I had plastic

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.759 
was in the cinema and I had plastic
glasses<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.260> they<00:00:22.320> generally<00:00:22.529> brought

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
glasses and they generally brought

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.290 
glasses and they generally brought
cheese<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.519> that's<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.060> different

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
cheese and I just that's a different

how<00:00:27.570> does<00:00:27.840> 3d<00:00:28.260> even<00:00:28.470> work<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.090> two<00:00:30.269> eyes

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
how does 3d even work you have two eyes

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.630 
how does 3d even work you have two eyes
I<00:00:30.720> -<00:00:31.230> lets<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.160> two<00:00:32.279> eyes

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
I - lets you have two eyes

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.490 
I - lets you have two eyes
we<00:00:32.790> call<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.090> stereoscopic<00:00:33.989> vision<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.469> you

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
we call this stereoscopic vision if you

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.970 
we call this stereoscopic vision if you
were<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:34.800> chemical<00:00:35.250> if<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.390> drink<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:36.780> eye

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
were all chemical if you drink one eye

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.069 
were all chemical if you drink one eye
you<00:00:37.980> don't<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.340> cyclops<00:00:38.790> yes<00:00:39.210> well<00:00:39.690> you've

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
you don't have cyclops yes well you've

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.200 
you don't have cyclops yes well you've
just<00:00:40.290> been<00:00:40.410> very<00:00:40.620> unfortunate<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.219> um<00:00:41.550> but

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
just been very unfortunate that um but

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.280 
just been very unfortunate that um but
basically<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.719> have<00:00:42.750> no<00:00:42.989> depth<00:00:43.200> perception

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
basically you have no depth perception

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.310 
basically you have no depth perception
you<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.040> no<00:00:44.309> ability<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.820> tell<00:00:45.180> how<00:00:46.140> close

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you have no ability to tell how close

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.229 
you have no ability to tell how close
how<00:00:46.590> far<00:00:46.860> away<00:00:47.070> something<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
how far away something is so that the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.450 
how far away something is so that the
way<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.539> have<00:00:48.719> evolved<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:50.010> two<00:00:50.280> eyes

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
way we have evolved is to have two eyes

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.700 
way we have evolved is to have two eyes
it's<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> bit<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.660> having<00:00:51.719> two<00:00:52.020> cameras<00:00:52.469> that

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
it's a bit like having two cameras that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.560 
it's a bit like having two cameras that
have<00:00:53.399> taken<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.760> picture<00:00:53.940> from<00:00:54.329> two<00:00:54.449> different

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
have taken a picture from two different

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.770 
have taken a picture from two different
angles<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.230> your<00:00:55.980> brain<00:00:56.600> compares<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
angles and your brain compares the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.660 
angles and your brain compares the
difference<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.410> converges<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.190> compares<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
difference it converges and compares the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.510 
difference it converges and compares the
difference<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.270> can<00:01:00.449> tell<00:01:00.719> therefore<00:01:01.620> how

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
difference and it can tell therefore how

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.280 
difference and it can tell therefore how
far<00:01:02.820> away<00:01:03.030> something<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.570> by<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> difference

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
far away something is by the difference

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
far away something is by the difference
between<00:01:04.470> these<00:01:04.680> two<00:01:04.920> images<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.030> want

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
between these two images if we then want

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.140 
between these two images if we then want
to<00:01:06.420> watch<00:01:07.260> something<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.920> 3d<00:01:08.220> rather<00:01:08.850> than

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
to watch something in 3d rather than

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.170 
to watch something in 3d rather than
watching<00:01:09.330> something<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:10.020> 2d<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:11.580> technology

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
watching something in 2d the technology

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.320 
watching something in 2d the technology
has<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.600> find<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.960> way<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.640> delivering<00:01:14.640> two

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
has to find a way of delivering two

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.350 
has to find a way of delivering two
separate<00:01:16.020> images<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:17.070> us<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.580> one<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> each<00:01:18.090> eye

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
separate images to us so one to each eye

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.359 
separate images to us so one to each eye
to<00:01:18.990> basically<00:01:19.290> fool<00:01:19.650> our<00:01:19.860> brain<00:01:20.100> into

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
to basically fool our brain into

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.070 
to basically fool our brain into
thinking<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.850> are<00:01:20.880> seeing<00:01:21.210> something<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.810> 3d

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
thinking we are seeing something in 3d

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.429 
thinking we are seeing something in 3d
so<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.009> how<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.820> old<00:01:24.060> red<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.020> green

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
so is this how the old red and green

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.590 
so is this how the old red and green
glasses<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> really<00:01:27.360> good<00:01:27.509> example

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
glasses that is a really good example

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.020 
glasses that is a really good example
exactly<00:01:28.439> that's<00:01:28.710> working<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.460> if<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.759> look<00:01:29.909> at

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
exactly that's working so if you look at

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.940 
exactly that's working so if you look at
the<00:01:30.119> images<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:31.470> your<00:01:31.650> piece<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> paper

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the images on the on your piece of paper

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.890 
the images on the on your piece of paper
it'll<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> red<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.299> green<00:01:33.329> image<00:01:33.689> that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
it'll be a red and a green image that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.719 
it'll be a red and a green image that
have<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.110> been<00:01:34.320> stuck<00:01:34.950> directly<00:01:35.460> over<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
have just been stuck directly over the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.480 
have just been stuck directly over the
top<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.090> each<00:01:36.180> other<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.220> glasses

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
top of each other and then the glasses

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.399 
top of each other and then the glasses
that<00:01:38.880> would<00:01:39.450> actually<00:01:39.810> separate<00:01:40.229> those<00:01:40.380> two

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that would actually separate those two

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.620 
that would actually separate those two
images<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> green<00:01:41.820> goes<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.450> eye<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
images so the green goes to one eye the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.690 
images so the green goes to one eye the
red<00:01:42.960> goes<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> other<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.340> gives<00:01:44.579> you

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
red goes to the other and it gives you

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.639 
red goes to the other and it gives you
this<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.360> sense<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.990> you're<00:01:46.200> looking<00:01:46.350> at

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
this this sense of you're looking at

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.469 
this this sense of you're looking at
something<00:01:46.860> 3d<00:01:47.399> okay<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.880> recognize<00:01:48.450> that

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
something 3d okay so I recognize that

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.719 
something 3d okay so I recognize that
we've<00:01:48.780> moved<00:01:49.020> away<00:01:49.200> from<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:50.040> red<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.399> green

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
we've moved away from the red and green

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.050 
we've moved away from the red and green
3d<00:01:51.720> glasses<00:01:51.990> no<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.970> difference

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
3d glasses no but what is the difference

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.209 
3d glasses no but what is the difference
then<00:01:54.509> between<00:01:54.540> my<00:01:55.320> brother's<00:01:55.649> glasses<00:01:56.040> and

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
then between my brother's glasses and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.770 
then between my brother's glasses and
the<00:01:56.280> ones<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.610> wore<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> cinema<00:01:57.329> we

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the ones that I wore in the cinema we

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.300 
the ones that I wore in the cinema we
would<00:01:57.930> usually<00:01:58.079> call<00:01:58.409> these<00:01:58.500> active<00:01:59.070> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
would usually call these active and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.340 
would usually call these active and
passive<00:01:59.759> solutions<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:00.750> your<00:02:01.049> brother's

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
passive solutions so your brother's

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.230 
passive solutions so your brother's
glasses<00:02:01.799> are<00:02:01.890> active<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.729> looks<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.119> they're

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
glasses are active it looks like they're

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.639 
glasses are active it looks like they're
just<00:02:03.270> normal<00:02:03.570> glasses<00:02:03.750> right<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.409> what<00:02:04.530> they

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
just normal glasses right but what they

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.950 
just normal glasses right but what they
are<00:02:04.680> actually<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.430> LCD<00:02:05.880> screens<00:02:06.210> these

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
are actually is LCD screens these

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.540 
are actually is LCD screens these
screens<00:02:07.560> are<00:02:07.649> capable<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.160> either<00:02:08.399> being

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
screens are capable of either being

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.880 
screens are capable of either being
completely<00:02:09.090> black<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.660> being<00:02:10.410> completely

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
completely black or being completely

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.699 
completely black or being completely
clear<00:02:11.099> they<00:02:11.430> alternate

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
clear they alternate

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.970 
clear they alternate
so<00:02:13.250> one<00:02:14.150> will<00:02:14.299> be<00:02:14.390> black<00:02:14.629> and<00:02:15.109> then<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.799> will<00:02:15.890> be

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
so one will be black and then it will be

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.740 
so one will be black and then it will be
clear<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.430> then<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.120> would<00:02:17.239> black<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.689> they'd

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
clear and then it would black and they'd

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.050 
clear and then it would black and they'd
be<00:02:17.870> clear<00:02:18.079> and<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.349> is<00:02:18.500> happening

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
be clear and this is happening

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.880 
be clear and this is happening
ridiculously<00:02:20.060> fast<00:02:20.359> but<00:02:21.019> it<00:02:21.140> sends<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.680> signal

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
ridiculously fast but it sends a signal

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.360 
ridiculously fast but it sends a signal
to<00:02:22.219> your<00:02:22.310> monitor<00:02:22.659> or<00:02:23.659> your<00:02:23.810> TV<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:24.769> it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
to your monitor or your TV so that it

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.849 
to your monitor or your TV so that it
synchronizes<00:02:26.239> which<00:02:26.810> frames<00:02:27.230> are<00:02:27.530> then<00:02:27.739> on

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
synchronizes which frames are then on

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.830 
synchronizes which frames are then on
display<00:02:28.340> when<00:02:28.969> your<00:02:29.120> eyes<00:02:29.209> are<00:02:29.239> looking<00:02:29.450> at<00:02:29.689> it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
display when your eyes are looking at it

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.809 
display when your eyes are looking at it
and<00:02:29.959> it<00:02:30.409> happened<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:30.709> fast<00:02:31.159> that<00:02:31.519> as<00:02:31.609> far<00:02:31.790> as

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
and it happened so fast that as far as

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.030 
and it happened so fast that as far as
your<00:02:31.969> eyes<00:02:32.120> your<00:02:32.569> brain<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:33.019> concerned<00:02:33.170> it's

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
your eyes your brain is concerned it's

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.800 
your eyes your brain is concerned it's
seen<00:02:34.340> those<00:02:34.579> two<00:02:34.819> images<00:02:35.120> at<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.329> same<00:02:35.389> time

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
seen those two images at the same time

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.530 
seen those two images at the same time
and<00:02:36.049> it<00:02:36.349> has<00:02:36.500> then<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:36.769> effect<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.459> 3d<00:02:38.329> because

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
and it has then the effect of 3d because

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.629 
and it has then the effect of 3d because
it's<00:02:38.719> got<00:02:38.870> got<00:02:39.230> these<00:02:39.349> two<00:02:39.530> images<00:02:39.650> okay<00:02:40.219> the

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
it's got got these two images okay the

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.610 
it's got got these two images okay the
downside<00:02:41.209> is<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:41.750> obviously<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.319> do<00:02:42.439> have

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
downside is that obviously you do have

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.679 
downside is that obviously you do have
issues<00:02:42.769> with<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.189> battery<00:02:43.639> and<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:44.299> headset

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
issues with the battery and the headset

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.960 
issues with the battery and the headset
the<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.349> glasses<00:02:45.560> themselves<00:02:45.919> are<00:02:46.519> there

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
the the glasses themselves are there

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.940 
the the glasses themselves are there
about<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.659> know<00:02:47.780> typically<00:02:48.200> about<00:02:48.349> 100<00:02:48.739> quid

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
about you know typically about 100 quid

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.610 
about you know typically about 100 quid
Wow<00:02:49.430> okay<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:50.150> that's<00:02:50.599> a<00:02:50.720> lot<00:02:50.870> more<00:02:51.109> than<00:02:51.470> one

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
Wow okay so that's a lot more than one

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.559 
Wow okay so that's a lot more than one
pound<00:02:51.889> that<00:02:52.189> I<00:02:52.220> paid<00:02:52.459> for<00:02:52.639> my<00:02:52.760> plastic<00:02:53.269> one<00:02:53.450> in

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
pound that I paid for my plastic one in

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.659 
pound that I paid for my plastic one in
cinema<00:02:53.870> yeah<00:02:54.079> so<00:02:54.829> as<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:54.980> technology<00:02:55.459> we've

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:55.669 
cinema yeah so as a technology we've

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.399 
cinema yeah so as a technology we've
kind<00:02:55.879> of<00:02:55.909> moved<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.239> that<00:02:56.329> direction<00:02:56.510> but

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
kind of moved in that direction but

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.349 
kind of moved in that direction but
we're<00:02:57.709> now<00:02:57.859> moving<00:02:58.099> away<00:02:58.310> from<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.849> towards

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
we're now moving away from it towards

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.390 
we're now moving away from it towards
the<00:03:00.019> passive<00:03:00.379> solution<00:03:00.769> like<00:03:00.919> you<00:03:01.069> see<00:03:01.219> in<00:03:01.310> the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
the passive solution like you see in the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.479 
the passive solution like you see in the
cinema<00:03:01.579> now<00:03:02.030> what<00:03:02.239> these<00:03:02.419> do<00:03:02.689> is<00:03:03.159> in<00:03:04.159> order<00:03:04.400> to

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
cinema now what these do is in order to

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.530 
cinema now what these do is in order to
get<00:03:04.669> the<00:03:04.909> images<00:03:05.329> into<00:03:05.480> your<00:03:05.569> eye<00:03:07.060> both<00:03:08.060> images

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
get the images into your eye both images

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.970 
get the images into your eye both images
are<00:03:08.750> displayed<00:03:09.079> on<00:03:09.109> screen<00:03:09.469> at<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.650> same<00:03:09.709> time

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
are displayed on screen at the same time

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.670 
are displayed on screen at the same time
a<00:03:10.129> bit<00:03:10.340> like<00:03:10.519> our<00:03:10.760> our<00:03:11.060> red<00:03:11.419> and<00:03:11.450> green<00:03:11.810> picture

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
a bit like our our red and green picture

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.699 
a bit like our our red and green picture
so<00:03:13.370> these<00:03:13.819> images<00:03:14.209> are<00:03:14.329> there<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:15.349> then<00:03:15.590> the

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
so these images are there and then the

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.229 
so these images are there and then the
lenses<00:03:16.129> are<00:03:16.370> polarized

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
lenses are polarized

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.360 
lenses are polarized
in<00:03:17.329> different<00:03:17.690> directions<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.739> that<00:03:18.889> it<00:03:19.040> picks

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
in different directions so that it picks

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.640 
in different directions so that it picks
up<00:03:19.549> one<00:03:20.389> each<00:03:20.599> eye<00:03:20.780> picks<00:03:21.079> up<00:03:21.260> one<00:03:21.500> of<00:03:21.590> the

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
up one each eye picks up one of the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.879 
up one each eye picks up one of the
other<00:03:21.769> images<00:03:22.030> now<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.269> is<00:03:23.449> done<00:03:23.690> at<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.349> the

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
other images now this is done at the the

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.640 
other images now this is done at the the
cost<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.549> resolution<00:03:26.510> because<00:03:27.470> it

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
cost of resolution because it

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.369 
cost of resolution because it
essentially<00:03:28.159> interlaces<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:30.169> screen

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
essentially interlaces the the screen

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.110 
essentially interlaces the the screen
I've<00:03:30.709> always<00:03:31.040> noticed<00:03:31.220> there's<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.819> bit<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.060> a

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
I've always noticed there's a bit of a

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.059 
I've always noticed there's a bit of a
problem<00:03:32.329> like<00:03:32.840> with<00:03:32.989> brightness<00:03:33.319> with

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
problem like with brightness with
