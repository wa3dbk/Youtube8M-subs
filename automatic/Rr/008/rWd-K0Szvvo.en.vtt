letter but in the wrong place it will
turn<00:03:22.030> blue<00:03:22.960> so<00:03:23.380> we'll<00:03:23.950> put<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.220> F<00:03:24.400> in<00:03:24.640> here<00:03:24.670> in

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
turn blue so we'll put the F in here in

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.130 
turn blue so we'll put the F in here in
the<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:27.220> then<00:03:27.580> we<00:03:27.700> have<00:03:27.910> an<00:03:28.090> S<00:03:28.450> well<00:03:28.990> let's

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
the I and then we have an S well let's

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.740 
the I and then we have an S well let's
put<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.320> T<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.830> there<00:03:30.040> so<00:03:30.850> we<00:03:30.970> know<00:03:31.090> T<00:03:31.360> is<00:03:31.480> wrong

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
put a T in there so we know T is wrong

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.230 
put a T in there so we know T is wrong
it<00:03:31.960> stays<00:03:32.230> red<00:03:32.740> but<00:03:33.040> we<00:03:33.160> can<00:03:33.310> move<00:03:33.460> the<00:03:33.670> F<00:03:33.850> and

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
it stays red but we can move the F and

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.760 
it stays red but we can move the F and
when<00:03:34.660> we<00:03:34.750> do<00:03:34.990> and<00:03:35.140> it's<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.440> right<00:03:35.590> place

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
when we do and it's in the right place

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.310 
when we do and it's in the right place
it'll<00:03:36.130> turn<00:03:36.310> green<00:03:36.640> as<00:03:37.170> will<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:40.600> H

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
it'll turn green as will the I and the H
