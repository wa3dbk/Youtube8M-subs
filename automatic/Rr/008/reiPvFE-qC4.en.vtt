00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.580
 well it's him everyone of his 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.530
 fake who I hope you are well 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.630
 we find ourselves today on call of 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.100
 duty black ops 2 and wii the game that me 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.170
 rage like it's not possible but 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.730
 I still do videos on it like 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.140
 you can see it then we are in 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.610
 catching the flag I'm going to show off a 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.590
 little bit the context I planted the 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.820
 decor story of well put you in 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.150
 the atmosphere so it is catching 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.640
 flag 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.460
 what's more I arrived in the course of 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.829
 part I think at four minutes 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.230
 after the start something like that I 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.910
 So play mvc mc with I believe that 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.850
 I have to load big capes with 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.500
 wrist before that are for me 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.420
 accessories we will say indispensable 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.559
 even though I did another class with 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.149
 fast charger 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.370
 it all depends on your playing style 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.719
 and your of the number of bullets 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.250
 necessary to kill an enemy 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.320
 I know I need a lot 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.640
 given either the connection or the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.930
 game that breaks the balls 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.149
 so here I am taking care of big 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.009
 short capes now let's get to the heart of 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.079
 subject then know that I proposed I 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.780
 will offer this gameplay alongside qg and 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.329
 side cf although I have more than 5000 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.310
 subscribers I do not know if it will play I 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.569
 do not know if that's going to make sure that the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.219
 gameplay is not accepted because 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:21.649
 I was told that qg do not agree 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.179
 youtuber over 5000 subscribers 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.639
 so I hope they will take when 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.869
 even good we'll see anyway so 

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:28.549
 it's a very big gameplay 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.079
 as much as you immediately steal the 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.270
 ways it's in the title here's double 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.920
 dog in catch of the flag I would not have 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.149
 put in the course of the game but here I am 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.490
 you say it's in the middle of the game 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.229
 I arrive and I do double dog when 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.509
 same and with a catch of the flag 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.279
 it's not necessarily obvious I do not know 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.419
 if there are many who have already done so 

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:45.799
 me in any case it's the first time 

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:47.179
 is what is interesting is that 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.929
 it was because of which the first 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.700
 part of the day 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.899
 so that's something that happens to me 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.609
 often right now it's that I'm going 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.079
 do all day parts 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.340
 shit but the first I would have done 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.829
 will always be the best 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.500
 I always want to do more than 30 or 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.150
 less than 30 they for example 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.970
 in four hours of the flag or so 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.620
 more than 40 pounds in domination or 50 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.720
 even nominated here it depends I 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.200
 will always do the best part 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.000
 of my day 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.230
 as soon as I wake up it's always 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.300
 like that here it is today I 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.940
 not working happily and it's this 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.470
 who will do that I will go free I will I 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.780
 am going to make a sick score and you 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.700
 have you are going to see it anyway 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.800
 in short this being said let's move on now 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.730
 about the video because I think 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.220
 that there are many who clicked 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.940
 above especially for the subject and the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.940
 title then youtube is in decay 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.200
 for me today because the number 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.760
 of declining views I speak not only 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.650
 from my chair I talk about a lot of 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.489
 youtuber ladies there are some who have more than 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.040
 1000 subscribers or 2000 and it barely takes 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.530
 500 video views not even me it's the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.850
 case for the for some videos those 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.110
 which work best so the jt of 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.580
 gamer the 20h of code 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.800
 on that there is no problem I do 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.380
 always a thousand or even 2000 seen even more 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.489
 sometimes for some but other than that 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.410
 for the rest all they were going 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.280
 orders tari the debates things 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.390
 like that it's things that are 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.709
 interesting and that's the worst 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.690
 but that's just down 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.160
 and that's something I do not understand 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.750
 today so maybe that the 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.340
 community who were following us at the beginning has 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.110
 grown up maybe she has something else to 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.739
 today make this there that a 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.570
 girlfriend 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.470
 they may live in their 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.000
 apartment which they may have 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.549
 things to handle whatever it is 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.110
 insurance pass the license just like 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.940
 that's finally I'm inventing things but it's 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.350
 things that can prevent you from being 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.850
 active on youtube and there are some who have 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.130
 outright let go sam it may be for 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.120
 that today the number of views and 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.760
 the number of activities 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.950
 that's what I say there is a 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.780
 word for that we will say the number 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.000
 of activities drop here I do not find it 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.220
 really the exact word but there is a 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.900
 sharp drop in activity on youtube for 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.519
 most youtuber the only ones who 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.340
 walking today it's still the 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.620
 podcasters like cyprien norman hugo 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.830
 all alone and all his cd alone that works 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.910
 still really and 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.160
 this is a shame because 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.950
 that frankly of my debut I 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.380
 were doing more sight and I was proposing a 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.940
 work less of less good quality and 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.110
 today that I manage to propose 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.490
 something qualities that my 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.750
 friend tahri has greatly improved 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.520
 compared to compared to my debut 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.950
 I think everyone will agree 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.390
 with me all the youtuber that starts 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.960
 do not necessarily order tahri 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.450
 great qualities and as soon as we start 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.560
 really to be comfortable and that's the 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.060
 number of views drops and that's really 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.930
 pity 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.609
 it's a shame so it's something that I 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.989
 unfortunately and I can not 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.450
 that I can not do anything 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.830
 the more that's why not bad 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.480
 unfortunately can not do it big 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.130
 thing in any case so frankly me 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.810
 I hope you will stay active enough 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.820
 long time for those who still stay 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.480
 here I do not know if this video will be seen 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.580
 by everybody 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.350
 I hope that will be the case but hey 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.030
 this is not a code drummer it's 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.700
 it's not a buzz video of my 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.020
 chain let's say so here I am I 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.880
 do not think she will make her views that 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.140
 would surprise me anyway but if that 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.250
 could be the case here is a small 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.520
 triple home screen 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.080
 in the end with the star I come back from a 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.580
 video gameplay with a killcam then 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.940
 on the other hand you will see that this is the mode 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.100
 studio 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.419
 of course I said you will see that I 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.160
 there is no calm kit in the mode 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.510
 studio it's weird I had never 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.830
 noticed until now I'm doing 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.540
 never catch the flag in fact my 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.770
 classes and a pond I put myself and 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.790
 I noticed that there was no 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.670
 of someone but the pass we are 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.770
 watch 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.330
 shows us something that is useless 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.740
 so I was trying to display the score 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.410
 story to put you something 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.740
 under the nose but it does not change big 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.930
 thing 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.910
 finally short so here it was the little 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.170
 anecdote there are not a few souls in the 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.340
 studio mode flag capture 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.070
 short so what should be remembered in 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.090
 any case of this video is that 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.190
 today I do not know if it's 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.720
 really profitable to embark on 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.940
 Youtube 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.110
 I was lucky everything is relative but 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.870
 I had the chance to say 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.030
 start limit limit that is to say at 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.800
 when it was still possible to 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.210
 to make known and today 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.730
 frankly apart by proposing 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.170
 content of enormous qualities I do not know 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.580
 if it will be possible to 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.690
 know 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.550
 personally I doubt one I want 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.780
 to say here is someone who has a big 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.090
 youtuber who starts again a chain 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.350
 again it is possible because here it is 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.720
 already has some community but 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.520
 someone who directly launches me 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.780
 not think it is possible that in 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.390
 anyway it's my personal opinion in 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.790
 it would surprise me apart from what already 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.170
 we already have a lot of subscribers 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.880
 as in plaid for example years he 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.590
 launched in December and is already at 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.290
 more than thirty thousand subscribers because he 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.640
 was proposing something frankly 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.440
 excellent what that's what made it 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.380
 knew so today this is I do not 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.400
 do not know if it's really I do not know 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.230
 not really what should be done 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.660
 will say so that subscribers remain 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.920
 even more active not even they
