00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.960
 Speak there, beauty, who spoke 'no 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.720
 today we are here to bring a video 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.210
 from gta5 and how I told you I'm 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.699
 starting the series here will not be missions 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.529
 it will be easter egg 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.970
 oeiras and the like 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.039
 In this first video here you are 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.259
 Seeing that I 'm on top of a train that 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.449
 I found I found this train is in 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.309
 movement with which to run after him 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.690
 I think it's a bit strange. 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.280
 would probably not be able to climb 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.920
 would fall over 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.360
 But I finally got on it and you 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.070
 will see that in that first part that I 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.680
 I'll show you a little of the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.729
 gta5 landscape face it's a thing 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.229
 very cool 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.780
 You must be noticing that I am. 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.610
 narrating over the video I recorded the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.589
 video leaves a long time recording 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.089
 knowing the map and such 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.040
 so what I did a selection of 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.350
 best parts are going to show you 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.510
 Look what the fuck, man, this part of you. 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.619
 passing over a bridge looks like 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.260
 Image 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:06.340
 the lake lounges further along it 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.100
 fuck face 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.289
 the scenery of gta 5 is a very 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.420
 fantastic and you see that I'm there 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.939
 With the clover on the head unlock it 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.159
 I put a smart outfit on it 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.469
 Funny that suit on his pants 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.780
 it was short then it appears to 6 of the car 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:25.719
 and if you have a set that you buy one 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.719
 store this blue set already I cut 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.159
 do not let his hair get any bigger 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.749
 I cut so you cut but actually 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.659
 You can increase your hair a little 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:36.759
 diminished increased a little I put this 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.700
 black beard he looks a lot like that 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.740
 with that game face kane and lynch 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.960
 For who knows, you will know what I am. 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.109
 speaking it is very similar to the 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.990
 car glasses not so much but in the way 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.579
 so the face hair is very much the same 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.380
 You'll see that I 'm passing by train. 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.590
 and later on here you will see what 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.049
 I found it very expensive 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.579
 passing by train and I found this 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.459
 here stay connected 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.560
 Look how I told you we'll pass. 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:09.039
 and on the train and look only behind 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.539
 Look, I saw there something pink then. 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.910
 I thought it might be an easter egg 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.790
 I threw myself off the train locally, I do not think 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.180
 I'm going to run there with my 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.459
 kakÃ¡ 47 we will not see 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.469
 what a beauty face was very by chance 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.480
 just looking back 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.670
 I suddenly found this one 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.430
 easter egg I do not know if everyone already 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.620

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.540

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.560

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.900
