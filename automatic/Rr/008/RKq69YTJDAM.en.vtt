my<00:02:46.930> painting<00:02:47.380> up<00:02:47.500> possibly<00:02:48.370> not<00:02:48.579> even<00:02:48.850> talking

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
my painting up possibly not even talking

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.520 
my painting up possibly not even talking
to<00:02:49.269> us<00:02:49.329> which<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.720> luxury<00:02:50.109> you<00:02:50.230> can<00:02:50.380> only

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
to us which is a luxury you can only

to us which is a luxury you can only
have<00:02:50.859> after<00:02:51.190> you've<00:02:51.760> already<00:02:51.820> talked<00:02:52.180> about

have after you've already talked about

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.770 
have after you've already talked about
everything<00:02:52.600> that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.840 

I<00:02:57.960> think<00:02:58.960> one<00:02:59.350> of<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.500> most<00:02:59.590> inspiring<00:03:00.400> things

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
I think one of the most inspiring things

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.910 
I think one of the most inspiring things
about<00:03:01.030> traveling<00:03:01.240> is<00:03:01.630> leaving<00:03:02.470> where<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.770> are

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
about traveling is leaving where you are

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.550 
about traveling is leaving where you are
and<00:03:03.190> coming<00:03:04.060> back<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.750> where<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.020> are<00:03:05.110> with

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
and coming back to where you are with

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.430 
and coming back to where you are with
the<00:03:06.370> experience<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:07.000> whatever<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.510> just<00:03:07.540> been

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
the experience of whatever you just been

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.990 
the experience of whatever you just been
through<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.250> almost<00:03:09.550> doesn't<00:03:09.850> matter

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
through and it almost doesn't matter

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:24.670 
through and it almost doesn't matter
where<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:10.420> go<00:03:10.570> it's<00:03:10.960> just<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.440> go

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.739
