an<00:00:33.239> earring<00:00:35.120> some<00:00:36.120> lace<00:00:36.620> which<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.710> probably

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
an earring some lace which I probably

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.170 
an earring some lace which I probably
could<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.129> done<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.309> shorter<00:00:38.730> list<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.090> I've

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
could have done a shorter list but I've

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.880 
could have done a shorter list but I've
done<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.450> one<00:00:39.660> anyway<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.559> more<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
done this one anyway so it's more like a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.049 
done this one anyway so it's more like a
little<00:00:41.700> wedding<00:00:41.940> dress<00:00:42.420> type<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.170> thing<00:00:44.059> there

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
little wedding dress type of thing there

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.610 
little wedding dress type of thing there
for<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.300> bridesmaid<00:00:45.750> bridesmaid<00:00:46.230> dress<00:00:46.469> or

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
for the bridesmaid bridesmaid dress or

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.340 
for the bridesmaid bridesmaid dress or
something<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:47.430> I'll<00:00:47.700> call<00:00:47.910> it

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
something like that I think I'll call it

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.470 
something like that I think I'll call it
but<00:00:49.350> what<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.530> liked<00:00:49.770> by<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.100> was<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.940> Cod

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
but what I liked by it was it's the Cod

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.689 
but what I liked by it was it's the Cod
it<00:00:52.379> didn't<00:00:52.680> look<00:00:52.739> bulky<00:00:53.010> or<00:00:53.250> anything<00:00:53.489> like

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
it didn't look bulky or anything like

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.020 
it didn't look bulky or anything like
that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
that

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.750 
that
and<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> was<00:00:54.840> perfect<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.430> doing<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.550> little

a white twisted wire glued onto a disc a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
a white twisted wire glued onto a disc a
little<00:01:31.920> bit<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.130> lace<00:01:32.250> round<00:01:32.610> got<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> little

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
little bit of lace round got a little

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.480

cushion<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.450> put<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.229> might<00:01:35.070> set<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
cushion to put on there I might set the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.010

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
back off and do a higher back one I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.899 
back off and do a higher back one I
think<00:01:37.140> I'll<00:01:37.500> do<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.920> because<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.460> found<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
think I'll do that because I found the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.780 
think I'll do that because I found the
back<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.479> too<00:01:39.659> sharp<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> did<00:01:41.759> a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
back to be too sharp and then I did a

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.819 
back to be too sharp and then I did a
little<00:01:42.000> bit<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.360> decoration<00:01:42.810> that's<00:01:43.590> going
