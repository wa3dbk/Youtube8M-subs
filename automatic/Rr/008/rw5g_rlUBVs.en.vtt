00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.070
 so hello again to the channel to helium 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.560
 Mihalych Achinsk Here is another video 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:26.039
 continuation of the swaz gazelle on this 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:28.220
 the moment already made those frameworks we are in this 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.270
 moment happens 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.550
 pasting engine compartment 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.430
 outside 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:57.690
 stepashkoy here and so it all 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:59.690
 looks took for bow motor 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.100
 compartment 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.100
 here so here clever engine compartment 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:19.970
 this pocket shrank a little bit 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:25.060
 big was the front beam 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:28.460
 with preparing simple arches like hands 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.149
 brought her forward raspberry to move 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.810
 easier to start 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.810
 in place became 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.180
 but here, in principle, all the same remains 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.870
 such here 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.890
 then you see a talker 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.890
 from an ordinary channel 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.800
 because it looks 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.990
 and powerfully of the fact that rome is right 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.410
 attack the beam from the business with gazelle needed 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.070
 some flimsy order ordered and 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:19.950
 we will not leave it because it is thin 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:24.650
 so here it is now for forgiveness and 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.650
 help don't be happy 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.290
 so she looks 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.310
 all seams are welded 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.210
 the same beam was made back 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.180
 under the box 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:59.290
 also from the channel something to me already 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:03:04.750
 painted dry lie in the moment 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.750
 glued over engine not compartment 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.670
 here and 3 part 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.739
 I thought so 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.739
 here, too, everything is taped 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:45.300
 so here is a radiator was bought 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.110
 mount 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:05:01.139
 made under the radiator under the fan then 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:04.479
 there is another but also a plus fortification 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:10.590
 the bounds of which will already be on the car 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:10.590
 mounted also already painted from the corner 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.069
 to look like 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.590
 soon it will collect all
