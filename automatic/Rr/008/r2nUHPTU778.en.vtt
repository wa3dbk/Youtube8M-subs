this<00:03:01.350> it's<00:03:01.530> extremely<00:03:02.100> light<00:03:02.340> it's<00:03:02.970> got<00:03:03.239> a

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
this it's extremely light it's got a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.059 
this it's extremely light it's got a
little<00:03:03.660> kind<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.200> band<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.709> top<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.980> your

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
little kind of band for the top of your

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.440 
little kind of band for the top of your
head<00:03:05.190> right<00:03:05.220> here<00:03:05.400> which<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.760> like<00:03:05.940> God<00:03:06.239> it's

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
head right here which is like God it's

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.059 
head right here which is like God it's
really<00:03:06.900> soft<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.350> cushiony<00:03:07.590> it's<00:03:07.860> kind<00:03:08.010> of

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
really soft and cushiony it's kind of

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.770 
really soft and cushiony it's kind of
feel<00:03:08.580> like<00:03:08.610> foam<00:03:08.940> may<00:03:09.180> be<00:03:09.239> wrapped<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.660> like<00:03:09.750> a

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
feel like foam may be wrapped in like a

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.640 
feel like foam may be wrapped in like a
synthetic<00:03:10.069> I<00:03:11.069> guess<00:03:12.000> like<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> leathery

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
synthetic I guess like a leathery

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.590 
synthetic I guess like a leathery
material<00:03:13.650> but<00:03:14.280> um<00:03:14.459> yeah<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.209> extremely

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
material but um yeah the extremely

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.800 
material but um yeah the extremely
extremely<00:03:15.989> light<00:03:16.260> headset<00:03:17.239> it's<00:03:18.239> got<00:03:18.510> as<00:03:18.750> you

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
extremely light headset it's got as you

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.930 
extremely light headset it's got as you
can<00:03:19.019> see<00:03:19.260> like<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.560> mesh<00:03:20.010> around<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.730> ears

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
can see like a mesh around the ears

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.190 
can see like a mesh around the ears
hopefully<00:03:21.359> it's<00:03:21.480> really<00:03:21.690> comfortable<00:03:22.049> the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
hopefully it's really comfortable the

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.840 
hopefully it's really comfortable the
only<00:03:22.500> thing<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.739> will<00:03:22.890> say<00:03:22.920> about<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.250> x12<00:03:23.730> that

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
only thing I will say about the x12 that

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.670 
only thing I will say about the x12 that
I've<00:03:23.910> been<00:03:23.970> using<00:03:24.150> forever<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:25.290> although

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
I've been using forever is that although

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.380 
I've been using forever is that although
they're<00:03:25.859> great<00:03:26.100> audio<00:03:26.489> wise<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.060> they<00:03:27.150> work

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
they're great audio wise and they work

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.509 
they're great audio wise and they work
well<00:03:27.600> functionality<00:03:28.230> wise<00:03:28.380> for<00:03:28.950> some<00:03:29.100> reason

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
well functionality wise for some reason

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.160 
well functionality wise for some reason
they<00:03:29.700> are<00:03:29.730> they<00:03:30.060> bug<00:03:30.269> my<00:03:30.450> head<00:03:30.660> after<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.989> while

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
they are they bug my head after a while

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.360 
they are they bug my head after a while
so<00:03:31.440> I'm<00:03:31.560> hoping<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:31.980> these<00:03:32.070> will<00:03:32.250> be<00:03:32.340> a

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
so I'm hoping that these will be a

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.860 
so I'm hoping that these will be a
little<00:03:32.730> bit<00:03:32.820> better<00:03:32.970> they<00:03:33.420> are<00:03:33.570> again<00:03:33.840> a

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
little bit better they are again a

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.240 
little bit better they are again a
little<00:03:34.079> more<00:03:34.260> expensive<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.920> think<00:03:34.980> that

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
little more expensive but I think that

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.890 
little more expensive but I think that
these<00:03:35.340> would<00:03:35.489> be<00:03:35.519> kind<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.910> comparable<00:03:36.329> to

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
these would be kind of comparable to

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.080 
these would be kind of comparable to
where<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.079> X<00:03:37.230> 12s<00:03:37.680> were<00:03:37.859> for<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.430> Xbox<00:03:38.820> 360

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
where the X 12s were for the Xbox 360

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.720 
where the X 12s were for the Xbox 360
console<00:03:39.840> on<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.739> side<00:03:40.920> we've<00:03:41.100> got<00:03:41.130> just<00:03:41.400> XO

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
console on this side we've got just XO

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.789 
console on this side we've got just XO
one<00:03:41.940> ear<00:03:42.180> force<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.780> side<00:03:42.989> XO<00:03:43.350> one<00:03:43.470> ear<00:03:43.590> force

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
one ear force this side XO one ear force

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.590 
one ear force this side XO one ear force
as<00:03:43.980> well<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.489> then<00:03:44.820> again<00:03:45.030> on<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.150> top<00:03:45.359> we've

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
as well and then again on the top we've

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.210 
as well and then again on the top we've
got<00:03:45.780> just<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.109> little<00:03:46.140> turtlebeach<00:03:46.709> branding

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
got just a little turtlebeach branding

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.460 
got just a little turtlebeach branding

I'm actually kind of stoked then you can
take<00:03:51.180> off<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.660> mic<00:03:51.870> if<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.140> just<00:03:52.320> want<00:03:52.500> to

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.430 
have the headset on and don't want the
mic<00:03:53.940> oops<00:03:54.329> that's<00:03:54.480> something<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:54.810> have<00:03:55.350> the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
mic oops that's something like have the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.780 
mic oops that's something like have the
mic<00:03:55.680> dangling<00:03:56.040> around<00:03:56.160> but<00:03:56.489> again<00:03:56.670> the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
mic dangling around but again the

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.030 
mic dangling around but again the
Michael<00:03:57.090> basically<00:03:57.480> just<00:03:57.660> plug<00:03:57.989> in<00:03:58.290> right

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
Michael basically just plug in right

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.430 
Michael basically just plug in right
here<00:03:59.430> like<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.359> then<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.959> mic<00:04:01.109> is<00:04:01.260> in

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
here like that and then the mic is in

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.380 
here like that and then the mic is in
and<00:04:01.620> you've<00:04:01.709> got<00:04:01.859> that<00:04:02.069> mesh<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:03.000> yeah<00:04:03.299> I'm

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
and you've got that mesh so yeah I'm

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.849 
and you've got that mesh so yeah I'm
really<00:04:03.569> excited<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:04.140> will<00:04:04.319> actually<00:04:04.470> be<00:04:04.739> doing

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
really excited I will actually be doing

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.890 
really excited I will actually be doing
probably<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.400> quality<00:04:05.910> or<00:04:06.090> audio<00:04:06.420> test<00:04:06.750> of

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
probably a quality or audio test of

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.099 
probably a quality or audio test of
these<00:04:06.989> guys<00:04:07.760> that<00:04:08.760> way<00:04:08.880> you<00:04:08.940> can<00:04:09.150> hear<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.870> I

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
these guys that way you can hear and I

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.599 
these guys that way you can hear and I
might<00:04:10.290> even<00:04:10.380> compare<00:04:10.829> them<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.100> x12<00:04:11.489> to

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
might even compare them to the x12 to

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:12.819 
might even compare them to the x12 to
see<00:04:11.730> if<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.880> mic<00:04:12.060> has<00:04:12.239> any<00:04:12.480> known

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
see if the mic has any known

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.410 
see if the mic has any known
improvements<00:04:13.829> and<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.310> actually<00:04:14.489> will<00:04:14.819> more

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
improvements and I actually will more

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.270 
improvements and I actually will more
than<00:04:15.540> likely<00:04:15.720> do<00:04:16.229> a<00:04:16.260> comparison<00:04:16.769> between<00:04:16.950> this

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
than likely do a comparison between this

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.920 
than likely do a comparison between this
and<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.489> X<00:04:17.639> 12s<00:04:18.000> in<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.120> future<00:04:18.389> video<00:04:18.510> so<00:04:18.690> be

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
and the X 12s in a future video so be

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.330 
and the X 12s in a future video so be
looking<00:04:19.049> for<00:04:19.200> that<00:04:19.320> links<00:04:20.039> will<00:04:20.160> be<00:04:20.190> in<00:04:20.280> the

looking for that links will be in the
