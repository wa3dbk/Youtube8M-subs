00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.609 
I can move them towards me that's not
really<00:00:16.330> what<00:00:16.449> I<00:00:16.480> have<00:00:16.720> in<00:00:16.840> mind<00:00:16.990> by<00:00:17.170> handlebar

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
really what I have in mind by handlebar

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.109 
really what I have in mind by handlebar
adjustment<00:00:18.070> that's<00:00:18.190> stem<00:00:18.550> adjustment

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
adjustment that's stem adjustment

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.120 
adjustment that's stem adjustment
adjusting<00:00:20.080> the<00:00:20.170> length<00:00:20.350> of<00:00:20.560> this<00:00:20.710> the<00:00:20.920> height

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
adjusting the length of this the height

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.189 
adjusting the length of this the height
of<00:00:21.280> this<00:00:21.400> but<00:00:22.150> you<00:00:22.420> probably<00:00:22.660> didn't<00:00:23.080> know

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
of this but you probably didn't know

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.660 
of this but you probably didn't know
that<00:00:23.380> you<00:00:23.440> can<00:00:23.619> actually<00:00:23.830> adjust<00:00:24.279> these

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
that you can actually adjust these

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.279 
that you can actually adjust these
handlebars<00:00:25.210> to<00:00:25.570> make<00:00:25.720> your<00:00:25.900> fit<00:00:26.080> on<00:00:26.199> the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
handlebars to make your fit on the

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.080 
handlebars to make your fit on the
bicycle<00:00:26.770> a<00:00:26.860> little<00:00:27.070> bit<00:00:27.190> more<00:00:27.340> comfortable<00:00:27.880> a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
bicycle a little bit more comfortable a

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.060 
bicycle a little bit more comfortable a
lot<00:00:28.600> of<00:00:28.750> people<00:00:28.960> don't<00:00:29.109> know<00:00:29.289> about<00:00:29.440> that<00:00:29.800> and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
lot of people don't know about that and

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.819 
lot of people don't know about that and
that<00:00:30.939> causes<00:00:31.210> some<00:00:31.510> problems<00:00:31.930> with<00:00:32.109> how<00:00:32.619> their

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
that causes some problems with how their

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.950 
that causes some problems with how their
hands<00:00:33.219> feel<00:00:33.430> their<00:00:33.760> wrists<00:00:34.179> their<00:00:34.359> forearms

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
hands feel their wrists their forearms

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.349 
hands feel their wrists their forearms
that<00:00:35.170> kind<00:00:35.440> of<00:00:35.530> thing<00:00:35.710> so<00:00:36.579> let's<00:00:37.030> just<00:00:37.210> take<00:00:37.300> a

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:37.359 
that kind of thing so let's just take a

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:38.729 
that kind of thing so let's just take a
closer<00:00:37.659> look<00:00:37.780> at<00:00:38.050> this<00:00:38.170> and<00:00:38.229> see<00:00:38.469> what<00:00:38.620> we

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
closer look at this and see what we

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.529 
closer look at this and see what we
might<00:00:38.920> be<00:00:39.069> able<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.309> do<00:00:39.519> here<00:00:40.059> we<00:00:40.210> are<00:00:40.239> looking

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
might be able to do here we are looking

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.709 
might be able to do here we are looking
at<00:00:40.659> the<00:00:40.780> handlebars<00:00:41.229> from<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.559> side<00:00:42.719> you

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
at the handlebars from the side you

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.180 
at the handlebars from the side you
probably<00:00:43.929> are<00:00:44.229> aware<00:00:44.379> that<00:00:44.440> handlebars<00:00:44.979> come

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
probably are aware that handlebars come

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.829 
probably are aware that handlebars come
in<00:00:45.280> different<00:00:45.550> widths<00:00:45.729> you<00:00:46.359> want<00:00:46.569> to<00:00:46.659> choose

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
in different widths you want to choose

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.110 
in different widths you want to choose
with<00:00:47.229> the<00:00:47.949> corresponds<00:00:48.609> to<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.850> width<00:00:49.030> of

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
with the corresponds to the width of

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.029 
with the corresponds to the width of
your<00:00:49.179> shoulders<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:50.350> that<00:00:50.499> your<00:00:50.620> arms<00:00:50.920> are

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
your shoulders so that your arms are

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.219 
your shoulders so that your arms are
essentially<00:00:51.549> parallel<00:00:52.179> when<00:00:52.839> you're<00:00:52.989> on<00:00:53.109> the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
essentially parallel when you're on the

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.709 
essentially parallel when you're on the
bike<00:00:53.429> but<00:00:54.429> handlebars<00:00:54.940> also<00:00:55.420> come<00:00:55.690> with

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
bike but handlebars also come with

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.860 
bike but handlebars also come with
varying<00:00:56.379> drop<00:00:57.129> which<00:00:58.059> is<00:00:58.269> this<00:00:58.600> distance

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
varying drop which is this distance

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.520 
varying drop which is this distance
right<00:00:59.319> here<00:00:59.739> and<00:00:59.920> reach<00:01:00.699> which<00:01:01.329> is<00:01:01.569> this

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
right here and reach which is this

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.310 
right here and reach which is this
distance<00:01:03.039> right<00:01:03.249> here<00:01:03.629> now<00:01:04.629> obviously<00:01:05.080> if<00:01:05.229> you

have smaller hands you're going to want

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.420 
have smaller hands you're going to want
to<00:01:06.850> use<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.450> handlebar<00:01:07.900> that<00:01:08.050> has<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.430> smaller

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
to use a handlebar that has a smaller

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.880 
to use a handlebar that has a smaller
drop<00:01:09.850> in<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.150> shorter<00:01:10.510> reach<00:01:10.750> on<00:01:10.990> our<00:01:11.650> tarry

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
drop in a shorter reach on our tarry

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.250 
drop in a shorter reach on our tarry
bicycles<00:01:12.550> we<00:01:12.790> use<00:01:12.970> salsa<00:01:13.270> short<00:01:13.900> and<00:01:14.080> shallow

take a straight edge like this and put

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.990 
take a straight edge like this and put
it<00:01:44.200> on<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.470> flat<00:01:44.710> part<00:01:45.040> of<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.220> bar<00:01:45.430> here<00:01:45.880> and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
it on the flat part of the bar here and

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.380 
it on the flat part of the bar here and
it<00:01:46.930> should<00:01:47.200> just<00:01:47.890> touch<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.610> tip<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.060> the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
it should just touch the tip of the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.380 
it should just touch the tip of the
brake<00:01:49.570> lever<00:01:50.010> now<00:01:51.010> let's<00:01:51.760> be<00:01:51.909> honest<00:01:52.240> these

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
brake lever now let's be honest these

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.270 
brake lever now let's be honest these
brake<00:01:52.600> levers<00:01:52.960> come<00:01:53.170> in<00:01:53.350> different<00:01:53.920> sizes

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
brake levers come in different sizes

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.890 
brake levers come in different sizes
they'll<00:01:54.790> vary<00:01:55.030> a<00:01:55.150> little<00:01:55.270> bit<00:01:55.390> depending<00:01:55.510> on

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
they'll vary a little bit depending on

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.540 
they'll vary a little bit depending on
manufacturer<00:01:56.440> so<00:01:56.830> this<00:01:56.980> is<00:01:57.100> just<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.370> rough

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
manufacturer so this is just a rough

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.820 
manufacturer so this is just a rough
guide<00:01:57.850> but<00:01:58.840> if<00:01:58.960> you<00:01:59.110> should<00:01:59.290> do<00:01:59.409> this<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.710> your

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
guide but if you should do this on your

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.830 
guide but if you should do this on your
own<00:01:59.890> bike<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.460> find<00:02:00.640> it<00:02:00.820> your<00:02:01.090> brake<00:02:01.330> lever<00:02:01.540> is

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
own bike and find it your brake lever is

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.230 
own bike and find it your brake lever is
really<00:02:02.409> out<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.620> whack<00:02:02.800> you<00:02:03.310> might<00:02:03.940> want<00:02:04.180> to

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
really out of whack you might want to

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.730 
really out of whack you might want to
take<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.540> back<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.930> shop<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:05.170> ask<00:02:05.530> them<00:02:05.710> to

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.999 
take it back to the shop and ask them to
look<00:02:05.979> at<00:02:06.130> positioning<00:02:07.030> this<00:02:07.150> properly<00:02:08.009> now

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
look at positioning this properly now

look at actually rotating the handlebars
within<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.319> stem<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.769> this

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
within the stem and this

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.860 
within the stem and this
where<00:02:15.219> we're<00:02:15.370> going<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.549> fix<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.359> lot<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.599> those

bolts you may have a bolt on the

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.559 
bolts you may have a bolt on the
backside<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.859> stem<00:02:48.099> just<00:02:48.370> take<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> look<00:02:49.359> at

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
backside of the stem just take a look at

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.030 
backside of the stem just take a look at
it<00:02:49.719> you<00:02:49.810> can<00:02:49.840> figure<00:02:50.200> out<00:02:50.349> pretty<00:02:50.530> quickly<00:02:50.799> how

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
it you can figure out pretty quickly how

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.580 
it you can figure out pretty quickly how
to<00:02:51.069> do<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.689> here<00:02:52.689> I've<00:02:52.810> got<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.109> handlebars

to do it here I've got the handlebars

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.589 
to do it here I've got the handlebars
adjusted<00:02:54.219> so<00:02:54.400> they're<00:02:54.669> pretty<00:02:54.849> much<00:02:55.060> flat<00:02:55.389> up

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
adjusted so they're pretty much flat up

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.449 
adjusted so they're pretty much flat up
here<00:02:55.629> this<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.709> one<00:02:56.859> of<00:02:56.889> the<00:02:57.069> extreme

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
here this is one of the extreme

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.759 
here this is one of the extreme
positions<00:02:57.939> now<00:02:58.510> what's<00:02:59.169> the<00:02:59.349> nice<00:02:59.530> thing

a little more air on your bike you're

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.939 
a little more air on your bike you're
kind<00:03:21.639> of<00:03:21.759> doing<00:03:22.419> this<00:03:22.659> to<00:03:23.319> get<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.739> brake

levers and that can be kind of tiring
and<00:03:26.829> annoying<00:03:26.919> after<00:03:27.459> a<00:03:27.669> while<00:03:28.259> so<00:03:29.259> you<00:03:29.290> say<00:03:29.560> to

yourself you know
let<00:03:30.669> me<00:03:30.759> give<00:03:30.909> up<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.150> little<00:03:31.359> bit<00:03:31.540> of<00:03:31.629> this<00:03:31.810> for

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
let me give up a little bit of this for

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.420 
let me give up a little bit of this for
a<00:03:32.109> little<00:03:32.259> bit<00:03:32.439> more<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.739> this<00:03:32.889> and<00:03:33.220> you<00:03:33.280> would

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
a little bit more of this and you would

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.249 
a little bit more of this and you would
do<00:03:33.549> that<00:03:33.729> by<00:03:33.790> rotating<00:03:34.449> the<00:03:34.689> bars<00:03:34.900> down<00:03:35.229> a

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:35.259 
do that by rotating the bars down a

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:37.259 
do that by rotating the bars down a
little<00:03:35.500> bit<00:03:35.739> now<00:03:36.459> you've<00:03:36.699> moved<00:03:36.879> the<00:03:37.030> hoods

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
little bit now you've moved the hoods

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.509 
little bit now you've moved the hoods
down<00:03:37.540> you're<00:03:38.409> introducing<00:03:39.069> more<00:03:39.280> of<00:03:39.430> a

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
down you're introducing more of a

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.789 
down you're introducing more of a
straight<00:03:39.939> position<00:03:40.509> rather<00:03:40.720> than<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.049> natural

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
straight position rather than a natural

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.550 
straight position rather than a natural
bent<00:03:42.579> position<00:03:42.849> to<00:03:43.299> your<00:03:43.419> wrist<00:03:43.720> but<00:03:44.349> you're

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
bent position to your wrist but you're

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.740 
bent position to your wrist but you're
buying<00:03:44.859> some<00:03:45.250> really<00:03:45.819> nice<00:03:46.060> feeling<00:03:46.540> when

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
buying some really nice feeling when

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.199 
buying some really nice feeling when
you're<00:03:46.989> down<00:03:47.169> here<00:03:47.439> in<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.620> drops<00:03:47.919> I<00:03:48.310> think

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
you're down here in the drops I think

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.789 
you're down here in the drops I think
what<00:03:49.359> you<00:03:49.449> need<00:03:49.479> to<00:03:49.720> do<00:03:49.840> as<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:49.989> rider<00:03:50.290> is<00:03:50.620> to

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
what you need to do as a rider is to

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.159 
what you need to do as a rider is to
assess<00:03:51.189> how<00:03:51.790> much<00:03:51.970> of<00:03:52.090> my<00:03:52.209> time<00:03:52.449> do<00:03:52.659> I<00:03:52.689> spend<00:03:52.989> up

here how much of my time do I spend down

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.890 
here how much of my time do I spend down
here<00:03:56.049> how<00:03:56.769> much<00:03:56.949> comfort<00:03:57.280> do<00:03:57.549> I<00:03:57.609> want<00:03:57.969> how<00:03:58.719> much

here how much comfort do I want how much

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.959 
here how much comfort do I want how much
comfort<00:03:59.139> do<00:03:59.409> I<00:03:59.439> want<00:03:59.739> here<00:04:00.129> and<00:04:00.280> then<00:04:00.759> make

comfort do I want here and then make

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.610 
comfort do I want here and then make
those<00:04:01.209> trade-offs<00:04:01.599> and<00:04:02.109> try<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.439> come<00:04:02.590> up

those trade-offs and try and come up

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.219 
those trade-offs and try and come up
with<00:04:02.739> an<00:04:03.009> optimum<00:04:03.549> position<00:04:04.090> by<00:04:04.659> making<00:04:05.079> this

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229 
with an optimum position by making this

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.249 
with an optimum position by making this
rotation<00:04:06.180> it's<00:04:07.180> really<00:04:07.509> simple<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.959> lot<00:04:08.199> of

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:08.259 
rotation it's really simple a lot of

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:10.619 
rotation it's really simple a lot of
people<00:04:08.620> never<00:04:08.829> think<00:04:09.189> about<00:04:09.519> it<00:04:09.729> they<00:04:10.299> go<00:04:10.449> on

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
people never think about it they go on

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.449 
people never think about it they go on

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
wrists maybe they're riding back here

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:15.749 
wrists maybe they're riding back here
anywhere<00:04:14.829> but<00:04:15.039> here<00:04:15.310> because<00:04:15.430> they<00:04:15.609> just

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:15.759 
anywhere but here because they just
