reproductions<00:00:56.940> videos<00:00:57.239> i'm<00:00:57.479> not<00:00:57.600> sure<00:00:57.720> if

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
reproductions videos i'm not sure if

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.360 
reproductions videos i'm not sure if
that<00:00:57.839> works<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.409> we<00:00:58.440> relaxed<00:00:58.890> which<00:00:59.040> it<00:00:59.220> does

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
that works but we relaxed which it does

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.640 
that works but we relaxed which it does
work<00:00:59.610> like<00:01:00.239> whenever<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.720> zombie<00:01:01.080> is<00:01:01.110> at<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
work like whenever the zombie is at the

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.380 
work like whenever the zombie is at the
window<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:01.979> see<00:01:02.159> him<00:01:02.370> right<00:01:02.519> there<00:01:02.549> he<00:01:03.269> was

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
window you see him right there he was

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.539 
window you see him right there he was
making<00:01:03.720> contact<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.500> he's<00:01:04.589> trying<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> pull

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
making contact and he's trying to pull

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.090 
making contact and he's trying to pull
the<00:01:05.790> wood<00:01:06.659> whatever<00:01:07.470> he's<00:01:07.620> doing<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.920> you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the wood whatever he's doing that you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.520 
the wood whatever he's doing that you
start<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> leg<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.150> that's<00:01:10.110> pretty<00:01:10.409> much

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
start up the leg and that's pretty much

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.380 
start up the leg and that's pretty much
it<00:01:10.650> you'll<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.220> able<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.700> out<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> map

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
it you'll be able to get out of the map

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.410 
it you'll be able to get out of the map
and<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.700> wouldn't<00:01:14.700> say<00:01:14.790> out<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> map<00:01:15.240> but

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and I wouldn't say out of the map but

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.969 
and I wouldn't say out of the map but
you<00:01:15.540> know<00:01:15.659> you'll<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.960> able<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.350> anywhere

you know you'll be able to get anywhere
in<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.190> map<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.640> long<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.210> that's<00:01:18.420> behind

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
in the map as long but that's behind

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.300 
in the map as long but that's behind
that<00:01:18.960> door<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.260> know<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.799> behind<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.130> door

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that door you know I get behind the door

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.749 
that door you know I get behind the door
I'll<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:21.060> able<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.240> get<00:01:21.420> any<00:01:21.630> place<00:01:21.899> I<00:01:22.049> want<00:01:22.320> and

I'll be able to get any place I want and

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.279 
I'll be able to get any place I want and
there's<00:01:23.759> another<00:01:23.820> spot<00:01:24.359> we<00:01:24.539> found<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.140> it

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
there's another spot we found that it

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.230 
there's another spot we found that it
actually<00:01:25.439> works<00:01:25.859> and<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.490> proof<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:26.939> it

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
actually works and this is proof that it

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.690 
actually works and this is proof that it
actually<00:01:27.420> works<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.259> any<00:01:28.469> window<00:01:29.250> as<00:01:29.369> long<00:01:29.579> as

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
actually works on any window as long as

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.630 
actually works on any window as long as
you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.880> stand<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.509> take<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> look<00:01:31.590> show<00:01:32.579> you

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
you can stand on it take a look show you

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.130 
you can stand on it take a look show you
right<00:01:32.820> now<00:01:33.740> ok<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.969> at<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> bottom<00:01:36.810> floor

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
right now ok this is at the bottom floor

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.690 
right now ok this is at the bottom floor
I'm<00:01:37.469> not<00:01:37.500> not<00:01:37.740> at<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> bottom<00:01:38.250> floor<00:01:38.399> what's

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
I'm not not at the bottom floor what's

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.260 
I'm not not at the bottom floor what's
one<00:01:38.969> floor<00:01:39.590> things<00:01:40.590> uh<00:01:40.770> second<00:01:41.460> floor<00:01:41.670> second

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
one floor things uh second floor second

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.240 
one floor things uh second floor second
floor<00:01:42.299> i<00:01:42.479> would<00:01:42.659> say<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.500> stand<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> side
