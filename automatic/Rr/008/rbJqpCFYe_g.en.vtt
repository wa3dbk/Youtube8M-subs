 do not 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.800
 now to all countries of the world their 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.800
 points 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.520
 Quickly informed from home 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.619
 with the kit for free repair the kit 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.260
 It is composed of a type of resin 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.650
 polyester a half-liter sachet 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.740
 microbes of glass a pot of 125 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.440
 centimeters of palatinate stretching and a 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.410
 fiberglass linear meter of 4 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.330
 ounces can follow the trick or in 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.100
 neighboring nation 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.460
 press open or in duration 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.660
 fill the saw with a boat of 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.550
 125 centimeters of catalyst have the 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.590
 said mansion founds deepen that the 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.350
 neighboring ultraviolet and neighboring 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.000
 on top is in the way that this 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.559
 decide tasting says the neighboring ultraviolet 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.750
 catalyze through the action of 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.810
 rays of the sun or of a lamp of 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.159
 ultraviolet the additive that makes 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.200
 catalyze this one 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.990
 included and already mixed inside the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.189
 neighbor while when sands silva 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:20.750
 you have to throw him catalyst in 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:23.689
 options of 1% and 3% depending on the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.390
 temperature the neighboring ultraviolet is 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.159
 easier to use since you do not have 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.220
 that coming to certain in my room can 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.340
 I was darling site 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.830
 closed where sunlight does not enter and 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.860
 once you have finished your repair 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.740
 made his board in the sun to catch a 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.230
 small hole in your table or for 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.660
 place plugs of guides or plugs of 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.130
 invention we are going to mix the tenths of 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.259
 polyester with my son video tracks 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.600
 mix in a plastic pot the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.079
 polyester adhesion the micro ways of 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.720
 glass and mix well until you get a 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.930
 mass that has the consistency of a 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.930
 yogurt 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.600
 made this dough on your table in the area 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.360
 that you want to repay and that previously 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.360
 sanding 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.240
 if you want to get a result 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.970
 component in from white you can do 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.850
 the same operation but eating the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.780
 micros of glass villas by pieces 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.450
 Fiberglass cut very thin 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.590
 to transport a surfboard in a 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.740
 weakest point a scratched point as in 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.209
 the entities or the funds we are going to use 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.510
 fiberglass we carry sheets of 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.970
 polyester 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.239
 we lay the hens on the fiber of 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.680
 glass and we impregnate it until 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.680
 be completely transparent 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.960
 we throw the chicken that is left over from the 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.220
 table the fiber has to stay 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.120
 transparent but you have to see the 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.909
 squares that form the fiber 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.980
 in a few minutes in the sun you will see how the 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.709
 neighbor gets hard 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.220
 so that it becomes smooth and that can be 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.590
 flirting let's take a gel corts is 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.560
 say a mixture of polyester resin 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:55.040
 with 5% external for tuning 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.680
 We apply the resin on the fiber with 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.790
 the brush as if it were paint the 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.069
 result is smooth and bright wait 5 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.890
 minutes before taking your board out of the sun 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:10.720
 for styrene to take effect and a 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.670
 Once hardened you can bind your table 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.970
 now that you know how to use these 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.220
 materials if you have any doubts 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.440
 you know what is the best way to prepare 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.020
 a touch on the table do not hesitate 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.720
 Contact us you can send us photos by 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.890
 email can call us by phone 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.890
 we will be against putting you
