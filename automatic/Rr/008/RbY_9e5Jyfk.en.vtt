00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.519
 hello everyone with you one more regular 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:14.030
 battery test in this case 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:14.030
 trials were 3000 milliamps 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:25.950
 and 12 volts and 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:30.050
 good polygraphy of course charging 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:35.960
 15 hours written 303 100 milliampere 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.960
 quick charge 1 hour 3000 amps 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:50.860
 nickel metal hydride ator and capacity 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.860
 which he did not show is 761 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.220
 milliampere total and that's right says 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.190
 about the fact that this 3000 here what 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:06.020
 indicate yes it is most likely 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.790
 fast charge but no more 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.690
 no markings to 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:17.330
 Unfortunately, there is not a good battery 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:21.460
 hard to sit here not just for 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.460
 compared to that 2,500 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.200
 so basically you can use 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:36.620
 as always on the site will be a link to the lot 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.620
 and a little description 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.760
 in principle , what else is worth paying 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.410
 attention here is the quality of printing 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.240
 neat line neat done 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.080
 that's so much so that here's a little ring 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.080
 watch this 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.689
 It seems to be like a factory, even on this 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:10.890
 thank you all 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:14.870
 761 normal battery will come down for 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.870
 lies to all bye
