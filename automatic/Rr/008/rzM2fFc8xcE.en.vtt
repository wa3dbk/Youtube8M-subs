gonna<00:01:24.229> get<00:01:24.409> overwhelmed<00:01:25.009> I<00:01:25.100> didn't<00:01:25.399> have<00:01:25.520> any

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
gonna get overwhelmed I didn't have any

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.240 
gonna get overwhelmed I didn't have any
backup<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.240> I<00:01:26.299> probably<00:01:26.509> was<00:01:26.750> gonna<00:01:26.899> die<00:01:27.109> but

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
backup and I probably was gonna die but

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.679 
backup and I probably was gonna die but
you<00:01:28.250> want<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:28.520> hold<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.759> amb<00:01:29.119> flags<00:01:29.390> on<00:01:29.570> this

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
you want to hold the amb flags on this

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.539 
you want to hold the amb flags on this
map<00:01:29.869> you<00:01:30.020> know<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.229> green<00:01:30.439> flags<00:01:30.740> that<00:01:31.250> I<00:01:31.310> have

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
map you know the green flags that I have

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.450 
map you know the green flags that I have
colored<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.240> mainly<00:01:33.200> because<00:01:33.350> this<00:01:33.829> map<00:01:34.189> is<00:01:34.219> a

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
colored and mainly because this map is a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.550 
colored and mainly because this map is a
one<00:01:34.729> sided<00:01:34.939> map<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:35.509> if<00:01:35.719> you<00:01:35.810> smile<00:01:36.049> on<00:01:36.200> a<00:01:36.320> side

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
one sided map and if you smile on a side

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.929 
one sided map and if you smile on a side
you're<00:01:36.770> probably<00:01:36.979> going<00:01:37.219> to<00:01:37.310> do<00:01:37.460> good<00:01:37.640> and

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
you're probably going to do good and

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.149 
you're probably going to do good and
it's<00:01:38.570> small<00:01:38.840> on<00:01:38.929> C<00:01:39.109> flag<00:01:39.380> if<00:01:39.679> you're<00:01:39.950> playing

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
it's small on C flag if you're playing

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.260 
it's small on C flag if you're playing
against<00:01:40.399> a<00:01:40.490> good<00:01:40.670> party<00:01:40.969> you're<00:01:41.090> probably

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
against a good party you're probably

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.999 
against a good party you're probably
gonna<00:01:41.479> get<00:01:41.659> spawn<00:01:41.960> trap<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:42.439> i<00:01:42.469> suggest<00:01:42.950> to

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
gonna get spawn trap so i suggest to

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.849 
gonna get spawn trap so i suggest to
leave<00:01:43.219> but<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.420> red<00:01:44.689> dots<00:01:44.929> are<00:01:45.229> actually<00:01:45.740> the

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
leave but the red dots are actually the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.319 
leave but the red dots are actually the
spawn<00:01:46.100> points<00:01:46.460> just<00:01:46.700> in<00:01:46.789> case<00:01:46.939> you<00:01:47.060> didn't

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
spawn points just in case you didn't

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.819 
spawn points just in case you didn't
know<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:47.780> know<00:01:47.840> pay<00:01:48.109> attention<00:01:48.530> for<00:01:48.710> that

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
know so you know pay attention for that

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:49.840 
know so you know pay attention for that
when<00:01:49.039> you're<00:01:49.189> running<00:01:49.340> through<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:49.670> sea

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
when you're running through the sea

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.419 
when you're running through the sea
spawn<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.390> right<00:01:51.079> here<00:01:51.350> there<00:01:52.009> are<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.219> bunch

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
spawn and right here there are a bunch

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.279 
spawn and right here there are a bunch
of<00:01:52.490> enemies<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.119> i<00:01:53.420> actually<00:01:53.570> don't<00:01:53.899> know<00:01:54.049> or

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.450 
should do if you said i should probably
lay<00:02:03.409> down<00:02:03.590> on<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:03.890> ground<00:02:03.950> you're<00:02:04.280> probably

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
lay down on the ground you're probably

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.099 
lay down on the ground you're probably
right<00:02:04.759> but<00:02:04.789> i<00:02:05.030> did<00:02:05.329> that<00:02:05.450> at<00:02:05.569> the<00:02:05.689> beginning<00:02:05.840> of

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
right but i did that at the beginning of

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:07.630 
right but i did that at the beginning of
the<00:02:06.229> game<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:06.679> see<00:02:06.829> this<00:02:06.950> dude's<00:02:07.189> no<00:02:07.460> use

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
the game and you see this dude's no use

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.460 
the game and you see this dude's no use
checking<00:02:07.969> that<00:02:08.090> corner<00:02:08.870> cuz<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:09.140> probably

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
checking that corner cuz you probably

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.860 
checking that corner cuz you probably
expected<00:02:09.979> me<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.220> be<00:02:10.250> there<00:02:10.550> but<00:02:10.729> i<00:02:11.000> decided<00:02:11.660> to

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
expected me to be there but i decided to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.670 
expected me to be there but i decided to
rush<00:02:12.050> them<00:02:12.170> mainly<00:02:12.410> because<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.830> know<00:02:12.980> i<00:02:13.310> saw

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
rush them mainly because you know i saw

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.380 
rush them mainly because you know i saw
portable<00:02:14.040> radar<00:02:14.250> they<00:02:14.489> all<00:02:14.609> just<00:02:14.879> spawn<00:02:15.120> there

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
portable radar they all just spawn there

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.809 
portable radar they all just spawn there
and<00:02:15.659> you<00:02:16.500> know<00:02:16.590> when<00:02:16.829> you<00:02:16.950> mostly<00:02:17.579> when

and you know when you mostly when
everybody's<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.540> spawn<00:02:18.840> they're<00:02:19.140> probably

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
everybody's all spawn they're probably

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.530 
everybody's all spawn they're probably
pressing<00:02:19.920> pressing<00:02:20.189> the<00:02:20.609> sprint<00:02:21.030> button<00:02:21.269> and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
probably to get to the action but if you

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.830 
probably to get to the action but if you

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
have them at the sea flag anymore which

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.589 
have them at the sea flag anymore which
is<00:02:31.590> now<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.430> was<00:02:32.549> kind<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.819> pissed<00:02:32.969> off<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.359> like

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
spawn systems they're probably gonna

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.920 
spawn systems they're probably gonna
split<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.730> spawns<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.299> spawned<00:02:45.659> on<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
other side of the map just a tip right

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.289 
other side of the map just a tip right
there<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:49.189> I'll<00:02:50.189> once<00:02:50.909> i<00:02:51.030> got<00:02:51.150> that

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
there and I'll once i got that
