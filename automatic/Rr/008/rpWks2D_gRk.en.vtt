00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
tippy TV iPad to Georgia we discussed

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.849 
tippy TV iPad to Georgia we discussed
what<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.420> wanted<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:15.929> terms<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.710> actual

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
what we wanted in terms of the actual

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.400 
what we wanted in terms of the actual
iPad<00:00:17.550> itself<00:00:17.970> already<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.930> let's<00:00:19.109> get<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
iPad itself already so let's get a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.680 
iPad itself already so let's get a
little<00:00:19.560> bit<00:00:19.740> more<00:00:19.890> specific

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690 
little bit more specific

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.630 
little bit more specific
one<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.740> biggest<00:00:22.920> questions<00:00:23.370> I<00:00:23.490> guess

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
one of the biggest questions I guess

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.770 
one of the biggest questions I guess
we'll<00:00:23.790> start<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.270> because<00:00:24.360> it<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.690> the

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:24.780 
we'll start with it because it is the

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.420 
we'll start with it because it is the
biggest<00:00:25.080> question<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.620> display<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.250> it

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
biggest question is the display is it

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.720 
biggest question is the display is it
going<00:00:26.610> to<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:27.230> 768<00:00:28.230> x<00:00:29.150> 1024<00:00:30.230> x<00:00:31.230> 768<00:00:31.770> or<00:00:32.190> vers

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
going to be 768 x 1024 x 768 or vers

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.390 
going to be 768 x 1024 x 768 or vers
fisa<00:00:33.000> or<00:00:33.300> vice<00:00:34.140> versa<00:00:34.680> or<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.070> they<00:00:35.220> gonna

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
fisa or vice versa or are they gonna

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.400 
fisa or vice versa or are they gonna
pixel<00:00:36.060> doublet<00:00:36.450> are<00:00:36.600> they<00:00:36.750> gonna<00:00:36.900> go<00:00:37.080> to<00:00:37.140> like

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
pixel doublet are they gonna go to like

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.260 
pixel doublet are they gonna go to like
some<00:00:37.620> crazy<00:00:38.720> 2048<00:00:39.720> display<00:00:40.820> you<00:00:41.820> know<00:00:41.970> I

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270

still going to be under aetna display

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.240 
still going to be under aetna display
can<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.570> well<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.230> we<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.470> agree<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.800> it's

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
can we well can we just agree that it's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.920 
can we well can we just agree that it's
gonna<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.519> double<00:01:05.970> whatever<00:01:06.450> it'll<00:01:06.720> either<00:01:06.840> be

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
gonna be double whatever it'll either be

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.660 
gonna be double whatever it'll either be
one<00:01:07.409> time<00:01:07.620> like<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> exact<00:01:08.070> same<00:01:08.220> size<00:01:08.430> or

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
one time like the exact same size or

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.770 
one time like the exact same size or
it'll<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:08.970> double<00:01:09.120> there's<00:01:09.450> no<00:01:09.540> way<00:01:09.659> they're

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
it'll be double there's no way they're

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.480 
it'll be double there's no way they're
gonna<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.050> like<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.409> crazy<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.159> between

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
gonna do like a crazy in between

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.860 
gonna do like a crazy in between
resolution<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.180> make<00:01:12.270> developers<00:01:12.690> lose

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
resolution and make developers lose

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.240 
resolution and make developers lose
their<00:01:13.020> minds<00:01:13.320> well<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.620> did<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> really<00:01:14.010> nice

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
their minds well you did a really nice

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.730 
their minds well you did a really nice
article<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.030> why<00:01:15.300> that<00:01:15.330> would<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.960> not<00:01:16.500> as

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
article on why that would be not as

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.640 
article on why that would be not as
feasible<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:17.580> people<00:01:17.880> would<00:01:18.090> think<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.530> would

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
feasible as people would think we would

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.289 
feasible as people would think we would
shrink<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.250> interface<00:01:20.580> would<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:20.850> smaller<00:01:21.180> or

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
shrink the interface would be smaller or

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.640 
shrink the interface would be smaller or
if<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:21.720> stretched<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.350> it'd<00:01:22.440> be<00:01:22.470> all

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
if they stretched it and it'd be all

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.680 
if they stretched it and it'd be all
blurry<00:01:22.890> yeah<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.700> really<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.120> have<00:01:24.330> they

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
blurry yeah so really they have they

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.570 
blurry yeah so really they have they
have<00:01:24.840> little<00:01:25.320> choice<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:25.800> again<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.220> Apple

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
have little choice then again with Apple

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.090 
have little choice then again with Apple
you<00:01:27.540> may<00:01:27.720> figure<00:01:28.080> something<00:01:28.500> out<00:01:28.620> so<00:01:28.980> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you may figure something out so the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.560 
you may figure something out so the
thing<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:29.460> costs<00:01:29.910> I<00:01:30.120> mean<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
thing is but costs I mean that is a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.140 
thing is but costs I mean that is a
display<00:01:31.020> its<00:01:31.200> equivalent<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> 27-inch<00:01:32.700> imac

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
display its equivalent to a 27-inch imac

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.030 
display its equivalent to a 27-inch imac
shrunk<00:01:33.570> down<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.050> nine<00:01:34.200> point<00:01:34.470> seven<00:01:34.650> inches

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
shrunk down to nine point seven inches

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.760 
shrunk down to nine point seven inches
it<00:01:35.640> would<00:01:35.940> be<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.420> mean<00:01:36.630> I'm<00:01:37.110> sure<00:01:37.320> Apple<00:01:37.710> would

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
it would be I mean I'm sure Apple would

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.440 
it would be I mean I'm sure Apple would
order<00:01:38.010> millions<00:01:38.580> of<00:01:38.730> them<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.060> should

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
order millions of them but it should

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
order millions of them but it should
still<00:01:39.480> be<00:01:39.660> expensive<00:01:40.260> hey<00:01:40.560> with<00:01:40.860> Apple<00:01:41.220> they

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
still be expensive hey with Apple they

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.040 
still be expensive hey with Apple they
could<00:01:41.580> buy<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.910> a<00:01:42.060> little<00:01:42.180> bit<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:42.570> costs

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
could buy it a little bit of the costs

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.350 
could buy it a little bit of the costs
so<00:01:43.350> lower<00:01:43.680> their<00:01:43.860> margins<00:01:44.250> they<00:01:44.790> could<00:01:45.060> as

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
so lower their margins they could as

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.750 
so lower their margins they could as
another<00:01:45.690> possibility<00:01:46.170> um<00:01:46.560> right<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:47.580> they

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
another possibility um right now they

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.870 
another possibility um right now they
sell<00:01:48.030> an<00:01:48.270> ipad<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.290> iphone<00:01:49.650> and<00:01:50.250> ipod<00:01:50.610> touch

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
sell an ipad and iphone and ipod touch

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.240 
sell an ipad and iphone and ipod touch
but<00:01:51.510> with<00:01:51.660> max<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.380> usually<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.830> a<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.160> on

some of the max you have a higher res

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.780 
some of the max you have a higher res
option<00:01:55.050> it's<00:01:55.530> possible<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.580> start

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
option it's possible that you start

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.920 
option it's possible that you start
treating<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.120> like<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> mac<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.750> you'd<00:01:57.840> have

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
treating it like a mac and you'd have

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.380 
treating it like a mac and you'd have
the<00:01:58.050> regular<00:01:58.230> ipad<00:01:58.860> at<00:01:59.040> 500<00:01:59.490> bucks<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.910> then

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the regular ipad at 500 bucks and then

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.230 
the regular ipad at 500 bucks and then
an<00:02:00.540> ipad<00:02:00.960> HD<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:02.070> something<00:02:02.490> at<00:02:02.730> eight<00:02:03.210> hundred

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
an ipad HD or something at eight hundred

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.210 
an ipad HD or something at eight hundred
dollars<00:02:03.450> would<00:02:03.900> that<00:02:04.020> work<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.680> could<00:02:05.190> work

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
dollars would that work it could work

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.760 
dollars would that work it could work
i've<00:02:05.700> seen<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.360> worked<00:02:06.900> well<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.650> know

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
i've seen it it worked well for you know

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.369 
i've seen it it worked well for you know
we<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:07.980> many<00:02:08.369> different<00:02:08.670> ipods<00:02:09.200> how<00:02:10.200> many

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
we have many different ipods how many

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.949 
we have many different ipods how many
different<00:02:10.649> apps<00:02:10.830> Matt<00:02:11.400> max<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:12.300> i<00:02:12.510> don't

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
different apps Matt max but i don't

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.820 
different apps Matt max but i don't
think<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.140> i<00:02:13.230> think<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.560> they're<00:02:13.680> going<00:02:13.769> to

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
think so i think that they're going to

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.800 
think so i think that they're going to
try<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.069> go<00:02:14.190> out<00:02:14.310> because<00:02:14.879> you<00:02:15.480> know<00:02:15.569> if<00:02:15.690> you

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
try to go out because you know if you

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.150 
try to go out because you know if you
think<00:02:15.989> i<00:02:16.200> would<00:02:16.440> assume<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.950> they're<00:02:17.040> going

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
think i would assume that they're going

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.820 
think i would assume that they're going
to<00:02:17.220> probably<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.989> cdma<00:02:18.989> version<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:19.800> i

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
to probably have a cdma version so i

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.960 
to probably have a cdma version so i
think<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.220> would<00:02:20.400> already<00:02:20.550> change<00:02:20.849> it

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
think that that would already change it

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.040 
think that that would already change it
and<00:02:21.060> then<00:02:21.180> they<00:02:21.300> would<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.659> that<00:02:21.930> would

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
and then they would have to that would

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.570 
and then they would have to that would
completely<00:02:22.620> fracture<00:02:23.129> the<00:02:23.220> market<00:02:23.459> there'd

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
completely fracture the market there'd

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.649 
completely fracture the market there'd
be<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> whole<00:02:23.730> bunch<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.209> them<00:02:24.300> then<00:02:24.480> because

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
be a whole bunch of them then because

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.390 
be a whole bunch of them then because
they'd<00:02:24.810> have<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.989> cdma<00:02:25.500> version<00:02:25.739> because<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
they'd have the cdma version because the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.620 
they'd have the cdma version because the
gsm<00:02:26.849> version

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
gsm version

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.270 
gsm version
maybe<00:02:29.630> even<00:02:29.840> they'll<00:02:30.050> have<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.290> gsm<00:02:31.070> cdma

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
maybe even they'll have a gsm cdma

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.770 
maybe even they'll have a gsm cdma
version<00:02:31.790> could<00:02:32.060> they<00:02:32.180> do<00:02:32.240> that<00:02:32.330> could<00:02:32.690> they

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
version could they do that could they

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.970 
version could they do that could they
fit<00:02:32.990> that<00:02:33.140> in<00:02:33.260> there<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.500> still<00:02:33.680> keep<00:02:33.830> it

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
fit that in there and still keep it

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.560 
fit that in there and still keep it
thinner<00:02:34.250> like<00:02:34.640> everyone<00:02:35.000> says<00:02:35.240> it's<00:02:35.390> going<00:02:35.510> to

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
thinner like everyone says it's going to

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.240 
thinner like everyone says it's going to
be<00:02:35.660> thinner<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.200> smaller<00:02:36.230> right<00:02:36.830> as<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.070> new

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
now you have a dock port and you can buy

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.710 
now you have a dock port and you can buy
from<00:03:49.410> apple<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.980> camera<00:03:50.460> kit<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.850> has<00:03:50.880> USB<00:03:51.330> and

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
adapter and so do you think that they'll

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.120 
adapter and so do you think that they'll
get<00:03:56.370> rid<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:57.270> 30<00:03:57.600> pin<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.050> make<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.620> USB

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
get rid of the 30 pin and make it a USB

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.430 
get rid of the 30 pin and make it a USB
port<00:03:59.430> instead<00:03:59.820> no<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.360> not<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.780> not<00:04:00.810> at<00:04:01.230> all

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
port instead no and not and not at all

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.470 
port instead no and not and not at all
because<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.830> can't<00:04:02.160> fit<00:04:02.310> as<00:04:02.400> many<00:04:02.520> just<00:04:03.120> this

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
because you can't fit as many just this

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.030 
because you can't fit as many just this
they<00:04:03.780> have<00:04:03.870> 30<00:04:04.050> pins<00:04:04.290> for<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.530> reason<00:04:04.800> they<00:04:04.890> use

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
they have 30 pins for a reason they use

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.160 
they have 30 pins for a reason they use
those<00:04:05.190> pins<00:04:05.460> to<00:04:05.610> do<00:04:05.730> things<00:04:06.000> but<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.690> eggs<00:04:06.810> it

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
those pins to do things but the eggs it

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.480 
those pins to do things but the eggs it
wasn't<00:04:07.500> just<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.740> random<00:04:08.070> number<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.430> they

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
wasn't just a random number that they

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.280 
wasn't just a random number that they
came<00:04:08.640> up<00:04:08.730> with<00:04:08.790> no<00:04:09.180> well<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.540> mean<00:04:09.600> I<00:04:09.870> think

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
came up with no well I mean I think

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.570 
came up with no well I mean I think
right<00:04:10.380> now<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:10.800> doesn't<00:04:10.830> do<00:04:11.100> enough<00:04:11.190> they

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
right now it doesn't do enough they

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.980 
right now it doesn't do enough they
probably<00:04:11.760> want<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.000> put<00:04:12.060> HDMI<00:04:12.600> on<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.900> if

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
probably want to put HDMI on that if

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.900 
probably want to put HDMI on that if
they<00:04:13.110> can<00:04:13.320> but<00:04:13.500> there's<00:04:13.650> not<00:04:13.770> enough<00:04:13.950> pins<00:04:14.190> but

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
they can but there's not enough pins but

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.640 
they can but there's not enough pins but
the<00:04:15.030> interesting<00:04:15.060> thing<00:04:15.510> is<00:04:15.560> Jonathan<00:04:16.560> I've
