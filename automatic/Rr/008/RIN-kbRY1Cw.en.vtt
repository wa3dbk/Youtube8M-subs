00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
hey people's I've just finished college

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.059 
hey people's I've just finished college
33<00:00:02.909> meaning<00:00:03.300> I<00:00:03.389> played<00:00:03.689> every<00:00:04.319> Call<00:00:04.589> of<00:00:04.620> Duty

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
33 meaning I played every Call of Duty

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.150 
33 meaning I played every Call of Duty
game<00:00:05.310> or<00:00:05.720> one<00:00:06.720> version<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.259> each<00:00:07.440> game<00:00:07.740> anyway

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
game or one version of each game anyway

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.580 
game or one version of each game anyway
why<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.090> say<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.750> because<00:00:09.780> games<00:00:10.320> like

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
why I say that is because games like

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.259 
why I say that is because games like
world<00:00:11.550> at<00:00:11.700> war<00:00:11.910> for<00:00:11.940> instance<00:00:14.030> we're<00:00:15.030> -<00:00:15.120> we're

game<00:00:51.110> but<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.140> doesn't<00:00:52.440> mean<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
game but that doesn't mean it's a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.389 
game but that doesn't mean it's a
different<00:00:53.059> direct<00:00:54.059> port<00:00:55.010> but<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.039> got<00:00:56.219> each
