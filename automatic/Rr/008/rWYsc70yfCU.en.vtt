00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.350 
two other kinds there's a white bottle
for<00:04:51.770> curling<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.010> then<00:04:53.820> I<00:04:53.850> think<00:04:54.150> there's<00:04:54.300> a

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
for curling and then I think there's a

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.280 
for curling and then I think there's a
gold<00:04:54.900> bottle<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:56.040> think<00:04:56.880> it<00:04:57.000> was<00:04:57.120> gold<00:04:57.360> for

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
gold bottle I think it was gold for

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.460 
gold bottle I think it was gold for
straightening<00:04:58.710> this<00:04:59.220> one<00:04:59.430> is<00:04:59.610> meant<00:05:00.390> for<00:05:00.690> when

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
straightening this one is meant for when

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.510 
straightening this one is meant for when
you<00:05:01.560> blow-dry<00:05:01.770> your<00:05:02.130> hair

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
you blow-dry your hair

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.440 
you blow-dry your hair
I'm<00:05:03.180> guessing<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.840> curling<00:05:04.260> one<00:05:04.440> is<00:05:04.680> lighter

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
I'm guessing the curling one is lighter

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.180 
I'm guessing the curling one is lighter
so<00:05:06.450> it<00:05:06.750> won't<00:05:07.169> weigh<00:05:07.320> your<00:05:07.470> hair<00:05:07.530> down<00:05:07.710> so<00:05:08.130> you

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
so it won't weigh your hair down so you

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.190 
so it won't weigh your hair down so you
can<00:05:08.340> curl<00:05:08.580> it<00:05:08.730> and<00:05:09.060> maybe<00:05:09.510> the<00:05:09.660> straightening

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
can curl it and maybe the straightening

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.300 
can curl it and maybe the straightening
one<00:05:11.150> has<00:05:12.150> stuff<00:05:12.780> that<00:05:12.960> you<00:05:13.020> know<00:05:13.140> will<00:05:13.770> weigh

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
one has stuff that you know will weigh

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.310 
one has stuff that you know will weigh
your<00:05:14.340> hair<00:05:14.520> down<00:05:14.730> in<00:05:15.150> a<00:05:15.240> sense<00:05:15.480> to<00:05:15.900> make<00:05:16.110> it

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
your hair down in a sense to make it

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.610 
your hair down in a sense to make it
straighter<00:05:16.890> I<00:05:17.160> got<00:05:18.090> the<00:05:18.270> blow-dry<00:05:18.630> one<00:05:18.870> cuz<00:05:19.500> I

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
straighter I got the blow-dry one cuz I

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.840 
straighter I got the blow-dry one cuz I
blow<00:05:19.830> dry<00:05:20.160> my<00:05:20.190> hair<00:05:22.010> nine<00:05:23.010> out<00:05:23.220> of<00:05:23.310> ten<00:05:23.460> times<00:05:23.640> I

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
wash my hair the only times I don't blow

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.790 
wash my hair the only times I don't blow
dry<00:05:25.860> it<00:05:25.919> is<00:05:26.130> if<00:05:26.610> I<00:05:27.540> happen<00:05:28.290> to<00:05:28.410> take<00:05:28.560> a<00:05:28.620> shower

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
dry it is if I happen to take a shower

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.680 
dry it is if I happen to take a shower

combination<00:06:06.759> of<00:06:06.969> these<00:06:07.210> or<00:06:07.509> if<00:06:07.539> it's<00:06:07.719> just

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
combination of these or if it's just

this<00:06:08.169> or<00:06:08.590> what<00:06:09.340> but<00:06:09.580> the<00:06:09.699> first<00:06:09.969> time<00:06:10.210> I<00:06:10.240> use

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:10.569 
this or what but the first time I use

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:13.589 
this or what but the first time I use
this<00:06:10.750> I<00:06:11.020> noticed<00:06:11.349> my<00:06:11.530> hair<00:06:11.610> was<00:06:12.610> definitely

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
this I noticed my hair was definitely

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.080 
this I noticed my hair was definitely
softer<00:06:14.050> after<00:06:14.169> blow-drying<00:06:14.530> it<00:06:15.039> it<00:06:15.729> felt

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
softer after blow-drying it it felt

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:22.230 
softer after blow-drying it it felt
better<00:06:16.270> it<00:06:19.530> it's<00:06:20.530> it<00:06:20.979> seemed<00:06:21.340> tame<00:06:21.759> I<00:06:21.789> have<00:06:22.210> a

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
better it it's it seemed tame I have a

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.899 
better it it's it seemed tame I have a
few<00:06:22.479> flyaways<00:06:22.990> so<00:06:23.710> this<00:06:23.919> definitely<00:06:24.250> helps

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:31.790 

yeah<00:06:28.680> and<00:06:29.680> there's<00:06:30.400> a<00:06:30.669> you<00:06:31.150> know<00:06:31.180> there's<00:06:31.270> a

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
plenty of other types of heat

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.610 
plenty of other types of heat
protectants<00:06:34.240> out<00:06:34.330> there<00:06:34.539> I<00:06:34.719> just<00:06:35.110> got<00:06:35.469> this

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
protectants out there I just got this

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.649 
protectants out there I just got this
one<00:06:35.800> because<00:06:35.979> it<00:06:36.129> was<00:06:36.189> the<00:06:36.340> cheapest<00:06:36.759> at<00:06:37.120> CBS

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
one because it was the cheapest at CBS

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:40.140 
one because it was the cheapest at CBS
at<00:06:37.930> the<00:06:38.020> time<00:06:38.259> I<00:06:38.529> definitely<00:06:39.490> we<00:06:39.610> will<00:06:40.090> be

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
at the time I definitely we will be

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.610 
at the time I definitely we will be
getting<00:06:40.509> more<00:06:40.629> heat<00:06:40.930> protectant<00:06:43.289> I'm<00:06:44.289> glad

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
getting more heat protectant I'm glad

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.459 
getting more heat protectant I'm glad
that<00:06:44.889> I<00:06:45.129> am<00:06:45.569> starting<00:06:46.569> to<00:06:46.689> use<00:06:46.930> them<00:06:47.139> because

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:47.469 
that I am starting to use them because

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:49.080 
that I am starting to use them because
they're<00:06:47.590> very<00:06:47.680> good<00:06:47.860> for<00:06:48.009> your<00:06:48.099> hair<00:06:48.340> so<00:06:48.969> if

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
they're very good for your hair so if

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.480 
they're very good for your hair so if
you<00:06:49.270> don't<00:06:49.870> use<00:06:49.990> heat<00:06:50.169> protectant<00:06:50.710> and<00:06:50.919> you

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
you don't use heat protectant and you

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.249 
you don't use heat protectant and you
