00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.429
 the 508 was launched in 2011 and 7 in 2012 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.799
 who appeared the rxh lolo road version 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.719
 with the sauce Peugeot end 2014 all 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.250
 508 benefited from a restyling with 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.080
 especially a big overhaul of the face 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.220
 before the lights the grille and the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.650
 shield his new gives back a 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.539
 new youth at this 508 version 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.400
 rxh is now available in shine 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.199
 as before but in addition with the two 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.970
 liters of water hdi of 180 horses associated 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.369
 to the last car box of the group 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.899
 the hat and 6 this motorization imposes 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.700
 besides the automatism whatever 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.000
 the body chosen sedan break or 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.200
 rxh inside the restyling did 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.460
 almost nothing changed in the assault 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.899
 according to him that we find a board of 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.940
 well presented board with a touch screen 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.710
 and the start button on the left 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.820
 of the original steering wheel 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.070
 nothing indicates inside that one is 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.300
 in a rxh version the only 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.770
 novelties come from the surveillance 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.050
 blind spots and the camera's 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.430
 back to the rear habitability allows 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.989
 to comfortably accommodate two 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.059
 adults who will be best placed 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.520
 to benefit from the huge glass roof 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.930
 the trunk exceeds the 500 of the 6 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.350
 cubic meters and is clearly more 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.060
 generous that on the hybrid model the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.409
 olive tree aldemar discreetly but we 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.450
 expect no less at this level of range 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.830
 engines provided a lot of torque to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.700
 low diet and raise easily even 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.170
 on highway 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.060
 however the performances are in 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.590
 withdrawal from category la 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.909
 box auto and fast soft and well manage 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.280
 amateurs are even entitled to 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.560
 paddles driving on road this 508 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.299
 rxh with standard 18-inch wheels gets 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.500
 watch closes at low speed but wins 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.600
 in comfort when speed increases 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.280
 on a small road the car stays at 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.430
 comfortable even if its high weight is 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.430
 feel 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.579
 the 508 rxh is not necessarily hybrid anymore 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.530
 and it is rather good news because 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.140
 this 100% thermal version avoids you 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.420
 to undergo the piloted etg 6 box imposed 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.680
 on the hybrid our part the gap in 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.270
 consumption compared to the version 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.659
 hybrid is weak with about a half 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.159
 liter 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.899
 and since there is no battery in 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.909
 the trunk of our version the big one 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.860
 safe is finally preserved this version 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.600
 is less expensive than 2500 euros in 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.500
 counting the ecological bonus compared 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.450
 to the hybrid version 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.799
 unless you really want to ride in 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.880
 hybrid so we advise you this 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.880
 more homogeneous version
