00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.870
 w 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.680
 beyond the file 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.570
 read the file 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.570
 level 5 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.440

 you see here several documents on the way I already did 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.120
 yes if several documents when you do for example 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.620

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.160
 there is a stop that his sentence when he is away for five years 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.619
 when you 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.760

 6 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.600

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.870
 8:30 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.870
 the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.180

 If you see 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.779

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.959

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.959

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.329

 just before you start working 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:03.449
 importantly a stable job 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.529
