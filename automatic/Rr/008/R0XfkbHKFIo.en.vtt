00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.130
 hello you dear welcome to 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.639
 my recipes 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.580
 Today I want to give you the recipe for one 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.279
 show a man is the most famous 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.439
 drink in turkish kitchen this 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.869
 drink will be in the summer 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.380
 Drunk because it is very turkey 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.720
 is warm and all refreshed properly and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.910
 is also delicious whenever we are in the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.469
 Drinking turkey I drink 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.680
 very much like one 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.210
 many find it pure, but I think that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.340
 you have to do that seldom 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.129
 try with itself tastes 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.719
 really good but you have to watch that 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.020
 I always make mistakes 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.780
 So you fill in half of the sheet 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.050
 all too and then rarely comes over it 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.199
 but if we do not pay attention to everything 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.840
 then once goes over the whole swims 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.609
 I have this problem every year 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.799
 Turkey if we go for a drink 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.830
 and my husband keeps laughing , he says 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.979
 And do not learn from it 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.100
 I keep coming but you can go here 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.509
 Be careful if you have one with you 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.360
 you want to drink mineral water since you drink 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.360
 can it be your alban up to the half 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.580
 stop and then always yourself and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.580
 after a bit so that 's not it 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.030
 so you can flood normally 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.850
 prepare with tap water but how 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.530
 I said that with pleasure 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.290
 drinking mineral water I know that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.570
 also directly with mineral water 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.310
 that's what I like better you can do that 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.009
 of course, but also easy 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.930
 prepare tap water 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.210
 Now I always show you what we do 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.939
 We need so many ingredients 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.790
 actually does not come after that 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.640
 another recipe from me turkish tv 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.710
 is actually the pots but what 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.610
 you have to pay attention to which goal you have to 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.119
 buy and tea kettle which I have to 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.730
 home 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.430
 I want you to do that 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.120
 show everything and mocha turkish mocha 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.980
 that is also very nice and 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.230
 coffee set read clearly that all that comes 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.900
 then in connection I have now 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.870
 First of all, prepare as one 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.950
 We here yogurt is allowed half a 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.530
 lemon salt mineral water selter 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.050
 that's all we need which 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.420
 yogurt takes it does not matter 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.150
 I will not give you any quantities now 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.290
 market because is depending on yogurt 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.660
 different is some yoghurt 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.370
 firmer and the other little rivers 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.430
 That's why you just have to do it yourself 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.080
 look at the criticism liquid would like to have something 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:51.250
 what you have to do it is very simple 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:55.330
 yogurt just coming in in a vessel 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.330
 I have just half 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.909
 then come and say you always have to 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.849
 Look inside after the night if 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:14.230
 you do not want to be so angry then 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:14.230
 comes salt wine and mÃ¼ller 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.849
 that will be I want to be fluid 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.220
 time and again to taste and watch 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:44.160
 if you still have salt to enter or 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:46.740
 stones mainufers i would know if else 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.870
 that is now a thick joop and 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.670
 that does not have to be really fluid 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.210
 her just with a wandmixer for 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.030
 mix 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:58.670
 I now have 500 grams 05 and now 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.550
 ago taken better 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.600
 a tablespoon of salt and juice of half 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.380
 lemon 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.570
 that's all you do not need anymore 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:14.340
 that would just have to be a dice 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.590
 that was right there on that too 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.650
 in Iran and so it will be 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.010
 Serves the export container for 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.500
 but I hope you like this concept 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.050
 I also really liked that 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.450
 what you have to look out for is natural 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.790
 that the yogurt is not so sweet 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.310
 tastes a bit sour 2 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.080
 yogurt is not a bit sweet 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.240
 I had lemon juice in it then 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.580
 but there is also in the potty 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.070
 yogurt was not a bit sour 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.520
 Tastes and that's perfect for a 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.400
 do 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.500
 It used to be in wood kettles 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.990
 made and album is so right 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.320
 so the cream hit that right 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.990
 to have that is really very much 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.990
 work and time connected if you can 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.720
 But like me, I would like to do an original 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.430
 it showed you the easiest way 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.919
 Of course I wish you a lot of fun 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.669
 try it out and say it by 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.669
