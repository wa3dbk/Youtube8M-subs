00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
a fantastic light weight Prime on there

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.170 
a fantastic light weight Prime on there
it's<00:02:16.020> super<00:02:16.350> fast<00:02:16.530> at<00:02:16.830> f-18<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.520> comparison<00:02:18.150> to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
it's super fast at f-18 in comparison to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.360 
it's super fast at f-18 in comparison to
you<00:02:18.630> know<00:02:18.750> any<00:02:18.990> other<00:02:19.110> kit<00:02:19.530> lens<00:02:19.770> or<00:02:19.980> even<00:02:20.250> a

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
you know any other kit lens or even a

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.060 
you know any other kit lens or even a
lot<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.640> primes<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.000> are<00:02:21.180> 2:8<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.890> put

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
lot of primes that are 2:8 so you put

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.180 
lot of primes that are 2:8 so you put
the<00:02:23.160> 35<00:02:23.880> f-18<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.600> your<00:02:24.750> D<00:02:24.900> 7000<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
the 35 f-18 on your D 7000 it's a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.310 
the 35 f-18 on your D 7000 it's a
perfect<00:02:26.790> field<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.360> view<00:02:27.540> as<00:02:27.690> well<00:02:27.720> because<00:02:28.230> it

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
perfect field of view as well because it

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.510 
perfect field of view as well because it
basically<00:02:28.410> brings<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.040> back<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
basically brings you back to the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.460 
basically brings you back to the
traditional<00:02:30.090> 50<00:02:30.510> millimeter<00:02:30.930> field<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.320> view

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
traditional 50 millimeter field of view

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.550 
traditional 50 millimeter field of view
so<00:02:32.190> rather<00:02:33.150> than<00:02:33.360> using<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.750> zoom<00:02:33.959> use<00:02:34.410> your

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
so rather than using a zoom use your

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.520 
so rather than using a zoom use your
feet<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:35.370> get<00:02:35.490> an<00:02:35.610> f-18<00:02:35.970> lens<00:02:36.330> super<00:02:37.260> sharp

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
feet you get an f-18 lens super sharp

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.980 
feet you get an f-18 lens super sharp
and<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:38.310> can<00:02:38.520> use<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.940> for<00:02:39.420> wide<00:02:39.660> if<00:02:39.900> you

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
and you can use it for wide if you

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.780 
and you can use it for wide if you
backup<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.770> can<00:02:40.830> use<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.220> for<00:02:41.370> long<00:02:41.520> if<00:02:41.700> you

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
backup you can use it for long if you

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.940 
backup you can use it for long if you
get<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.060> close<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:43.290> basically<00:02:43.470> can<00:02:43.800> have

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
get in close and you basically can have

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.350 
get in close and you basically can have
that<00:02:44.160> on<00:02:44.340> your<00:02:44.459> lens<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.730> can<00:02:44.880> leave<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.209> on

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
that on your lens you can leave it on

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.470 
that on your lens you can leave it on
your<00:02:45.420> on<00:02:45.930> your<00:02:45.959> d7000<00:02:46.920> at<00:02:47.040> 35<00:02:47.550> million<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:48.270> lens

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
your on your d7000 at 35 million a lens

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.449

and shoot almost anything with it and

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.340 
and shoot almost anything with it and
you<00:02:50.970> get<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.209> advantage<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.720> having<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:52.080> super

would be the Nikon 105 F 2.8 VR this is

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.160 
would be the Nikon 105 F 2.8 VR this is

VR and it's got the N for nano coating

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.690 
VR and it's got the N for nano coating
so<00:03:13.260> it's<00:03:13.380> quite<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.590> mouthful<00:03:14.010> for<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.250> lens<00:03:14.430> name

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
so it's quite a mouthful for a lens name

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.190 
so it's quite a mouthful for a lens name
it<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:15.989> fantastic<00:03:16.620> lens<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.880> also<00:03:18.690> doubles

it is a fantastic lens it also doubles

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.350 
it is a fantastic lens it also doubles
you<00:03:19.769> can<00:03:19.920> use<00:03:20.040> for<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.280> macro<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.060> get<00:03:21.209> the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
you can use for a macro so you get the

one<00:05:05.650> a<00:05:05.680> Nikon<00:05:06.100> is<00:05:06.190> best<00:05:06.520> it's<00:05:06.850> nice<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.420> wide

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
one a Nikon is best it's nice and wide

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.090 
one a Nikon is best it's nice and wide
especially<00:05:07.840> on<00:05:08.140> an<00:05:08.230> FX<00:05:08.560> body<00:05:08.800> it<00:05:08.950> works

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
especially on an FX body it works

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.190 
especially on an FX body it works
beautifully<00:05:09.580> for<00:05:09.610> wide<00:05:09.910> but<00:05:10.420> on<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.540> DX<00:05:10.930> body

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
beautifully for wide but on the DX body

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.990 
beautifully for wide but on the DX body
it<00:05:11.380> gives<00:05:11.530> you<00:05:11.620> about<00:05:11.800> a<00:05:11.830> 30<00:05:12.190> millimeter<00:05:12.460> field

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
it gives you about a 30 millimeter field

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.690 
it gives you about a 30 millimeter field
of<00:05:13.150> view<00:05:13.360> its<00:05:13.900> f<00:05:14.110> 2.8<00:05:14.740> so<00:05:14.919> it's<00:05:15.040> fairly<00:05:15.340> fast

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
of view its f 2.8 so it's fairly fast

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.390 
of view its f 2.8 so it's fairly fast
not<00:05:15.970> quite<00:05:16.210> as<00:05:16.330> fast<00:05:16.480> as<00:05:16.690> an<00:05:16.810> f-18<00:05:17.230> or<00:05:17.560> now<00:05:17.710> 1/4

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
not quite as fast as an f-18 or now 1/4

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.580 
not quite as fast as an f-18 or now 1/4
but<00:05:19.030> it's<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.240> really<00:05:19.540> nice<00:05:19.690> lens<00:05:20.020> it's<00:05:20.290> light

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590

you<00:05:20.830> can<00:05:20.950> pick<00:05:21.130> them<00:05:21.280> up<00:05:21.370> used<00:05:21.700> for<00:05:22.000> about<00:05:22.150> 250

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
you can pick them up used for about 250

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.420 
you can pick them up used for about 250
to<00:05:22.930> 300<00:05:23.500> just<00:05:23.650> depending<00:05:24.040> on<00:05:24.100> how<00:05:24.160> you're

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
to 300 just depending on how you're

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
looking out there with pricing and it's

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.580 
looking out there with pricing and it's
a<00:05:26.770> really<00:05:27.070> nice<00:05:27.340> light<00:05:28.030> lens<00:05:28.480> as<00:05:29.140> a<00:05:29.200> matter<00:05:29.500> of

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
a really nice light lens as a matter of

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.530 
a really nice light lens as a matter of
fact<00:05:29.890> between<00:05:30.669> if<00:05:30.910> you're<00:05:31.090> just<00:05:31.300> going<00:05:31.450> to

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
fact between if you're just going to

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.350 
fact between if you're just going to
pick<00:05:31.810> two<00:05:32.169> primes<00:05:32.530> to<00:05:32.680> shoot<00:05:33.010> with<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.730> 20<00:05:34.150> mil

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
pick two primes to shoot with the 20 mil

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.710 
pick two primes to shoot with the 20 mil
and<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:35.350> 50<00:05:35.740> mil<00:05:35.950> become<00:05:36.610> -<00:05:36.850> excellent<00:05:37.450> primes

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
and the 50 mil become - excellent primes

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.800 
and the 50 mil become - excellent primes
at<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.020> good<00:05:38.229> price<00:05:38.500> and<00:05:39.180> you<00:05:40.180> could<00:05:40.360> shoot<00:05:40.570> just

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
at a good price and you could shoot just

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.320 
at a good price and you could shoot just
about<00:05:40.960> anything<00:05:41.320> with<00:05:41.680> that<00:05:41.919> if<00:05:42.190> you're<00:05:43.120> doing

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
about anything with that if you're doing

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.940 
about anything with that if you're doing
portraits<00:05:43.630> or<00:05:44.050> at<00:05:44.140> a<00:05:44.169> wedding<00:05:44.410> whatnot

portraits or at a wedding whatnot

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.950 
portraits or at a wedding whatnot
because<00:05:45.130> the<00:05:45.370> 20<00:05:45.700> gives<00:05:45.880> you<00:05:46.030> your<00:05:46.180> wider<00:05:46.660> end

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
because the 20 gives you your wider end

because the 20 gives you your wider end
the<00:05:47.410> 50<00:05:47.800> gives<00:05:48.010> you<00:05:48.070> your<00:05:48.190> longer<00:05:48.610> and<00:05:48.790> they're

both<00:05:49.180> fast<00:05:49.570> lenses<00:05:50.080> and<00:05:50.260> they<00:05:50.710> work<00:05:50.950> very<00:05:50.979> well

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
both fast lenses and they work very well

excellent<00:06:14.860> primes<00:06:15.220> these<00:06:16.180> are<00:06:16.300> the<00:06:16.360> four

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
excellent primes these are the four

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.310 
excellent primes these are the four
primes<00:06:16.870> that<00:06:17.020> I<00:06:17.290> carry<00:06:17.680> a<00:06:17.800> lot<00:06:18.060> the<00:06:19.060> 50mm<00:06:19.570> 435

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
primes that I carry a lot the 50mm 435

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.430 
primes that I carry a lot the 50mm 435
the<00:06:20.830> 105<00:06:21.370> and<00:06:21.640> the<00:06:21.850> 20<00:06:22.210> mil<00:06:22.390> they're<00:06:23.290> all

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
the 105 and the 20 mil they're all

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.250 
the 105 and the 20 mil they're all
excellent<00:06:23.919> I<00:06:24.250> use<00:06:24.669> the<00:06:24.820> 105<00:06:25.240> in<00:06:25.419> place<00:06:25.690> of<00:06:25.900> the

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
excellent I use the 105 in place of the

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.469 
excellent I use the 105 in place of the
85<00:06:26.710> f-18<00:06:27.280> which<00:06:27.460> I<00:06:27.550> used<00:06:27.729> to<00:06:27.850> shoot<00:06:28.030> with<00:06:28.210> a<00:06:28.240> lot

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
85 f-18 which I used to shoot with a lot

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.260 
85 f-18 which I used to shoot with a lot
the<00:06:28.870> 105<00:06:29.410> has<00:06:29.590> nicer<00:06:29.979> bokeh<00:06:30.370> and<00:06:30.550> it<00:06:30.970> has<00:06:31.090> the

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
the 105 has nicer bokeh and it has the

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.450 
the 105 has nicer bokeh and it has the
VR<00:06:31.599> and<00:06:31.810> it<00:06:32.110> doubles<00:06:32.440> as<00:06:32.560> a<00:06:32.590> macro<00:06:33.039> so<00:06:33.280> that's

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
VR and it doubles as a macro so that's

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.250 
VR and it doubles as a macro so that's
why<00:06:33.640> it<00:06:33.700> replaced<00:06:34.120> the<00:06:34.240> 85<00:06:34.660> in<00:06:34.870> my<00:06:34.990> back

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
why it replaced the 85 in my back

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.940 
why it replaced the 85 in my back
those<00:06:35.950> are<00:06:36.100> my<00:06:36.190> four<00:06:36.460> favorite<00:06:36.640> primes<00:06:37.090> so

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
those are my four favorite primes so

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.980 
those are my four favorite primes so
that's<00:06:38.950> what<00:06:39.160> I<00:06:39.190> use<00:06:39.370> a<00:06:39.400> lot<00:06:39.730> on<00:06:39.940> the<00:06:40.090> d7000<00:06:40.930> I

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
that's what I use a lot on the d7000 I

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.320 
that's what I use a lot on the d7000 I
also<00:06:41.110> use<00:06:41.350> all<00:06:41.530> these<00:06:41.680> a<00:06:41.740> lot<00:06:41.980> on<00:06:42.100> my<00:06:42.220> D<00:06:42.280> 700<00:06:43.030> so

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
also use all these a lot on my D 700 so

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.690 
also use all these a lot on my D 700 so
if<00:06:43.510> if<00:06:44.470> you're<00:06:44.770> shooting<00:06:45.130> with<00:06:45.160> two<00:06:45.400> bodies

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
if if you're shooting with two bodies

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.940 
if if you're shooting with two bodies
like<00:06:45.880> I<00:06:46.030> am<00:06:46.180> an<00:06:46.330> FX<00:06:46.660> and<00:06:46.870> a<00:06:46.960> DX<00:06:47.350> I<00:06:47.590> have<00:06:47.710> a<00:06:47.740> D

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
like I am an FX and a DX I have a D

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.490 
like I am an FX and a DX I have a D
seven<00:06:48.250> hundred<00:06:48.550> and<00:06:48.670> the<00:06:48.910> d7000<00:06:49.780> I<00:06:49.900> shoot<00:06:50.380> with

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
seven hundred and the d7000 I shoot with

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.350 
seven hundred and the d7000 I shoot with
those<00:06:50.680> in<00:06:50.830> tandem<00:06:51.280> you<00:06:51.610> can<00:06:51.730> use<00:06:51.880> all<00:06:52.030> four<00:06:52.330> of

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
those in tandem you can use all four of

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.210 
those in tandem you can use all four of
these<00:06:52.510> primes<00:06:52.840> on<00:06:53.020> both<00:06:53.200> bodies<00:06:53.440> so<00:06:54.100> they

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
these primes on both bodies so they

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.730 
these primes on both bodies so they
become<00:06:54.460> even<00:06:54.760> more<00:06:54.940> versatile<00:06:55.510> so<00:06:56.230> stay<00:06:56.560> tuned

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
become even more versatile so stay tuned
