00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.270
 and today we are back in the channel 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.730
 welcome to a new video I hope that 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.230
 be super good and good welcome to a 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.809
 video in which I'm going to show you a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.809
 kind of new weapon in advance wolf 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.520
 double gold here and always always 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.140
 they kill when they are capturing the flag 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.029
 but we're not here to talk 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.010
 of that we are here to talk about a 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.189
 weapon so to speak new though 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.960
 it really is neither a weapon nor is it black 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.000
 you're a little weird but well now you go 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.669
 to see the gusts that I have been wearing the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.520
 sentinel that is important and so on 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.469
 is basically dispensable then 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.360
 I'm going to tell you a secret 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.670
 so to say that I really have not seen 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.200
 It's never to say I've never seen anyone 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.629
 talk about it never seen in a 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.210
 game never seen basically nothing with 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.700
 that and it's simply the following as 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.289
 I see nothing turret 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.059
 special so to speak but we take 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.390
 with the accessories we plant it in the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.620
 ground and pumas we have the turret as well 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 say that we can take it is a 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.550
 manual turret is as if they were our 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.920
 my no particular and as I am seeing 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.500
 has a mono laser but this is 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.729
 this is pretty weird not then this 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.409
 to comment there are three ways to 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.000
 customize the truth all good 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.009
 world knew that I existed at least 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.750
 I knew perfectly well that this existed 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.790
 the only thing that he never really saw 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.350
 used would never be in its potential and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.170
 well then I will comment and more or 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.509
 least to know that this 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.610
 it's not like the wind trees 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.100
 and nothing in a second is already 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.250
 dead and the truth is that this accessory 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.710
 the link with the turret so more very 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.270
 very well there are three types a kind of 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.700
 a thousand normal no that's a bit 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.560
 trash and after and two other types 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.539
 what is this from laser and one that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.810
 launches rockets in fact in this game 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.940
 you will see in a few moments with some 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.600
 quad fit and itch with this well it lay 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.970
 the second reads like the sole reviento 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.110
 as far as it is quite far it is very 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.670
 little time the truth that had me 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.860
 than to record a live for this because 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.659
 my mother as you see here I fuck this uncle 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.759
 killed him now it's I think it's the one that fit 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.619
 killed me this other today so quiet 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.920
 they're going to throw us a bomber 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.470
 this pretty rogue moment 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.410
 if they come and they leave me super stunned and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.540
 I say it's your ammunition center that 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.819
 it's going to be a little bit fail this but 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.470
 there starts to shoot second a double 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.660
 I say my mother a triple I make a 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.360
 I jump I kill this one killed the other four 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.950
 low one which here you can in just 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.890
 juste ammunition pretty enough 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.390
 epic we are not in war land and 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.310
 the truth is that it was pretty cool 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.860
 that then I'm just putting clips 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.560
 with what is being the machine is 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.599
 with the accessory of the series that I believe 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.459
 which is frankly the best flame 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.840
 like being a little useless the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.630
 I do not really tried much what I go 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.640
 being the rockets but good is 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.739
 a kind of mini one the other and that of 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.110
 the fish is a spear experts so 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.940
 I also do not think it is very useful not 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.769
 instead, if this one the truth is that 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.900
 going very well go much better than 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.819
 four I do not know how much mobility has more 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.500
 or less but here the truth that failed 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.330
 because he left here to each of the two 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.709
 shots two people and for each of 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
 both a little touch if the truth 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.890
 it fails a lot but I do not know for 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.230
 have fun for a while to do here a 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.000
 little fool are going pretty well this 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.500
 weapon and the truth that I needed that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.160
 reminded me that this existed not because 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.160
 with so much 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:29.290
 and that's nothing in half a second and it 's 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.890
 more than dead, the truth is not enough 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.959
 better than the four that the m1 that 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.569
 any of these lasers I do not know by 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.220
 what really but it does not go very well and 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.739
 is that above all it is very fun to 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.299
 trolling even if it's because you never 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.090
 I 've never seen any clip with this and it's 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.129
 relatively easy to remove not now 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.140
 I will put on screen the accessories that 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.610
 you need for this but I tell you 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.459
 I've never seen this any video of a 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.290
 trolley or from nowhere or anything and I do not know 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.030
 if it bothers you ideal that you would think that 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.609
 I try to get a live with this not 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.349
 It's worth 650 points of this streak that 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.340
 carries the rockets and so on is much more 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.989
 difficult you see this you have to 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.329
 practically close the performance and 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.450
 this guy at 6 meters because it did not last 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.879
 nothing half seconds is very good what 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.190
 it's been with the link, but not 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.840
 neither do we not forge a little more 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.220
 I believe that with laser it is with 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.840
 better going to go for that because of the good thing 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.180
 I have to gust attention here but 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.910
 here is that I do not know how anyone so much 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.320
 one put me well in my charge here to another 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.949
 is that you do not read it enough here 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.970
 in this area and he's pretty cool 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.800
 then good people below 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.600
 let's go with the accessories that you 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.610
 we have to place first in first 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.560
 place to have the normal card 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.570
 that always and always have to be 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.889
 removable then to disassemble it 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.020
 basically for the medium to be a 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.030
 turret can unmount if only 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.850
 we put removable will be the mini kun 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.850
 then if we put it removable and 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.440
 directed energy we will turn it into the 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.900
 laser beam that we have had before is 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.570
 say the first rally with bullets the 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.020
 second laser beams third the 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.699
 third way the last one would be putting him 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.169
 the cabriolet as they were called and 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.520
 rocket turrets 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.400
 so if we put those two 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.190
 accessories will become a spear 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.050
 here with basically and a pretty thing 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.970
 quite peculiar not a technique 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.250
 quite peculiar and good 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.810
 try it to see to see how it goes like this 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.130
 that nothing people this is basically everything 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.320
 I hope that good that I have 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.060
 served so that more or less the country that 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.490
 this exists I at least did not know 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.750
 before and I found it quite 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.370
 curious 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.050
 people if you want if you like this 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.220
 idea you can tell by the comments 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.200
 although I can try to record a live 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.330
 2.0 with any of these three variants 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.160
 I already tell you that you can use it because 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.110
 especially the closely divided and 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.120
 it also has a radar to a moral laser 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.950
 that are pretty cool and nothing 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.810
 a greeting I hope you liked that 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.810
 yes they liked me and see you
