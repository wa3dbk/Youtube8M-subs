the implementations that we've seen a
widgets<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.280> been<00:00:50.430> painfully<00:00:51.210> slow<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230

speeded<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:52.920> version<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.879> new

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
speeded up for this version for the new

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.150 
speeded up for this version for the new
year<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.570> we're<00:00:55.230> trying<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> optimize<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:56.129> for

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
year and we're trying to optimize it for

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.549 
year and we're trying to optimize it for
then<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.610> grab<00:00:57.000> your<00:00:57.149> chassis<00:00:57.570> what<00:00:58.440> we've

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
then you grab your chassis what we've

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.110 
then you grab your chassis what we've
got<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:58.710> today<00:00:58.980> obviously<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.579> six<00:00:59.850> months

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
got here today obviously it's six months

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.819 
got here today obviously it's six months
away<00:01:00.300> before<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:00.690> launch<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.170> its<00:01:01.320> prototype

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
away before they launch so its prototype

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.979 
away before they launch so its prototype
and<00:01:02.190> yeah<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.940> quick<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.660> will<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.840> much

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and yeah it's quick but it will be much

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.870 
and yeah it's quick but it will be much
faster<00:01:04.229> once<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.920> full<00:01:05.129> production<00:01:05.400> come<00:01:05.760> in

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
faster once the full production come in

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.070 
faster once the full production come in
there<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.270> summer<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.780> obviously<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
there in the summer so obviously the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.480 
there in the summer so obviously the
next<00:01:07.260> thing<00:01:07.380> we're<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> look<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:07.979> Tim<00:01:08.280> is

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
next thing we're going to look at Tim is

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.149 
next thing we're going to look at Tim is
internet<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.479> TV<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:10.799> do<00:01:10.950> with

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
internet on TV so what can we do with
