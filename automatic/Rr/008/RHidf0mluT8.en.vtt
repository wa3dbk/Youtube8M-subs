just<00:01:56.090> created<00:01:56.300> a<00:01:56.570> regular<00:01:57.080> game<00:01:57.230> and<00:01:57.730> went<00:01:58.730> to

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
just created a regular game and went to

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.170 
just created a regular game and went to
the<00:02:00.020> crypt<00:02:00.950> of<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.070> skeleton<00:02:01.490> king<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.820> just

the crypt of the skeleton king and just
left<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.960> game<00:02:03.110> at<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.979> very<00:02:04.250> moment<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:05.210> I

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
left the game at that very moment that I

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.230 
left the game at that very moment that I
went<00:02:05.750> inside<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.490> say<00:02:07.490> I'm<00:02:07.610> in<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.790> regular<00:02:08.119> game

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
went inside so say I'm in a regular game

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.170 
went inside so say I'm in a regular game
I'm<00:02:08.780> going<00:02:09.020> through<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:09.619> whole<00:02:09.820> trips<00:02:10.820> and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
I'm going through the whole trips and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.390 
I'm going through the whole trips and
all<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.810> stuff<00:02:12.350> here<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:12.680> though<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:13.040> found

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
all this stuff here and though I found

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.850 
all this stuff here and though I found
this<00:02:13.520> real<00:02:14.450> crypts<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.930> go<00:02:15.440> into<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.680> real

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
this real crypts I go into the real

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.949 
this real crypts I go into the real
crypts<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.220> then<00:02:16.459> now<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:16.880> would<00:02:17.209> leave<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:17.690> i

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
crypts and then now I would leave so i

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.460 
crypts and then now I would leave so i
would<00:02:18.170> get<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.530> way<00:02:18.680> point<00:02:18.920> right<00:02:19.070> there<00:02:19.209> so

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
would get that way point right there so

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.550 
would get that way point right there so
there<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.590> have<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.990> just<00:02:24.110> leave<00:02:24.440> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
there you have it and you just leave the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.350 
there you have it and you just leave the
game<00:02:24.709> at<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:24.980> point<00:02:25.100> if<00:02:25.490> you<00:02:25.640> were<00:02:25.730> in<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.940> real

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
game at this point if you were in a real

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.850 
game at this point if you were in a real
game<00:02:26.480> then<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.690> could<00:02:26.840> go<00:02:26.990> into<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.290> new<00:02:27.709> game

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
game then you could go into a new game

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.060 
game then you could go into a new game
so<00:02:28.580> very<00:02:28.910> easy<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.450> do<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:29.930> run<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.800> really

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
so very easy to do this run you really

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.640 
so very easy to do this run you really
wanted<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.490> get<00:02:31.850> some<00:02:32.120> rares<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:33.350> put<00:02:33.470> them<00:02:33.560> on

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
wanted to get some rares and put them on

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.560 
wanted to get some rares and put them on
the<00:02:33.709> auction<00:02:33.830> house<00:02:34.100> very<00:02:34.700> easy<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.360> it's

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
the auction house very easy and it's

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.110 
the auction house very easy and it's
just<00:02:35.750> something<00:02:36.110> that<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.320> hope<00:02:37.310> lizard<00:02:37.730> is

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
just something that a hope lizard is

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.270 
just something that a hope lizard is
looking<00:02:38.690> at<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.170> maybe<00:02:39.560> thinking<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.100> any

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
looking at and maybe thinking of any

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.610 
looking at and maybe thinking of any
strategy<00:02:40.730> on<00:02:40.880> how<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.120> save<00:02:41.570> wit<00:02:41.780> points<00:02:42.110> this

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
strategy on how to save wit points this

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.340 
strategy on how to save wit points this
and<00:02:42.769> that<00:02:42.890> unless<00:02:43.580> say<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:44.989> working<00:02:45.260> as

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
and that unless say this is working as

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.810 
and that unless say this is working as
intended<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.160> is<00:02:46.250> what<00:02:46.370> they<00:02:46.489> want<00:02:46.730> from

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
intended and this is what they want from

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.270 
intended and this is what they want from
the<00:02:46.940> game<00:02:47.090> then<00:02:47.269> that's<00:02:47.780> fine<00:02:47.900> too<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:49.130> really

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
the game then that's fine too it really

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.180 
the game then that's fine too it really
doesn't<00:02:49.519> matter<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.790> me<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:49.910> much<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:51.190> it

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
doesn't matter to me that much so it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.560 
doesn't matter to me that much so it
could<00:02:52.340> go<00:02:52.430> either<00:02:52.459> way<00:02:52.670> maybe<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.269> is<00:02:53.390> what

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
could go either way maybe this is what

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.750 
could go either way maybe this is what
they<00:02:53.690> intended<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.200> happen<00:02:54.500> just<00:02:55.220> have<00:02:55.370> you

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
they intended to happen just have you

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.850 
they intended to happen just have you
know<00:02:55.790> runs<00:02:56.209> like<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.870> go<00:02:57.410> into<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.739> game

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
know runs like this and go into the game

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.000 
know runs like this and go into the game
but<00:02:58.420> seeing<00:02:59.420> as<00:02:59.510> they<00:02:59.750> did<00:02:59.930> block<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.590> actual

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
but seeing as they did block the actual

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.690 
but seeing as they did block the actual
skeleton<00:03:01.820> king<00:03:02.000> way<00:03:02.630> point<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.440> very

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
skeleton king way point in the very

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.100 
skeleton king way point in the very
beginning<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.209> game<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.540> was<00:03:05.630> like<00:03:05.840> um

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
beginning of the game it was like um

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.910 
beginning of the game it was like um
beta<00:03:06.950> patch<00:03:07.190> 7<00:03:08.060> we<00:03:08.959> figured<00:03:09.320> out<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.799> was<00:03:09.890> a

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
beta patch 7 we figured out it was a

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.280 
beta patch 7 we figured out it was a
fiction<00:03:10.340> FXR<00:03:10.970> figured<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.630> out<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:11.930> he<00:03:12.080> said

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
fiction FXR figured it out and he said

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.160 
fiction FXR figured it out and he said
um<00:03:12.489> told<00:03:13.489> me<00:03:13.610> about<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.060> i<00:03:14.390> showed<00:03:15.019> it<00:03:15.110> on

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
um told me about it and i showed it on

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.400 
um told me about it and i showed it on
my<00:03:15.320> video<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:17.420> doesn't<00:03:17.660> seem<00:03:17.810> like<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:18.140> is

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
my video so it doesn't seem like this is

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.890 
my video so it doesn't seem like this is
the<00:03:18.739> intended<00:03:19.100> way<00:03:19.910> they<00:03:20.150> wanted<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.630> game

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
the intended way they wanted to a game

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.330 
the intended way they wanted to a game
to<00:03:21.049> work<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:21.560> i<00:03:21.590> don't<00:03:21.830> know<00:03:21.890> if<00:03:22.010> they're<00:03:22.190> going

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
to work so i don't know if they're going

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.530 
to work so i don't know if they're going
to

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
to

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.929 
to
change<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.989> or<00:03:23.230> what's<00:03:23.829> going<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.129> happen<00:03:24.400> with

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
change it or what's going to happen with

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:26.940 
change it or what's going to happen with
the<00:03:25.120> game<00:03:25.299> but<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.659> still<00:03:25.870> works<00:03:26.049> in<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.620> game

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
the game but it still works in the game
