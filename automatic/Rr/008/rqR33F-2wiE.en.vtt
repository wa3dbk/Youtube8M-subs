00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
that profile one two profile one I could

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.330 
that profile one two profile one I could
set<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.890> 1000<00:03:38.790> Hertz<00:03:39.170> whatever<00:03:40.170> dpi<00:03:40.590> change

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
set it to 1000 Hertz whatever dpi change

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.740 
set it to 1000 Hertz whatever dpi change
the<00:03:41.400> sensitivity<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.060> which<00:03:42.570> I'm<00:03:42.660> not

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
the sensitivity of that which I'm not

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.699 
the sensitivity of that which I'm not
gonna<00:03:42.900> have<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.170> round<00:03:43.320> because<00:03:43.500> they<00:03:43.620> you

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
gonna have to round because they you

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.390 
gonna have to round because they you
basically<00:03:44.010> only<00:03:44.250> use<00:03:44.370> one<00:03:44.580> profile<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:46.220> on<00:03:47.220> to

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
basically only use one profile and on to

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.830 
basically only use one profile and on to
the<00:03:47.459> fly<00:03:47.640> sensitivity<00:03:48.269> which<00:03:48.390> is<00:03:48.510> really<00:03:48.750> nice

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
the fly sensitivity which is really nice

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.330 
the fly sensitivity which is really nice
