00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
did with the rear diffuser panel to

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.820 
did with the rear diffuser panel to
really<00:01:51.430> help<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.330> ear<00:01:52.720> as<00:01:53.020> you're<00:01:53.380> traveling

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830

really help that ear as you're traveling
through<00:01:53.980> the<00:01:54.070> vehicle<00:01:54.630> get<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.660> little<00:01:56.080> bit<00:01:56.170> of

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
through the vehicle get a little bit of

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.990 
through the vehicle get a little bit of
turbulence<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.920> get<00:01:57.100> out<00:01:57.280> of<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.610> way<00:01:57.760> of<00:01:57.940> the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
turbulence and get out of the way of the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.420 
turbulence and get out of the way of the
vehicle<00:01:58.510> and<00:01:58.660> then<00:01:59.200> also<00:01:59.440> integrated<00:02:00.280> the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
vehicle and then also integrated the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.630 
vehicle and then also integrated the
dual<00:02:00.850> exhaust<00:02:01.420> into<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.050> vehicle<00:02:02.500> so<00:02:02.740> we<00:02:03.400> put

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
dual exhaust into the vehicle so we put

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.630 
dual exhaust into the vehicle so we put
in<00:02:03.760> a<00:02:04.380> converted<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.710> dual<00:02:06.430> exhaust

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
in a converted it to a dual exhaust

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.210 
in a converted it to a dual exhaust
system<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.480> have<00:02:08.289> them<00:02:08.500> integrated<00:02:08.979> right

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
system and have them integrated right

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.610 
system and have them integrated right
into<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.729> rear<00:02:09.909> diffuser<00:02:10.329> so<00:02:11.230> as<00:02:11.349> you<00:02:11.439> can<00:02:11.560> see

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
into the rear diffuser so as you can see

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.710 
into the rear diffuser so as you can see
our<00:02:11.980> goal<00:02:12.310> with<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.760> two
