00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.340
 Garlic 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.900
 can help with the taste is garlic 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.700
 grind it up again all the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.200
 taste of man first thing we're going to 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.730
 do is 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.890
 on the back 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.890
 let's give a little garlic 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.960
 cumin 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.290
 a tip of oregano 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.440
 Take a very hot pan 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.240
 we add a jet of oil and 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.280
 pointed smoke like the vein and we're going to 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.280
 let her start working 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.950
 we have the onion cut in a pen 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.950

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.640
 and we are going to give it 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.890
 because she 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.970
 that's when we would see the tomato 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.680
 the dark background 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:04.060
 so that you have together you will be juicy and rich 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.060
 we return to the fire a couple of minutes 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.360
 already 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.510

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.120
 we have a cream pre-cooked pasta 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.250
 huancaína 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.330
 and a little bit of evaporated milk that is 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.630
 the touch of the plate 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.910
 and that if we work at medium heat 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.670

 and we will be what 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.230
 is solved with milk a little bit and 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.190

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:50.360
