00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.910
 yes 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.960
 ah 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.139
 welcome to a new video tutorial of 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.150
 photography on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.730
 learn how to convert a photograph 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.029
 to black and white in a few simple steps 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.650
 in adobe photoshop is this tutorial 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.450
 applies to all versions of 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.820
 photoshop so do not go to 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.580
 worry good because we do this 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.929
 video tutorial simply because 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.970
 many people are using 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.010
 external software only to do 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.930
 a conversion of photographs to white and 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.879
 black and in it they are using the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.000
 software that are quite expensive for 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.550
 they use photoshop that is not even so 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.010
 expensive has a very tool 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.809
 very accurate and usable called 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.070
 conversion to black and white not what 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.020
 we find in the image section adjustments 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.789
 black and white between black and white 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.760
 I realize that automatically 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.460
 photography turns white and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.750
 black obviously because we have chopped that 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.850
 selection we have adjustments 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.050
 preset depending on the filter 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.090
 that we are going to give to our 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.220
 photographs for example gum filter 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.190
 neutral this is already applied for landscapes 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.340
 if we want a red filter 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.630
 and well let's see more green filter 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.610
 etcetera good but the best would be 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.620
 leave it by default by default 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.810
 we will have our image clearly 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.120
 original but applied to a base of 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.170
 zero saturation in what would be 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.910
 each one of those colors here we can 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.400
 activate and deactivate the preview 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.050
 from before and after here we can 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.880
 set the black and white we want 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.490
 work in the areas detected as 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.840
 for example this and good here 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.480
 depending on the color that we 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.820
 we want to work we also have the 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.260
 part of the yellows etc you 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.420
 can work with all these values 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.160
 until you find the black and white 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.620
 desired obviously these use 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.800
 very much in the photographs what 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.479
 would be being good ok portrait here 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.860
 the configurations will arrive and you 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.410
 depending on what you want 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.150
 there is an option called nuance this 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.370
 option is if we want to work 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.470
 the saturation part and the tone to the 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.890
 ok time if we want to take stock 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.930
 exact in a color quality in a 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.790
 exact color temperature but as not 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.290
 we want so we can leave it with 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.920
 zero saturation that would be the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.110
 same white 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.910
 all of selecting matisse and working 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.940
 only with the aura of colors with the 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.890
 rgb and the floors and temples and 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.750
 magentas and this would be the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.700
 purpose of this tutorial this tutorial 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.459
 it's a bit quick but we realize 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.840
 that applies a lot and helps us 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.640
 too much in what would be 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.700
 our black and white photographs 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.670
 to obviously have them stored in 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.709
 our computers or else for some 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.440
 kind of contest I hope you have them
