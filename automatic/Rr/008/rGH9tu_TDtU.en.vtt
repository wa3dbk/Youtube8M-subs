barrier<00:03:19.959> which<00:03:20.319> is<00:03:20.500> really<00:03:20.799> weird<00:03:21.090> because

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
barrier which is really weird because

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.210

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
are on the same side which this may turn

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.830 
are on the same side which this may turn
into<00:03:29.620> something<00:03:30.130> that's<00:03:30.519> going<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:31.000> be<00:03:31.090> fairly

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
into something that's going to be fairly
