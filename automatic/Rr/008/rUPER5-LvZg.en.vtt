 Man in a shirt and one regatinha

 You will need a shirt and 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.680
 lightweight scissors also 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.719
 increase type of doing has neither error 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.820

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.110
 the first we will do is chrome 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:01.170
 Look, then you're going to need a 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.530
 take this light the only observe find 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.750
 a light that is tight little're having 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.549
 her leg tight because because she's going 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.700
 stay on the arm if you take a law 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.549
 very wide it will look strange 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.960
 you can also cut and make a body 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.060
 when curtinha 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.670
 but here in the car and will make one of 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.159
 longer line demand then the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.150
 ideal is that you wear legging with 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:31.799
 tight leg, you 're going to bend it to the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:40.829
 normal but you stretch a surface and 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:42.659
 come here as tinho and look that thing 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.570
 People are going to do it, we're going to cut it. 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.750
 This one was not here to do that. 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.750
 court 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:13.349
 The agent only cut and half a dozen and she 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.540
 stayed like this, people like that are 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.430
 Strange looks kinda ugly but I'll 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.970
 I'll dress and you'll see how it goes. 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.830
 cool the ball stays so I'll put 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.080
 a body for you to see how it is 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.940
 But first we're going to play the cat and 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.310
 I ask you now I had to do it. 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.500
 a 10 regatta are using now that is 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.140
 much bigger and a bit more 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.690
 robertinho of the act 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.489
 We're going in a shirt. 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.470
 Can you borrow a shirt from your husband? 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:52.739
 and your boyfriend, your brother, and you were well 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:55.260
 stretched and tailored people will 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.390
 depend on your taste is more for you 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.989
 do a little lower here 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.709
 side 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.970
 You mark three of them are here. 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:08.840
 under the arm 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.840
 You will give three fingers and mark 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.030
 here you will score two fingers 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.720
 Now we'll make people go. 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.790
 join're 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.790
 We'll connect this point at that point. 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:49.740
 is to do the same thing from the other side here 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:49.740
 it's three fingers and here two 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:09.340
 Now we're going to join the collar now. 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.350
 People this will depend on your taste if 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.410
 You want a more dug top 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.829
 you can increase a lot 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.440
 cut but if not you can cut only that 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.240
 around the collar are you just take this 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.580
 now, do not you? 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:30.990
 so that's what I'm gonna do, it's just cut 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.990
 Who turns the collar? 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:49.940
 there are very simple people the now also the 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.190
 differential is you stretch is so that 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.560
 You cut this fabric, it looks really ugly. 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.160
 at the time he chopped all such 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.100
 you pick up it opens and you do not pick it up any more 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.990
 just because you roll the bridge 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.480
 so he folds and gets a little regatinha 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:15.830
 like this 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:18.530
 now it also has a finish 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.490
 more cute 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.350
 This is how it is now I'm going to wait to go back 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.050
 to show you the final result 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.980
 it's good, then it's the result 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.990
 Last 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:35.420
 Look, I thought it was cute then. 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.610
 This is Tite himself reminding you that 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.110
 to give the finish it's just you pull 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.930
 here bee 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.120
 only you pull the fabric he takes 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.280
 that cut liver knows it gives a 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.070
 look fine fabric fine workmanship 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.790
 I chose to use it in this way. 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.950
 goaninha 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.440
 but you can put normal knows how 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:58.130
 if it was a normal blouse but I think 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:01.930
 cool here and there we did not even want to 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.850
 finding back also looked pretty 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:10.060
 because it was this cut and come stay 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.060
 well defeat money right 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:17.030
 Amanda you can pull or you can 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.070
 cut as I said so I just in the 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.900
 It's finally gone so I think it's good. 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.250
 cool then if you have a pair of pants 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.580
 legging you never again what is and 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.010

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.160
 you can cut customize transform 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.470
 in the cloud so beautiful that this is the 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.750
 final result of the race had I 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.210
 I also love it, it's very cool. 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.880
 Oh how I told you guys cut three 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.190

 Or you can put it in you. 

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:08.870

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.259

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.849
