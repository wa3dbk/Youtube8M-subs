it's<00:01:50.470> all<00:01:50.590> been<00:01:50.740> about<00:01:50.830> change<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.460> spring

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
it's all been about change to the spring

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.330 
it's all been about change to the spring
rate<00:01:51.970> or<00:01:52.120> the<00:01:52.270> air<00:01:52.720> pressure<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.470> having

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
rate or the air pressure and and having

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.980 
rate or the air pressure and and having
that<00:01:54.460> kind<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:54.760> adjustment<00:01:55.300> is<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.630> really

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
that kind of adjustment is is really

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.980 
that kind of adjustment is is really
something<00:01:56.290> you<00:01:56.320> can<00:01:56.820> really<00:01:57.820> work<00:01:58.060> on<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.600> make

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
something you can really work on to make

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.110 
something you can really work on to make
those<00:01:59.170> like<00:01:59.620> really<00:01:59.920> small<00:02:00.220> changes<00:02:00.730> every

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
those like really small changes every

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.880 
those like really small changes every
world<00:02:01.330> cup<00:02:01.390> comes<00:02:01.750> down<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.170> two<00:02:02.620> milliseconds

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
world cup comes down to two milliseconds

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.560 
world cup comes down to two milliseconds
whether<00:02:03.550> you<00:02:03.730> you're<00:02:04.030> winning<00:02:04.270> or<00:02:04.390> losing

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
whether you you're winning or losing

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.630 
whether you you're winning or losing
your<00:02:04.840> near<00:02:04.960> so<00:02:05.170> having<00:02:05.950> some<00:02:06.130> of<00:02:06.220> that<00:02:06.370> you<00:02:06.490> can

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
your near so having some of that you can

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.660 
your near so having some of that you can
alter<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.240> work<00:02:07.570> with<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.990> guys<00:02:08.170> at<00:02:08.470> Fox<00:02:08.800> to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
alter and work with the guys at Fox to

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.700 
alter and work with the guys at Fox to
test<00:02:09.910> out<00:02:10.119> new<00:02:10.390> things<00:02:10.420> at<00:02:10.990> every<00:02:11.500> race<00:02:11.680> you

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
test out new things at every race you

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.890 
test out new things at every race you
know<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.070> can<00:02:12.220> really<00:02:12.420> really<00:02:13.420> narrow<00:02:13.750> down

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
know you can really really narrow down

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.140 
know you can really really narrow down
those<00:02:14.110> fine<00:02:14.380> changes<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.160> having<00:02:15.820> sent<00:02:16.060> what

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
those fine changes and having sent what

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.400 
those fine changes and having sent what
your<00:02:16.270> judgment<00:02:16.630> in<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.750> shock<00:02:16.990> is<00:02:17.170> really

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
your judgment in a shock is really

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.470 
your judgment in a shock is really
really<00:02:17.770> pushing<00:02:18.190> pushing<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.060> boundaries<00:02:19.300> I

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
really pushing pushing the boundaries I

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.680 
really pushing pushing the boundaries I
think<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:21.100> then<00:02:21.310> we've<00:02:21.640> tested<00:02:21.850> them<00:02:22.030> at<00:02:22.450> home

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
think and then we've tested them at home

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.000 
think and then we've tested them at home
as<00:02:22.900> well<00:02:23.020> like<00:02:23.230> we've<00:02:23.350> testing<00:02:23.650> them<00:02:23.740> at<00:02:23.830> home

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
as well like we've testing them at home

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.850 
as well like we've testing them at home
and<00:02:24.280> start<00:02:24.490> of<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.640> year<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.840> gusting<00:02:26.740> like

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
and start of the year so gusting like

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.080 
and start of the year so gusting like
the<00:02:26.980> murder<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.459> all<00:02:27.550> sorts<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:27.910> conditions

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
the murder and all sorts of conditions

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.840 
the murder and all sorts of conditions
and<00:02:28.510> then<00:02:28.660> we<00:02:28.810> go<00:02:28.930> racing<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:29.740> like<00:02:29.950> it's

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
and then we go racing and it's like it's

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.150 
and then we go racing and it's like it's
hardly<00:02:31.209> knows<00:02:31.450> you're<00:02:32.350> riding<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.770> all<00:02:32.950> day

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
hardly knows you're riding it all day

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.340 
hardly knows you're riding it all day
every<00:02:33.430> day<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.880> tracks<00:02:34.390> like<00:02:34.630> flat<00:02:35.110> out

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
every day and the tracks like flat out

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.600 
every day and the tracks like flat out
and<00:02:35.560> it's<00:02:35.680> dry<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.250> then<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.459> go<00:02:36.550> to

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
and it's dry and then you go to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.550 
and it's dry and then you go to
different<00:02:36.820> race<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:37.330> muddy<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:37.750> when<00:02:37.990> so

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
different race it's muddy and when so

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.990 
different race it's muddy and when so
we've<00:02:38.680> really<00:02:38.980> tested<00:02:39.280> them<00:02:39.430> under<00:02:39.670> like

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
we've really tested them under like

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.790 
we've really tested them under like
pretty<00:02:40.390> much<00:02:40.480> every<00:02:40.900> condition<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:41.620> out

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
pretty much every condition like out

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.160 
pretty much every condition like out
there<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.370> they<00:02:43.030> have<00:02:43.150> loads<00:02:43.420> down<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.660> saw<00:02:43.959> and

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
there and they have loads down a saw and

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.229 
there and they have loads down a saw and
you<00:02:44.260> know<00:02:44.410> it's<00:02:44.560> been<00:02:44.739> it's<00:02:45.370> been<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.580> it's<00:02:46.000> been

working<00:02:54.310> with<00:02:54.489> Marcus<00:02:54.970> Simmons<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.420> lot<00:02:55.570> just

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
working with Marcus Simmons a lot just

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.410 
working with Marcus Simmons a lot just
doing<00:02:56.500> runs<00:02:56.739> on<00:02:57.010> different<00:02:57.489> courses<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.120> and

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
taking notes on what was working we

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.520 
taking notes on what was working we
would<00:03:01.030> do<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.209> lot<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.420> time<00:03:01.510> runs<00:03:02.019> so<00:03:02.290> we<00:03:02.380> could

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
would do a lot of time runs so we could

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.530 
would do a lot of time runs so we could
really<00:03:02.769> see<00:03:02.980> like<00:03:03.250> how<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.940> changes<00:03:04.390> were

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
really see like how the changes were

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.210 
really see like how the changes were
affecting<00:03:04.930> our<00:03:05.019> times<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.800> could<00:03:06.190> really

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
affecting our times and I could really

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.670 
affecting our times and I could really
see<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.730> time<00:03:06.940> was<00:03:07.180> was<00:03:07.750> affected<00:03:08.260> by<00:03:08.290> what<00:03:08.560> we

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
see the time was was affected by what we

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.420 
see the time was was affected by what we
change<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.220> over<00:03:10.120> this<00:03:10.239> winter<00:03:10.930> just<00:03:11.080> gone

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
change so over this winter just gone

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.460 
change so over this winter just gone
fitzy<00:03:12.430> worked<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.760> lot<00:03:12.910> on<00:03:13.080> making<00:03:14.080> the

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
fitzy worked a lot on making the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.259 
fitzy worked a lot on making the
internals<00:03:14.950> how<00:03:15.070> we<00:03:15.130> wanted<00:03:15.459> them<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:15.970> what

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
internals how we wanted them and what

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.540 
internals how we wanted them and what
was<00:03:16.390> going<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.600> work<00:03:16.750> for<00:03:17.019> us<00:03:17.250> same<00:03:18.250> with<00:03:18.459> the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
was going to work for us same with the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.390 
was going to work for us same with the
shop<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:19.440> we<00:03:20.440> really<00:03:20.739> found<00:03:20.950> like<00:03:21.250> our

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
shop and so we really found like our

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.370 
shop and so we really found like our
times<00:03:21.670> on<00:03:21.940> certain<00:03:22.510> courses<00:03:22.810> we<00:03:23.019> were<00:03:23.110> shaving

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
times on certain courses we were shaving

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.070 
times on certain courses we were shaving
times<00:03:23.739> off<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:24.519> think<00:03:25.269> just<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.780> small

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
times off and I think just the small
