00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
that body and here in 2010 we decided to

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.650 
that body and here in 2010 we decided to
take<00:02:34.959> our<00:02:35.140> Punisher<00:02:35.620> line<00:02:35.860> we've<00:02:36.430> been

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
take our Punisher line we've been

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.449 
take our Punisher line we've been
utilizing<00:02:37.660> on<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.170> eighth<00:02:38.290> scale<00:02:38.560> scene<00:02:38.860> and

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
utilizing on the eighth scale scene and

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.370 
utilizing on the eighth scale scene and
sort<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.820> moving<00:02:40.030> some<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.630> those<00:02:40.690> concepts<00:02:41.200> in

sort of moving some of those concepts in

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.770 
sort of moving some of those concepts in
the<00:02:41.470> 10<00:02:41.650> scale<00:02:41.920> we

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
the 10 scale we

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.570 
the 10 scale we
basically<00:02:44.440> where<00:02:44.650> we<00:02:44.740> started<00:02:45.040> here<00:02:45.250> was<00:02:45.430> with

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
basically where we started here was with

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.550 
basically where we started here was with
our<00:02:45.640> high<00:02:45.880> flow<00:02:46.150> body<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:47.140> we<00:02:47.230> started

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
our high flow body and we started

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.590 
our high flow body and we started
altering<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.460> position<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.090> cab<00:02:49.270> in<00:02:49.510> the

edges on the side some of the things
that<00:03:04.540> we<00:03:04.660> originally<00:03:04.840> introduced<00:03:05.500> back<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.040> o3

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610

on<00:03:06.730> our<00:03:06.850> first<00:03:07.090> body<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.810> they<00:03:08.230> were<00:03:08.290> really

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
on our first body and they were really

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.170 
on our first body and they were really
proud<00:03:08.770> of<00:03:08.830> those<00:03:09.070> concepts<00:03:09.610> we<00:03:09.820> think<00:03:10.030> they

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
proud of those concepts we think they

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.699

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
the two-wheel power look a little

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.260 
the two-wheel power look a little
different<00:03:25.950> looking<00:03:26.950> at<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.160> b44<00:03:27.760> Punisher

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
different looking at the b44 Punisher

out<00:03:32.680> there<00:03:32.860> in<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.040> track<00:03:33.330> people<00:03:34.330> since<00:03:34.630> we

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
out there in the track people since we

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.180 
out there in the track people since we
introduced<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.230> at<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.470> hotrod<00:03:35.800> shootout

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
introduced it at the hotrod shootout

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.710 
introduced it at the hotrod shootout
people<00:03:36.550> are<00:03:36.610> really<00:03:36.760> all<00:03:36.970> over<00:03:37.000> us<00:03:37.390> they<00:03:37.570> love

the<00:03:37.870> way<00:03:37.989> this<00:03:38.170> thing<00:03:38.410> looks<00:03:38.580> looks<00:03:39.580> fast<00:03:39.850> on

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
the way this thing looks looks fast on

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.490 
the way this thing looks looks fast on
the<00:03:40.150> track<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.600> looks<00:03:40.780> different<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.380> I

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
the track and looks different and I

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.500 
the track and looks different and I
think<00:03:41.709> that's<00:03:41.890> what<00:03:42.010> people<00:03:42.130> like<00:03:42.370> we<00:03:43.120> started

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
think that's what people like we started

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.860 
think that's what people like we started
again<00:03:44.320> with<00:03:44.470> our<00:03:44.590> high<00:03:44.739> flow<00:03:45.040> body<00:03:45.310> or<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.180> b44

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
again with our high flow body or the b44

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.270 
again with our high flow body or the b44
and<00:03:47.470> we<00:03:47.530> started<00:03:47.799> playing<00:03:48.010> with<00:03:48.130> the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
and we started playing with the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.890 
and we started playing with the
positioning<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:48.940> cab<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.510> treatment

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
positioning of the cab and the treatment

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.070 
positioning of the cab and the treatment
behind<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.320> cab<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:51.489> heights<00:03:51.870> really<00:03:52.870> along

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
behind the cab the heights really along

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.990 
behind the cab the heights really along
the<00:03:53.200> sides<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.860> hard<00:03:54.070> chamfer<00:03:54.519> edges<00:03:54.820> which

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
the sides the hard chamfer edges which

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.420 
the sides the hard chamfer edges which
we<00:03:55.180> had<00:03:55.360> on<00:03:55.390> our<00:03:55.660> original<00:03:56.110> VJ<00:03:56.650> for<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.250> beef

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
we had on our original VJ for the beef

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.699 
we had on our original VJ for the beef
44<00:03:58.120> body<00:03:58.390> we're<00:03:58.900> keeping<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.350> lot<00:03:59.500> of<00:03:59.530> those
