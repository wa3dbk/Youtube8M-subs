in<00:00:03.870> first<00:00:04.230> grade<00:00:04.470> when<00:00:04.770> I<00:00:04.799> was<00:00:04.980> painting<00:00:05.279> with

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
in first grade when I was painting with

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.369 
in first grade when I was painting with
poster<00:00:05.879> paints<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.359> painted<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.960> boat<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.319> I

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
poster paints I painted a boat and I

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.780 
poster paints I painted a boat and I
made<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.680> smoke<00:00:07.980> go<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.400> right<00:00:08.580> direction

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
made the smoke go the right direction

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.540 
made the smoke go the right direction
and<00:00:09.330> my<00:00:09.599> first<00:00:10.380> grade<00:00:10.559> teacher<00:00:10.590> told<00:00:11.160> my<00:00:11.340> mom

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
and my first grade teacher told my mom

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.360 
and my first grade teacher told my mom
you<00:00:12.300> should<00:00:12.509> nurture<00:00:12.900> his<00:00:13.259> artistic<00:00:13.620> ability

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
you should nurture his artistic ability

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.599 
you should nurture his artistic ability
I've<00:00:14.969> been<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> visual<00:00:15.719> person<00:00:15.960> ever<00:00:16.770> since<00:00:17.250> I

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
I've been a visual person ever since I

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.630 
I've been a visual person ever since I
was<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.270> our<00:00:18.510> director<00:00:18.990> I'm<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.199> designer<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.949> I

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
was in our director I'm a designer and I

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.990 
was in our director I'm a designer and I
just<00:00:20.820> love<00:00:21.210> how<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:22.140> cube<00:00:22.439> looks<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.279> mean<00:00:23.730> it's

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
just love how the cube looks I mean it's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000 
just love how the cube looks I mean it's
just<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.539> coolest-looking<00:00:25.080> computer<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
just the coolest-looking computer on the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.210 
just the coolest-looking computer on the
planet

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.890 

the<00:00:31.220> first<00:00:31.430> reaction<00:00:31.820> I<00:00:31.910> had<00:00:31.939> to<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:32.390> size<00:00:32.570> of

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
the first reaction I had to the size of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.840 
the first reaction I had to the size of
the<00:00:33.020> g4<00:00:33.380> cube<00:00:33.410> was<00:00:33.950> really<00:00:34.400> one<00:00:34.550> of<00:00:34.579> amazement

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
the g4 cube was really one of amazement

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.040 
the g4 cube was really one of amazement
because<00:00:35.300> if<00:00:35.420> you<00:00:35.510> had<00:00:35.600> asked<00:00:35.750> me<00:00:35.840> in<00:00:35.989> advance

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
because if you had asked me in advance

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.750 
because if you had asked me in advance
how<00:00:36.500> small<00:00:37.030> can<00:00:38.030> a<00:00:38.090> supercomputer<00:00:39.050> be<00:00:39.199> I<00:00:39.760> never

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
how small can a supercomputer be I never

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.939 
how small can a supercomputer be I never

we could remove both visual and audible

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.670 
we could remove both visual and audible
clutter<00:02:38.600> so<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.720> team<00:02:39.930> figured<00:02:40.290> out<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.410> way<00:02:40.620> to

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
clutter so the team figured out a way to

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.400

actually<00:02:41.010> remove<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.910> fan<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:43.019> products

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
actually remove the fan the products

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.229 
actually remove the fan the products
