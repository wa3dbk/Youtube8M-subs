00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
to make the head and then mini cutters

food coloring from Emery colors I find

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.510 
food coloring from Emery colors I find
it<00:00:54.420> really<00:00:54.600> useful<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.410> let<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.800> colored

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
it really useful to let the colored

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.760 
it really useful to let the colored
icing<00:00:56.730> rest<00:00:57.329> overnight<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:58.320> least<00:00:58.530> for

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
icing rest overnight or at least for

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.389 
icing rest overnight or at least for
several<00:00:59.070> hours<00:00:59.219> as<00:00:59.640> it<00:01:00.059> helps<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.190> color<00:01:02.190> to

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
several hours as it helps the color to

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.899 
several hours as it helps the color to
develop<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.210> darkens<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.949> matures<00:01:05.580> I

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
develop and it darkens as it matures I

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.179 
develop and it darkens as it matures I
would<00:01:06.090> say<00:01:07.100> especially<00:01:08.330> this<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.390> really

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
would say especially this is really

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.830 
would say especially this is really

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.810 

and<00:01:50.620> then<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.640> just<00:01:51.880> have<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.180> let<00:01:52.800> this<00:01:53.820> layer

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
and then you just have to let this layer

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.210 
and then you just have to let this layer
dry<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.540> won't<00:01:55.750> take<00:01:55.930> too<00:01:56.170> long<00:01:56.200> just<00:01:56.980> couple

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
dry it won't take too long just couple

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.860 
dry it won't take too long just couple
hours<00:01:57.670> because<00:01:58.090> these<00:01:58.240> are<00:01:58.420> really<00:01:58.630> small

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
hours because these are really small

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.200 
hours because these are really small
sections<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.590> then<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.280> can<00:02:00.460> take<00:02:00.700> your<00:02:00.760> lead
