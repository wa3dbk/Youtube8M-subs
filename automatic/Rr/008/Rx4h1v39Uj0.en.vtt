 langton what a craftsman is 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.599
 practically the map where the is done 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.189
 prologue of gta then to activate 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.110
 this trend is nania to press f4 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.480
 we have a lot of options between which 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.730
 we can change our character 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.800
 and make it any neither hurt us 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.510
 we want is in this thing we will make gods 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.149
 video do not worry that the videos there 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.559
 I'll do something about where the fuck is 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.460
 going my dog ​​but got shit 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.250
 on him but because he is leaving 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.289
 went crazy saw the cow went to 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.629
 fuck is we can do a lot of things 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.219
 marani spal to spur all vehicles 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.190
 what we want is meanwhile I want 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.680
 put the day ok perfect time 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.930
 do you expect there is a menu in this in 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.210
 this training is dead anton let's go 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.189
 is so let's do blog 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.260
 basically nothing changes in the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.000
 game because it does not change later 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.040
 a cock but to go to our anton 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.110
 what we have to do we have to take a 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 vehicle not to fire a vehicle 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.490
 probably a helicopter o 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.280
 even a much better hydra and 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.259
 we must head to this point in the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.850
 map that I will show you in this area 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.530
 of map to that we will arrive in those of 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.750
 map we will see immediately that it is practically 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.270
 Instantly displays the map 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.430
 because north of hampton is a part already 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.920
 existing start only that it does not come 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.049
 loaded the maco you see already lunge them 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.820
 the map shows the music 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.409
 of nettle in spa born because of its own 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.780
 the santos attacked , however, when 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.460
 We normally play the game 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.110
 obviously it doesn't load the map because 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.670
 we do not need it 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.500
 and here we are now we try 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.630
 to land without breaking the helicopter 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.130
 and without possibly dying here 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.110
 perfect than manual landing 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.329
 let's go play the vehicle for 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.700
 go around freely have tria 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.530
 norton from really cool guys 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.330
 let us assume that I like a sultan 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.979
 perfect rest we go around 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.700
 guys to make it even more 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.480
 pussy still the most thing 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.269
 let's go into the reader and put snow light 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.930
 so it's practically snowing it's looks 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.400
 that we are really in the snow is immersed 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.959
 in this map for then we go to 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.940
 explore this area then then 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.769
 then it's the first time I 've ever been there 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.480
 showed the train is just to see 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.280
 if it works, then we will explore it 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.470
 together we will see what will happen this is 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.840
 the part where people do their mission 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.459
 that is, where it escapes eg with 3 euro which 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.830
 there is the old woman taken hostage 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.569
 let's see what 's around here 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.010
 let's say what's behind there 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.810
 basically nothing this map e 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.340
 this hangar is not well cared for either 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.530
 see what kind split in two by one 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.750
 part of the map very little care also 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.489
 if there can be because the fuck we do 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.530
 just a mission that would n't make sense 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.180
 just treat her more than much with the hate 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.069

 Holy shit, I fucked her back here 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.090
