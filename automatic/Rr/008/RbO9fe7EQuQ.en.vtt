basically like a pop filter and my mic
quality<00:00:15.120> will<00:00:15.360> sound<00:00:15.570> better<00:00:15.599> because

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
quality will sound better because

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.099 
quality will sound better because
recently<00:00:16.320> like<00:00:16.740> my<00:00:16.859> two<00:00:16.920> last<00:00:17.340> videos<00:00:17.789> have

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.779 
recently like my two last videos have
the<00:00:19.109> worst<00:00:19.380> my<00:00:19.650> quality<00:00:20.100> for<00:00:20.310> some<00:00:20.490> reason<00:00:20.760> I

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the worst my quality for some reason I

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.250 
the worst my quality for some reason I
don't<00:00:20.939> know<00:00:21.000> why<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.480> my<00:00:21.689> mic<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:22.050> keeps

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
don't know why like my mic just keeps

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.259 
don't know why like my mic just keeps
fucking<00:00:22.470> up<00:00:22.769> but<00:00:23.010> I'm<00:00:23.310> hoping<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.000> solves

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
fucking up but I'm hoping this solves

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.759 
fucking up but I'm hoping this solves
the<00:00:24.359> issue<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.539> didn't<00:00:24.779> even<00:00:24.930> test<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.619> like

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the issue I didn't even test it so like

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.710 
the issue I didn't even test it so like
if<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.099> fucked<00:00:26.340> up<00:00:26.550> then<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.180> whole<00:00:27.390> video

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
if it's fucked up then this whole video

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.000 
if it's fucked up then this whole video
is<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> waste<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.349> time<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.560> probably<00:00:28.800> should

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
is a waste of time I probably should

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.919 
is a waste of time I probably should
have<00:00:29.039> checked<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.760> probably<00:00:30.210> will<00:00:30.449> check<00:00:30.750> it

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
an aimbot Lobby online before ever

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.109 
an aimbot Lobby online before ever
that's<00:01:25.560> why<00:01:25.740> we're<00:01:25.920> all<00:01:26.100> hoping<00:01:26.430> black<00:01:26.670> ops<00:01:26.880> 3

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
that's why we're all hoping black ops 3

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.760 
that's why we're all hoping black ops 3
is<00:01:27.150> good<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.840> don't<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.259> come<00:01:28.409> back<00:01:28.590> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
is good so we don't have to come back to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.880 
is good so we don't have to come back to
black<00:01:28.979> ops<00:01:29.189> 2<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.640> I'm<00:01:29.909> thinking<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.600> like

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
black ops 2 and I'm thinking it is like

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.200 
black ops 2 and I'm thinking it is like
Vonderhaar<00:01:31.890> knows<00:01:32.579> everything<00:01:33.119> about
