00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
MSW box on Neil and today I'm looking at

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.730 
MSW box on Neil and today I'm looking at
fish<00:00:10.820> eye<00:00:11.030> lens<00:00:11.139> for<00:00:12.139> people<00:00:12.440> that<00:00:12.590> they<00:00:12.709> know

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
fish eye lens for people that they know

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.970 
fish eye lens for people that they know
what<00:00:13.100> that<00:00:13.129> is<00:00:13.309> is<00:00:13.610> a<00:00:14.420> device<00:00:15.019> where<00:00:15.379> if<00:00:15.769> you

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
what that is is a device where if you

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.100 
what that is is a device where if you
look<00:00:16.340> at<00:00:16.490> something<00:00:16.759> very<00:00:17.360> like<00:00:17.570> a<00:00:17.599> fisheye

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
look at something very like a fisheye

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.960 
look at something very like a fisheye
lens<00:00:18.140> it<00:00:18.890> would<00:00:19.009> distort<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:19.550> picture

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
lens it would distort the picture

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.490 
lens it would distort the picture
depending<00:00:20.390> on<00:00:20.450> whether<00:00:20.660> you're<00:00:20.840> close<00:00:21.020> or<00:00:21.259> far

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
depending on whether you're close or far

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.319 
depending on whether you're close or far

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:23.329 
so that's pretty much what it does so

so that's pretty much what it does so
it's<00:00:23.509> just<00:00:23.630> a<00:00:23.809> bit<00:00:24.110> of<00:00:24.140> fun<00:00:24.259> for<00:00:24.800> changing<00:00:25.250> your
