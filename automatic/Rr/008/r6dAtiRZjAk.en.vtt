00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
how does this work it's really simple

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.960 
how does this work it's really simple
you<00:00:24.810> just<00:00:24.930> connect<00:00:25.410> your<00:00:25.470> device<00:00:25.800> via<00:00:26.039> USB<00:00:26.279> to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
you just connect your device via USB to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.750 
you just connect your device via USB to
a<00:00:27.000> power<00:00:27.269> bank<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.900> you're<00:00:28.769> often<00:00:29.099> charging

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
a power bank and you're often charging

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.550 
a power bank and you're often charging
just<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.539> if<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.840> want<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.050> smaller<00:00:31.349> one

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
just like that if you want a smaller one

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.440 
just like that if you want a smaller one
you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.949> do<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.219> some<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.880> them<00:00:33.000> even<00:00:33.090> charge

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
you can do that some of them even charge

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.330 
you can do that some of them even charge
two<00:00:33.719> devices<00:00:33.750> at<00:00:34.200> once<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.829> you're<00:00:34.950> at<00:00:35.130> an

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
two devices at once if you're at an

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.799 
two devices at once if you're at an
airport<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.030> need<00:00:36.180> your<00:00:36.390> phone<00:00:36.570> and

airport and you need your phone and
tablet<00:00:36.989> charged<00:00:37.440> real<00:00:37.710> quick<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.040> can

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
tablet charged real quick you can

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.250 
tablet charged real quick you can
connect<00:00:38.489> both<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.969> you're<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.840> going

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
connect both and you're up and going

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.190 
connect both and you're up and going
it's<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.550> simple<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.540> there's<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.989> lot<00:00:43.170> more

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
it's that simple but there's a lot more

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.709 
it's that simple but there's a lot more
to<00:00:43.500> power<00:00:43.680> banks<00:00:44.010> than<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.250> might<00:00:44.430> consider

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
to power banks than you might consider

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.290 
to power banks than you might consider
at<00:00:45.719> first<00:00:46.170> glance<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.030> you<00:00:48.030> have

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
at first glance like that you have

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.170 
at first glance like that you have
milliamp<00:00:49.079> hours<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.860> compare<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:51.000> is

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
milliamp hours to compare and this is

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.660 
milliamp hours to compare and this is
the<00:00:51.329> key<00:00:51.539> feature<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:52.050> batteries<00:00:52.520> like<00:00:53.520> this

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the key feature on batteries like this

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.880 
the key feature on batteries like this
extreme<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> 2600<00:00:55.289> milliamp<00:00:55.469> hour

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
extreme it's a 2600 milliamp hour

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.099 
extreme it's a 2600 milliamp hour
battery<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.640> that's<00:00:57.420> probably<00:00:57.690> going<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.960> get

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
battery and that's probably going to get

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.779 
battery and that's probably going to get
you<00:00:58.230> about<00:00:58.440> maybe<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:59.010> charge<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.609> your<00:00:59.730> phone

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
you about maybe one charge on your phone

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.069 
you about maybe one charge on your phone
depending<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.629> phones

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
depending on your phones

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.369 
depending on your phones
sighs<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:02.039> ravpower<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.820> also<00:01:03.149> 2600<00:01:04.080> maybe

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
sighs this ravpower is also 2600 maybe

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080 
sighs this ravpower is also 2600 maybe
in<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> slightly<00:01:04.920> cylindrical<00:01:05.610> shape<00:01:05.820> here

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
in a slightly cylindrical shape here

give<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> different<00:01:07.020> design<00:01:07.470> Flair<00:01:07.830> this

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
give a different design Flair this

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.969 
give a different design Flair this
jakhary<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.119> 6,000<00:01:10.110> milliamp<00:01:10.500> hours<00:01:10.860> so

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
jakhary is 6,000 milliamp hours so

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.679 
jakhary is 6,000 milliamp hours so
that's<00:01:11.070> probably<00:01:11.430> two<00:01:11.610> charges<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.390> your

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689

is 12,000 milliamp hours but it has a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.850 
is 12,000 milliamp hours but it has a
slightly<00:01:32.909> different<00:01:33.119> design<00:01:33.450> aesthetic<00:01:34.110> this

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
slightly different design aesthetic this

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.289 
slightly different design aesthetic this
event<00:01:35.280> tech<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.900> 20,000<00:01:36.900> milliamp<00:01:37.320> hours
