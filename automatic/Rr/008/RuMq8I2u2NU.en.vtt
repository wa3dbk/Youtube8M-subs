00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello everyone and today we have a review on 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.719
 channel and a large set from a distant 88 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.910
 of the year 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:18.710
 black series throne one space set 68 76 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.090
 Renata 86 detail and 1 minifigure 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.699
 I have the wrong set of boxes 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 usually bought but there is a manual like 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.119
 has repeatedly said old 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.699
 I like the instructions much more 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.180
 set of 86 details all instructions 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.020
 is broadcast on such a leaflet 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.960
 one such leaf a3 format expanded 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.410
 probably actually everything is going 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.390
 walker our model to and and all instructions 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.750
 small but in my opinion it is good 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.760
 We now turn to the review of the model for 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.070
 Our museum bought a set of not new 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.739
 towers and states of middle pitch i 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.079
 I'll tell you very bad but far from 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.460
 the perfect set represents 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.210
 small building 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.490
 similar to a walker whether such fur 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.799
 rather strange construction and 1 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.939
 minifigure let's start with minifigur 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.710
 then we will look at this construction 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.650
 this minifigure appeared eighty 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.680
 the seventh year was a time 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.950
 thugs 1 black throne invaders behind him 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.869
 constantly space police was hunting 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.320
 black color he is all black avatar 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.810
 so let's say evil black helmet black body 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.370
 black many black cylinders and only 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.640
 small print on the groove 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.820
 de turns out such a black and white color 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.610
 very interesting what 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.650
 his helmet visor is also black and 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.230
 opaque if opened by a visor q 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.160
 see a classic smiley classic 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.710
 head 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.600
 minifigures and if we look head 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.600
 old without a hole inside at after 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.210
 almost all black taro helmet 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.670
 minifigures were the same anime not 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.710
 differed there were slight variations but 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.260
 no like now that every new set 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.180
 new menu figurine before they did 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.850
 I am a few years old and the same figure 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.340
 stamps good or badly unequivocally 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.060
 it cannot be said on the one hand that 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.560
 all minifigures were identical this 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.000
 a message that the computer is not a figure 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.010
 represented less collectible 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.590
 value at the same time it is a plus 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.950
 since the set was not bought to 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.300
 there was a new mini figure in the collection 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.700
 to have a new building new 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.140
 details to existing buildings 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.770
 could do more and more 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.450
 so that such a cornerstone is impossible 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.459
 unequivocally say let's go now 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.470
 move on to the building itself is color 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.160
 gamma set as the whole series will be true 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.950
 one black yellow black yellow 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.340
 black base and not big yellow 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.130
 glass accents yellow antenna details 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.550
 yellow and slightly transparent 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.580
 red all sets were very 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.920
 similarly designed all in one style 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.590
 This model is such 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.410
 small walker as I understand it 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.620
 it's a function which 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:20.240
 these legs rotate that is if we 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:24.730
 click here he goes so much like 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:30.740
 unusually it's all so interesting 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:33.860
 mobility is not these from the paws 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.430
 least original for '88 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.670
 this was cool to plant 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.050
 minifigure remove these 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:48.610
 grabs we harbor glass and plant 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:53.350
 our driver of this unit 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:56.270
 open , from the function he still has 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.580
 such a small trick practically 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.580
 the trunk height of the lash opens and 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:14.870
 inside, let's say he is 88 years old 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:18.020
 something not a wrench with such 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.459
 a simple tool our touch 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.410
 had to exercise their 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.500
 aggressive raids on 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.570
 on the planets 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.280
 naturally he can not fly and see 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.220
 planted on the planet and then he is there 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.770
 under the top of the top 2 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.300
 antennas it is not clear why the engines too 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.570
 apparently to accelerate to 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.910
 faster spanked on the surface of the planet well 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.430
 In principle, there are no more functions 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.370
 he doesn't have a little set 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.960
 here is the flight functional now I will do 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.990
 some photos will finish 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.990
 our review of this set is 88 years old 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.300
 here we looked yes wonderful 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.560
 set from the black series from exactly 1 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.360
 practically the first thematic set 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.780
 perseverance of the classic cosmos 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.640
 a set of 27 years in my opinion zdorovskiy 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.010
 set is not sure that I will collect all 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.500
 this series at least five days set 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.360
 + 1 is quite small therefore everything 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.700
 maybe put like if you 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.980
 like this one here in my opinion 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.440
 wonderful set of signed channel 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.340
 group go and see you in the museum before 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.340
 see you soon
