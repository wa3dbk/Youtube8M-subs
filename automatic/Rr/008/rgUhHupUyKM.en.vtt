but<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.700> still<00:00:48.570> can't<00:00:48.719> understand<00:00:49.200> why<00:00:49.440> they

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
but I still can't understand why they

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.290 
but I still can't understand why they
wouldn't<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.579> extra<00:00:51.030> player

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
wouldn't just have that extra player

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.270 
wouldn't just have that extra player
yeah<00:00:51.780> yeah<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.140> mean<00:00:52.440> even<00:00:52.649> though<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.100> not

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
yeah yeah I mean even though it's not

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.830 
yeah yeah I mean even though it's not
that<00:00:53.610> big<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.000> difference<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.719> is

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
that big of a difference because it is

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.080 
that big of a difference because it is
that<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:55.500> tier<00:00:55.860> point<00:00:56.129> advantage<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.699> you

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that one tier point advantage so you

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.330 
that one tier point advantage so you
know<00:00:57.210> even<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.440> 1<00:00:58.920> t1

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
know even if you have that you know 1 t1

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580 
know even if you have that you know 1 t1
you<00:01:00.059> know<00:01:00.210> advantage<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.199> proved<00:01:01.410> quite

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you know advantage it proved quite

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.529 
you know advantage it proved quite
crucial<00:01:01.890> towards<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> head<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.449> know

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
crucial towards the head but you know

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.390 
crucial towards the head but you know
what<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.960> never<00:01:04.170> disregard<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.949> t1

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
what you can never disregard a t1

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.490 
what you can never disregard a t1
because<00:01:05.729> if<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.450> say<00:01:06.689> survive<00:01:07.140> until

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
because if you do is say survive until

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.109 
because if you do is say survive until
the<00:01:07.650> very<00:01:07.799> end<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.100> only<00:01:08.310> heavy<00:01:08.729> tanks<00:01:09.000> are

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the very end and only heavy tanks are

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.580 
the very end and only heavy tanks are
remaining<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.600> can't<00:01:09.810> go<00:01:09.900> for<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> sneaky<00:01:10.439> base

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
remaining you can't go for a sneaky base

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.710 
remaining you can't go for a sneaky base
capture<00:01:10.860> yeah<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.210> always<00:01:12.420> better

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
capture yeah you know it's always better

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.080 
capture yeah you know it's always better
to<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:13.470> not<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.090> definitely

tanks<00:01:45.090> strong<00:01:45.360> yeah<00:01:45.720> yeah<00:01:45.930> yeah<00:01:46.170> opposed<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
tanks strong yeah yeah yeah opposed to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.160

their opponents two girls one cup action

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.399 
their opponents two girls one cup action
they<00:01:49.799> will<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:49.979> spotted<00:01:50.369> here<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.610> t1<00:01:50.880> will

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
they will be spotted here that t1 will

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.200 
they will be spotted here that t1 will
most<00:01:52.409> likely<00:01:52.729> beautifully<00:01:53.729> done<00:01:53.939> here

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
most likely beautifully done here

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.550 
most likely beautifully done here
actually<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.140> little<00:01:55.409> bit<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
actually is just a little bit of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620 
actually is just a little bit of
crossfire<00:01:56.040> he<00:01:56.549> was<00:01:56.670> covered<00:01:56.969> by<00:01:57.090> those<00:01:57.329> logs

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
crossfire he was covered by those logs

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.630 
crossfire he was covered by those logs
and<00:01:58.079> gap<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> middle<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.189> she's<00:01:59.430> down<00:01:59.579> to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and gap in the middle but she's down to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.240 
and gap in the middle but she's down to
a<00:01:59.790> 13-percent<00:02:00.659> hit<00:02:01.170> points<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.950> most

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
a 13-percent hit points and the most

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.090 
a 13-percent hit points and the most
probably<00:02:03.119> he<00:02:03.240> will<00:02:03.659> go<00:02:03.869> down<00:02:04.020> there<00:02:04.829> looks

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
probably he will go down there looks

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.570 
probably he will go down there looks
like<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.520> t1<00:02:05.969> will<00:02:06.390> go<00:02:06.509> down<00:02:06.689> 400<00:02:07.340> Baron<00:02:08.340> gets

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
like this t1 will go down 400 Baron gets

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.360 
like this t1 will go down 400 Baron gets
done<00:02:08.879> ow<00:02:09.209> by<00:02:09.539> up<00:02:09.569> his<00:02:10.379> opponent<00:02:10.890> actually<00:02:11.190> that

safe with their heavy tanks yeah as long
as<00:03:21.220> DC<00:03:21.580> regrouped<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.560> like<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.739> forest<00:03:24.190> can

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
as DC regrouped I like the forest can

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.830 
as DC regrouped I like the forest can
you<00:03:24.489> take<00:03:24.700> strong<00:03:25.000> like<00:03:25.270> they're<00:03:25.450> pretty<00:03:25.660> much

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
you take strong like they're pretty much

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.720 
you take strong like they're pretty much
safe<00:03:26.110> they<00:03:26.320> do<00:03:26.380> open<00:03:26.980> themselves<00:03:27.130> up<00:03:27.489> to<00:03:27.550> a

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
safe they do open themselves up to a

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
the vo2 grills one crop side that

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.360 
the vo2 grills one crop side that
decided<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:52.000> leave<00:03:52.270> their<00:03:52.630> t69<00:03:53.320> as<00:03:53.709> defense

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
and actually they're switching it up now

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.460 
and actually they're switching it up now
