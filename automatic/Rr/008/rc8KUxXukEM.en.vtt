00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 people and welcome here 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.200
 another round of hunger games here 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.240
 Here are two people in the process 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.690
 round which are pretty interesting 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.719
 namely the new job and rubber hd here 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.490
 on the rubber hd myself where I am 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:23.250
 and somehow that was total now 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.650
 wild and yes in any case 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.099
 this becomes quite interesting as 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.929
 already said no job and so still and 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.730
 hd are here on the summer 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.739
 Unfortunately I did not get anything 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.640
 or are not on the server but 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.180
 here in the round just in there and I have 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.690
 also no idea where here where here 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.840
 the boxes are from that I must be there 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.370
 Just have a look 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.449
 Well, that's not so great now 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.140
 I have to play the sound here again 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.140
 make it quieter 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.550
 Let's see how far we are here now 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:07.390
 probably do not come too far 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.700
 but it does not matter we'll get it 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:15.490
 somehow we only need normal 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:18.610
 nice gesture or so that soon only one 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.780
 good gesture should have no yes 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:26.140
 be problem 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.020
 I have to have a city here too 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.229
 down with it and here he again 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.259
 down to 2 then it is finally time 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.250
 but now let's have a look 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.960
 maybe you can be in the round here yes 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.190
 but still something tear though the now 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.130
 is already in the beginning a little rough stupid here 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:50.470
 yet why I look on here 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.450
 every case could be announced 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:02:01.090
 be interesting if I have something good 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:02.770
 but were given a look as much as 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.369
 I would even be in it at all 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.380
 interest 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:15.140
 If I know now I already know 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:23.480
 that is a bit stupid yes yes 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:25.580
 is not no box at the moment ok seven 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.230
 people are still there gama hd and norbert 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:36.770
 Of course it is her fault to breathe somewhere 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.660
 on the server here and good but me 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.870
 my what brings us to crafting table 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:47.270
 really nothing 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:52.880
 I should eat something and here too 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:55.940
 a few potatoes and a tie 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.570
 maybe now you can 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.700
 accompany this 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.700
 there we have school again 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:13.209
 I just do not know what it looks like when 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.209
 you have to attack someone now 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.220
 that could then be fatal 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.570
 of me actually really not 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.060
 equipment in the park have the box 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.980
 there is a well hidden but this 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.700
 ok now at least have one 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.710
 sword but we try here anyway 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.020
 to be relatively defensive he does me 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.880
 sorry I know defensive can be boring 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.620
 become 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.960
 but I do not know how to do that 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.060
 otherwise they will do if I do not 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.160
 equipment and I have 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.700
 not at the moment 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.960
 then I can not do anything there either 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.740
 can not you expect me there 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.300
 something excessive travel if I only 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:06.090
 a wooden sword and some leather 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:09.960
 armor from there they do so now 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.820
 there are only five people left 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.810
 Names probably a bad one 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.860
 armor meanwhile and so on what 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.250
 you can stop to have 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:26.390
 na good one I hope still remains 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.390
 to the set trader 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:37.549
 are already funny guys and he 

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:37.549
 somehow 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.660
 that just went stupid that the map 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:47.610
 actually do not know and no 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.590
 I have no idea where to find something here 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:57.180
 all the boxes are just tough 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:59.069
 was empty but maybe yes 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.409
 Maybe we'll do that 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.270
 probably not required if 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.280
 that already starts and that was then 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.900
 the round rubber hand to guest himself 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.050
 personally killed 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:14.150
 and that was the consequence of this for me 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.150
 Bankruptcy out until next time
