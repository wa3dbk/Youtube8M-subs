this<00:00:03.510> is<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.689> design<00:00:04.080> concept<00:00:04.589> that<00:00:04.799> actually

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
this is a design concept that actually

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.740 
this is a design concept that actually
began<00:00:05.549> when<00:00:06.000> we<00:00:06.089> started<00:00:06.359> looking<00:00:06.450> at

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
began when we started looking at

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.169 
began when we started looking at
lifestyle<00:00:07.710> trends<00:00:08.040> in<00:00:08.160> United<00:00:08.519> States<00:00:08.790> we<00:00:09.000> saw

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
lifestyle trends in United States we saw

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.299 
lifestyle trends in United States we saw
two<00:00:09.240> key<00:00:09.840> trends<00:00:10.200> emerging<00:00:10.500> one<00:00:10.860> was<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
two key trends emerging one was the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.490 
two key trends emerging one was the
Millennials<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.000> their<00:00:12.450> desire<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.960> live<00:00:13.170> in

Millennials and their desire to live in

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.230 
Millennials and their desire to live in
a<00:00:13.590> more<00:00:13.769> urban<00:00:13.920> setting<00:00:14.460> secondly<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
a more urban setting secondly is the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240 
a more urban setting secondly is the
baby<00:00:15.420> boomers<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.470> saw<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.710> baby<00:00:16.980> boomer

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
baby boomers and we saw the baby boomer

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.730 
baby boomers and we saw the baby boomer
generation<00:00:17.279> retiring<00:00:18.210> not<00:00:18.869> necessarily

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
going into a sedentary lifestyle but

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.420 
going into a sedentary lifestyle but
kind<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.660> looking<00:00:21.779> at<00:00:22.020> alternative<00:00:22.740> housing

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
kind of looking at alternative housing

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.029 
kind of looking at alternative housing
opportunities<00:00:24.300> downsizing<00:00:25.260> maybe<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.560> second

major<00:00:28.320> trends<00:00:28.710> said<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.460> needed<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.789> look

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
major trends said that we needed to look

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.209 
major trends said that we needed to look
at<00:00:30.210> appliance<00:00:30.929> design<00:00:31.230> differently<00:00:31.710> we

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
at appliance design differently we

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.090 
at appliance design differently we
couldn't<00:00:32.640> take<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.899> standard<00:00:33.899> 33<00:00:34.440> or<00:00:34.530> 36<00:00:34.950> inch

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
couldn't take a standard 33 or 36 inch

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.520 
couldn't take a standard 33 or 36 inch
appliance<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.820> simply<00:00:36.690> shrink<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.110> down<00:00:37.290> for

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
appliance and simply shrink it down for

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.020 
appliance and simply shrink it down for
these<00:00:37.620> smaller<00:00:37.890> living<00:00:38.250> spaces<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.820> that's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
these smaller living spaces and that's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.819 
these smaller living spaces and that's
what<00:00:39.180> led<00:00:39.329> us<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.989> micro<00:00:40.290> kitchen<00:00:40.410> concept

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
what led us to the micro kitchen concept

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.060 
what led us to the micro kitchen concept
it's<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.730> 24<00:00:42.210> inch<00:00:42.360> module<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.559> based<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
it's a 24 inch module it's based on a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.950 
it's a 24 inch module it's based on a
standard<00:00:44.340> countertop<00:00:44.940> height<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
standard countertop height and a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.510 
standard countertop height and a
standard<00:00:46.289> countertop<00:00:46.710> depth<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.309> sort

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
standard countertop depth and that sort

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.100 
standard countertop depth and that sort
of<00:00:47.550> became<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> design<00:00:48.180> guidelines<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.930> us

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
of became the design guidelines for us

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.869 
of became the design guidelines for us
what<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.800> developed<00:00:50.190> though<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.610> first

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
what we developed though is that first

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.790 
what we developed though is that first
step<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> six<00:00:51.719> linear<00:00:52.110> foot<00:00:52.379> fully

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
step was a six linear foot fully

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.040 
step was a six linear foot fully
equipped<00:00:53.640> kitchen<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> cooking

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
equipped kitchen so we have a cooking

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.740 
equipped kitchen so we have a cooking
module<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.620> refrigeration<00:00:56.489> module<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.660> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
module a refrigeration module and a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.599 
module a refrigeration module and a
washing<00:00:58.170> module<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.980> within<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.340> six

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
washing module and within that six

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.490 
washing module and within that six
linear<00:00:59.910> feet<00:01:00.180> space<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.140> all<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
linear feet space you have all the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.080 
linear feet space you have all the
technology<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.280> latest<00:01:02.550> technology<00:01:03.059> and

technology the latest technology and
food<00:01:03.359> preparation<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.379> refrigeration<00:01:05.159> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
food preparation and refrigeration and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.090 
food preparation and refrigeration and
cleaning<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.380> what's<00:01:07.799> interesting

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
cleaning right there what's interesting

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.539 
cleaning right there what's interesting
is<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.299> gonna<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> first<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.549> product

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
is this is gonna be the first a product

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.039 
is this is gonna be the first a product
that<00:01:11.700> concept<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.330> were<00:01:12.450> actually<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> take

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
that concept that were actually to take

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.200 
that concept that were actually to take
into<00:01:13.439> our<00:01:13.470> maker<00:01:14.100> space<00:01:14.460> which<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.850> launched

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
into our maker space which we launched

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.580 
into our maker space which we launched
about<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.450> month<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.869> half<00:01:15.900> ago

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
about a month and a half ago

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.350 
about a month and a half ago
it's<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.100> maker<00:01:17.310> space<00:01:17.430> dedicated<00:01:17.909> to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it's a maker space dedicated to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.630 
it's a maker space dedicated to
appliance<00:01:18.900> design<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.830> called<00:01:20.070> first<00:01:20.310> build

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
appliance design it's called first build

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.010 
appliance design it's called first build
because<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> kind<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.240> reflects<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.869> fact

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
because it kind of reflects the fact

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.660 
because it kind of reflects the fact
that<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.650> more<00:01:22.830> than<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:22.979> creating<00:01:23.520> ideas

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
that it's more than just creating ideas

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.760 
that it's more than just creating ideas
it's<00:01:24.479> building<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:24.990> ideas<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.530> actually

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it's building the ideas and actually

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.260 
it's building the ideas and actually
selling<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> ideas<00:01:26.640> through<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> micro

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
selling the ideas through a micro

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.670 
selling the ideas through a micro
factory<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.990> we're<00:01:28.110> building<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> little

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
factory that we're building a little

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.710 
factory that we're building a little
Kentucky<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> idea<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.329> take<00:01:30.570> this

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
Kentucky so the idea is to take this

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.319 
Kentucky so the idea is to take this
concept<00:01:31.100> run<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.220> into<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> community<00:01:33.000> which

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
concept run it into the community which

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.969 
concept run it into the community which
right<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.840> about<00:01:33.900> 1,300<00:01:34.619> members

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
right now we have about 1,300 members

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.800 
right now we have about 1,300 members
and<00:01:35.520> they'll<00:01:35.729> critique<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> design<00:01:36.509> add

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
and they'll critique the design add

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.679 
and they'll critique the design add
enhanced<00:01:37.590> tweak<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.979> design<00:01:38.360> based<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.540> those

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
enhanced tweak the design based on those

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.950 
enhanced tweak the design based on those
those<00:01:40.110> inputs<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:40.979> we'll<00:01:41.130> prototype<00:01:41.670> that

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
those inputs then we'll prototype that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.600 
those inputs then we'll prototype that
take<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> few<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.409> concepts<00:01:43.860> out<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.189> market
