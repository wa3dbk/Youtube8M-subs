00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.349 
they didn't hit their mark
I<00:04:13.230> mean<00:04:14.230> just<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.709> look<00:04:14.889> at<00:04:15.129> this<00:04:15.370> like<00:04:15.909> it's

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
I mean just to look at this like it's

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.150 
I mean just to look at this like it's
taking<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:18.989> guess<00:04:19.989> his<00:04:20.229> same<00:04:20.470> presence<00:04:21.009> is

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
taking I guess his same presence is

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.189 
taking I guess his same presence is
being<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.519> character<00:04:21.880> of<00:04:21.940> neo<00:04:22.180> and<00:04:22.599> then

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
being the character of neo and then

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.260 
being the character of neo and then
adding<00:04:23.680> like<00:04:23.919> elements<00:04:24.580> of<00:04:24.729> like<00:04:24.940> gun

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
adding like elements of like gun

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.909 
adding like elements of like gun
fighting<00:04:25.599> like<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:26.020> mean<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.259> first<00:04:26.470> mate<00:04:26.710> just

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
fighting like I mean the first mate just

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.770 
fighting like I mean the first mate just
had<00:04:27.009> a<00:04:27.099> lot<00:04:27.280> of<00:04:27.310> gun<00:04:27.610> fights<00:04:27.940> you<00:04:28.300> know

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
had a lot of gun fights you know

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.290 
had a lot of gun fights you know
and<00:04:29.050> then<00:04:29.949> that<00:04:30.190> second<00:04:30.910> one<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.240> third

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
and then that second one and the third

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.629 
and then that second one and the third
one<00:04:31.570> had<00:04:32.259> more<00:04:32.470> like<00:04:32.710> long<00:04:32.949> hand-to-hand

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
one had more like long hand-to-hand

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.640 
one had more like long hand-to-hand
combat<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:34.270> neo<00:04:34.630> never<00:04:34.930> had<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.260> use<00:04:35.289> like<00:04:35.620> a

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
combat so neo never had to use like a

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.960 
combat so neo never had to use like a
gun<00:04:35.949> but<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:37.240> mean<00:04:37.930> this<00:04:38.380> is<00:04:38.860> like<00:04:39.220> comparable

late early Garrett ating towards like a

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.040 
late early Garrett ating towards like a
little<00:06:04.630> dog<00:06:05.700> that<00:06:06.700> he<00:06:06.880> really<00:06:07.120> loved<00:06:07.420> and<00:06:07.810> they

of course messed him up and the dog so I
don't<00:06:13.390> think<00:06:13.540> it's<00:06:13.720> centered<00:06:14.020> around<00:06:14.080> and<00:06:14.410> are

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
don't think it's centered around and are

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.140 
don't think it's centered around and are
things<00:06:14.770> more<00:06:15.010> than<00:06:15.190> that<00:06:15.370> I<00:06:15.550> mean<00:06:15.580> he<00:06:15.850> said
