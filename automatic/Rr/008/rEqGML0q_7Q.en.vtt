00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
after bringing it back I had gone into

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.310 
after bringing it back I had gone into
the<00:01:26.100> garage<00:01:26.370> to<00:01:27.620> put<00:01:28.620> some<00:01:28.800> things<00:01:28.950> away<00:01:29.160> I

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320

the<00:01:33.060> freezer<00:01:33.540> at<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> time<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.280> thought<00:01:35.550> it<00:01:35.610> was

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the freezer at the time I thought it was

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.870 
the freezer at the time I thought it was
the<00:01:36.360> compressor<00:01:37.070> possibly<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.580> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the compressor possibly going out I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.410 
the compressor possibly going out I

thought about rats and I thought about

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.600 
thought about rats and I thought about
