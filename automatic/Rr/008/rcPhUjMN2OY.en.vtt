00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
pretty sure I am that not only can

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.060 
pretty sure I am that not only can
people<00:00:42.690> make<00:00:42.870> between<00:00:43.379> five<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.649> fifteen

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
people make between five and fifteen

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.350 
people make between five and fifteen
hundred<00:00:44.129> pounds<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> first<00:00:44.700> month<00:00:45.000> but

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
hundred pounds in the first month but

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.540 
hundred pounds in the first month but
they<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.079> go<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.649> something<00:00:47.280> similar

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
they can go on and do something similar

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.770 
they can go on and do something similar
around<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.969> thousand<00:00:48.329> pounds<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> think<00:00:48.570> we're

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
around a thousand pounds I think we're

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.360 
around a thousand pounds I think we're
saying<00:00:48.930> every<00:00:49.440> single<00:00:49.739> month<00:00:49.890> thereafter<00:00:50.070> is

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
saying every single month thereafter is

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.920 
saying every single month thereafter is
that<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.879> also<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.270> case<00:00:51.449> yes

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
that is that also the case yes

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.760 
that is that also the case yes
absolutely<00:00:52.440> yeah<00:00:52.620> now<00:00:54.050> my<00:00:55.050> understanding<00:00:55.620> is

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
absolutely yeah now my understanding is

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.729 
absolutely yeah now my understanding is
that<00:00:56.510> you're<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:58.050> actually

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
that you're going to be actually

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.459 
that you're going to be actually
demonstrating<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.840> prior<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.289> when<00:01:01.440> people

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
demonstrating this prior to when people

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.750 
demonstrating this prior to when people
have<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.920> make<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.190> their<00:01:02.280> mind<00:01:02.489> whether<00:01:02.550> they

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
have to make up their mind whether they

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.520 
have to make up their mind whether they
want<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> stay<00:01:03.120> or<00:01:03.239> not<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.170> they

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
want to stay or not is that so they

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
want to stay or not is that so they
could<00:01:04.710> come<00:01:04.799> along<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.519> they<00:01:06.060> could<00:01:06.180> actually

could come along and they could actually
get<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.020> system<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:08.520> they<00:01:08.640> could

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
get this system and then they could

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.520 
get this system and then they could
still<00:01:09.000> go<00:01:09.150> home<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> refund<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.350> is
