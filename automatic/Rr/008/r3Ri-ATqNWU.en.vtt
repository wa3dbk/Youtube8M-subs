00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.689
 hello kids equipped with commenting and 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.029
 we started a new floor of the broken and with 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.220
 ander del modern warfare2 we are already in 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.830
 the 21 and as you know the last games 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.290
 they were pretty bad the truth was 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.449
 born the two were started parties 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.690
 with champions that flip ice and with a 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.830
 fucking team both so 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.750
 let's hope it goes better now and that we 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.010
 there are two levels for nuclear as well 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.290
 that now what we're going to get but 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.890
 let's go the other part will start great 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.930
 this to your roll they will see what happens in 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.450
 this is if we're lucky we're getting 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.280
 for too much and I can trace it back in that 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.730
 we are winning to see if there is luck 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.480
 when perfect perfectÃ­simo I do not complain 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.660
 I do not notice 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.590
 if we go to air support we are not 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.570
 some 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.380
 and out here are going to come 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.380
 how many predators 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.110
 the typical can perillo 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.110
 that there is always 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.110
 that good team someone 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.110
 well with the most relative title 95 of 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.110
 everyone 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.520

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.469
 down brief them now friends talking 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.170
 and so I can get behind what 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.040
 are the points 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.040
 if you are lucky 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.020
 here on the right safe 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.020
 at the radar level and navas 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.480
 amazing 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.680
 a team makes a ball 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.680
 here comes an hour 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.640
 if it fits the sap 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.460
 I played like the flavor has flown 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.460
 the uncle 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.630
 Lamata 3 to 4 behind or on the side 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.510
 wherever 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.510
 let's see we continue like this we go badly at all 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.430
 but the people who because of luck 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.530
 and there are strong and double low 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.590
 I get in here there were people up there but 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.879
 one can not do anything for now 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.879
 around here there are also people 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.580
 it's being the best and not rinse out there 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.780
 the whole round here is already 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.780
 in the government team 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.569
 I hide here a second covers 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.569
 company please please and do not kill me 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.390
 this Campero let this 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.140
 the ball is covered by the 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.510
 comrades but here fast he took me 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.900
 harris hold so you have to take a 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.900
 weapon now 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.810
 I killed s 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.810
 and we keep moving 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.860
 in our team and have martyrdom as 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.860
 one 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:53.550
 with fame is a not good but 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.850
 they take it series of bouquets or it looks like 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.850
 at least 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.120
 incredible underwater 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.250
 that is, it does not move, 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.900
 garden does not kill or god 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.490
 rather more to the game the truth is 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.490
 that these seven in the aunt 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.940
 in a few 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:30.110
 the bells these that know 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.110
 for example 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:41.320
 in something 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.320
 It is that this day adopt and palm 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.750

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.750

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.789

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.410
 it feels 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.310
 There are people that we feel we have 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.000
 this week playing less badly 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:18.849
 vengeful of law that is that you are a 

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:21.610
 Fucked country dude 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:26.240
 10 42 of this with fame if side gave 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.800
 Riding like a piggy helmet of people 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.669
 I was not talking but pretty much so 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.669
 that's not the problem now 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.919
 so we'll win we're going to go for 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.220
 Derek again to see if the fool decided 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.220
 move 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.879
 let's hope so 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.879
 is from our team 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:55.080

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.780

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:04.259
 more than 8 if that so good 28 that 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.419
 pretty bad to the game but good not 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.189
 you can do much more 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.560
 obviously the support we've just taken out 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:13.800

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.120
