specific way and depending on what types
of<00:00:39.540> space<00:00:40.079> tiles<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.530> played<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.250> know<00:00:41.280> areas

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
of space tiles get played you know areas

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.790 
of space tiles get played you know areas
become<00:00:42.059> more<00:00:42.329> or<00:00:42.570> less<00:00:42.660> valuable<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.469> whatnot

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800

land grabs that are going on and the you

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.420 
land grabs that are going on and the you
know<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> raw<00:00:49.289> structure<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.129> game<00:00:50.280> it

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
silky simple smooth you place a plant at

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.049 
silky simple smooth you place a plant at
every<00:00:55.350> turn<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.800> harvest<00:00:56.489> some<00:00:56.610> resources

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
every turn you harvest some resources

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240 
every turn you harvest some resources
and<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.960> use<00:00:58.170> those<00:00:58.350> resources<00:00:58.559> plus

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
and then you use those resources plus

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.950 
and then you use those resources plus
all<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> special<00:00:59.850> powers<00:01:00.120> you've<00:01:00.300> got<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.719> it

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
just goes it's super fast and yet it

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
feels like you accomplish a lot in just

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.490 
feels like you accomplish a lot in just
five<00:01:05.339> rounds<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.939> mean<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.450> just<00:01:06.600> really<00:01:07.020> works

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
five rounds I mean it just really works

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.030 
five rounds I mean it just really works
in<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.710> lot<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.100> ways<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.409> must<00:01:10.680> say<00:01:10.830> it

in a lot of ways and so I must say it
breaks<00:01:11.220> my<00:01:11.369> heart<00:01:11.400> because<00:01:12.000> oh<00:01:12.119> my<00:01:12.299> gosh<00:01:12.510> it's

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
species out and while there's nothing

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.240 
species out and while there's nothing
wrong<00:01:37.200> with<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.619> I'm<00:01:37.680> sure<00:01:37.740> there's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
wrong with that and I'm sure there's

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.649 
wrong with that and I'm sure there's
lots<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.610> people<00:01:38.850> who<00:01:38.939> absolutely<00:01:39.060> love<00:01:39.630> that

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
lots of people who absolutely love that

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.780 
lots of people who absolutely love that
sort<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.170> play<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.590> mean<00:01:40.860> Jen<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.729> know

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
sort of play I mean Jen and I you know

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.340 
sort of play I mean Jen and I you know
we<00:01:41.939> sat<00:01:42.150> down<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.450> were<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.689> well<00:01:43.140> okay

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
we sat down and were like well okay

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.830 
we sat down and were like well okay
maybe<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.280> ignore<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:45.149> nasty<00:01:45.659> stuff

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
maybe we can just ignore the nasty stuff

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.300 
maybe we can just ignore the nasty stuff
that<00:01:45.960> we'll<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.079> never<00:01:46.350> use<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.009> actual

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
that we'll just never use the actual

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.219 
that we'll just never use the actual
special<00:01:48.090> powers<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.600> are<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.110> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
special powers that are for like you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.870 
special powers that are for like you
know<00:01:49.290> aggressive<00:01:50.070> attacking<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.640> whatnot

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
know aggressive attacking and whatnot

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.370 
know aggressive attacking and whatnot
and<00:01:51.090> we'll<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.420> focus<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.899> live<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.229> let

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
and we'll just focus on live and let

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.230 
and we'll just focus on live and let
live<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.799> maybe<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.250> little<00:01:53.490> bit<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.880> vying<00:01:54.090> for

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
live and maybe a little bit of vying for

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.969 
live and maybe a little bit of vying for
control<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.350> okay<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.649> somebody<00:01:55.890> gets

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
control but that's okay if somebody gets

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.380 
control but that's okay if somebody gets
pushed<00:01:56.219> out<00:01:56.369> well<00:01:56.610> hey<00:01:56.729> at<00:01:56.850> least<00:01:56.909> they<00:01:57.180> get

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
pushed out well hey at least they get

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.700 
pushed out well hey at least they get
you<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.570> compensation<00:01:58.320> they<00:01:58.409> get<00:01:58.530> some

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
you know compensation they get some

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.679 
you know compensation they get some
resources<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.310> kicked<00:01:59.490> out<00:01:59.579> but<00:02:00.299> what

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
resources you get kicked out but what

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.359 
resources you get kicked out but what
happens<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.350> very<00:02:01.710> quickly<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.189> into

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
happens is you very quickly get into

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.520 
happens is you very quickly get into
situations<00:02:02.520> where<00:02:03.060> no<00:02:03.329> know<00:02:03.570> by<00:02:04.110> far<00:02:04.320> your

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
situations where no know by far your

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.249 
situations where no know by far your
best<00:02:04.590> move<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.430> point<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.659> put<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
best move at this point is to put the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.809 
best move at this point is to put the
screws<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:08.009> your<00:02:08.129> opponent<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.580> mean<00:02:08.729> because

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
there's just really nothing else good

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.999 
there's just really nothing else good
you<00:02:10.140> get<00:02:10.259> you're<00:02:10.379> never<00:02:10.560> going<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.739> complete

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
you get you're never going to complete

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.960 
you get you're never going to complete
this<00:02:11.129> objective<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.510> this

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
right in between those two planets and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.290 
right in between those two planets and
you'll<00:02:20.680> you'll<00:02:21.160> bleed<00:02:21.550> your<00:02:21.730> opponent<00:02:22.060> dry<00:02:22.270> I

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
mean and that just doesn't work for me

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.880 
mean and that just doesn't work for me
and<00:02:25.510> Jen<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.930> mean<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.290> know<00:02:26.350> we<00:02:26.500> only<00:02:26.530> got

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
and Jen I mean you know we only got

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.530 
and Jen I mean you know we only got
about<00:02:27.070> halfway<00:02:27.460> through<00:02:27.670> our<00:02:27.910> first<00:02:28.270> game

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
about halfway through our first game

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.090 
about halfway through our first game
when<00:02:29.050> we<00:02:29.170> said<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.380> know<00:02:29.500> what<00:02:29.710> okay<00:02:29.980> we<00:02:30.070> just

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
when we said you know what okay we just

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.500 
when we said you know what okay we just
got<00:02:30.310> stopped<00:02:30.610> we're<00:02:30.790> just<00:02:30.940> beating<00:02:31.270> each

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
got stopped we're just beating each

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.630 
got stopped we're just beating each
other<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.960> Ella<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:32.320> just<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.920> we<00:02:33.100> cannot

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
other and Ella it's just that we cannot

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.970 
other and Ella it's just that we cannot
find<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:34.120> peaceful<00:02:34.690> way<00:02:34.960> to<00:02:34.990> coexist<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:35.740> this

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
find a peaceful way to coexist in this

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.010 
find a peaceful way to coexist in this
little<00:02:36.310> slice<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.970> heaven<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.300> little<00:02:37.540> solar

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
little slice of heaven this little solar

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.210 
little slice of heaven this little solar
system<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.760> game<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.000> not<00:02:40.300> for<00:02:40.570> us<00:02:40.690> but

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
system and so the game is not for us but

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.170 
system and so the game is not for us but
obviously<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.490> really<00:02:42.730> has<00:02:42.850> nothing<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.090> do

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
obviously that really has nothing to do

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.370 
obviously that really has nothing to do
with<00:02:43.270> anything<00:02:43.510> because<00:02:43.720> hopefully<00:02:44.080> from<00:02:44.230> the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
with anything because hopefully from the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.810 
with anything because hopefully from the
run<00:02:44.530> too<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.770> guys<00:02:44.920> can<00:02:45.160> decide<00:02:45.400> whether<00:02:45.670> it's

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
run too you guys can decide whether it's

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.900 
run too you guys can decide whether it's
something<00:02:46.120> for<00:02:46.270> you<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:47.200> mean<00:02:47.320> I<00:02:47.410> got<00:02:47.590> say

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
something for you and I mean I got say

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.750 
something for you and I mean I got say
the<00:02:48.910> raw<00:02:49.090> mechanisms<00:02:49.720> just<00:02:50.110> works<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.590> well<00:02:50.830> if

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
the raw mechanisms just works so well if

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.510 
the raw mechanisms just works so well if
the<00:02:52.330> designers<00:02:52.870> had<00:02:53.320> gone<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:54.040> different<00:02:54.220> way

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
the designers had gone a different way

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.180 
the designers had gone a different way
they<00:02:54.760> had<00:02:54.970> looked<00:02:55.510> for<00:02:55.750> less<00:02:56.470> aggressive

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
they had looked for less aggressive

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.650 
they had looked for less aggressive
means<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.580> interaction<00:02:58.030> between<00:02:58.120> players<00:02:58.390> I

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
means of interaction between players I

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.960 
means of interaction between players I
mean<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:59.650> would<00:02:59.860> totally<00:03:00.100> be<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.400> keeper<00:03:00.670> for

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
mean this would totally be a keeper for

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.490 
mean this would totally be a keeper for

me and Jen and we'd be super excited to
get<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.709> final<00:03:03.040> version<00:03:03.520> but<00:03:03.700> as<00:03:04.240> it<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.570> I<00:03:04.600> mean

you<00:03:05.200> know<00:03:05.260> only<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:06.040> vicious<00:03:06.430> need<00:03:06.700> apply<00:03:06.970> if

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
you know only the vicious need apply if

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.330 
you know only the vicious need apply if
you<00:03:07.780> want<00:03:07.990> to<00:03:08.080> play<00:03:08.230> exoplanets<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.040> just<00:03:09.190> got

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
you want to play exoplanets you just got

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.460 
you want to play exoplanets you just got
to<00:03:09.490> know<00:03:09.610> that<00:03:09.790> going<00:03:10.060> in<00:03:10.330> another<00:03:10.990> sync<00:03:11.350> thing

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
to know that going in another sync thing

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.470 
to know that going in another sync thing
-<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.830> do<00:03:11.890> think<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:12.520> is<00:03:12.580> definitely<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:13.240> game

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
- I do think this is definitely a game

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.540 
- I do think this is definitely a game
i'm<00:03:13.810> totally<00:03:14.190> hypothesizing<00:03:15.190> here<00:03:15.340> because

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
i'm totally hypothesizing here because

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.490 
i'm totally hypothesizing here because
of<00:03:15.670> course<00:03:15.700> i've<00:03:16.180> only<00:03:16.420> played<00:03:16.540> one<00:03:17.080> game<00:03:17.260> all

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
of course i've only played one game all

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.930 
of course i've only played one game all
the<00:03:17.620> way<00:03:17.650> through<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.100> you<00:03:18.130> just<00:03:18.370> watch<00:03:18.580> me<00:03:18.820> do

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
the way through and you just watch me do

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.190 
the way through and you just watch me do
it<00:03:19.030> then<00:03:19.120> i<00:03:19.239> played<00:03:19.450> another<00:03:19.630> half<00:03:19.840> game<00:03:20.050> on

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
it then i played another half game on

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.479 
it then i played another half game on
top<00:03:20.350> that<00:03:20.560> with<00:03:20.650> my<00:03:20.739> wife<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.040> we<00:03:21.130> had<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.340> stop

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
top that with my wife and we had to stop

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.210 
top that with my wife and we had to stop
but<00:03:22.180> i<00:03:22.450> would<00:03:22.900> hypothesize<00:03:23.320> that<00:03:23.709> this<00:03:23.980> game

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
but i would hypothesize that this game

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.979 
but i would hypothesize that this game
the<00:03:24.610> more<00:03:24.820> players<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.330> get<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.750> more

the more players you get the more

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.780 
the more players you get the more
interesting<00:03:26.170> it's<00:03:26.769> gonna<00:03:26.920> get<00:03:27.160> because

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
interesting it's gonna get because

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
every single planet in the third orbital

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.770 
every single planet in the third orbital

I'm the only and you get a lot more of
these<00:04:01.000> things<00:04:01.330> popping<00:04:01.840> up<00:04:01.959> all<00:04:02.170> over<00:04:02.230> the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
these things popping up all over the

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.199 
these things popping up all over the
board<00:04:02.860> it's<00:04:03.340> gonna<00:04:03.489> become<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.820> much<00:04:04.180> more

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
board it's gonna become a much more

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.840 
board it's gonna become a much more
interesting<00:04:04.900> and<00:04:05.350> varied<00:04:05.920> solar<00:04:06.220> system<00:04:06.610> so

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
interesting and varied solar system so

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.150 
interesting and varied solar system so
and<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.600> heck<00:04:07.959> may<00:04:08.200> be<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.470> certain<00:04:08.560> extent<00:04:09.070> a

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
and a heck may be to a certain extent a

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.580 
and a heck may be to a certain extent a
little<00:04:09.670> bit<00:04:09.790> less<00:04:09.940> aggressive<00:04:10.090> -<00:04:10.750> because

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
little bit less aggressive - because

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.979 
little bit less aggressive - because
with<00:04:12.190> only<00:04:12.220> two<00:04:12.730> players<00:04:13.000> you<00:04:13.269> know<00:04:13.360> all<00:04:13.570> your

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
with only two players you know all your

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.720 
with only two players you know all your
thought<00:04:14.230> is<00:04:14.470> bent<00:04:14.739> on<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.280> know<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.489> absolute

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
thought is bent on you know the absolute

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.000 
thought is bent on you know the absolute
destruction<00:04:16.450> of<00:04:16.810> your<00:04:16.900> opponent<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.590> so<00:04:17.950> it

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
destruction of your opponent and so it

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.409 
destruction of your opponent and so it
just<00:04:18.040> doesn't<00:04:18.280> work<00:04:18.430> for<00:04:18.489> me<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:18.729> Jen<00:04:18.910> maybe

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
just doesn't work for me and Jen maybe

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.029 
just doesn't work for me and Jen maybe
with<00:04:19.630> more<00:04:19.780> players<00:04:20.049> it's<00:04:20.440> just<00:04:20.650> kind<00:04:20.830> of<00:04:20.890> more

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
with more players it's just kind of more

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.640 
with more players it's just kind of more
oh<00:04:21.220> well<00:04:21.669> oh<00:04:21.849> yeah<00:04:22.240> you<00:04:22.300> kind<00:04:22.539> of<00:04:22.630> got<00:04:22.750> hit<00:04:23.289> in

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
oh well oh yeah you kind of got hit in

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.140 
oh well oh yeah you kind of got hit in
sort<00:04:24.010> of<00:04:24.070> an<00:04:24.160> ancillary<00:04:24.520> way<00:04:24.640> because<00:04:24.940> well<00:04:25.120> I

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
sort of an ancillary way because well I

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.100 
sort of an ancillary way because well I
had<00:04:25.360> to<00:04:25.510> use<00:04:25.690> this

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
had to use this
