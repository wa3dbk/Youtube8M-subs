00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.469
 hello and in this video we will learn 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.469
 create a shell for weapons 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:21.600
 let's start by creating a blue class 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:25.320
 print for this click either in canton 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.090
 browser either create a new one here 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.510
 blueprint class 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.629
 choose ector type let's call it 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.870
 projectile 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:41.549
 that is, the projectile after this two times 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.610
 click on the class and here we will create 

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:49.129
 our projectile, respectively, will be consisted 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.129
 consist of a static misha object 

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:55.870
 so articles 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:01.079
 throw an object konor frame we choose 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:05.860
 By the way Conor Frey in the form of a small cube 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.780
 here a remove one parameter well, 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.960
 Kalyazin, that is, our shell will not 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.430
 interact with other objects and 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.799
 we will need just one more 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.280
 component 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:23.729
 projectile moment is standard already 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:28.420
 the component that it has 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.170
 how our more precisely moves more correctly 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.170
 say tunes our behavior 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.700
 object and then everyone will act like 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.550
 projectile projectile muvment he 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.220
 called here we enter the initial 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.270
 our speed 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.600
 projectile we go and and 2000 and the main thing still 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.869
 the values we need here 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.909
 you can test all values 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.539
 who here have to see how they are 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.479
 affect the movement of our projectile the most 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:05.590
 the main thing is the displacement of our projectile 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:11.030
 coordinate he will have us shoot 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.819
 x-coordinate, respectively, wasps 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.120
 how did you do it all here by 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:21.140
 the default is one respectively 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.950
 save and you can already set our 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:30.140
 projectile projectile and for pretend like 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:33.380
 it you will look see us 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.480
 flew we did not notice accordingly 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:43.630
 x coordinates which remember this is red 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:51.290
 an arrow and see he flew that way 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:52.190
 accordingly let's change y now 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.870
 he will fly away 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:00.440
 in two coordinates as we see here 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.010
 somewhere here he will fly yes here and so 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.900
 by 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.560
 to on vector general flies after 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.200
 have created 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.430
 blue print itself we need to ask 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.989
 that is, we want our player 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.600
 fired could fire shells for 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.170
 this we need to go to blue print 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.500
 editor so we want our projectile 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.959
 fired from the playerâ€™s position for 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.060
 this when you click the mouse button for this 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:36.440
 we have to add new events i mouse 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.829
 want a left mouse button respectively 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:44.359
 we have to create an object of our class 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:49.400
 blueprint enter the name of the full FSB an 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:51.500
 actor from class here naturally we 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.900
 should trigger this event when pressed 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.280
 mouse buttons and be sure to choose our 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.410
 project class 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:05.430
 accordingly this event will be 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:10.170
 create our projectile and here we need 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:14.580
 set another one more parameter this 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:19.769
 Place of origin of our object spawn 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:23.970
 transform pull the knot appears here 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:27.120
 such an event here we set the position 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:34.440
 our projectile where it is created and how it 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:38.400
 we will even be turned 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.340
 from the playerâ€™s position and accordingly 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.320
 in the direction where our player is looking 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.550
 have we should actually get two 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.750
 parameter from player 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:53.430
 his position and his turn like him 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:57.320
 turned therefore to get these 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.320
 parameters we naturally need to get 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.640
 player number standard get function 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.450
 player controller 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.450
 and after that we can already operate 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.290
 positions 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:18.020
 player and his turn accordingly 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:21.190
 here find event miles envelope 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.190
 kane and world space 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:37.100
 this way we get our position 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:37.790
 player and turn we get get control 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.550
 rotation 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:52.000
 With the help of this event this is essentially 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:52.000
 let's all run and as we see here 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:10.490
 we shoot the projectile again from the position 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:10.490
 our player is all about it
