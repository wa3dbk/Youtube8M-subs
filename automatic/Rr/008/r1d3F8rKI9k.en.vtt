work out formula i take i know it's cold

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.880 
work out formula i take i know it's cold
right<00:00:14.940> now<00:00:15.320> original<00:00:16.320> i<00:00:16.350> say<00:00:16.560> right<00:00:16.770> now

right now original i say right now
because<00:00:17.160> i<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.279> change<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.850> up<00:00:17.940> from<00:00:18.119> time<00:00:18.300> to

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
because i do change it up from time to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.900 
because i do change it up from time to
time<00:00:18.590> this<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> good<00:00:20.010> workout<00:00:20.310> supplement

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
time this is a good workout supplement

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.599 
time this is a good workout supplement
it<00:00:21.270> gets<00:00:21.449> an<00:00:21.570> extra<00:00:21.840> blood<00:00:22.020> flow<00:00:22.609> vascularity

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
it gets an extra blood flow vascularity

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.460 
it gets an extra blood flow vascularity
things<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.180> kind<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.960> benefits<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.439> a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
things that kind of benefits you in a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.439 
things that kind of benefits you in a
workout<00:00:25.769> because<00:00:25.980> more<00:00:26.460> blood<00:00:26.699> flow<00:00:26.730> that

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
workout because more blood flow that

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.330 
workout because more blood flow that
obviously<00:00:27.750> means<00:00:27.930> more<00:00:28.140> oxygen<00:00:28.619> more<00:00:28.859> oxygen

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
obviously means more oxygen more oxygen

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.640 
obviously means more oxygen more oxygen
more<00:00:29.519> nutrients<00:00:30.060> also<00:00:30.449> means<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.439> work

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
more nutrients also means you get work

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.040 
more nutrients also means you get work

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
longer harder faster enable-if don't

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.840 
longer harder faster enable-if don't
actually<00:00:34.260> come<00:00:34.410> stronger<00:00:34.890> when<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.700> take

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
actually come stronger when you take

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.090 
actually come stronger when you take
this<00:00:36.059> likely<00:00:36.719> claims<00:00:36.989> you're<00:00:37.380> actually<00:00:37.739> just

able to use a straight that you have a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.479 
able to use a straight that you have a
little<00:00:40.170> bit<00:00:40.290> better<00:00:40.440> sir<00:00:40.770> will<00:00:40.980> utilize<00:00:41.309> those

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
little bit better sir will utilize those

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.209 
little bit better sir will utilize those
muscles<00:00:41.879> stuff<00:00:42.090> full<00:00:42.210> potential<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:44.070> that's

casein proteins like cottage cheese

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.039 
casein proteins like cottage cheese
because<00:01:40.049> that's<00:01:40.200> weird<00:01:40.500> no<00:01:40.829> casing<00:01:41.750> is<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.960> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
because that's weird no casing is in a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.410 
because that's weird no casing is in a
food<00:01:43.229> source<00:01:43.549> very<00:01:44.549> slow<00:01:44.700> digesting<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.299> that

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
food source very slow digesting so that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.090 
food source very slow digesting so that
we<00:01:45.509> would<00:01:45.630> usually<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> cuff<00:01:46.409> supply<00:01:46.829> of
