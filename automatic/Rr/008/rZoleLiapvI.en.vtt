00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.370
 hello everyone today I bring you the last 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.350
 step or the final step of exo isstech 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.730
 zombies on the map of hold break and good 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.140
 has not been able to upload it before as we have 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.820
 been a little boy reads rings and such 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.279
 these days but good here you have the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.910
 last step of ellis tÃ©rek once 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.010
 you have done step number 6 we come to 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.650
 what is the computer and the computer 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.210
 Well, it tells us that we have to 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.100
 shoot or kill several zombies and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.570
 get some cards made even 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.489
 you do not even need to go to the computer 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.379
 the only thing if you want to hear the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.240
 track yes yes no but once you have 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.620
 done the last step as you see here there 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.329
 some cards when we kill the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.250
 zombies that come out automatically 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.590
 this would be one of the cards and what 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.570
 we have to do is let's kill 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.860
 zombies were coming out these cards what 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.050
 The only thing we have to do is take the 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.670
 so you can have a low idea 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.619
 confirmed you kill the zombie you take the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.050
 card is worth what we need are 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.820
 49 cards each character since I 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.100
 I'm explaining for four players 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.290
 It's worth for one player, only one 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.970
 player would need 49 here every 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.250
 character 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.820
 we need 49 cards ie the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.850
 segurata needs 49 aunt 49 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.630
 which would be cleaning other 49 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.580
 and the one who would be the boss no other 49 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.040
 then we each need our 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.410
 49 cards I like we spent a round or 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.270
 all good one round I do not believe then in 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.340
 about two three rounds and once we've 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.450
 done well we already have all 49 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.400
 cards what we have to do is 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.680
 come to some panels that are worth 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.810
 each character has his panel the lille and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.030
 It would be this that I would have to take this 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.780
 which is here next to the exo room 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.150
 it's worth then 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.280
 as it was called the security is worth the 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.200
 surely this one of care has to come 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.080
 just right next to the room 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.610
 of the exo there is also another panel would be 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.440
 this voucher would have to be placed here 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.459
 ahead and wait is worth now I tell you 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.130
 exactly what we have to do 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.650
 OK later 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.420
 you have to go to the panel that is 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.730
 right next to the titan or us 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.319
 we see the titan is worth it where is good 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.850
 is the drink is of health worth 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.709
 right here on the left as it is 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.500
 This panel this would be the worth sickle 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.140
 there you will have to put in front and then 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.480
 the last panel is worth it 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.760
 would be that of the boss is just in the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.519
 principle next to the area where it is 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.840
 what to clean us to disinfect 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.950
 what would this be from here what 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.989
 we have to do is that we give the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.319
 four at a time and we count to three 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:46.560
 tenths 1 2 3 already and just press 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.660
 what the button would be worth until it 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.310
 put in green is worth we simply count 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.019
 three and we have to give the four 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.489
 characters at the same time is worth when 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.040
 four characters at once we have given 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.440
 the next thing we have to do is go 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.209
 to the computer, click on the computer 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.020
 the computer will talk to us and such will tell us 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.870
 good 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.240
 they gave us some things and what we have 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.760
 what to do is go to the exo room and 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.830
 take the exo and it tells us that it is already 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.570
 activated we did not know 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.400
 exactly why we did the 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.900
 first time and it did not come out then we went back 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.390
 to the room again and went back to give 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.800
 until there comes a moment that does not sound 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.870
 like the background helicopter and it tells us 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.190
 that the vehicle is already coming, it's worth 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.190
 I'm going to leave you with the audio of the film 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.450
 good here as you have seen then I 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.430
 I just got the end just 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.440
 in which in which the helicopter good 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.940
 Well, the only thing that the 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.560
 helicopter was coming he was getting 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.660
 just above and what you have seen 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.400
 it crashes and they give us the achievement 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.770
 we can continue the round us 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.920
 We were continuing a little and good in 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.670
 6 a series of things happens once we have 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.650
 made the easter ec in the room of exo I 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.690
 I could not record it because good with the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.940
 Hurry, I did not record it but in the living room 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.489
 the exo is unlocked opens we said 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.650
 a kind of panel that is where 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.810
 we can improve the weapon is worth what happens 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.359
 that in that panel we are only going to be able to 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.919
 upgrade weapons from level 20 to bear 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.200
 that is, once we have the weapon 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.600
 level 20 we can put the gun and we 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.610
 will give the diamond camouflage can by 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.950
 to say well it would be good if we 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.680
 would the weapon at level 25 worth 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.150
 basically it would be that apart from the achievement and 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.830
 that's it would be what would be the 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.800
 district of exo zombies the map out 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.840
 break for four players and good 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.909
 I will put the description all the steps 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.979
 in case you want to even think I'll do 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:44.259
 a whole remix of all the steps for 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.940
 make it a little clearer so nothing 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.169
 this has been the hysteria that I hope that 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.909
 you liked it if you liked to vote 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.289
 I like it and favorites and see you in the 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.289
 next video greetings to all 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.220
 rectified
