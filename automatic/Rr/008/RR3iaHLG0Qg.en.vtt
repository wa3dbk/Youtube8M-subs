00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 hello everyone guys hello everyone and 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.680
 welcome back to this new video from 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.519
 then as announced in the video 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.480
 previous one 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:17.070
 Today I'll show you how to put on s 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:23.550
 on android then it is very simple enough 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:31.349
 go to the play store was his 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:41.820
 about and write and spend spr 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:43.350
 a certain but also danced launcher e 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.800
 go find it 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.789
 the first result is vivian and this does 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.860
 andrea go and install it for you vi 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.899
 me is me to open them volvera barn 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.719
 Install accepts and downloads once 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.539
 installed you will see these continue 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.860
 here you see and if you went there to 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.860
 that is, click to press 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.990
 here you will see this screen 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.299
 easily very similar to ios net and if 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.659
 let's take a slide 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.650
 multitasking and this option that 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.110
 precisely I did 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.579
 in the previous video also doing 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:35.460
 adds we can put shortcuts 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:39.060
 network and widgets also widget puts it all 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.360
 the widgets you want in fact are created there 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.860
 an opposite page for widgets you see 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:52.350
 for example, this is the youtube here 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.070
 precisely and then if pressed squeezed on xv 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.930
 will delete the widgets then we can 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.079
 move the application anyway 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.090
 equal to ios network and delete 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:08.259
 therefore the folders are also 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.259
 practically identical 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.989
 I make you see virtually the same 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.790
 we give them a name and then they worked 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.860
 eliminating is very simple 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.560
 therefore for the sum of the similar all 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:31.370
 iphone this will be enough to download 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:35.110
 this programs manson this theme for 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.610
 instead the unlocking we have to install 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.069
 first thing or locker 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.489
 now return a moment on the home 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.690
 because this makes it easier to play now 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.940
 store 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:54.849
 let's go first we have to 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.849
 unlocking we need to download glock er.go 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:04.519
 at home and also here the first result 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:09.160
 that you get this in green it 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:13.329
 go to install then use then 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:20.930
 it opens or uninstalls me but it comes to you 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:27.049
 who will download once everything is done 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:39.850
 this will always be enough to go on the play 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:39.850
 store and go look for iphone 5 iphone 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:48.370
 sorry iphone 5 because i get the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.370
 point loc 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:04:03.390
 green dam is always like this I ca n't 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:09.840
 write now right now 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:12.180
 well go there the heat the first one there 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.220
 this one comes here 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.510
 go and install it too 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:22.710
 you see it's all done once 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:28.620
 things is really very simple 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:32.760
 go to apr go go locker go on in 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:38.310
 stables and go to select iphone 5 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:43.820
 weight go to click on apply see 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.820
 this button which in mass applies 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:54.030
 go and complete it and live written 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:05:00.750
 used at this point we have here the 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:05.610
 our sum similar to iphone and we have 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.910
 also the unlock similar to iphone with the 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:15.690
 camera shortcut 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:21.150
 you see so then it's a lot 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:25.560
 simple you ca n't see and I hope you 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.840

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.440
