solution<00:00:26.970> but<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.619> what<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> would

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
solution but this is what the I would

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
suggest you do take about 2/3 of a cup

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.660 
suggest you do take about 2/3 of a cup
of<00:00:34.620> apple<00:00:35.219> juice<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.960> combine<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
of apple juice and combine that with the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.110 
of apple juice and combine that with the
olive<00:00:39.300> oil<00:00:39.770> and<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.890> half<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.190> cup<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.610> olive<00:00:41.790> oil

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
you would with a citrus juice and use

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.279 
you would with a citrus juice and use
that<00:00:49.530> instead<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.820> ideal<00:00:51.289> definitely

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
that instead it's not ideal definitely

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.000 
that instead it's not ideal definitely
not<00:00:52.500> ideal<00:00:52.789> but<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:54.180> second<00:00:55.050> best<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.860> would

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
not ideal but it's second best I would

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.420 
not ideal but it's second best I would
try<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.809> know<00:00:57.930> maybe<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.770> let

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
try that and you know maybe you can let

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.799 
try that and you know maybe you can let
us<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.609> how<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.270> went

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
us know how this went

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.560 
us know how this went
the<00:01:01.590> main<00:01:01.770> thing<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.219> there's<00:01:03.000> enough<00:01:03.480> of

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
the main thing is that there's enough of

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.990 
the main thing is that there's enough of
olive<00:01:03.870> oil<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.760> biggest

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
olive oil and that is the biggest

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.660 
olive oil and that is the biggest
trigger<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.869> citrus<00:01:07.290> juice<00:01:07.619> also<00:01:07.950> helps<00:01:08.520> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
trigger the citrus juice also helps to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.289 
trigger the citrus juice also helps to
relax<00:01:08.970> or<00:01:09.360> expand<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.860> late<00:01:11.070> by<00:01:11.670> dogs<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
relax or expand on that late by dogs and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.740 
relax or expand on that late by dogs and
to<00:01:12.570> discharge<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:14.340> stones<00:01:15.150> from<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> liver

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
to discharge the stones from the liver

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.830 
to discharge the stones from the liver
and<00:01:15.960> gall<00:01:16.200> bladder<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:17.369> Apple<00:01:18.299> choose<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
and gall bladder but Apple choose the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.820 
and gall bladder but Apple choose the
malic<00:01:19.200> acid<00:01:19.650> has<00:01:19.860> somewhat<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.509> fact<00:01:21.830> and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
malic acid has somewhat that in fact and

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.830 
malic acid has somewhat that in fact and
so<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.189> might<00:01:24.030> want<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> do<00:01:24.570> that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
so you might want to do that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.550 
so you might want to do that
if<00:01:25.170> apple<00:01:25.950> juice<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.990> acceptable<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.170> you

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
if apple juice is not acceptable to you

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.700 
if apple juice is not acceptable to you
you<00:01:28.920> may<00:01:29.150> use<00:01:30.150> half<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.290> cup<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:33.570> sour<00:01:34.020> tart

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
you may use half a cup of the sour tart

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.899

cherry<00:01:35.369> juice<00:01:35.790> and

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
cherry juice and

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.139 
cherry juice and
you<00:01:37.090> said<00:01:37.359> instead<00:01:37.630> half<00:01:38.439> a<00:01:38.710> cup<00:01:39.039> of<00:01:39.310> sour<00:01:39.640> tart

churches<00:01:41.079> and<00:01:41.409> that<00:01:42.399> would<00:01:42.640> be<00:01:42.850> another<00:01:43.319> good

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
churches and that would be another good

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.889 
churches and that would be another good
way<00:01:44.499> to<00:01:44.609> substitute<00:01:45.609> that<00:01:45.789> I'm<00:01:46.329> not<00:01:46.569> a<00:01:46.600> good

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
way to substitute that I'm not a good

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.709 
way to substitute that I'm not a good
way<00:01:47.170> but<00:01:47.229> down<00:01:47.799> again<00:01:48.490> second<00:01:49.060> or<00:01:49.179> third<00:01:49.420> best

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
way but down again second or third best

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.849 
way but down again second or third best
I<00:01:50.140> hope<00:01:50.950> this<00:01:51.549> works<00:01:51.819> for<00:01:52.119> you<00:01:52.299> and<00:01:52.539> will<00:01:53.530> I
