00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:23.460
 ingredients 3 and fresh anchovies oil 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.189
 extra virgin olive oil wine one glass 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.619
 of wine a glass of vinegar salt lemon 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:36.769
 chilli a quarter of an onion and 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:40.519
 parsley first thing we try the anchovies 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:46.699
 the plug must be removed 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:50.180
 we make so tips we have complete 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.180
 we give you away 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.170
 naturally anchovies must be 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.710
 fresh I recommend the says were 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.379
 clean 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.240
 in the meantime we wash them we put in 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:13.130
 boiling 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.130
 the certain wine and salt 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.770
 we have loyalists 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.210
 oren and well the water that the anchovies yes 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.780
 must really clean well row away 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.590
 all the blood turning slightly 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.380
 I recommend it without breaking once 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.510
 wash and drain them well maybe 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.610
 we crash with a little spare and home 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:55.510
 that the water is off and we are going to fix it 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:58.510
 in a dish thus set up 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.510
 so 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.470
 now let's go pour it 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.470
 on the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:25.330
 and the anchovies became white immediately 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:28.930
 there we go immediately to pour then he did 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.910
 this operation and we went to dab 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.770
 I recommend you always leave me like this 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:40.600
 because they ca n't be moved 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:48.430
 because so far we take lemons and 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:50.640
 we write it on a tuft of us 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.640
 parsley 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:03.480
 I go this simple though 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:10.140
 we also put the onion and grind it 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:15.660
 on the so-called we add a little 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:22.230
 chilli that already chopped it e 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:26.730
 we put the oil we cover with oil salt 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:31.380
 so they are already beautiful white we can 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:35.190
 eat once we put the oil we do 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.310
 so so that he brags for everything then 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.290
 we put them in the fridge at least a couple 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.970
 hours before eating them, yes 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.600
 it flavor the whole well 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.700
