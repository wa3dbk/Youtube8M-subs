thank<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.459> Betty<00:02:25.709> okay<00:02:26.709> now<00:02:27.639> he<00:02:27.700> won't<00:02:28.180> be

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
thank you Betty okay now he won't be

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.479 
thank you Betty okay now he won't be
able<00:02:28.329> to<00:02:28.480> purify<00:02:28.769> but<00:02:29.769> I'm<00:02:29.980> thinking<00:02:30.340> he's

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
able to purify but I'm thinking he's

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.740 
able to purify but I'm thinking he's
like<00:02:30.989> he's<00:02:31.989> similar<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.530> pure<00:02:32.950> water<00:02:33.750> level

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
like he's similar to a pure water level

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.569 
like he's similar to a pure water level
60<00:02:35.109> so<00:02:35.380> he<00:02:35.560> has<00:02:35.680> like<00:02:35.799> a<00:02:35.829> certain<00:02:36.010> percentage

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
60 so he has like a certain percentage

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.819 
60 so he has like a certain percentage
but<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.630> chances<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:38.019> him<00:02:38.170> even<00:02:39.359> breaking<00:02:40.359> is

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
but the chances of him even breaking is
