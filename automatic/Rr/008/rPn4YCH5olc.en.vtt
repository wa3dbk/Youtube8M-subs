00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.030
 Let's show you how to change the 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:12.369
 the brake pad of the edital of the line 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.049
 he spun top row that have the same 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:18.340
 construction 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.500
 Hellish, he's the one to pass over her. 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.170
 is held by a pin with music and 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.750
 presence here is more security by 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.400
 the thread may not be 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:33.129
 It did not go so easily. 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.350
 it has a theme that low 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.640
 Those tablets do not end there. 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.859
 bar by gravity 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.839
 so that you can do this 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.969
 change of tablets in this case here 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.100
 to ride what is not what we are 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.159
 making it a question of getting more 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.219
 easy to show in detail to you more 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:54.100
 that brake you can make the exchange with 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.370
 He takes his wheel in Bahia and has to 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.559
 loose the connections to avoid 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.809
 because then in the hour of 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.900
 you have to redo the 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.420
 centralization of the brake is fine here is 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:13.030
 anyway basically pull the first 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:19.000
 line with a key there is from the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:21.550
 pin size you make the strip this 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.870
 time out is with you it's a screw 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.780
 thin to avoid leaving the field with the 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.390
 theorist taking off 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.210
 you basically pull the set of 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.270
 patients at the time this brake has no 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.820
 box inside is then facilitated by 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.970
 the team for another reason if there is 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.730
 a black lock 'that is, if 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.860
 by chance the transport without the wheel without 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.320
 the disc here in the middle the brake was 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.170
 triggered and he placed the partners a 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.600
 another is you can take sharing 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.180
 out and then push the issues of 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.670
 back extend a screwdriver a 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.150
 key there a little bit bigger 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.650
 It's to change without needing a 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.979
 bleed the brakes which have 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.290
 to the beam and that prevents pulled brake is 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.540
 treatment is 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.910
 practically impossible without that brown 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.860
 a tablet or without 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.850
 insert a boring inside and 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.280
 Making them back is an option. 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.940
 back in place has to be 100 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.880
 A little bet is taking place from now on 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.070
 It's easy for you if you need it. 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.260
 if you continue to defend the body 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.390
 the other side is to win a 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.140
 good place to put the same thing back 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.020
 that having a ball is with you 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.630
 the canopy does not have there is and if that line 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.590
 which has no more right side can 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.590
 vote yes to vote have problem you 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.470
 does the pet and at home he is and 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.130
 run like a drawer 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.090
 put it there just put a pin back 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.760
 and the president 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.670
 then the time to put the route between 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.600
 many others remember is that because that 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:16.310
 happens throughout the month and uses the 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:19.340
 you can redo these obstacles 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.150
 to do maintenance is to clean in here 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.980
 It's something you have to do. 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.239
 regularly to avoid the cold gets 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.760
 getting too hot the disc is 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.100
 you end up with your partners as different 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.380
 You end up in this country, there is little patience. 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.350
 new has to do the center is also 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.800
 How do you do that in the other video too? 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.560
 the freitas installation in the bay is 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.040
 super simple voting in an accent 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.140
 Just put the wheel and do the 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.510
 treatment is good to put the president 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.299
 it's super simple to change a 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.570
 tablet of this line stretched higher than 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.570
