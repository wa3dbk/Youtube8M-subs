00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.719
 with more slender map of the pits so 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.210
 this is the graffiti effectively 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.039
 and this is one of the ones that called me the most 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.090
 attention the other day when he played for 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.070
 the night so over there we'll see if we 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.689
 we make friends of slender and it leaves us 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.529
 to bother all you do not have to 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.480

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.480

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.090
 Gentlemen the bourgeois and the other are both 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:59.940
 protagonists of the story so 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:07.100
 I'm going to lower it a bit if I'm not going to paste 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.100
 some pretty brutal ones there is 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.270
 Well, gentlemen, nothing 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.890

 come Uncle slender we are already known 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.670

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.409
 always me what blogs tick does not 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.289
 I see a lot of grace because you're a little 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.659
 crazy about the map looking for leaves like that 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.659

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.800

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.860

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.580

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.869
