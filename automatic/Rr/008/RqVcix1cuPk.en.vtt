00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
and maybe creating problems with their

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.660

it's very difficult and then they have

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.879 
it's very difficult and then they have
to<00:04:36.220> go<00:04:36.430> back<00:04:36.910> over<00:04:37.509> it<00:04:37.570> and<00:04:38.110> wipe<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:38.650> tape

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
to go back over it and wipe the tape

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.120 
to go back over it and wipe the tape
down<00:04:39.190> with<00:04:39.220> their<00:04:39.639> hands<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.330> get<00:04:40.509> it<00:04:40.570> to<00:04:41.130> stick

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
down with their hands to get it to stick

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.339 
down with their hands to get it to stick
properly<00:04:42.460> all<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.030> way<00:04:43.389> down<00:04:43.720> and<00:04:44.169> there's

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
properly all the way down and there's

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.920 
properly all the way down and there's
just<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.770> lot<00:04:45.009> of<00:04:45.039> time<00:04:45.400> wasted<00:04:46.030> in<00:04:46.210> doing<00:04:46.660> that

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
just a lot of time wasted in doing that

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.860 
just a lot of time wasted in doing that
not<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:47.889> mention<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.669> tape<00:04:48.910> probably<00:04:49.479> doesn't

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
not to mention the tape probably doesn't

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.710 
not to mention the tape probably doesn't
go<00:04:49.990> on<00:04:50.260> very<00:04:50.590> straight<00:04:51.190> gets<00:04:51.970> wrinkled<00:04:52.570> and

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
go on very straight gets wrinkled and

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.659 
go on very straight gets wrinkled and
crinkled<00:04:52.780> and<00:04:53.590> it<00:04:53.710> just<00:04:53.979> doesn't<00:04:54.400> look<00:04:54.639> very

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
crinkled and it just doesn't look very

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.270 
crinkled and it just doesn't look very
nice

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
nice

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.490 
nice
another<00:04:57.280> problem<00:04:57.849> is<00:04:58.240> that<00:04:58.270> they<00:04:58.930> get<00:04:59.199> in<00:04:59.380> a

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
another problem is that they get in a

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.779 
another problem is that they get in a
really<00:04:59.710> big<00:05:00.039> hurry

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
really big hurry

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.270 
really big hurry
they<00:05:01.210> don't<00:05:01.479> really<00:05:01.750> apply<00:05:02.169> the<00:05:02.320> pressure<00:05:02.860> at

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
they don't really apply the pressure at

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.120 
they don't really apply the pressure at
all<00:05:03.310> so<00:05:03.909> it<00:05:04.060> doesn't<00:05:04.539> get<00:05:04.690> enough<00:05:05.229> of<00:05:05.470> the

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
all so it doesn't get enough of the

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.460 
all so it doesn't get enough of the
pressure<00:05:06.580> on<00:05:07.150> down<00:05:07.449> the<00:05:07.659> sides<00:05:07.930> of<00:05:08.139> the<00:05:08.229> box

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
pressure on down the sides of the box

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.529 
pressure on down the sides of the box
and<00:05:08.770> they<00:05:08.860> come<00:05:09.130> in<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.490> next<00:05:09.669> morning<00:05:09.880> and

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
and they come in the next morning and

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.839 
and they come in the next morning and
the<00:05:10.599> flaps<00:05:10.900> are<00:05:11.169> popped<00:05:11.440> up<00:05:11.650> on<00:05:11.919> each<00:05:12.130> end<00:05:12.520> and

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
the flaps are popped up on each end and

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:15.330 
the flaps are popped up on each end and
a<00:05:13.389> lot<00:05:13.599> of<00:05:13.630> times<00:05:13.990> it<00:05:14.229> has<00:05:14.259> nothing<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.830> do<00:05:15.039> that

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
a lot of times it has nothing to do that

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.760 
a lot of times it has nothing to do that
with<00:05:15.759> the<00:05:15.909> tank<00:05:16.180> not<00:05:16.389> sticking<00:05:17.020> properly<00:05:17.620> it

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
with the tank not sticking properly it

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.350 
with the tank not sticking properly it
has<00:05:17.800> to<00:05:18.220> do<00:05:18.400> with<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.729> fact<00:05:18.970> that<00:05:19.090> there<00:05:19.330> just

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
has to do with the fact that there just

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.170 
has to do with the fact that there just
wasn't<00:05:19.750> enough<00:05:20.259> pressure<00:05:21.159> applied<00:05:21.639> to<00:05:21.759> get

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
wasn't enough pressure applied to get

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.390 
wasn't enough pressure applied to get
that<00:05:22.479> adhesive<00:05:23.080> to<00:05:23.380> adhere<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.159> Box

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400
