recommended but because it was under my
sink<00:01:05.680> I'm<00:01:06.400> us<00:01:06.580> about<00:01:06.850> this<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.120> long<00:01:07.240> time<00:01:07.390> ago

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
sink I'm us about this a long time ago

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.330 
sink I'm us about this a long time ago
and<00:01:07.810> just<00:01:07.870> didn't<00:01:08.200> realize<00:01:08.320> I<00:01:08.470> had<00:01:08.590> it's<00:01:08.980> often

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
and just didn't realize I had it's often

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.670 
and just didn't realize I had it's often
using<00:01:09.640> it<00:01:09.760> and<00:01:10.060> it<00:01:10.960> does<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.260> good<00:01:11.470> job<00:01:11.530> of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
using it and it does a good job of

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.410 
using it and it does a good job of
conditioning<00:01:12.220> my<00:01:12.340> hair<00:01:12.370> so<00:01:12.850> I<00:01:12.940> thought<00:01:13.150> I'll

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
conditioning my hair so I thought I'll

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.910 
conditioning my hair so I thought I'll
go<00:01:13.630> ahead<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.020> do<00:01:14.110> something<00:01:14.470> already<00:01:14.650> had

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
go ahead and do something already had

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.520 
go ahead and do something already had
instead<00:01:15.430> of<00:01:15.520> buying<00:01:15.729> new<00:01:16.690> conditioner<00:01:17.260> and<00:01:17.410> to

try a new method I figure what's the

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.940 
try a new method I figure what's the
worst<00:01:19.390> that<00:01:19.540> can<00:01:19.660> happen<00:01:19.720> but<00:01:20.500> don't<00:01:20.680> like<00:01:20.800> way

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.880 
and then while it was dripping wet with
conditioner<00:01:52.990> I<00:01:54.000> separate<00:01:55.000> each<00:01:55.210> curl<00:01:55.890> into

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
conditioner I separate each curl into

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.310 
conditioner I separate each curl into
its<00:01:57.280> individual<00:01:57.820> kind<00:01:58.570> of<00:01:58.630> coil<00:01:58.930> and<00:02:01.080> my<00:02:02.080> hair

its individual kind of coil and my hair

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.899 
its individual kind of coil and my hair
kind<00:02:02.650> of<00:02:02.740> naturally<00:02:03.159> evolved<00:02:03.520> into<00:02:03.700> ring

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
kind of naturally evolved into ring

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.090 
kind of naturally evolved into ring
words<00:02:04.090> when<00:02:04.300> it's<00:02:04.450> wet<00:02:04.720> so<00:02:05.290> I<00:02:05.320> just<00:02:05.710> kind<00:02:05.979> of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
words when it's wet so I just kind of

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.440 
words when it's wet so I just kind of

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
straight cells really surprised that it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.770 
straight cells really surprised that it
actually<00:02:15.549> kind<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:15.940> curled<00:02:16.209> up<00:02:16.299> a<00:02:16.420> little<00:02:16.630> bit

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
actually kind of curled up a little bit

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.479 
actually kind of curled up a little bit
because<00:02:17.680> I've<00:02:17.860> got<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.040> lot<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.400> the

about<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.299> texture<00:02:22.600> my<00:02:22.810> yard<00:02:23.019> or<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.170> can't

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
about the texture my yard or I can't

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.530 
about the texture my yard or I can't
quite<00:02:23.560> figure<00:02:23.860> out<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.940> know<00:02:24.970> what<00:02:25.269> around

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
quite figure out you know what around

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.220 
quite figure out you know what around
the<00:02:26.500> racy<00:02:26.860> for<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.519> where<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.510> fall<00:02:28.780> into<00:02:29.110> that

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
the racy for a where I fall into that

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.840 
the racy for a where I fall into that
realm<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.650> think<00:02:29.830> parts<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.190> my<00:02:30.280> hair<00:02:30.489> might

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
realm I think parts of my hair might

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.390 
realm I think parts of my hair might
be<00:02:31.060> like<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.540> three<00:02:32.260> or<00:02:32.530> three<00:02:32.740> because<00:02:33.160> are<00:02:33.250> so

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
be like a three or three because are so

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.910 
be like a three or three because are so
straight<00:02:33.730> but<00:02:34.480> anyway<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.470> just<00:02:35.500> wanted<00:02:35.860> to

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
straight but anyway I just wanted to

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.330 
straight but anyway I just wanted to
come<00:02:36.220> show<00:02:36.820> me<00:02:37.210> results<00:02:37.770> my<00:02:38.770> hair<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.160> probably

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
come show me results my hair is probably

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.460 
come show me results my hair is probably
about<00:02:39.610> 99%<00:02:40.540> dry<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.540> actually<00:02:43.720> did<00:02:44.110> sit

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
about 99% dry and I actually did sit

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.020 
about 99% dry and I actually did sit
under<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.800> dryer<00:02:44.830> for<00:02:45.100> about<00:02:45.520> 30<00:02:45.790> minutes

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
under the dryer for about 30 minutes

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.850 
under the dryer for about 30 minutes
after<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.570> apply<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.930> conditioner<00:02:47.260> just<00:02:47.740> to

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
after I apply the conditioner just to

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.470 
after I apply the conditioner just to
get<00:02:48.010> my<00:02:48.130> hair<00:02:48.310> started<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.700> dry<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.030> because<00:02:49.390> I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
get my hair started to dry and because I

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.150 
get my hair started to dry and because I
didn't<00:02:49.780> want<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:50.020> have<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> soaking<00:02:50.770> wet<00:02:50.920> head

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
didn't want to have a soaking wet head

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.910 
didn't want to have a soaking wet head
all<00:02:51.820> day<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.050> wasn't<00:02:53.440> dry<00:02:53.620> all<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:53.800> way

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
all day so it wasn't dry all the way

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.890 
all day so it wasn't dry all the way
when<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.190> finished<00:02:54.610> under<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.150> dryer<00:02:55.270> but<00:02:55.690> it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
when I finished under the dryer but it

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.430 
when I finished under the dryer but it
was<00:02:56.020> probably<00:02:56.850> in<00:02:57.850> fact<00:02:58.270> it<00:02:58.510> sits<00:02:58.810> right<00:02:58.930> quite

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
was probably in fact it sits right quite

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.530 
was probably in fact it sits right quite
a<00:02:59.470> bit<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.950> in<00:03:00.190> here<00:03:00.460> was<00:03:00.670> maybe<00:03:00.880> about<00:03:01.120> half

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
a bit and in here was maybe about half

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.040 
a bit and in here was maybe about half
dry<00:03:02.880> after<00:03:03.880> I<00:03:04.090> said<00:03:04.270> I<00:03:04.330> was<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.510> drive<00:03:04.720> for<00:03:04.900> 30

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
dry after I said I was a drive for 30

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.410 
dry after I said I was a drive for 30
minutes<00:03:05.320> so<00:03:06.280> if<00:03:06.640> anyone<00:03:06.910> out<00:03:06.940> there<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.210> enough

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
minutes so if anyone out there is enough

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.060 
minutes so if anyone out there is enough
time<00:03:07.630> with<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.930> hair<00:03:08.110> dryer<00:03:08.320> I<00:03:08.710> think<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:08.950> you

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
time with a hair dryer I think that you

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.430 
time with a hair dryer I think that you
could<00:03:09.190> sit<00:03:09.370> under<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:09.640> dryer<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:10.170> it'll<00:03:11.170> film

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
could sit under the dryer and it'll film

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.490 
could sit under the dryer and it'll film
they<00:03:12.310> won't<00:03:12.490> have<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.670> data<00:03:12.940> effect<00:03:13.360> but<00:03:13.720> anyway

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
they won't have a data effect but anyway

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.980 
they won't have a data effect but anyway
just<00:03:14.860> wanted<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.430> say<00:03:15.820> thank<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.270> cronulla
