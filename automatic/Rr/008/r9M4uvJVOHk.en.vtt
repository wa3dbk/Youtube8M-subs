 each of these tanks contains a portion of sea a portion of rolling 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.439
 this third of these decisions also accounts for the great biodiversity 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.739
 that characterizes this country 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:18.709

 We have experience are 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.819

 here they can 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.879
 here can asthma 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.139
 other expressions of life 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.139
 respect them 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.659
 now the ball a little bit what happens behind each third that finish 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:21.769
 to see 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.769
 we are a group of 12 people 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.079
 very especially 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.399
 even so the animals that are part of our collection fed them 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.599
 efe the sample that the physical conditions 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.099
 of the 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.599
 how it has to be 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.039
 we need 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.939
 or the elements 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.719
 a los controls 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.729
 our animals efe 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.659
 come situations of captivity 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.219
 for what 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:55.169
 Judge 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.099
 possibility to meet them 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.099
 5 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.169
 and in such sacrificed 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.469
 believe that this year in a 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:07.379
 staff habitat 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.390
 they are here for us to learn from they are here to 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:12.429
 what 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:13.310
 we go with them 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.820
 then we have to guarantee that this year also
