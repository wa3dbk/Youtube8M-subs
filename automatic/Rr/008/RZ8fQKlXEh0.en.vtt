how I achieved all the grooves and the
partitions<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.550> surface<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> element

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
partitions in the surface of the element

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.840 
partitions in the surface of the element
without<00:00:42.450> having<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.079> etch<00:00:43.290> them<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.739> after<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850

going to be using don't have all the
surface<00:00:50.850> details<00:00:51.270> built<00:00:52.050> into<00:00:52.320> them<00:00:52.469> when<00:00:52.559> you

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
surface details built into them when you

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.100 
surface details built into them when you
get<00:00:52.860> them<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.430> know<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.760> depends<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.300> who

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
know started to use you know you may

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.759 
know started to use you know you may
have<00:01:03.480> different<00:01:03.870> techniques<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.619> what

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
have different techniques but this what

have different techniques but this what
works<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.159> me<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.489> uh<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:06.060> draw<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
works for me is uh I draw all the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.160 
works for me is uh I draw all the
surface<00:01:07.530> details<00:01:08.180> on<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> helmet<00:01:10.020> all

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
surface details on to the helmet all

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.990 
surface details on to the helmet all
this<00:01:10.380> red<00:01:10.590> mark<00:01:10.619> while<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.369> red<00:01:11.520> sharpie<00:01:11.820> on

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
this red mark while the red sharpie on

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.330 
this red mark while the red sharpie on
here<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:13.189> representing<00:01:14.189> raised<00:01:14.520> or<00:01:14.990> recessed

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
here is representing raised or recessed

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.030 
here is representing raised or recessed
portions<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> helmet<00:01:17.939> now<00:01:18.740> once<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.890> got

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
portions of the helmet now once you got

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.350 
portions of the helmet now once you got
them<00:01:20.159> drawn<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.090> they're

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
them drawn out in there and they're

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.179 
them drawn out in there and they're
symmetrical<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.259> where<00:01:22.830> they<00:01:22.950> should<00:01:23.159> be

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
symmetrical and where they should be

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.050 
symmetrical and where they should be
what<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.900> go<00:01:25.229> over<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.490> spots<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.939> I

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
what I do is I go over the spots that I

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.420 
what I do is I go over the spots that I
want<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.450> recessed<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.710> thin<00:01:28.950> strips<00:01:29.280> of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
want to be recessed with thin strips of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.600 
want to be recessed with thin strips of
cardboard<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.780> flew<00:01:31.020> them<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.320> using<00:01:32.009> hot

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
cardboard and I flew them on using hot

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.120 
cardboard and I flew them on using hot
glue<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:34.079> happens<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.619> after<00:01:34.860> i'm

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
glue so that what happens is after i'm

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.580 
glue so that what happens is after i'm
done<00:01:35.369> glassing<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.970> helmet<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.930> fondo<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
done glassing the helmet and I fondo the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.950 
done glassing the helmet and I fondo the
surface<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.340> I'm<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> bondo<00:01:39.630> around

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
surface of it I'm going to bondo around

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.069 
surface of it I'm going to bondo around
the<00:01:40.170> outside<00:01:40.650> portions<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> helmet<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
the outside portions of the helmet and

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.410 
the outside portions of the helmet and
then<00:01:43.079> when<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.979> bondo<00:01:44.369> sets<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.090> stand

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
then when it's the bondo sets up I stand

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.080 
then when it's the bondo sets up I stand
it<00:01:45.540> down<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> little<00:01:45.930> bit<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.320> then<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.560> peel

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
it down a little bit and then you peel

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.060 
it down a little bit and then you peel
the<00:01:48.090> cardboard<00:01:48.630> strips<00:01:48.990> off<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.890> leaves

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the cardboard strips off and it leaves

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.819 
the cardboard strips off and it leaves
the<00:01:50.460> seams<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.299> between<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.439> different

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the seams in between the different

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.670 
the seams in between the different
plates<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:54.060> surface<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> helmet<00:01:55.049> so

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
plates the surface of the helmet so

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.100 
plates the surface of the helmet so
that's<00:01:56.579> how<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> do<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.210> I'm<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> go

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that's how I do that I'm going to go

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.899 
that's how I do that I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.619> fiberglass<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.399> inside<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> this
