overhead shot of the map here before we
get<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.779> footage<00:00:07.049> if<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.440> look<00:00:07.560> at<00:00:07.680> the

get to the footage if you look at the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.930 
get to the footage if you look at the
closely<00:00:08.189> at<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.370> right<00:00:08.519> side<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.790> map

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940

closely at the right side of the map
you'll<00:00:09.120> see<00:00:09.150> an<00:00:09.300> a-10<00:00:09.630> outline<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.170> US

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
you'll see an a-10 outline of the US

based<00:00:10.679> based<00:00:11.340> on<00:00:11.490> calculations<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:12.059> wingspan

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
based based on calculations a wingspan

based based on calculations a wingspan
we<00:00:12.630> can<00:00:12.750> see<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.049> map<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.440> roughly<00:00:13.799> 1.7<00:00:14.309> 3

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
we can see the map is roughly 1.7 3

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.670 
we can see the map is roughly 1.7 3
kilometers<00:00:15.150> by<00:00:15.389> one<00:00:15.690> point<00:00:15.870> 13<00:00:16.199> kilometers

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
kilometers by one point 13 kilometers

kilometers by one point 13 kilometers
the<00:00:17.220> play<00:00:17.369> will<00:00:17.490> help<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.760> little<00:00:17.820> bit<00:00:17.970> smaller

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the play will help a little bit smaller

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.540 
the play will help a little bit smaller
than<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.420> obviously<00:00:18.930> but<00:00:19.310> enough<00:00:20.310> math

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
than that obviously but enough math

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.000 
than that obviously but enough math
let's<00:00:20.789> get<00:00:20.939> into<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.240> analysis<00:00:21.869> here<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.920> I'll

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
let's get into the analysis here so I'll

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.320 
let's get into the analysis here so I'll
be<00:00:23.130> honest<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.490> was<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> little<00:00:23.730> more<00:00:23.939> excited

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
javelin is in the top right corner we

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 
javelin is in the top right corner we
saw<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:06.479> will<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.720> making<00:01:06.900> an

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
saw that that will be making an

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.620 
saw that that will be making an
appearance<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.470> anti-tank<00:01:07.920> weapon<00:01:08.220> yeah<00:01:08.939> 64

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.200 
appearance it's anti-tank weapon yeah 64
player<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.110> pc<00:01:10.470> 24<00:01:11.369> player<00:01:11.580> than<00:01:11.760> console

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
player on the pc 24 player than console

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.149 
player on the pc 24 player than console
so<00:01:12.510> kind<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.350> disappointing<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.799> console

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
so kind of disappointing for the console

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.260 
so kind of disappointing for the console
side<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.460> they<00:01:14.520> said<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> maps<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.060> gonna<00:01:15.180> be

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
side and they said the maps are gonna be

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.640 
side and they said the maps are gonna be
a<00:01:15.299> little<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:15.509> slim<00:01:15.869> down<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.110> guess<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
a little bit slim down I guess for the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.520 
a little bit slim down I guess for the
console<00:01:17.040> people<00:01:17.670> which<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.330> no<00:01:18.540> big<00:01:18.659> deal<00:01:18.840> all

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
console people which is no big deal all

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.410 
console people which is no big deal all
right<00:01:19.710> here<00:01:19.860> we'll<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.220> knifing<00:01:21.000> animation

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
right here we'll see knifing animation

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.370 
using so that leads me to believe that
there's<00:02:38.040> multiple<00:02:38.840> selections<00:02:39.840> for<00:02:39.960> weapons

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
there's multiple selections for weapons

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.740 
there's multiple selections for weapons
you<00:02:41.010> can<00:02:41.160> cycle<00:02:41.520> through<00:02:41.700> like<00:02:42.030> missiles<00:02:42.390> guns

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
you can cycle through like missiles guns

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.650 
you can cycle through like missiles guns
and<00:02:42.870> stuff<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.250> also<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.550> see<00:02:44.760> em<00:02:45.030> 206

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
and stuff like that also you see em 206

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.890 
and stuff like that also you see em 206
ready<00:02:45.960> which<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.740> M<00:02:47.100> 206<00:02:47.640> is<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.900> flare

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
ready which is M 206 is a flare

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.380 
ready which is M 206 is a flare
basically<00:02:49.770> like<00:02:49.920> countermeasure<00:02:50.640> systems<00:02:50.910> so

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
basically like countermeasure systems so

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.060 
basically like countermeasure systems so
that<00:02:51.420> will<00:02:51.840> deploy<00:02:52.110> flares<00:02:52.410> like<00:02:52.770> infrared

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
that will deploy flares like infrared

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.510 
that will deploy flares like infrared
flares<00:02:53.400> which<00:02:53.640> we'll<00:02:53.790> see<00:02:53.820> later<00:02:53.940> on<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.510> also

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
flares which we'll see later on and also

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.710 
flares which we'll see later on and also
I'm<00:02:56.520> cooking<00:02:56.820> go<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.060> head<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.270> here<00:02:57.420> with<00:02:57.540> gun

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
I'm cooking go and head on here with gun

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.970 
I'm cooking go and head on here with gun
on<00:02:57.840> Gandhi<00:02:58.110> don't<00:02:58.230> really<00:02:58.410> see<00:02:58.590> any<00:02:58.680> missile

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
on Gandhi don't really see any missile

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.710 
on Gandhi don't really see any missile
to<00:02:59.040> missile<00:02:59.100> action<00:02:59.640> so<00:02:59.850> you'll<00:03:00.420> see<00:03:00.600> right

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
to missile action so you'll see right

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.820 
to missile action so you'll see right
here<00:03:00.870> as<00:03:01.020> he's<00:03:01.170> aiming<00:03:01.290> down<00:03:01.500> there<00:03:01.680> with<00:03:01.800> that

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
here as he's aiming down there with that

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.560 
here as he's aiming down there with that
he's<00:03:02.070> got<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.190> laser<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.670> gun<00:03:02.850> for<00:03:03.000> one<00:03:03.210> so<00:03:03.540> I

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
he's got a laser on a gun for one so I

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.880 
he's got a laser on a gun for one so I
mean<00:03:03.810> there's<00:03:04.170> like<00:03:04.200> attachments<00:03:04.710> if<00:03:04.830> you

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
mean there's like attachments if you

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
mean there's like attachments if you
look<00:03:05.010> real<00:03:05.160> close<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.520> can<00:03:05.550> see<00:03:05.670> like<00:03:05.850> a

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
look real close so you can see like a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.180 
look real close so you can see like a
bright<00:03:06.180> light<00:03:06.390> down<00:03:06.570> there<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.990> think<00:03:07.860> that's<00:03:07.980> a

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
bright light down there I think that's a

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.300 
bright light down there I think that's a
sniper<00:03:08.490> scope<00:03:09.080> reflecting<00:03:10.080> maybe<00:03:10.290> if<00:03:11.160> it's

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
sniper scope reflecting maybe if it's

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.890 
sniper scope reflecting maybe if it's
like<00:03:11.460> a<00:03:11.490> balance<00:03:11.910> thing<00:03:12.120> or<00:03:12.330> maybe<00:03:12.360> it's<00:03:12.750> like

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
like a balance thing or maybe it's like

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.050 
like a balance thing or maybe it's like
a<00:03:12.960> flashlight<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.530> have<00:03:13.710> no<00:03:13.860> idea<00:03:13.980> well<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.030> is

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
a flashlight I have no idea well this is

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.460 
a flashlight I have no idea well this is
slowed<00:03:15.360> down<00:03:15.510> something<00:03:15.750> it's<00:03:15.960> like<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.080> glint

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
slowed down something it's like a glint

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.870 
slowed down something it's like a glint
but<00:03:17.240> here's<00:03:18.240> a<00:03:18.980> havoc<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.070> looks<00:03:20.250> like<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.730> my

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
but here's a havoc it looks like that my

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.570 
but here's a havoc it looks like that my
28th<00:03:21.270> havoc<00:03:21.680> seeing<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.740> kill<00:03:22.920> fitta<00:03:23.130> pops<00:03:23.370> up

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
28th havoc seeing the kill fitta pops up

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.770 
28th havoc seeing the kill fitta pops up
you<00:03:23.610> just<00:03:23.820> got<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:23.970> couple<00:03:24.150> kills<00:03:24.480> with<00:03:24.600> that

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780

a being the gas station so looks like

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.280 
a being the gas station so looks like
this<00:03:29.730> would<00:03:29.910> be<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.030> heavy<00:03:30.210> choke<00:03:30.540> point<00:03:30.810> or<00:03:31.230> a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
this would be a heavy choke point or a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.950 
this would be a heavy choke point or a
lot<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.530> action<00:03:31.890> will<00:03:32.670> cut<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.330> havoc<00:03:33.810> here

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
lot of action will cut to the havoc here

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
about to get lit up by the havoc see the

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.570 
about to get lit up by the havoc see the
ground<00:03:37.530> shaking<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.070> tearing<00:03:38.340> out<00:03:38.430> that's

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
ground shaking and tearing out that's

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.040 
ground shaking and tearing out that's
pretty<00:03:38.760> awesome<00:03:38.820> here<00:03:39.690> looks<00:03:39.870> like<00:03:39.960> an

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
pretty awesome here looks like an

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.810 
pretty awesome here looks like an
infrared<00:03:40.320> Gunners<00:03:40.740> seat<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:41.460> can<00:03:41.580> see<00:03:41.700> the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
infrared Gunners seat you can see the

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.340 
infrared Gunners seat you can see the
box<00:03:42.030> like<00:03:42.300> a<00:03:42.330> rectangle<00:03:42.570> in<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.930> middle<00:03:43.170> on

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
box like a rectangle in the middle on

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.720 
box like a rectangle in the middle on
the<00:03:43.620> bottom<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.040> screen<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.280> looks<00:03:44.430> like<00:03:44.700> a

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
the bottom of the screen it looks like a

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.430 
the bottom of the screen it looks like a
kind<00:03:45.090> of<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.210> reference<00:03:45.360> view<00:03:45.930> for<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.230> pilot

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
kind of a reference view for the pilot

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.720 
kind of a reference view for the pilot
to<00:03:46.590> see<00:03:46.770> which<00:03:46.890> way<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.130> Gunners<00:03:47.430> looking

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
to see which way the Gunners looking

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.240 
to see which way the Gunners looking
that's<00:03:47.910> my<00:03:48.210> guess<00:03:48.270> what<00:03:48.660> that<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:49.070> and<00:03:50.070> looks

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
that's my guess what that is and looks

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.400 
that's my guess what that is and looks
like<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.460> Havoc's<00:03:50.820> weapon<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.870> also<00:03:52.140> fully

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
like the Havoc's weapon is also fully

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.170 
like the Havoc's weapon is also fully
automatic<00:03:52.830> back<00:03:53.370> in<00:03:53.490> the<00:03:53.580> jet<00:03:53.760> now<00:03:53.940> if<00:03:54.090> you

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
automatic back in the jet now if you

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.270 
automatic back in the jet now if you
notice<00:03:54.360> it<00:03:54.840> says<00:03:55.110> heat<00:03:55.410> seek<00:03:55.680> on<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:55.890> bottom

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
notice it says heat seek on the bottom

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.240 
notice it says heat seek on the bottom
of<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.670> heads<00:03:57.360> up<00:03:57.480> display<00:03:57.950> shoots<00:03:58.950> two

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
missiles so he's shooting to the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.390 
missiles so he's shooting to the
heat-seeking<00:04:00.750> missiles<00:04:01.140> we<00:04:01.200> see<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:01.620> on<00:04:02.190> the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
heat-seeking missiles we see that on the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
missiles now we only had two we don't

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.470 
missiles now we only had two we don't
know<00:04:05.310> if<00:04:05.430> that's<00:04:05.580> too<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:05.910> begin<00:04:06.150> with<00:04:06.330> if

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
know if that's too to begin with if

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.580 
know if that's too to begin with if
that's<00:04:06.750> what<00:04:06.840> he<00:04:06.900> had<00:04:07.050> at<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.200> present<00:04:07.560> time

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
that's what he had at the present time

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.800 
that's what he had at the present time
so<00:04:08.370> now<00:04:08.850> on<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.030> bottom<00:04:09.270> left<00:04:09.420> here<00:04:09.570> screen

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
so now on the bottom left here screen

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.090 
so now on the bottom left here screen
looks<00:04:10.020> like<00:04:10.080> there's<00:04:10.410> a<00:04:10.680> mobile

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
looks like there's a mobile

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.740 
looks like there's a mobile

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
anti-aircraft vehicle fire on the plane

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.050 
anti-aircraft vehicle fire on the plane

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
the hook overhead so back in the Jets we

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.940 
the hook overhead so back in the Jets we
see<00:04:15.300> more<00:04:15.480> just<00:04:15.900> gone<00:04:16.170> on<00:04:16.200> gun<00:04:16.500> gameplay<00:04:16.739> I

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
see more just gone on gun gameplay I

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.229 
see more just gone on gun gameplay I
don't<00:04:17.190> see<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.400> lot<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.580> planes<00:04:17.910> shooting

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
don't see a lot of planes shooting

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.430 
don't see a lot of planes shooting
missiles<00:04:18.510> with<00:04:18.630> each<00:04:18.750> other<00:04:18.900> which<00:04:19.080> is<00:04:19.109> kind

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
missiles with each other which is kind

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.740 
missiles with each other which is kind
of<00:04:19.500> interesting

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
of interesting

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.210 
of interesting
it<00:04:20.870> sounded<00:04:21.079> really<00:04:21.230> a<00:04:21.320> big<00:04:21.590> problem<00:04:22.010> for<00:04:22.130> me

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
it sounded really a big problem for me

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.370 
it sounded really a big problem for me
I'd<00:04:22.310> rather<00:04:22.340> be<00:04:22.790> like<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.300> know<00:04:23.480> 1943<00:04:24.200> where

I'd rather be like you know 1943 where

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.050 
I'd rather be like you know 1943 where
you<00:04:24.470> can<00:04:24.590> shoot<00:04:24.890> on<00:04:25.040> children<00:04:25.370> looks<00:04:25.820> like<00:04:25.940> you

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
you can shoot on children looks like you

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.490 
you can shoot on children looks like you
can<00:04:26.210> look<00:04:26.360> around<00:04:26.480> outside<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.320> look<00:04:27.410> around

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
can look around outside and look around

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.960 
can look around outside and look around
the<00:04:27.680> cockpit<00:04:27.980> which<00:04:28.100> is<00:04:28.220> kind<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:28.400> cool<00:04:28.580> and

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
the cockpit which is kind of cool and

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.850 
the cockpit which is kind of cool and
you<00:04:29.450> saw<00:04:29.600> some<00:04:29.780> flares<00:04:30.080> being<00:04:30.350> deployed<00:04:30.620> there

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
you saw some flares being deployed there

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.890 
you saw some flares being deployed there
and<00:04:30.980> then<00:04:31.070> also<00:04:31.220> you<00:04:31.370> see<00:04:31.700> pretty<00:04:32.660> heavy

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
and then also you see pretty heavy

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.090 
and then also you see pretty heavy
gunfire<00:04:33.230> come<00:04:33.650> from<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.860> ground

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
gunfire come from the ground

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.790 
gunfire come from the ground
anti-aircraft<00:04:34.580> fire<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.380> this<00:04:36.380> guy's<00:04:36.560> going

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
anti-aircraft fire and this guy's going

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.740 
anti-aircraft fire and this guy's going
fully<00:04:37.040> inverted<00:04:37.700> with<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.000> role<00:04:38.180> so<00:04:38.420> a<00:04:38.600> lot<00:04:38.720> of

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
fully inverted with the role so a lot of

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.970 
fully inverted with the role so a lot of
people<00:04:38.900> were<00:04:39.020> saying<00:04:39.200> the<00:04:39.320> Jets<00:04:39.500> look<00:04:39.680> super

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
people were saying the Jets look super

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.800 
people were saying the Jets look super
slow<00:04:40.250> but<00:04:40.790> I<00:04:41.000> mean<00:04:41.150> if<00:04:41.240> you<00:04:41.330> think<00:04:41.360> about<00:04:41.510> the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
slow but I mean if you think about the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.690 
slow but I mean if you think about the
mouse<00:04:41.930> for<00:04:42.140> that<00:04:42.230> small<00:04:42.530> a<00:04:42.800> jet<00:04:43.220> in<00:04:43.370> real<00:04:43.520> life

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
mouse for that small a jet in real life

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.550 
mouse for that small a jet in real life
like<00:04:44.030> those<00:04:44.240> flankers<00:04:44.810> can<00:04:45.020> hit<00:04:45.170> mock<00:04:45.350> too

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
like those flankers can hit mock too

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.620 
like those flankers can hit mock too
easily<00:04:45.950> they<00:04:46.640> would<00:04:46.760> cause<00:04:46.940> that<00:04:46.970> map<00:04:47.300> in<00:04:47.450> like

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
easily they would cause that map in like

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.810 
easily they would cause that map in like
blink<00:04:48.110> of<00:04:48.200> an<00:04:48.260> eye<00:04:48.350> looks<00:04:49.070> like<00:04:49.190> a<00:04:49.220> mounted<00:04:49.670> tow

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
blink of an eye looks like a mounted tow

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.700 
blink of an eye looks like a mounted tow
missile<00:04:50.180> here<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.510> guys<00:04:50.660> aiming<00:04:51.320> at<00:04:51.410> the<00:04:51.500> tank

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
missile here the guys aiming at the tank

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.140 
missile here the guys aiming at the tank
to<00:04:51.890> shoot<00:04:52.070> him<00:04:52.190> so<00:04:52.400> I<00:04:52.430> mean<00:04:52.730> that's<00:04:52.820> nothing

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
to shoot him so I mean that's nothing

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.159 
to shoot him so I mean that's nothing
new<00:04:53.180> but<00:04:53.600> just<00:04:53.990> kind<00:04:54.440> of<00:04:54.470> confirmed<00:04:56.080> but<00:04:57.080> yeah

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
new but just kind of confirmed but yeah

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.050 
new but just kind of confirmed but yeah
like<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.470> said<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:57.950> mean<00:04:58.190> we've<00:04:58.700> got<00:04:58.850> a<00:04:58.880> wide

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
like I said I mean we've got a wide

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.400 
like I said I mean we've got a wide
variety<00:04:59.240> of<00:04:59.419> vehicles<00:04:59.600> didn't<00:04:59.990> get<00:05:00.080> out<00:05:00.230> to<00:05:00.320> be

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
variety of vehicles didn't get out to be

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.750 
variety of vehicles didn't get out to be
a<00:05:00.440> lot<00:05:00.530> of<00:05:00.560> fun<00:05:00.680> I<00:05:00.830> just<00:05:01.070> hope<00:05:01.190> people<00:05:01.400> don't

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
a lot of fun I just hope people don't

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.670 
a lot of fun I just hope people don't
sit<00:05:02.120> around<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.419> airport<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.200> camp<00:05:03.380> from<00:05:03.560> all

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
sit around the airport and camp from all

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.200 
sit around the airport and camp from all
the<00:05:03.770> time<00:05:03.890> to<00:05:03.980> be<00:05:04.070> kind<00:05:04.220> of<00:05:04.250> boring<00:05:04.400> here's

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
the time to be kind of boring here's

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.580 
the time to be kind of boring here's
another<00:05:05.270> quick<00:05:05.630> thing<00:05:05.900> look<00:05:06.350> in<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:06.470> bottom

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
another quick thing look in the bottom

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.840 
another quick thing look in the bottom
right<00:05:06.800> of<00:05:06.830> your<00:05:06.890> screen<00:05:06.980> that<00:05:07.370> guy<00:05:07.460> is<00:05:07.520> a<00:05:07.640> gas

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
right of your screen that guy is a gas

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.490 
right of your screen that guy is a gas
mask<00:05:08.090> on<00:05:08.390> I<00:05:08.660> thought<00:05:09.020> that<00:05:09.080> was<00:05:09.230> kind<00:05:09.470> of

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
mask on I thought that was kind of

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.740 
mask on I thought that was kind of
interesting<00:05:09.790> maybe<00:05:10.790> there's<00:05:11.000> customizable

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
interesting maybe there's customizable

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.090 
interesting maybe there's customizable
like<00:05:12.020> gas<00:05:12.230> masks<00:05:12.680> or<00:05:12.770> something<00:05:12.980> like<00:05:13.040> that

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
like gas masks or something like that

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.650 
like gas masks or something like that
who<00:05:14.060> knows<00:05:15.460> also<00:05:16.460> if<00:05:16.610> you<00:05:16.669> look<00:05:16.700> closely<00:05:17.090> off

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
who knows also if you look closely off

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.210 
who knows also if you look closely off
the<00:05:17.900> right<00:05:18.020> side<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.290> screen<00:05:18.530> a<00:05:18.560> second<00:05:19.130> here

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
the right side the screen a second here

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.970 
the right side the screen a second here
you'll<00:05:19.370> see<00:05:19.660> there's<00:05:20.660> a<00:05:20.750> parachute<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.590> also

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
you'll see there's a parachute and also

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.890 
you'll see there's a parachute and also
in<00:05:22.130> a<00:05:22.190> couple<00:05:22.460> seconds<00:05:22.730> we'll<00:05:22.850> see<00:05:23.060> a<00:05:23.419> red<00:05:23.780> and

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
in a couple seconds we'll see a red and

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.180 
in a couple seconds we'll see a red and
gluttonous<00:05:24.230> screen<00:05:24.500> that's<00:05:24.710> actually<00:05:25.100> the

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
gluttonous screen that's actually the

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.250
