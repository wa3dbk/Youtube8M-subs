 basic recipe to start us 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.809
 let's open our molds so 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.030
 it's very simple we will place them 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.940
 in a saucepan with their fat and 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.840
 make them come back on high heat while 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.629
 our mussels are opening up 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.129
 we are going to cut out our onions so 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.739
 we first cut it in half and 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.730
 we will come after the hands so it's 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.290
 make the nice little piece as soon as the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.339
 mussels are all open then to little 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.560
 close after three minutes we go 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.530
 to be able to get out of the fire we will leave them 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.610
 aside and we will continue the recipe 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.040
 in a hot pan do 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.909
 come back from the olive oil and we're going 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.140
 to be able to add our onions kilos 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.869
 onions starts to take a nice 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.560
 coloring will be able to lower the fire and 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.119
 add our four chicken legs 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.820
 we will be able to cut our squids so 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.130
 very simple we will come to make small 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.900
 circles so about the same 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.360
 size that the onions we cut 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.770
 just a moment ago squid 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.280
 cut out we will also be able to 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.840
 add to our chickens we will leave 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.840
 marinate ten minutes 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.190
 we will be able to complete our 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.480
 preparation with the tablespoon of 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.700
 tomato concentrate thyme laurel 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.080
 and to finish a little bit of 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.240
 saffron to give color 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.320
 we will let the preparation come back 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.580
 for a few minutes 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.500
 and during that time we will enjoy it 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.710
 to filter the water of the mussels that we are going 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.940
 then added to our preparation 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.660
 we take the opportunity to cut our hearts 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.120
 artichokes in four so we add 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.820
 our artichoke hearts and our little ones 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.930
 frozen peas in the preparation and 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.160
 now we are going to cook 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.210
 almost ten minutes 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.210
 and during that time we will be able to 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.250
 quietly take care of the rice in a 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.660
 rock or ideally in a large pan 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.460
 with straws there you go to put 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.910
 olive oil at the bottom and we will be able 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.580
 to return our rice for not alas 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.250
 houziaux risotto at the bottom until 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.210
 it becomes translucent 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.460
 as soon as the rice starts to become 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.050
 translucent recover the broth that has 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.730
 served to cook all the others 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.590
 ingredients and we will finish the added 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.030
 gradually to our rice continue to 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.250
 add boiling water to your rice 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.150
 until they are cooked 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.540
 exactly on the same principle as 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.540
 risotto 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.180
 as soon as our risotto and we go 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.280
 simply be able to add all our 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.800
 ingredients with lorie so our 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.890
 shrimp unhusked 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.330
 we will be able to mix we will also 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.330
 ability to add mussels 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.200
 so here at the level of the molds you 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.030
 do not have to put the whole 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.370
 me what I recommend is to 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.190
 keep a side by side and put in 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.200
 about half in your dish on 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.360
 then add our chicken legs 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.610
 with the vegetables and let's cook 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.670
 one last time on high heat so that 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.560
 all the flavors can mix 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.350
 before finishing cut some 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.570
 pieces of parsley we take advantage 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.390
 also to cut our garlic cloves 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.420
 we can add at the same time 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.700
 that the parsley remains only 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.950
 add garlic and parsley to your pay 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.500
 there we mix for one last time and 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.239
