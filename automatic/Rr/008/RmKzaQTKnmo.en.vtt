00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.720
 we do not make this table every 7 inches the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.700
 which has a problem because it is argon 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.879
 roof because it does not load 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.620
 and they have already taken it to other cars 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.840
 technicians 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.730
 they tried to solder the pin but what 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.160
 they did was damage the floors 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.189
 originals and what we are going to do now 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.920
 then this is applicable to all 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.689
 You know what we're going to do is we 're going 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.280
 to load directly because the 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:36.220
 original system has already deteriorated and already and 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.739
 no longer has the route nor does the 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.239
 adequate voltage here at the end of the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.430
 what we are going to do is that 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.190
 we are going to load this tablet to 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.890
 not having that is uncovering and is 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.199
 receiving the battery so that we can 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.800
 turn on the first thing we have to 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.500
 to do is that we're going to 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.250
 by lifting the positive line of the pin 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.070
 of the charger that does not touch the time 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.620
 I entered the original route 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.570
 because if not then we would be 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.370
 stealing from voltage nador and not us 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.420
 the proper voltage would come 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.450
 to the battery connector 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.250
 at the end of the positive bacteria only 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.049
 we do this how much tax the pin 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.439
 negative there is no fool 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.270
 abnormal the earth and the positive pin not 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.330
 they have to enter has to be in 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.420
 the air and can not touch its track 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.400
 original where I live weld because if not 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.890
 then it steals the voltage 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.660
 we put a cable always euro success like 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.909
 in essence that I put 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.940
 thin so as not to 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.900
 it will not be any 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.550
 no bulk something but an attention of the 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.210
 voltage bursts it 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.470
 very to follow and here we see that the other 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.880
 pizza we bring it high 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.210
 to the positive pizza from the battery and so 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.650
 we would get the right voltage 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.900
 remember that to load these tablets 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.700
 many times the shippers of the 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.000
 phones will not load it into your 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.820
 total since they change amperage a 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.600
 these people's battery of an opera 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.680
 high 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.310
 this for example is two thousand 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.830
 three hundred and fifty milliamps 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.790
 amperage too high for what 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.400
 it's a battery a cell phone and jackie 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.230
 we would solve the problem any 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.910
 that it was charging by placing it 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.819
 directly they have to load us 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.760
 new and the only thing that would be is that nothing 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.819
 will not show us what is loading in 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.130
 the screen of our tablet but to the 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.200
 half an hour an hour let's see at two 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.690
 hours let's see how the tablet 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.330
 it's loaded because the bar is going to go up 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.330
