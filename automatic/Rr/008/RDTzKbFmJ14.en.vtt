00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.559
 and thousands of scientists have signed a 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.260
 letter against the threat of robots 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.820
 murderers warn of the serious 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.990
 dangers of artificial intelligence 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.990
 for military purposes 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.340
 and more than 1000 scientists and experts in 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.870
 technology have signed a letter a 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.270
 letter in which they warn about the danger 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.030
 to develop the so-called robots 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:47.010
 killers that is autonomous weapons 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.010
 programmed with artificial intelligence 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.200
 the manifesto signed by the astrophysicist 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.870
 british stephen hawking the entrepreneur 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.810
 and the most tesla president and the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.100
 cofounder of apple steve wozniak 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.960
 affirm that the military application of the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.060
 artificial intelligence to the race of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.060
 armaments is a bad idea 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.260
 the possible military applications of 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.090
 artificial intelligence have 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.340
 unleashed a great controversy in the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.290
 recent years and the debate has even 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.390
 come to united nations - that has 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.120
 dedicated meetings of experts to this 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.920
 subject and there has even been a 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.220
 international prohibition of this 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.220
 technology 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.590
 now the signers of the new letter 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.119
 have asked to be banned 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.590
 specifically the use of 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.970
 artificial intelligence for 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.579
 development of weapons that could 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.149
 work without doubt beyond the 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.149
 human control 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.540
 important to note that if this 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.860
 technology is not regulated properly in 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.380
 Regarding your possible 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.670
 military applications could put in 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.670
 risk the future of humanity 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.990
 Low production costs in few 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.880
 years will make these machines be 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.880
 easy to find on the black market 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.020
 already said steven hawking this can 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.730
 be the greatest invention of man but 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.730
 also the last 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.349
 If you liked the video do not forget to give it 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.840
 like subscribe to the channel if so 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.430
 you want to join my facebook page in 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.450
 screen and in description you can 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.870
 find this is the world's head 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.870
 Goodnight
