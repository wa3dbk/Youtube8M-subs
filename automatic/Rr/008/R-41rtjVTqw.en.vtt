00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.440 

okay<00:00:04.240> so<00:00:04.300> this<00:00:05.200> is<00:00:05.350> the<00:00:05.470> final<00:00:05.890> video<00:00:05.979> on<00:00:06.450> how

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
okay so this is the final video on how

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.810 
okay so this is the final video on how
to<00:00:07.479> solve<00:00:07.779> a<00:00:08.050> Rubik's<00:00:09.009> Cube<00:00:09.309> and<00:00:09.400> the<00:00:09.519> Rubik's

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
to solve a Rubik's Cube and the Rubik's

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.350 
to solve a Rubik's Cube and the Rubik's
Cube<00:00:09.969> she<00:00:10.150> is<00:00:10.379> like<00:00:11.379> how<00:00:11.589> to<00:00:11.650> solve<00:00:11.919> for<00:00:12.070> me<00:00:12.360> and

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
Cube she is like how to solve for me and

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.600 
Cube she is like how to solve for me and
we'll<00:00:14.169> be<00:00:14.320> positioning<00:00:14.919> the<00:00:15.039> corners<00:00:15.400> and

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
we'll be positioning the corners and

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.100 
we'll be positioning the corners and
then<00:00:15.879> solving<00:00:16.720> the<00:00:16.900> cube<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:18.930> first<00:00:19.930> thing<00:00:20.080> you

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
then solving the cube so first thing you

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.800 
then solving the cube so first thing you
need<00:00:20.260> to<00:00:20.320> do<00:00:20.530> is<00:00:21.220> to<00:00:21.430> look<00:00:21.580> for<00:00:21.850> any<00:00:22.060> corner<00:00:22.630> in

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
need to do is to look for any corner in

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.530 
need to do is to look for any corner in
the<00:00:22.900> right<00:00:23.080> spot<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:24.580> isn't<00:00:25.000> this<00:00:25.300> isn't

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
the right spot this isn't this isn't

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.820 
the right spot this isn't this isn't
this<00:00:25.870> isn't<00:00:26.110> whoa<00:00:26.800> this<00:00:27.190> is<00:00:28.080> because<00:00:29.080> all<00:00:29.770> the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
this isn't whoa this is because all the

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.680 
this isn't whoa this is because all the
colors<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.700> colors<00:00:31.000> are<00:00:31.180> in<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:31.510> right<00:00:31.660> spot

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.690 
colors the colors are in the right spot

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.290 
colors the colors are in the right spot
with<00:00:32.110> their<00:00:32.200> centers<00:00:32.590> and<00:00:32.920> this<00:00:33.670> one<00:00:33.910> this

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
with their centers and this one this

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.590 
with their centers and this one this
said<00:00:34.600> corner<00:00:35.230> is<00:00:35.290> actually<00:00:35.650> solved<00:00:36.600> which

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
said corner is actually solved which

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.550 
said corner is actually solved which
will<00:00:37.780> be<00:00:37.930> a<00:00:37.960> good<00:00:38.290> thing<00:00:38.500> for<00:00:38.650> us<00:00:38.970> so<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:41.320> you

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
will be a good thing for us so if you

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.970 
will be a good thing for us so if you
have<00:00:41.770> if<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.400> corner<00:00:42.670> is<00:00:42.790> in<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:42.970> right<00:00:43.090> spot

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
have if the corner is in the right spot

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.270 
have if the corner is in the right spot
what<00:00:44.980> you<00:00:45.130> do<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:46.660> if<00:00:47.649> the<00:00:47.770> corner<00:00:48.040> is<00:00:48.100> in<00:00:48.190> the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
what you do like if the corner is in the

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.150 
what you do like if the corner is in the
right<00:00:48.399> spot<00:00:48.579> you<00:00:49.090> put<00:00:49.630> it<00:00:49.750> in<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.500> top<00:00:50.770> right

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
right spot you put it in the top right

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.080 
right spot you put it in the top right
the<00:00:52.000> top<00:00:52.149> right<00:00:52.329> position<00:00:52.840> so<00:00:54.570> top<00:00:55.570> right<00:00:55.930> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the top right position so top right and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.360 
the top right position so top right and
if<00:00:58.090> there<00:00:58.300> is<00:00:58.390> no<00:00:58.630> corner<00:00:59.020> in<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.620> position<00:01:00.070> in

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
if there is no corner in the position in

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.930 
if there is no corner in the position in
the<00:01:00.579> right<00:01:00.670> position<00:01:01.180> then<00:01:01.930> just<00:01:02.860> do<00:01:03.489> this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
the right position then just do this

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.360 
the right position then just do this
algorithm<00:01:04.409> which<00:01:05.409> will<00:01:05.560> also<00:01:05.770> orient<00:01:06.280> the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
algorithm which will also orient the

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:13.200 
algorithm which will also orient the
corners<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:09.549> no<00:01:10.090> yeah<00:01:10.510> you<00:01:11.229> are<00:01:12.210> you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
corners you are no yeah you are you

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.859 
corners you are no yeah you are you
prime<00:01:13.479> L<00:01:14.170> prime<00:01:14.440> you<00:01:16.680> all<00:01:17.680> I<00:01:17.740> prime<00:01:18.070> u<00:01:19.030> prime<00:01:19.060> L

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
prime L prime you all I prime u prime L

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.590 
prime L prime you all I prime u prime L
and<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:20.710> will<00:01:21.010> move<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.940> corners<00:01:22.270> around

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
and that will move the corners around

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.840 
and that will move the corners around
except<00:01:23.500> for<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.680> one<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.340> front<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.700> you

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
except for the one in the front of you

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.210 
except for the one in the front of you
and<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.820> may<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:29.409> may<00:01:29.440> have<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:29.890> do<00:01:30.040> this

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
and you may you may have to do this

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.440 
and you may you may have to do this
algorithm<00:01:30.549> twice<00:01:31.680> okay<00:01:32.680> so<00:01:33.090> yeah<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.330> may

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
algorithm twice okay so yeah you may

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.929 
algorithm twice okay so yeah you may
have<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:34.659> do<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.780> twice<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.439> or<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.640> will<00:01:36.820> get

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
have to do it twice and or you will get

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.630 
have to do it twice and or you will get
lucky<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.330> do<00:01:37.450> it<00:01:37.570> once<00:01:37.810> or<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:39.460> might

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
lucky and do it once or you might

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.250 
lucky and do it once or you might
actually<00:01:39.790> be<00:01:40.180> really<00:01:40.510> lucky<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:40.990> all<00:01:41.140> the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
actually be really lucky and all the

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.980 
actually be really lucky and all the
corners<00:01:41.590> will<00:01:41.680> be<00:01:41.770> oriented<00:01:42.040> for<00:01:42.490> you<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:43.330> all

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
corners will be oriented for you and all

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.390 
corners will be oriented for you and all
you<00:01:44.080> have<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.260> do<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.590> just<00:01:44.770> put<00:01:45.130> them<00:01:45.220> in<00:01:45.280> the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
you have to do is just put them in the

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.050 
you have to do is just put them in the
right<00:01:45.490> spot<00:01:45.759> like<00:01:46.330> just<00:01:46.630> flip<00:01:46.960> them<00:01:47.080> so<00:01:48.060> in

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
right spot like just flip them so in

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.230 
right spot like just flip them so in
this<00:01:49.180> case<00:01:49.479> I<00:01:49.689> have<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.080> do<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.290> twice<00:01:50.530> so<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:52.180> do

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
this case I have to do it twice so I do

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.179 
this case I have to do it twice so I do
the<00:01:52.420> algorithm<00:01:52.750> again<00:01:53.640> wait<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:55.270> are<00:01:55.920> u<00:01:56.920> prime

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
the algorithm again wait you are u prime

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:03.179 
the algorithm again wait you are u prime
L<00:01:57.759> prime<00:01:58.030> u<00:01:58.630> r<00:01:59.170> prime<00:01:59.409> u<00:01:59.829> prime<00:01:59.860> L<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.840> then<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
L prime u r prime u prime L and then the

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.700 
L prime u r prime u prime L and then the
corners<00:02:03.549> are<00:02:03.700> in<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.850> right<00:02:04.000> spot<00:02:04.299> and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
corners are in the right spot and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.830 
corners are in the right spot and
luckily<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:06.009> have<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.460> salt<00:02:06.820> but<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.689> is<00:02:07.810> a

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
luckily I have to salt but that is a

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.120 
luckily I have to salt but that is a
very<00:02:08.470> rare<00:02:08.709> chance<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.599> now<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.860> actually

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
very rare chance so now to actually

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.920 
very rare chance so now to actually
solve<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.730> cube

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
solve the cube

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.190 
solve the cube
you<00:02:14.439> put<00:02:14.680> its<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.670> put<00:02:15.909> the<00:02:16.120> corner<00:02:16.599> that<00:02:17.079> is

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
you put its you put the corner that is

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.220 
you put its you put the corner that is
not<00:02:17.349> solved<00:02:17.739> so<00:02:17.920> these<00:02:18.159> and<00:02:18.459> these<00:02:18.579> so<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:20.049> put

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
not solved so these and these so you put

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.740 
not solved so these and these so you put
the<00:02:20.349> corner<00:02:20.620> facing<00:02:20.799> you<00:02:21.220> in<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:22.120> top<00:02:22.390> left

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
the corner facing you in the top left

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.339 
the corner facing you in the top left
position<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:26.260> do<00:02:26.409> the<00:02:26.560> algorithm<00:02:26.970> l<00:02:27.970> d<00:02:28.840> L

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
position and you do the algorithm l d L

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.500 
position and you do the algorithm l d L
prime<00:02:29.739> D<00:02:30.099> prime<00:02:30.599> u<00:02:31.599> you<00:02:32.530> may<00:02:32.709> have<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.220> do<00:02:33.370> this

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
prime D prime u you may have to do this

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.530 
prime D prime u you may have to do this
more<00:02:34.510> than<00:02:34.540> once<00:02:34.720> or<00:02:35.230> twice<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.930> once<00:02:39.540> -

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
more than once or twice so that once -

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.780 
more than once or twice so that once -
twice<00:02:42.269> thrice<00:02:43.269> or<00:02:43.569> three<00:02:43.780> times<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.409> then

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
twice thrice or three times and then

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.960 
twice thrice or three times and then
that<00:02:45.790> was<00:02:46.000> four<00:02:46.239> times<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.609> you<00:02:48.609> just<00:02:48.819> keep

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
that was four times so you just keep

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.240 
that was four times so you just keep
doing<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.239> until<00:02:49.329> you<00:02:49.569> get<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.810> solve<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:50.379> a

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
doing that until you get to solve and a

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.509 
doing that until you get to solve and a
very<00:02:51.909> important<00:02:52.359> thing<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:53.560> never<00:02:53.829> turn<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
very important thing you never turn the

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.440 
very important thing you never turn the
cube<00:02:54.790> or<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.659> will<00:02:55.900> screw<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.620> whole<00:02:56.799> cube<00:02:57.099> up

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
cube or you will screw the whole cube up

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.099 
cube or you will screw the whole cube up
you<00:02:58.450> do<00:02:58.659> you<00:02:59.319> turn<00:02:59.620> so<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.159> can<00:03:00.280> be<00:03:00.400> u<00:03:00.670> u<00:03:01.420> u<00:03:01.810> prime

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
you do you turn so it can be u u u prime

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.800 
you do you turn so it can be u u u prime
u<00:03:02.530> -<00:03:03.189> and<00:03:04.150> just<00:03:05.109> put<00:03:05.349> it<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:06.459> top<00:03:06.879> left

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
u - and just put it in the top left

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.910 
u - and just put it in the top left
position<00:03:08.489> then<00:03:09.489> do<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.180> algorithm<00:03:10.450> again<00:03:10.920> L

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
position then do the algorithm again L

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.240 
position then do the algorithm again L
deep<00:03:12.760> I'll<00:03:13.239> kinda<00:03:13.629> found<00:03:13.780> LG<00:03:14.230> L<00:03:14.439> prime<00:03:14.799> D<00:03:15.010> Prime

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
deep I'll kinda found LG L prime D Prime

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.409 
deep I'll kinda found LG L prime D Prime
and<00:03:15.549> then<00:03:16.450> within<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.959> next<00:03:16.989> few<00:03:17.379> moves

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
and then within the next few moves

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:24.330 
and then within the next few moves

maybe if you really liked it and just go
over<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:50.530> algorithms<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:51.370> eventually<00:03:51.879> you

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
over the algorithms and eventually you

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.939 
over the algorithms and eventually you
will<00:03:52.900> have<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:54.430> will<00:03:55.319> you<00:03:56.319> can<00:03:56.470> you'll<00:03:56.739> be

will have you will you can you'll be

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.390 
will have you will you can you'll be
able<00:03:57.069> to<00:03:57.250> solve<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.669> cube<00:03:57.879> right<00:03:58.150> off<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:58.510> bat

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
able to solve the cube right off the bat

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.550 
able to solve the cube right off the bat
in<00:04:00.400> a<00:04:00.549> matter<00:04:00.699> of<00:04:00.819> minutes<00:04:01.229> maybe<00:04:02.229> even

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
in a matter of minutes maybe even

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.369 
in a matter of minutes maybe even
seconds<00:04:03.599> and<00:04:04.599> you<00:04:04.840> can<00:04:04.870> impress<00:04:05.169> all<00:04:05.349> your

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
seconds and you can impress all your

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:11.129 
seconds and you can impress all your
friends<00:04:05.500> so<00:04:06.150> thanks<00:04:07.150> for<00:04:07.269> watching<00:04:07.329> and<00:04:08.129> bye
