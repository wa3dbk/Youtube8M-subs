interesting way to put him but yes it's

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.220 
interesting way to put him but yes it's
true<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.239> dream<00:03:44.390> events<00:03:44.780> would<00:03:44.900> basically

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
true the dream events would basically

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.370 
true the dream events would basically
take<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:46.100> core<00:03:46.730> idea<00:03:47.270> of<00:03:47.360> one<00:03:47.810> of<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.020> Olympic

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
take the core idea of one of the Olympic

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.260 
take the core idea of one of the Olympic
events<00:03:48.830> and<00:03:48.980> then<00:03:49.250> just<00:03:49.430> kind<00:03:49.670> of<00:03:49.730> twisted

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
events and then just kind of twisted

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.390 
events and then just kind of twisted
into<00:03:50.510> craziness<00:03:51.110> like<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.770> snowball<00:03:52.370> fight

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
into craziness like a snowball fight

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.400 
into craziness like a snowball fight
well<00:03:53.209> that's<00:03:53.360> way<00:03:53.510> that's<00:03:53.720> not<00:03:53.840> based<00:03:54.110> on<00:03:54.230> any

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
well that's way that's not based on any

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.220 
well that's way that's not based on any
big<00:03:54.980> event<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.430> can<00:03:55.610> think<00:03:55.820> of<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.180> great<00:03:56.510> example

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
big event I can think of a great example

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.470 
big event I can think of a great example
of<00:03:57.260> this<00:03:57.470> is<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:58.250> dream<00:03:58.730> event<00:03:58.940> where<00:03:59.300> you're

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.290 
of this is the dream event where you're
switching<00:03:59.810> with<00:04:00.620> vehicles<00:04:01.160> in<00:04:01.459> time<00:04:01.910> of<00:04:02.150> the

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
switching with vehicles in time of the

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.960 
switching with vehicles in time of the
race<00:04:02.510> where<00:04:03.320> there's<00:04:03.590> multiple<00:04:03.800> paths<00:04:04.310> where

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
race where there's multiple paths where

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.900 
race where there's multiple paths where
you<00:04:05.420> can<00:04:05.690> use<00:04:06.290> your<00:04:06.500> vehicles<00:04:07.040> like<00:04:07.700> ice

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
you can use your vehicles like ice

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.740 
you can use your vehicles like ice
skating<00:04:08.600> or<00:04:08.780> bobsled<00:04:09.530> or<00:04:10.120> snowboarding<00:04:11.120> or

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
even skis down the mountain to get first

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.080 
even skis down the mountain to get first
place<00:04:14.720> I<00:04:15.140> found<00:04:15.530> that<00:04:15.709> one<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.100> most<00:04:16.310> fun<00:04:16.609> yeah

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
place I found that one the most fun yeah

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.729 
place I found that one the most fun yeah
that<00:04:17.239> one<00:04:17.359> was<00:04:17.390> great<00:04:17.810> there<00:04:18.350> was<00:04:18.440> also<00:04:18.560> like<00:04:18.680> a

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
that one was great there was also like a

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.729 
that one was great there was also like a
game<00:04:19.040> show<00:04:19.070> mode<00:04:19.609> which<00:04:19.880> was<00:04:20.060> okay<00:04:21.049> I<00:04:21.380> thought

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
game show mode which was okay I thought

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.620 
game show mode which was okay I thought
where<00:04:22.370> they<00:04:22.520> would<00:04:22.669> give<00:04:22.820> you<00:04:22.940> a<00:04:22.970> goal<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.539> you

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
where they would give you a goal and you

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.550 
where they would give you a goal and you
had<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:23.870> do<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.080> before<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.440> other

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
had to do it before the other

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.500 
had to do it before the other
contestants<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.520> only<00:04:25.669> problem<00:04:26.060> I<00:04:26.150> found

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
contestants the only problem I found

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.270 
contestants the only problem I found
that<00:04:26.690> one<00:04:26.900> is<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.320> there's<00:04:27.890> a<00:04:27.950> lot<00:04:28.160> of

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
that one is that there's a lot of

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.890 
that one is that there's a lot of
accidents<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:28.940> can<00:04:29.090> happen<00:04:29.420> in<00:04:29.510> that<00:04:29.660> or

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
accidents that can happen in that or

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.530 
accidents that can happen in that or
just<00:04:29.930> confusion<00:04:30.830> in<00:04:30.980> general<00:04:31.550> because<00:04:32.120> they

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
just confusion in general because they

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.660 
just confusion in general because they
kind<00:04:32.810> of<00:04:32.930> either<00:04:33.110> don't<00:04:33.500> word<00:04:33.770> it<00:04:33.980> correct<00:04:34.370> or

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
kind of either don't word it correct or

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.030 
kind of either don't word it correct or
it's<00:04:35.570> just<00:04:35.780> poorly<00:04:36.170> done<00:04:36.350> right<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:36.890> would

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
it's just poorly done right I would

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.400 
it's just poorly done right I would
agree<00:04:37.250> but<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:37.670> like<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.060> idea<00:04:38.480> of<00:04:38.600> it<00:04:38.870> I<00:04:38.900> wish

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
agree but I like the idea of it I wish

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.770 
agree but I like the idea of it I wish
if<00:04:39.650> they<00:04:39.950> would<00:04:40.130> expand<00:04:40.550> upon<00:04:40.850> it<00:04:41.060> in<00:04:41.210> future

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
if they would expand upon it in future

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.840 
if they would expand upon it in future
versions<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:42.590> this<00:04:42.740> game<00:04:42.830> but<00:04:43.460> do<00:04:43.700> it<00:04:43.730> better

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.600 
make a playlist of your events yeah that
one<00:04:51.110> was<00:04:51.290> probably<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.830> one<00:04:52.100> that<00:04:52.370> I<00:04:52.400> would

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
one was probably the one that I would

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.580 
one was probably the one that I would
say<00:04:52.850> is<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.120> most<00:04:53.270> useful<00:04:53.540> there<00:04:54.260> is<00:04:54.410> some

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
say is the most useful there is some

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.230 
say is the most useful there is some
replayability<00:04:55.160> in<00:04:55.430> this<00:04:55.550> game<00:04:55.790> because<00:04:56.090> you

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
replayability in this game because you

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.300 
replayability in this game because you
can<00:04:56.390> get<00:04:56.570> stuff<00:04:56.870> for<00:04:57.050> your<00:04:57.200> Me's<00:04:57.410> to<00:04:57.950> increase

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
can get stuff for your Me's to increase

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.820 
can get stuff for your Me's to increase
your<00:04:58.520> stats<00:04:58.790> and<00:04:59.360> there's<00:04:59.600> a<00:04:59.690> lot<00:05:00.140> of<00:05:00.500> stuff

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
your stats and there's a lot of stuff

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.090 
your stats and there's a lot of stuff
you<00:05:00.860> can<00:05:01.100> unlock<00:05:01.670> lots<00:05:02.210> of<00:05:02.420> music<00:05:03.110> and<00:05:03.440> lots<00:05:03.950> of

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
you can unlock lots of music and lots of

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.080 
you can unlock lots of music and lots of
clothes<00:05:04.490> tons<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:05.780> tons<00:05:05.810> of<00:05:06.740> clothes<00:05:07.340> the

that<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.590> gamepad<00:05:13.190> just<00:05:13.550> decided<00:05:14.090> to<00:05:14.140> not

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
that the gamepad just decided to not

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.230 
that the gamepad just decided to not
even<00:05:15.320> be<00:05:15.440> used<00:05:15.860> at<00:05:16.040> all<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.460> started<00:05:16.790> a<00:05:16.880> TV

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
channel of its own that's basically it

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.250 
channel of its own that's basically it
the<00:05:19.580> gamepad<00:05:19.940> has<00:05:20.030> used<00:05:20.300> it<00:05:20.450> like<00:05:20.600> a<00:05:20.660> TV

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
the gamepad has used it like a TV

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.200 
the gamepad has used it like a TV
channel<00:05:21.500> that<00:05:21.770> you're<00:05:21.890> tuning<00:05:22.250> into<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.850> you

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
channel that you're tuning into and you

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.700 
channel that you're tuning into and you
can<00:05:23.240> use<00:05:23.480> it<00:05:23.510> to<00:05:23.690> switch<00:05:23.900> channels<00:05:24.350> to<00:05:24.500> see

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
can use it to switch channels to see

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.670 
can use it to switch channels to see
your<00:05:25.340> records<00:05:25.910> or<00:05:26.330> even<00:05:27.050> if<00:05:27.170> you<00:05:27.230> do<00:05:27.380> really

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
your records or even if you do really

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.740 
your records or even if you do really
well<00:05:27.800> in<00:05:28.100> an<00:05:28.220> event<00:05:28.580> they<00:05:28.940> might<00:05:29.180> interview

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
well in an event they might interview

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.600 
well in an event they might interview
you<00:05:29.900> for<00:05:30.080> the<00:05:30.170> TV<00:05:30.470> channel<00:05:30.890> I<00:05:31.130> thought<00:05:31.430> that

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
you for the TV channel I thought that

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.950 
you for the TV channel I thought that
was<00:05:31.730> clever<00:05:31.970> yeah<00:05:32.480> I<00:05:32.510> thought<00:05:32.750> that<00:05:32.810> was

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
was clever yeah I thought that was

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.840 
was clever yeah I thought that was
clever<00:05:33.200> -<00:05:33.530> it<00:05:33.890> didn't<00:05:34.190> happen<00:05:34.310> very<00:05:34.580> often

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
clever - it didn't happen very often

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.820 
clever - it didn't happen very often
because<00:05:35.240> we<00:05:35.450> were<00:05:35.990> not<00:05:36.200> very<00:05:36.440> good<00:05:36.500> at<00:05:36.740> the

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
because we were not very good at the

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.160 
because we were not very good at the
game<00:05:36.860> but<00:05:37.610> when<00:05:37.790> it<00:05:37.910> did<00:05:38.090> happen<00:05:38.120> it<00:05:38.810> was<00:05:38.930> cool

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
game but when it did happen it was cool

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.350 
game but when it did happen it was cool
they<00:05:39.500> took<00:05:39.650> your<00:05:39.830> picture<00:05:39.980> honestly<00:05:40.640> I<00:05:41.000> wish

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
they took your picture honestly I wish

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.780 
they took your picture honestly I wish
they<00:05:41.570> had<00:05:41.600> done<00:05:41.900> more<00:05:42.260> with<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.590> gamepad<00:05:43.010> now

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
they had done more with the gamepad now

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.780 
they had done more with the gamepad now
lastly<00:05:44.360> there<00:05:44.690> is<00:05:44.810> an<00:05:44.960> online<00:05:45.410> mode<00:05:45.650> well<00:05:46.280> at

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
lastly there is an online mode well at

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.060 
lastly there is an online mode well at
least<00:05:46.970> I<00:05:47.270> think<00:05:47.360> there<00:05:47.870> is<00:05:48.020> because<00:05:48.320> every

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
least I think there is because every

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.860 
least I think there is because every
time<00:05:49.250> I<00:05:49.280> went<00:05:49.520> to<00:05:49.640> test<00:05:49.940> it<00:05:50.180> nobody<00:05:50.690> was

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
time I went to test it nobody was

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.510 
time I went to test it nobody was
playing<00:05:51.050> I<00:05:51.530> mean<00:05:51.740> it's<00:05:51.980> the<00:05:52.130> middle<00:05:52.340> of<00:05:52.430> the

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
playing I mean it's the middle of the

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.850 
playing I mean it's the middle of the
Olympics<00:05:52.970> right<00:05:53.060> now<00:05:53.420> and<00:05:53.780> nobody<00:05:54.320> is<00:05:54.470> caring

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
Olympics right now and nobody is caring

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.980 
Olympics right now and nobody is caring
to<00:05:54.980> play<00:05:55.130> this<00:05:55.310> online<00:05:55.550> I<00:05:56.060> couldn't<00:05:56.480> test<00:05:56.750> it

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
to play this online I couldn't test it

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.440 
to play this online I couldn't test it
but<00:05:57.260> in<00:05:57.410> theory<00:05:57.860> it's<00:05:58.400> there<00:05:58.790> all<00:05:59.300> right

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
but in theory it's there all right

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.580 
but in theory it's there all right
little<00:05:59.630> leave<00:05:59.750> you<00:05:59.840> where<00:05:59.990> Mario<00:06:00.350> and<00:06:00.530> Sonic

play it for more than a day I agree with

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.790 
play it for more than a day I agree with
you<00:06:28.910> for<00:06:29.060> those<00:06:29.300> exact<00:06:29.690> reasons<00:06:30.260> as<00:06:30.410> well<00:06:30.560> if

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
you for those exact reasons as well if

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.130 
you for those exact reasons as well if
you<00:06:30.920> want<00:06:31.130> the<00:06:31.250> controller<00:06:31.700> yeah<00:06:32.420> I<00:06:32.870> guess

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
you want the controller yeah I guess

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.080 
you want the controller yeah I guess
it'd<00:06:33.380> be<00:06:33.410> worth<00:06:33.650> the<00:06:33.830> $10<00:06:34.520> if<00:06:34.760> you<00:06:34.850> really

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
it'd be worth the $10 if you really

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.880 
it'd be worth the $10 if you really
think<00:06:35.360> about<00:06:35.510> it<00:06:35.720> factor<00:06:36.350> in<00:06:36.470> the<00:06:36.590> fact<00:06:36.800> that

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
think about it factor in the fact that

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.370 
think about it factor in the fact that
controllers<00:06:37.520> $40<00:06:38.180> and<00:06:38.540> if<00:06:38.810> you<00:06:38.930> just<00:06:39.110> want<00:06:39.290> to

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
controllers $40 and if you just want to
