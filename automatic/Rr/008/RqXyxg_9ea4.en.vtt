 attention we can all consider ourselves happy 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.819
 nothing more serious has happened 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.519
 but children there are things that 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.930
 you should know what polite should not 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.250
 not play next to a truck of a 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.519
 car and especially do not go in 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.519
 below 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.290
 okay why because they have some 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.470
 blind spots simply what is this 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.879
 that it is there around cars of 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.459
 areas that drivers can not 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:18.100
 see them called blind spots 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.260
 the vehicles are big and the more the 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.180
 blind spots are important only if a 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.800
 child as you walk or swear then 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.910
 that he is in this blind spot 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.130
 driver can not see 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.300
 and what will happen if a truck goes 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.889
 to roll while you are in his 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:36.470
 dead angle you it's the accident 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:39.300

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.220

 balloon rolls under a truck yes 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.370
 what do you do in this case you have to 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.590
 ask the driver or an adult to 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.520
 help you if you want to recover the 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.270
 balloon alone 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.410
