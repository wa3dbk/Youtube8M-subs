polish<00:00:05.009> that<00:00:05.040> I<00:00:05.250> received<00:00:05.700> recently<00:00:06.049> it's

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
polish that I received recently it's

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.049 
polish that I received recently it's
cold<00:00:07.470> off<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.610> record<00:00:08.790> oh<00:00:10.280> the<00:00:11.280> record<00:00:11.610> upside

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
cold off the record oh the record upside

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.450 
cold off the record oh the record upside
down<00:00:12.300> which<00:00:13.139> ever<00:00:13.320> way<00:00:13.500> around<00:00:13.799> off<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
down which ever way around off the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.550 
down which ever way around off the
record<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.839> mid-round<00:00:18.560> hopefully

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
record and it's a mid-round hopefully

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.700 
record and it's a mid-round hopefully
the<00:00:19.800> camera<00:00:20.130> there<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.369> go<00:00:20.539> mid<00:00:21.539> brown<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.109> I

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
the camera there we go mid brown and I

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.740 
the camera there we go mid brown and I
think<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.609> from<00:00:23.789> their<00:00:23.970> new<00:00:24.119> connection

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
think this is from their new connection

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.210 
think this is from their new connection
which<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.550> sandstorm<00:00:26.550> collection<00:00:27.180> and

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
which is the sandstorm collection and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.099 
which is the sandstorm collection and
airing<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.490> my<00:00:29.789> nails<00:00:30.660> right<00:00:31.050> now

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
airing it on my nails right now

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.319 
airing it on my nails right now
obviously<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> blue<00:00:32.460> one<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> bone

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
obviously not the blue one but the bone

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.880 
obviously not the blue one but the bone
color<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.760> so<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.120> two<00:00:36.390> coats<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.079> this

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
color and so this is two coats and this

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.369 
color and so this is two coats and this
product<00:00:38.340> actually<00:00:38.489> needed<00:00:39.149> two<00:00:39.270> coats<00:00:39.379> it's

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
product actually needed two coats it's

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.060 
product actually needed two coats it's
because<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.890> quite<00:00:41.160> runny<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.649> quite<00:00:43.649> thin

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
because it's quite runny and quite thin

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.819 
because it's quite runny and quite thin
it<00:00:44.520> doesn't<00:00:45.000> give<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.289> sort<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.379> coverage

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
it doesn't give you the sort of coverage

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.430 
it doesn't give you the sort of coverage
that<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.219> want<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.850> your<00:00:47.910> first<00:00:48.750> coat<00:00:49.050> or<00:00:49.260> if

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
that you want in your first coat or if

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.850 
that you want in your first coat or if
you<00:00:49.620> were<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.980> apply<00:00:50.190> I'm<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.820> went<00:00:51.149> great<00:00:51.329> I

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
you were to apply I'm you went great I

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.810 
you were to apply I'm you went great I
think<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> biggest<00:00:53.070> issue<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.610> it

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
think the biggest issue is that it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.840 
think the biggest issue is that it
caught<00:00:54.059> dries<00:00:54.360> quite<00:00:54.780> quickly<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.920> even

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
caught dries quite quickly so even

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.240 
caught dries quite quickly so even
working<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.480> your<00:00:57.719> first<00:00:57.989> coat<00:00:58.800> because

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
working on your first coat because

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.900 
working on your first coat because
becomes<00:01:00.000> bit<00:01:00.300> difficult<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.550> any<00:01:02.550> kind<00:01:02.820> of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
becomes bit difficult and any kind of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.510 
becomes bit difficult and any kind of
becomes<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.480> bit<00:01:03.629> messy<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.960> lasts<00:01:07.500> okay<00:01:08.010> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
becomes a bit messy and it lasts okay it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.240 
becomes a bit messy and it lasts okay it
drives<00:01:08.880> quite<00:01:09.270> quickly<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.840> said<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.409> it

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
drives quite quickly as I said and it

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.570 
drives quite quickly as I said and it
only<00:01:11.460> comes<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.290> eight<00:01:13.290> milliliters<00:01:13.799> which<00:01:14.189> is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
only comes in eight milliliters which is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.530 
only comes in eight milliliters which is
point<00:01:14.880> 27<00:01:15.390> fluid<00:01:15.840> ounces<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.470> that's<00:01:17.540> almost

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
point 27 fluid ounces and that's almost

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.859 
point 27 fluid ounces and that's almost
only<00:01:18.840> half<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.619> size<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.159> most<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.869> nail

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
only half the size of most of the nail

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.719 
only half the size of most of the nail
polishes<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.680> get<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.159> most<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> new

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
polishes that you get so most of the new

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.499 
polishes that you get so most of the new
brushes<00:01:24.000> are<00:01:24.420> about<00:01:24.689> 50<00:01:25.049> milliliters<00:01:25.590> witches

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
brushes are about 50 milliliters witches

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.249 
brushes are about 50 milliliters witches
point<00:01:27.509> 50<00:01:28.080> fluid<00:01:28.799> ounces<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.420> think<00:01:30.420> like

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
point 50 fluid ounces I think like

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.960 
point 50 fluid ounces I think like
they'd<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.009> ipi<00:01:32.939> ones<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.700> might<00:01:35.700> face

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
they'd be the ipi ones the might face

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.620 
they'd be the ipi ones the might face
cosmetic<00:01:36.509> ones<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.400> Muska<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.360> in

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
cosmetic ones and I Muska do this and in

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.850 
cosmetic ones and I Muska do this and in
a<00:01:40.049> half<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.890> fluid<00:01:41.340> ounce<00:01:41.490> etc<00:01:42.119> etc<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.689> quite<00:01:43.619> a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
a half a fluid ounce etc etc so quite a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.830 
a half a fluid ounce etc etc so quite a
lot<00:01:44.490> smaller<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:46.170> one<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:47.009> quite<00:01:47.630> thin<00:01:48.630> as

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
lot smaller the one is quite thin as

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.649 
lot smaller the one is quite thin as
well<00:01:49.939> quite<00:01:50.939> bendy<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:52.530> quite<00:01:52.890> thin<00:01:53.659> that's

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
well quite bendy and quite thin that's

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.520 
well quite bendy and quite thin that's
the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.850 
the
it's<00:01:57.530> quite<00:01:57.860> flexible<00:01:58.550> so<00:01:59.420> I<00:01:59.450> I<00:01:59.900> prefer<00:02:00.590> a

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
it's quite flexible so I I prefer a

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.060 
it's quite flexible so I I prefer a
broader<00:02:01.420> wand<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:02.750> I<00:02:02.900> prefer<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.650> one<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.950> be

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
broader wand and I prefer the one to be

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.010 
broader wand and I prefer the one to be
bit<00:02:04.280> stiffer<00:02:04.640> because<00:02:05.060> then<00:02:05.180> I<00:02:05.210> have<00:02:05.450> more<00:02:05.660> I

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
bit stiffer because then I have more I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.830 
bit stiffer because then I have more I
feel<00:02:06.470> that<00:02:06.800> I<00:02:06.860> have<00:02:06.950> more<00:02:07.310> control<00:02:07.490> over<00:02:08.119> the

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
feel that I have more control over the

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.070 
feel that I have more control over the
application<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.910> lasts<00:02:11.360> really<00:02:11.510> really<00:02:11.900> well

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
application it lasts really really well

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.000 
application it lasts really really well
I've<00:02:12.320> had<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:13.100> shell<00:02:13.700> with<00:02:14.000> these<00:02:14.209> now<00:02:14.480> twice<00:02:15.080> if

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
I've had a shell with these now twice if

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.030 
I've had a shell with these now twice if
the<00:02:16.280> camera<00:02:16.580> ever<00:02:17.410> there<00:02:18.410> we<00:02:18.500> go<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.890> has<00:02:18.980> a

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the camera ever there we go that has a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.070 
the camera ever there we go that has a
shower<00:02:19.370> twice<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.600> see<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.810> it's

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
shower twice and you can see that it's

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.210 
shower twice and you can see that it's
not<00:02:21.290> flaked<00:02:21.740> like<00:02:22.490> this<00:02:23.480> one<00:02:23.750> this<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.860> ben<00:02:25.070> my

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
not flaked like this one this is ben my
