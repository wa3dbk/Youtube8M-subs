hi<00:00:04.430> everybody<00:00:04.790> today<00:00:05.450> we<00:00:06.260> are<00:00:06.439> going<00:00:06.740> to<00:00:06.950> make

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
hi everybody today we are going to make

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.509 
hi everybody today we are going to make
almond<00:00:08.210> milk<00:00:08.660> and<00:00:08.960> I'm<00:00:09.500> going<00:00:09.980> to<00:00:10.220> use<00:00:10.910> the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 
almond milk and I'm going to use the

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.990 
almond milk and I'm going to use the
Oster<00:00:13.519> versa<00:00:13.870> to<00:00:15.190> create<00:00:16.190> our<00:00:16.370> creation<00:00:16.820> and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
Oster versa to create our creation and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.840 
Oster versa to create our creation and
this<00:00:17.930> is<00:00:17.990> going<00:00:18.350> to<00:00:18.410> be<00:00:18.530> a<00:00:18.560> test<00:00:18.860> to<00:00:19.039> see<00:00:19.250> if<00:00:19.280> the

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
this is going to be a test to see if the

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.750 
this is going to be a test to see if the
versa<00:00:20.090> is<00:00:20.510> strong<00:00:20.930> enough<00:00:21.200> or<00:00:21.520> it's<00:00:22.520> good

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
versa is strong enough or it's good

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.420 
versa is strong enough or it's good
enough<00:00:22.970> to<00:00:23.030> make<00:00:23.390> almond<00:00:23.690> milk<00:00:24.320> so<00:00:24.770> let's<00:00:25.310> get

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
enough to make almond milk so let's get

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.900 
enough to make almond milk so let's get
to<00:00:25.610> it

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
to it

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.750 
to it
so<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:26.630> ratio<00:00:27.110> for<00:00:27.770> almond<00:00:28.220> milk<00:00:28.460> is

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
so the ratio for almond milk is

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.639 
so the ratio for almond milk is
basically<00:00:29.740> one<00:00:30.740> two<00:00:30.920> three<00:00:31.190> so<00:00:32.050> one<00:00:33.050> measuring

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
basically one two three so one measuring

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.759 
basically one two three so one measuring
and<00:00:34.640> we're<00:00:34.850> going<00:00:34.969> to<00:00:35.030> use<00:00:35.239> one<00:00:36.109> cup<00:00:36.140> here<00:00:36.620> of

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
and we're going to use one cup here of

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:42.279 
and we're going to use one cup here of
elements<00:00:37.699> all<00:00:38.390> Hellmann's<00:00:39.609> and<00:00:41.170> we're<00:00:42.170> going

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
elements all Hellmann's and we're going

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:48.329 
elements all Hellmann's and we're going
to<00:00:42.320> use<00:00:42.620> 3<00:00:43.249> cups<00:00:43.489> of<00:00:43.760> water<00:00:45.429> three<00:00:46.429> total<00:00:46.989> and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
to use 3 cups of water three total and

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.819 
to use 3 cups of water three total and
we're<00:00:49.339> gonna<00:00:49.519> add<00:00:49.760> some<00:00:49.789> dates<00:00:50.539> to<00:00:51.249> sweeten<00:00:52.249> it

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
we're gonna add some dates to sweeten it

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.790 
we're gonna add some dates to sweeten it
so<00:00:54.829> I<00:00:54.859> would<00:00:57.640> let's<00:00:58.640> see<00:00:58.929> it's<00:00:59.929> really<00:01:00.229> two

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
so I would let's see it's really two

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.509 
so I would let's see it's really two
dates<00:01:01.039> is<00:01:01.219> enough<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.609> this<00:01:01.729> so<00:01:02.889> you<00:01:03.889> see<00:01:04.129> okay

my I do this was my attempt to make

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.760 
my I do this was my attempt to make
almond<00:04:42.650> milk<00:04:43.040> using<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.580> Versa<00:04:43.850> I<00:04:44.770> actually

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
almond milk using the Versa I actually

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.720 
almond milk using the Versa I actually
think<00:04:46.340> that<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:47.150> Vitamix<00:04:47.960> and<00:04:48.610> actually<00:04:49.610> the

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
think that the Vitamix and actually the

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.360 
think that the Vitamix and actually the
Blendtec<00:04:50.150> did<00:04:50.360> a<00:04:50.390> better<00:04:50.630> job<00:04:50.930> so<00:04:51.260> that's<00:04:52.130> my
