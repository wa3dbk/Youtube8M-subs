00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
okay now as you can see it's starting to

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.209 
okay now as you can see it's starting to
bubble<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.050> cook<00:00:10.260> over<00:00:10.380> here<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:10.980> one<00:00:11.190> is

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
bubble and cook over here this one is

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.220 
bubble and cook over here this one is
deciding<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.790> pick<00:00:12.000> sides<00:00:12.269> here<00:00:12.630> over<00:00:12.960> here

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
deciding to pick sides here over here

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.589 
deciding to pick sides here over here
and<00:00:13.290> over<00:00:13.469> here<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.340> it's<00:00:15.179> starting<00:00:15.540> to

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
and over here and it's starting to

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.170 
and over here and it's starting to
bubble<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.199> cook<00:00:16.980> around<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.550> edges<00:00:17.940> and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
bubble and cook around the edges and

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.359 
bubble and cook around the edges and
it's<00:00:18.330> gonna<00:00:18.510> slowly<00:00:18.930> hopefully<00:00:19.529> move<00:00:20.070> its<00:00:20.250> way

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
it's gonna slowly hopefully move its way

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.679 
it's gonna slowly hopefully move its way
towards<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> middle<00:00:21.029> but<00:00:21.210> what<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.570> do

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
towards the middle but what I do

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.109 
towards the middle but what I do
sometimes<00:00:22.199> if<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.800> see<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.910> kind<00:00:24.029> of

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
sometimes if I see that it's kind of

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.460 
sometimes if I see that it's kind of
cooking<00:00:24.420> up<00:00:24.539> here<00:00:24.720> getting<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.019> little<00:00:25.199> too

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
cooking up here getting a little too

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.470 
cooking up here getting a little too
high<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:26.010> don't<00:00:26.039> want<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.460> start<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> bubble

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
high I don't want to start to bubble

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480 
high I don't want to start to bubble
over<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.930> edge<00:00:28.080> or<00:00:28.320> anything<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.039> it's

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
over the edge or anything if it it's

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.099 
over the edge or anything if it it's
cooking<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> little<00:00:29.970> unevenly<00:00:30.599> I'll<00:00:30.840> go<00:00:30.990> ahead

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
cooking a little unevenly I'll go ahead

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.560 
cooking a little unevenly I'll go ahead
and<00:00:31.320> stir<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.130> little<00:00:32.250> bit<00:00:32.399> all<00:00:33.360> right

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
and stir it just a little bit all right

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.680 
and stir it just a little bit all right
now<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:34.020> went<00:00:34.290> ahead<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.950> stirred<00:00:35.690> this

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
now I went ahead and stirred this

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.959 
now I went ahead and stirred this
mixture<00:00:37.170> because<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.309> all<00:00:38.520> starting

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
mixture because it was just all starting

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.700 
mixture because it was just all starting
to<00:00:39.000> bubble<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.510> almost<00:00:39.899> up<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.320> top<00:00:40.500> over

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
to bubble up almost up to the top over

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.889 
to bubble up almost up to the top over
here<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:42.090> edge<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.540> wasn't<00:00:42.690> really

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
here on one edge and it wasn't really

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.540 
here on one edge and it wasn't really
cooking<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.559> went<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.890> stirred<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.309> down

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
cooking so I went and stirred it down

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.299 
cooking so I went and stirred it down
real<00:00:45.270> good<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:46.260> make<00:00:46.379> sure<00:00:46.440> everything<00:00:47.219> was

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
real good to make sure everything was

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.069 
real good to make sure everything was
incorporated<00:00:47.940> real<00:00:48.090> good<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:49.050> looks

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
incorporated real good and now it looks

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.500 
incorporated real good and now it looks
like<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.680> heating<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.030> little<00:00:51.239> bit<00:00:51.329> better

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
like it's heating up a little bit better

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.459 
like it's heating up a little bit better
you<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.440> sort<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.920> see<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:54.289> see<00:00:55.289> it's

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
you can sort of see here see it's

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.430 
you can sort of see here see it's
changing<00:00:56.370> color<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.030> more<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:58.020> just

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
changing color it's more of a it's just

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.720 
changing color it's more of a it's just
a<00:00:58.530> little<00:00:58.739> dark<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.340> picture<00:00:59.640> it's

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
a little dark in this picture it's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.729 
a little dark in this picture it's
really<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.120> dark<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:01.440> actually

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
really not that dark but it's actually

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.009 
really not that dark but it's actually
really<00:01:01.800> quite<00:01:02.399> pale<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.149> then<00:01:03.750> around<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
really quite pale and then around the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.050 
really quite pale and then around the
edges<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.769> kind<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.979> looks<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.309> melted

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
edges it just kind of looks like melted

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.870 
edges it just kind of looks like melted
oil<00:01:06.299> or<00:01:06.630> olive<00:01:06.840> oil<00:01:07.229> basically<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.670> it's

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
oil or olive oil basically and so it's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.700 
oil or olive oil basically and so it's
cooking<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.420> around<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> edges<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.500> that's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
cooking up around the edges and that's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.050 
cooking up around the edges and that's
what<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.010> want<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:11.790> want

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
what you want it to do and you just want

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.460 
what you want it to do and you just want
to<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.210> careful<00:01:12.390> once<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.869> does<00:01:13.080> start<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
to be careful once it does start to

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.070 
to be careful once it does start to
bubble<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.060> really<00:01:15.630> want<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.930> keep

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
bubble like that you really want to keep

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.749 
bubble like that you really want to keep
an<00:01:16.259> eye<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.770> because<00:01:16.890> it'll<00:01:17.400> start<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
an eye on it because it'll start to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.340 
an eye on it because it'll start to
bubble<00:01:17.939> quicker<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.780> quicker<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.080> quicker

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
bubble quicker and quicker and quicker

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.440 
bubble quicker and quicker and quicker
and<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:20.369> you're<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:20.610> careful<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.180> will

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
and if you're not careful it will

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.719 
and if you're not careful it will
overflow<00:01:22.020> out<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.770> your<00:01:22.920> crock<00:01:23.189> pot<00:01:23.220> depending

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
overflow out of your crock pot depending

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.030 
overflow out of your crock pot depending
on<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> size<00:01:24.330> batch<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.799> keep

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
on the size batch you have so just keep

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.840 
on the size batch you have so just keep
an<00:01:26.159> eye<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.290> every<00:01:28.290> now<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.619> then<00:01:28.850> if

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
an eye on it and every now and then if

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.700 
an eye on it and every now and then if
you<00:01:30.090> need<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.960> ahead<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.170> stir<00:01:31.560> it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
you need to you can go ahead and stir it

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.429 
you need to you can go ahead and stir it
down<00:01:32.090> try<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> scrape<00:01:33.450> down<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.810> edges<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.409> you

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
down try to scrape down the edges so you

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.020 
down try to scrape down the edges so you
don't<00:01:34.710> end<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:34.950> getting<00:01:35.100> these<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.610> hard

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
don't end up getting these really hard

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.999 
don't end up getting these really hard
caked<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.960> bits<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.439> edges<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.860> have

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
caked on bits on the edges that have

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.770 
caked on bits on the edges that have
cooked<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.880> end<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.329> mixing<00:01:39.689> that

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
cooked and then you end up mixing that
