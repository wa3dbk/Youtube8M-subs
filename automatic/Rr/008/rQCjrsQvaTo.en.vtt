00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.240
 there was one him to comment 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.609
 since in any case you have always seen i 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.480
 My big ozzy the gameplay as I call them 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.160
 I 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.310
 even today guys are seeing a big guy 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.920
 game play off always done to my usual 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.660
 m need 300 more than I am now 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.450
 taking much by hand to get them behind 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.129
 every time more and more to realize them 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.690
 views and still I really like it a lot 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.090
 young people in this way even if a 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.440
 some may not like it for some 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.219
 demons could n't make sense but 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.520
 really i still do this kind of 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.000
 gameplay 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.610
 it is necessary to have beyond only skill in the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.280
 make the stripes immediately and recycle them 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.010
 but we must know well 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.140
 how to close the enemies and very well 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.460
 organized and find especially the 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.750
 right lobby and in any case also have one 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.129
 good connection to get in right away 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.530
 by bike as soon as they drive here 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.490
 fortunately, I come back to it right away 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.200
 that precisely because he didn't know from 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.420
 September if I'm not mistaken 30 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.130
 better then I have to say that lately 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.170
 I'm almost not complaining anymore 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.240
 view connection from point become 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.280
 almost always fast enough i 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.009
 enemies apart when you stream that 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.750
 among other things I should also have the others 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.580
 streaming since I've done a couple 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.140
 in the last few days he is really happy 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.450
 of these tracks, however, I am bringing 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.100
 forward along with the type of pub I am 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.850

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.500
 clan 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.960
 This project is therefore quiz 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.380
 nothing other things kids living 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.550
 say besides the fact that it has reached i 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.759
 5,000 subscribers that we complain so much 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.929
 time yesterday about writings and there will also be 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.750
 a special course my channel 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.490
 which I think will come out in a couple of days e 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.920
 I didn't really know what to do then besides 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.750
 ask for advice from you because I have 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.399
 asked that the moral but as said do 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.899
 maybe a company reads of those who 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.420
 they do short things given the shells o 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.399
 beetle freedom we know is the field a 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.280
 two steps so I could do one 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.840
 crossbar challenger a sotoudeh cells 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.130
 and a club like that with the ball is 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.290
 combined with what you do, even mediators 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.900
 football clubs and maybe even bring them into the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.239
 Clan dog because no such challenge 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.010
 in addition to the thanks 5,000 registered and 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.079
 or make a line with other blogs as it is 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.610
 proposed to do some fax or stuff of 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.560
 it's kind of pretty enough anyway 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.810
 digital football is always around the neck 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.980
 some challenges did it then 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.600
 if you too someone 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.130

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.140
 I will also take inspiration from your e 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.450
 it could very well be loaded 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.209
 clan anyway besides these guys the 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.859
 gameplay obviously a 371 3 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.280
 if I am not mistaken, I made it 9 st 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:45.079
 new town and beyond that what else do I have to 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.359
 say I read about the gameplay called the 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.100
 my special now of the subject if 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.570
 I am not wrong because I had a 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.280
 couple of things to say but I hope not 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.320
 having forgotten anything these things is 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.090
 always forgetting things of course 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.280
 you know they are not beautiful comments 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.340

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.420
 I don't know how to talk in a joke 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.849
 as long as such too 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.739
 then nothing very important 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.069
 guys mean according to you guys 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.680

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.989
 bedin disclose on TV dragon ball 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:21.019

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.230
 to down read or write by the way 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.930
 there is also a case for reading or 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.680
 see the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.799
 television injuries if you read it or see it 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.019
 because I personally am also a 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.870
 all waiting for you to tend not to 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.310
 can hear waiting for the return of the 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.439
 dragon ball with new venue for those not 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.260
 he knew because the new series will be released 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.760
 of dragon ball in July are the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.400
 wrong series that will continue with 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.129
 dark machine made to take it to 17 years 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.139
 denial a cock its own lever 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.200
 finished in hand on the 2nd half ready there 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:07.299
 in front of a1 to fail and precisely 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.400
 snow are a bit different than dragon ball 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.720
 either I'm 17 I never missed a 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.760
 bet boy of all of them 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.889

 if the carton is better and more beautiful than 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.660
 have ever done in all of it 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.459
 usual plot ngara cartoons comics all 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.320
