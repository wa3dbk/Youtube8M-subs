00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.180 
I wonder what you think any president
can<00:02:01.840> accomplish<00:02:02.110> during<00:02:02.500> our<00:02:02.740> first<00:02:02.920> time

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
can accomplish during our first time

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.690 
can accomplish during our first time
against<00:02:03.430> an<00:02:03.580> office<00:02:03.850> attorney

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.550 

well<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.470> think<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.420> new<00:02:12.810> president<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.440> do

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
well I think that a new president can do

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.130 
well I think that a new president can do
an<00:02:13.740> enormous<00:02:14.220> amount<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:15.540> restore<00:02:15.870> confidence

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
an enormous amount to restore confidence

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.870 
an enormous amount to restore confidence
to<00:02:16.710> move<00:02:16.860> an<00:02:16.980> agenda<00:02:17.100> forward<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:18.560> speaks<00:02:19.560> to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
to move an agenda forward that speaks to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.550 
to move an agenda forward that speaks to
the<00:02:20.880> needs<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.270> economy<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.380> needs

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
the needs of the economy and the needs

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.190 
the needs of the economy and the needs
of<00:02:22.850> middle-class<00:02:23.850> families<00:02:24.420> all<00:02:24.570> across<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
of middle-class families all across the

be needed my transition team is going to
be<00:02:48.180> monitoring<00:02:48.900> very<00:02:49.200> closely<00:02:49.290> what<00:02:50.220> happens

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
be monitoring very closely what happens

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.370 
be monitoring very closely what happens
over<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.600> course<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.050> next<00:02:52.260> several

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
over the course of the next several

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.490 
over the course of the next several
months<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:54.120> one<00:02:54.270> thing<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.600> can<00:02:54.780> say<00:02:55.050> with

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
months the one thing I can say with

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.490 
months the one thing I can say with
certainty<00:02:55.740> is<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.330> I<00:02:57.330> have<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.990> focus<00:02:58.140> on

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
certainty is that I have to focus on

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.940 
certainty is that I have to focus on
jobs<00:02:59.180> because<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:01.110> hemorrhaging<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.680> jobs

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
jobs because the hemorrhaging of jobs

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.500 
jobs because the hemorrhaging of jobs
has<00:03:02.340> an<00:03:02.580> impact<00:03:03.590> obviously<00:03:04.590> on<00:03:05.510> consumer

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
has an impact obviously on consumer

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.130 
has an impact obviously on consumer
confidence<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.320> ability<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.709> people<00:03:07.890> to

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
confidence and the ability of people to

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.470 
confidence and the ability of people to
to<00:03:10.140> buy<00:03:10.320> goods<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.739> services<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:12.300> have

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
to buy goods and services and can have

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.890 
to buy goods and services and can have
enormous<00:03:12.690> spillover<00:03:13.200> effects<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:15.330> think

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
enormous spillover effects and I think

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.120 
enormous spillover effects and I think
it's<00:03:16.050> going<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.260> be<00:03:16.350> very<00:03:16.380> important<00:03:16.890> for<00:03:16.920> us

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
it's going to be very important for us

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.150 
it's going to be very important for us
to<00:03:17.310> provide<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:19.200> kinds<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.530> assistance<00:03:19.769> to

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
to provide the kinds of assistance to

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.250 
to provide the kinds of assistance to
state<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.610> local<00:03:20.880> governments<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.870> make<00:03:22.019> sure

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
state and local governments to make sure

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.290 
state and local governments to make sure
that<00:03:22.590> they<00:03:22.769> don't<00:03:22.860> compound<00:03:23.340> some<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.239> the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
that they don't compound some of the

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.759 
that they don't compound some of the
problems<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.750> are<00:03:24.959> already<00:03:25.050> out<00:03:25.200> there<00:03:25.470> by

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
problems that are already out there by

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.860 
problems that are already out there by
having<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.250> initiate<00:03:26.970> major<00:03:27.150> layoffs<00:03:27.600> or

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
having to initiate major layoffs or

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.290 
having to initiate major layoffs or
initiate<00:03:28.680> tax<00:03:28.920> increases<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.700> there<00:03:30.120> are<00:03:30.180> some

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
initiate tax increases so there are some

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.370 
initiate tax increases so there are some
things<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.600> we<00:03:30.780> know<00:03:30.900> we're<00:03:31.080> going<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.230> have

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
things that we know we're going to have

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.540 
things that we know we're going to have
to<00:03:31.500> do<00:03:32.840> but<00:03:33.840> I'm<00:03:34.110> confident<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.860> new

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
to do but I'm confident that a new

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.920 
to do but I'm confident that a new
president<00:03:36.030> can<00:03:36.239> have<00:03:36.390> an<00:03:36.510> enormous<00:03:36.660> impact

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
president can have an enormous impact

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.370 
president can have an enormous impact
that's<00:03:37.500> why<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.709> ran<00:03:37.920> for<00:03:38.160> president<00:03:39.230> all<00:03:40.230> right

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
that's why I ran for president all right

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.729 
that's why I ran for president all right
Layton<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.989> so<00:03:43.230> there's<00:03:43.440> been<00:03:43.530> some

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
Layton and so there's been some

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.370 
Layton and so there's been some
suggestion<00:03:44.100> from<00:03:44.370> House<00:03:44.610> Democrats<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.510> the

suggestion from House Democrats that the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.620 
suggestion from House Democrats that the
stimulus<00:03:47.100> package<00:03:47.459> may<00:03:47.760> be<00:03:48.420> in<00:03:48.510> trouble

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
stimulus package may be in trouble

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.820 
stimulus package may be in trouble
there's<00:03:48.930> going<00:03:49.050> to<00:03:49.110> be<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.200> hard<00:03:49.350> time<00:03:49.470> getting

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
there's going to be a hard time getting

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.740 
there's going to be a hard time getting
out<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:50.160> lame<00:03:50.640> duck<00:03:50.820> session<00:03:51.030> are<00:03:51.360> you<00:03:51.450> still
