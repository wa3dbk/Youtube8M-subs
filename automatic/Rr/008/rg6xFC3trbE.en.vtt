00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.380
 but i am the movie i am the paul 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.050
 Winter flehr and we had one today 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.070
 braised off 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.290
 with the flute red-cross-ball jam 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.200
 The recipe comes from the book 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.270
 pilgrimages from the wienerwald around our 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.920
 direct has a recipe for this book 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.790
 which we live now 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.860
 will save 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.200
 for the preparation of the really bad 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.260
 we need bacon one 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.220
 thrown holy salt of white pepper 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.620
 Thyme violates firefighters cinnamon and a 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.030
 We also need one 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.399
 silvaner it was an oil vinegar and fine 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.680
 sliced root vegetables to tie 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.680
 the wing may be required 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.990
 First of all, we spice up a niche 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.210
 with salt and pepper around with him 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.570
 after that we want the wing of one 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.790
 side to the other to govern together in 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.090
 that means bringing in shape and that 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.540
 exchanges will take for frying 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.940
 Spagat catch on top with a knot 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.650
 and take it with two fingers and 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.320
 turn to a bend so that the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.870
 loose side to the rear side afterwards 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.780
 let's hit the bend over the 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.510
 wing and tighten the knot 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.180
 we go with the same procedure 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.510
 continue ahead and thus benefit the whole 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.700
 after the bad the distance between 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.750
 The sleep should be about two to three 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.729
 centimeters amount to wheat of the way 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.509
 it gets strong again with salt 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:53.020
 pepper thyme crushed 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:56.020
 We then give juniper berries 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.970
 the rule in a vascular best no 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.000
 Metal because the meat is otherwise one 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.760
 metallic taste takes on afterwards 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.619
 without concern with root vegetables the wing 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.940
 we are a shot of apple vinegar 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.240
 very little 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.550
 We'll do that now after 24 hours 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.150
 Let's take the building meat out of the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.150
 fridge out 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.900
 is that yes? 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.290
 One should now take the meat 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.290
 out there 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.280
 let it drain properly 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.340
 page off so that we have the vegetables 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.700
 have separated and played liquid 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:49.120
 the respect is now his 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.120
 it adds a little bit more 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.709
 and add that late 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.569
 afterwards we let the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.510
 preheated 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.599
 pan some butter lard wait for it 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.609
 Liquid should be the butter lard 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.730
 do we need to know that that very much? 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.889
 hot and therefore the danger exists that 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.659
 nothing is burning 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:23.030
 the butter lard now smokes and proves 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:25.310
 that prepared meat roast the whole 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.849
 all around 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.749
 then we give the meat 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:34.290
 out and pour the excess 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:37.709
 Butterfett we still comfort some bacon 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:42.889
 add to the root the rootstock 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.310
 The whole thing is golden brown 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.560
 roast 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.269
 who would like to do something paradeis man 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.269
 Add to make the color more beautiful 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.189
 is the whole well equipped 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.189
 Do it with a little effort 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.290
 then roast the flour briefly 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.360
 and pour on the stain 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.450
 then you put that before 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:16.049
 roasted in and now pushes 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:20.100
 the flora is 180 degrees for 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.750
 one and a half hours as a parking space for the 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.160
 Successfully we need soft butter 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:29.550
 Potter salt grind more handy and 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.990
 he flours for it first we beat 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:37.919
 the butter with the sugar foamy 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.040
 this does not get any skin and 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.690
 we have a nice day 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.970

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.940
 and finally we close the operation 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.870
 towards magnets all to one 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.870
 sunny day 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.210
 and make little dumplings out of it 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.050
 citic necessary rolls you are in 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:10.169
 boiling water and leaves you about ever

 pan onion sweat on 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.430
