folds<00:00:10.470> first<00:00:11.470> fold<00:00:11.740> the<00:00:11.830> rectangle<00:00:12.490> into

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:12.640 
folds first fold the rectangle into

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.600 
folds first fold the rectangle into
quarters<00:00:13.240> by<00:00:14.080> folding<00:00:14.500> in<00:00:14.650> half<00:00:14.680> and<00:00:15.250> then<00:00:15.460> in

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
quarters by folding in half and then in

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:47.549 
quarters by folding in half and then in
half<00:00:15.639> again

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.560 

take<00:00:48.559> one<00:00:48.770> half<00:00:49.040> and<00:00:49.370> fold<00:00:49.760> a<00:00:49.850> 60-degree<00:00:50.540> angle

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
take one half and fold a 60-degree angle

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.100 
take one half and fold a 60-degree angle
at<00:00:51.080> the<00:00:51.320> middle<00:00:51.650> of<00:00:51.770> the<00:00:51.920> top<00:00:52.129> edge<00:00:52.870> take<00:00:53.870> one

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
at the middle of the top edge take one

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.799 
at the middle of the top edge take one
90-degree<00:00:54.739> corner<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.400> place<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:56.270> on<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.690> the

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
90-degree corner and place it on to the

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.200 
90-degree corner and place it on to the
folded<00:00:57.290> quarter<00:00:57.769> line<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.790> that<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:59.090> edge

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
folded quarter line so that the edge

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:22.870 
folded quarter line so that the edge
goes<00:00:59.570> through<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.989> top<00:01:00.260> middle<00:01:00.500> point<00:01:21.850> now<00:01:22.850> I

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
goes through the top middle point now I

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.910 
goes through the top middle point now I
do<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.330> same<00:01:23.539> fold<00:01:23.869> on<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.380> other<00:01:24.530> half<00:01:24.800> of

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
do the same fold on the other half of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.580 
do the same fold on the other half of
the<00:01:25.009> paper<00:01:25.509> fold<00:01:26.509> another<00:01:26.750> 60-degree<00:01:27.560> angle

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
the paper fold another 60-degree angle

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.779 
the paper fold another 60-degree angle
at<00:01:28.039> the<00:01:28.160> top<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.910> so<00:01:29.690> you've<00:01:29.869> made<00:01:30.460> 120<00:01:31.460> degree

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
at the top and so you've made 120 degree

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:50.810 
at the top and so you've made 120 degree
angle<00:01:32.240> at<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.539> top

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.660 

then<00:01:51.820> feel<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:52.180> fold<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.899> short<00:01:53.170> edge

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
then feel the fold to the short edge

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.279 
then feel the fold to the short edge
hold<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.880> short<00:01:55.119> edge<00:01:55.329> up<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.930> fold<00:01:56.170> line

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
hold the short edge up to the fold line

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:07.350 
hold the short edge up to the fold line
and<00:01:56.619> match<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.429> edges<00:02:05.549> do<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.700> same<00:02:06.909> on<00:02:07.179> the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
and match the edges do the same on the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:20.850 
and match the edges do the same on the
other<00:02:07.390> side<00:02:17.670> turn<00:02:18.670> over<00:02:19.080> we<00:02:20.080> have<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> rhombus

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
other side turn over we have a rhombus

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.580 
other side turn over we have a rhombus
with<00:02:21.130> one<00:02:21.370> full<00:02:21.670> line<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:22.060> symmetry<00:02:22.269> and<00:02:22.780> two

other<00:02:23.830> short<00:02:24.459> fold<00:02:24.760> lines<00:02:26.040> fold<00:02:27.040> away<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
other short fold lines fold away the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.670 
other short fold lines fold away the
small<00:02:27.849> triangles<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:29.110> form<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.470> regular
