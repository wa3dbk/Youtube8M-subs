mineplex on mineplex under D mic the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.940 
mineplex on mineplex under D mic the
mineplex<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.180> custom<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.869> also<00:01:28.530> use

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950

shaders<00:01:29.670> adjusts<00:01:30.509> because<00:01:31.549> that<00:01:32.549> makes<00:01:33.180> more

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
shaders adjusts because that makes more

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.240 
shaders adjusts because that makes more
like<00:01:34.159> so<00:01:35.420> then<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.750> makes<00:01:36.990> more<00:01:37.259> HD<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.100> all

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
like so then it makes more HD and all

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.990 
like so then it makes more HD and all
