you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.540> go<00:01:06.689> from<00:01:06.900> bone<00:01:07.259> dry<00:01:07.619> -<00:01:08.580> completely

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you can go from bone dry - completely

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.929 
you can go from bone dry - completely
workable<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.130> joinable<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.430> another<00:01:11.700> piece

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
I don't know about you guys but a lot of

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.680 
I don't know about you guys but a lot of
times<00:01:24.270> when<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.470> need<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.190> work<00:01:26.400> with<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.880> slab<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
times when I need to work with a slab I

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.690 
times when I need to work with a slab I
will<00:01:27.990> roll<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.320> more<00:01:28.530> than<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.710> need<00:01:28.980> and<00:01:29.250> then

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
will roll out more than I need and then

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700 
will roll out more than I need and then
I<00:01:29.760> tend<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> keep<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.659> around<00:01:30.930> thinking<00:01:31.500> well

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
I tend to keep that around thinking well

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.380 
I tend to keep that around thinking well
depending<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.670> mean<00:01:32.820> tomorrow<00:01:33.270> I

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
depending on what I mean tomorrow I

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.000 
depending on what I mean tomorrow I
might<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:33.990> able<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.230> use<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.530> rest<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.890> this

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
might be able to use the rest of this

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.450 
might be able to use the rest of this
and<00:01:35.310> then<00:01:35.630> sometimes<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.260> dries<00:01:37.830> out<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
and then sometimes it just dries out and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.399 
and then sometimes it just dries out and
doesn't<00:01:38.580> get<00:01:38.790> used<00:01:39.060> well<00:01:39.540> I'm<00:01:40.020> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> take

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
doesn't get used well I'm going to take

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.280 
doesn't get used well I'm going to take
a<00:01:40.740> little<00:01:41.220> piece<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.430> slab<00:01:41.940> here<00:01:42.330> this<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.750> very

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
a little piece of slab here this is very

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.460 
a little piece of slab here this is very
very<00:01:43.470> hard<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.130> bone<00:01:44.460> dry<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.260> go<00:01:46.260> ahead

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
very hard this is bone dry and go ahead

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.460 
very hard this is bone dry and go ahead
and<00:01:46.710> rehydrate<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.490> -<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.690> point<00:01:49.080> where<00:01:49.290> it

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
and rehydrate this - to a point where it

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.969 
and rehydrate this - to a point where it
would<00:01:49.620> be<00:01:49.799> workable<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.970> join<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.680> bottom

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
would be workable to join to the bottom

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.590 
would be workable to join to the bottom
of<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.220> small<00:01:53.460> pot<00:01:53.729> or<00:01:54.060> something<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.540> that

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
of a small pot or something like that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.330 
of a small pot or something like that
I'm<00:01:55.080> going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.290> use<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.470> baggie<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.190> had<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
I'm going to use a baggie if you had a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.700 
I'm going to use a baggie if you had a
bigger<00:01:56.640> piece<00:01:56.940> of<00:01:56.970> clay<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:58.140> could<00:01:58.290> use<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
bigger piece of clay you could use a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.590 
bigger piece of clay you could use a
larger<00:01:59.159> bag<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.790> a<00:02:00.060> large<00:02:00.299> freezer<00:02:00.840> bag<00:02:02.600> so

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
larger bag like a large freezer bag so

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.280 
larger bag like a large freezer bag so
take<00:02:04.170> my<00:02:04.320> clay<00:02:04.940> put<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:06.060> here<00:02:06.330> in<00:02:06.540> my<00:02:06.630> bag<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
take my clay put it here in my bag and

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.750 
take my clay put it here in my bag and
I'm<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.429> going<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.640> add<00:02:08.759> some<00:02:09.060> water<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.539> it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.649 

Oh<00:02:13.680> God<00:02:14.709> my<00:02:14.980> sponge<00:02:15.370> wet<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.209> squeeze<00:02:16.629> some

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
Oh God my sponge wet and squeeze some

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.100 
Oh God my sponge wet and squeeze some
water<00:02:17.079> in<00:02:17.319> here<00:02:18.269> this<00:02:19.269> has<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.510> lot<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.780> surface

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
water in here this has a lot of surface

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.289 
water in here this has a lot of surface
area<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.799> it<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.400> should<00:02:21.579> absorb<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:22.120> water

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
area to it so it should absorb the water

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.390 
area to it so it should absorb the water
very<00:02:22.689> quickly<00:02:23.790> I'm<00:02:24.790> going<00:02:24.909> to<00:02:25.329> use<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:26.400> water

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
very quickly I'm going to use the water

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.670 
very quickly I'm going to use the water
in<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.819> bucket<00:02:27.970> here<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.689> push<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.140> air<00:02:29.290> out

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
in the bucket here to push the air out

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.250 
in the bucket here to push the air out
of<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.920> bag

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.790 

you<00:02:35.769> man<00:02:36.120> seal<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.330> up

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.130 

I'm<00:02:42.280> sure<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.150> actually<00:02:43.270> seal<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.110> you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
I'm sure that you actually seal it you

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.800 
I'm sure that you actually seal it you
don't<00:02:44.620> want<00:02:45.550> this<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:46.030> fill<00:02:46.300> up<00:02:46.540> with<00:02:46.750> water

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
don't want this to fill up with water

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.790 
don't want this to fill up with water
just<00:02:47.440> one<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.670> use<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.930> small<00:02:50.320> amount<00:02:50.740> of

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
just one to use the small amount of

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.030 
just one to use the small amount of
water<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:52.020> control<00:02:53.020> that<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:53.710> chose<00:02:54.010> to

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
water that you control that you chose to

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.760 
water that you control that you chose to
put<00:02:54.400> in<00:02:54.550> there

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.610 

okay

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
okay

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.800 
okay
so

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
so

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.060 
so
almost<00:03:06.500> no<00:03:06.800> air<00:03:07.160> in<00:03:07.490> this<00:03:07.790> bag<00:03:08.090> got<00:03:08.770> water<00:03:09.770> in

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
almost no air in this bag got water in

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.390 
almost no air in this bag got water in
here<00:03:10.810> drop<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.990> down<00:03:12.170> in<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:13.040> bucket<00:03:15.400> the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
here drop it down in this bucket the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.070 
here drop it down in this bucket the
water<00:03:16.550> pressure<00:03:16.970> from<00:03:17.300> all<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.690> water<00:03:17.870> in<00:03:18.020> the

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
water pressure from all the water in the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.010 
water pressure from all the water in the
bucket<00:03:18.200> again<00:03:19.070> it's<00:03:19.340> going<00:03:19.460> to<00:03:19.520> distribute

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
bucket again it's going to distribute

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.040 
bucket again it's going to distribute
that<00:03:21.020> water<00:03:21.440> around<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.850> slab<00:03:23.180> of<00:03:23.480> clay<00:03:23.660> and

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
that water around the slab of clay and

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.100 
that water around the slab of clay and
apply<00:03:24.830> pressure<00:03:25.190> so<00:03:25.670> that<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.360> water<00:03:26.630> absorbs

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
apply pressure so that the water absorbs

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:51.050 
apply pressure so that the water absorbs
in<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:28.120> rehydrates<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.390> clay<00:03:29.680> check<00:03:30.680> back

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.410 

okay<00:03:52.060> here's<00:03:53.050> our<00:03:53.470> slab<00:03:54.330> whoop<00:03:56.580> now<00:03:57.580> remember

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
okay here's our slab whoop now remember

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.340 
okay here's our slab whoop now remember
this<00:03:58.750> was<00:03:58.990> rock<00:03:59.650> hard<00:03:59.680> earlier<00:04:01.080> this<00:04:02.080> is<00:04:02.140> a

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
this was rock hard earlier this is a

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.640 
this was rock hard earlier this is a
totally<00:04:03.040> pliable<00:04:03.670> piece<00:04:03.910> of<00:04:04.120> clay<00:04:04.360> now<00:04:04.650> you

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
totally pliable piece of clay now you

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.610 
totally pliable piece of clay now you
could<00:04:05.860> certainly<00:04:06.250> join<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.500> onto<00:04:08.500> the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
could certainly join this onto the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.620 
could certainly join this onto the
bottom<00:04:08.890> of<00:04:08.980> a<00:04:09.070> pot<00:04:09.280> at<00:04:09.640> this<00:04:10.060> point<00:04:10.360> if<00:04:10.510> you

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630
