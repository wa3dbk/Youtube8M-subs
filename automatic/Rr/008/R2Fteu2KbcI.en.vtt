00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.590 
because I think this bag was originally
used<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:43.229> travel<00:01:44.009> makeup<00:01:44.640> case<00:01:44.939> something

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
used as a travel makeup case something

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.920 
used as a travel makeup case something
like<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.899> toiletry<00:01:46.409> case<00:01:47.540> but<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.750> look

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
like that toiletry case but if you look

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.310 
like that toiletry case but if you look
in<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.229> back<00:01:49.579> this<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:51.420> authentication<00:01:51.990> -

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
in the back this is for authentication -

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.069
