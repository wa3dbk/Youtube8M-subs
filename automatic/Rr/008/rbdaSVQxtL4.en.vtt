that
don't<00:02:25.980> worry<00:02:26.070> along<00:02:26.310> with<00:02:26.459> time<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.880> go<00:02:27.000> like

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
don't worry along with time you go like

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.020 
don't worry along with time you go like
this<00:02:27.740> because<00:02:28.740> he'll<00:02:28.950> cut<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.340> hell<00:02:29.700> color

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
this because he'll cut the hell color

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.780 
this because he'll cut the hell color
will<00:02:30.680> aerodynamics<00:02:31.680> all<00:02:32.430> about<00:02:32.670> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
will aerodynamics all about the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:42.790 
will aerodynamics all about the
aerodynamics<00:02:33.060> has<00:02:33.720> been<00:02:33.870> there

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.250 

question<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.010> day<00:02:44.239> what<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.390> aerodynamics

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
question of the day what is aerodynamics

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.660 
question of the day what is aerodynamics
comment<00:02:46.739> them<00:02:47.180> yeah<00:02:48.209> come<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:48.830> many<00:02:49.830> dynamics

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
comment them yeah come on many dynamics

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.050 
comment them yeah come on many dynamics
