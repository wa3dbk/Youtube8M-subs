now all of the information is the same
the<00:02:31.170> advantage<00:02:31.769> of<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.370> earlier<00:02:33.000> one<00:02:33.330> for<00:02:33.690> me

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
the advantage of the earlier one for me

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.110 
the advantage of the earlier one for me
is<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.650> lot<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.220> illustrations<00:02:36.000> are

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
is that a lot of the illustrations are

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.590 
is that a lot of the illustrations are
actually<00:02:36.660> things<00:02:37.019> which<00:02:37.290> pertain<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.800> my<00:02:38.130> car

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
actually things which pertain to my car

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.259 
actually things which pertain to my car
1941<00:02:39.600> whereas<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.739> this<00:02:41.160> book<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.819> lot<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
1941 whereas in this book a lot of the

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.410 
1941 whereas in this book a lot of the
illustrations<00:02:42.930> are<00:02:43.050> from<00:02:43.230> 1946<00:02:44.160> through<00:02:44.420> 1948

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
illustrations are from 1946 through 1948

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.490 
illustrations are from 1946 through 1948
so<00:02:46.819> it's<00:02:47.819> kind<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.239> bonus<00:02:48.690> once<00:02:48.930> again<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.200> got

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
so it's kind of a bonus once again I got

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.039 
so it's kind of a bonus once again I got
both<00:02:49.769> of<00:02:49.799> these<00:02:50.069> on<00:02:50.310> eBay<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:51.239> think<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.840> paid

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
both of these on eBay I think I paid

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.530 
both of these on eBay I think I paid
less<00:02:52.230> than<00:02:52.440> $20<00:02:53.069> for<00:02:53.100> both<00:02:53.489> of<00:02:53.730> them<00:02:53.850> whereas

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
less than $20 for both of them whereas

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.770 
less than $20 for both of them whereas
the<00:02:54.780> reprinted<00:02:55.410> book<00:02:56.000> which<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.150> don't<00:02:57.209> find<00:02:57.569> is

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
the reprinted book which I don't find is

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.050 
the reprinted book which I don't find is
useful<00:02:58.260> because<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.950> lack<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.640> clarity<00:02:59.880> of

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
useful because of the lack of clarity of

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.680 
useful because of the lack of clarity of
the<00:03:00.180> illustrations<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.080> bought<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.769> from<00:03:02.069> a
