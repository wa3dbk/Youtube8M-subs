00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.049
 Hi, I'm Patricia Green and I'm going to make you 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.420
 a brief introduction of the talk or 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.500
 conference that I will give in the next 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.360
 Conscious feeding congress 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.360
 in the day cat 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.290
 with a focus mostly on a biochemist 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.390
 molecular of the human being but I do not 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.300
 He answered many questions and questions with 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.430
 those that later I found like this 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.199
 than to look for a little more and to 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.290
 understand and deepen more on the subject 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.660
 of man I decided to study medicine 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.619
 different traditional medicines 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.409
 ancestral as traditional medicine 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.810
 something Ayurvedic Chinese our 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.050
 traditional western medicine and others 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.170
 energy therapies in the year 2000 I 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.420
 I bought the camera that read gdv which is a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.390
 tool to visualize and measure the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.240
 human energy field and thanks to everything 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.410
 I have been able to verify that you can not 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.050
 really understand the name without 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:35.050
 delve in the world of 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.410
 energy of the soul and spirit 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.280
 I think it's important to always move forward 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:47.410
 with the scientific look with the analysis 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:51.720
 and with the scientific analysis but there 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.720
 that also know how to integrate 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.450
 synthesize with the look 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.940
 that's why I decided to put this title to the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.430
 conference and I will address the subject of 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.530
 feeding from this from this 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.630
 perspective from this broad vision of 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.940
 to be human is to say man is not 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.160
 he only has a physical body but 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.560
 that also has other bodies between 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.290
 more subtle quotes and when we speak 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.980
 feeding 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.980
 we must attend 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.400
 but we must also attend to the 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.040
 other bodies 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.079
 in the conference, I will speak no 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.980
 only as I say of the physical body 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:34.140
 but such quality and 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.120
 energetic characteristic of different 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.670
 food there are foods that are 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.280
 hot others are cold some expand 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.519
 others contract one they make ascend the 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.900
 Energy others to make you lose anyway 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.209
 I will talk a little about the appearance 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.400
 energetic of food and then 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:55.060
 I'll talk about this body in quotes 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.830
 subtle called energy field 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.260
 which is the reflection of our state 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:04.390
 physical psychic psychic and physical and how 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.120
 feed it as nurture it as 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.430
 enhance it I hope you like the 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.430
 conference and I hope this day
