the<00:00:03.090> macbook<00:00:03.449> pro<00:00:03.480> family<00:00:04.140> really<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.400> quite

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
the macbook pro family really is a quite

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.020 
the macbook pro family really is a quite
remarkable<00:00:06.930> engineering<00:00:07.099> achievement<00:00:08.099> it's

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
remarkable engineering achievement it's

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.089 
remarkable engineering achievement it's
truly<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.809> result<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.880> years<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.980> hard<00:00:13.980> work

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
truly the result of years of hard work

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.870 
truly the result of years of hard work
of<00:00:15.020> innovation<00:00:16.020> annick<00:00:17.010> driven<00:00:17.550> by<00:00:17.699> this

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
of innovation annick driven by this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.990 
of innovation annick driven by this
obsessive<00:00:18.750> attention<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.340> every<00:00:20.789> detail

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
obsessive attention to to every detail

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.920 
obsessive attention to to every detail
and<00:00:22.010> this<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.160> particularly<00:00:23.699> evident<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
and this is particularly evident in the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.759 
and this is particularly evident in the
enclosure<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:27.630> traditionally<00:00:28.289> notebooks

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
enclosure and traditionally notebooks

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.840 
enclosure and traditionally notebooks
are<00:00:28.980> made<00:00:29.220> from<00:00:29.929> multiple<00:00:30.929> parts<00:00:31.759> but<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
are made from multiple parts but the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.299 
are made from multiple parts but the
problem<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.329> when<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.200> multiple<00:00:34.680> parts

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
problem is when you have multiple parts

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.510 
problem is when you have multiple parts
you<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.730> add<00:00:35.880> size<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.690> weight<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.520> you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
you you add size and weight and you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.610 
you you add size and weight and you
increase<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.270> opportunity<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:40.050> failure<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
increase the opportunity for failure and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.970 
increase the opportunity for failure and
that<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.640> huge<00:00:42.360> breakthrough<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.710> heard

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that the huge breakthrough that we heard

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.880 
that the huge breakthrough that we heard
was<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.760> replace<00:00:45.090> all<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.690> those<00:00:45.840> parts<00:00:46.350> with

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
was to replace all of those parts with

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.850 
was to replace all of those parts with
just<00:00:47.160> one<00:00:47.489> part<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.170> part<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.590> called

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
just one part and at one part we called

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.660 
just one part and at one part we called
the<00:00:49.950> unibody<00:00:51.260> we<00:00:52.260> figured<00:00:52.739> out<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.890> way<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the unibody we figured out a way of

to make that one part was to machine it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.200 
to make that one part was to machine it
from<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> single<00:01:12.240> piece<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.479> aluminium

aluminium was the ideal choice for this

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.440 
aluminium was the ideal choice for this

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
precision that is just completely

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:22.380 
precision that is just completely
unheard<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.850> in<00:02:16.120> this<00:02:16.540> industry

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.370 

we<00:02:23.390> have<00:02:23.600> been<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:25.660> fanatical<00:02:26.660> in<00:02:27.050> the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
we have been so fanatical in the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.040 
we have been so fanatical in the
tolerances<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.430> how<00:02:28.970> we<00:02:29.030> machine<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:29.840> build

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
tolerances of how we machine and build

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.840 
tolerances of how we machine and build
up<00:02:30.200> these<00:02:30.410> products

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
up these products

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.360 
up these products
in<00:02:33.270> many<00:02:33.690> ways<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.930> think<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.830> more<00:02:34.920> beautiful

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
in many ways I think it's more beautiful
