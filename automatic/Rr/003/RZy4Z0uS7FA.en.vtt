00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.230
 hello friends today to me in 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.820
 hands got 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:18.980
 such a knife touch the sky lapdog in a friend not 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:26.180
 today, not so long ago had a chance to 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.180
 tell this is the knife of the company air Chrysostom 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.880
 voice pip knife in just such right leather 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.820
 classic 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.820
 has a leather dial 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.320
 actually the blade itself 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.070
 so pretty interesting 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:00.210
 what I want to say on what brand of steel 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.670
 there is no information here but 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:09.500
 since it is air I can assume that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:13.049
 1095 hail 17 here is the processing of the blade 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.310
 then on the slopes and 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.310
 sort of like polishing on 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:26.869
 on the blade itself, although satin is also 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.930
 so sitting on the square on the butt here 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.970
 about two millimeters 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:40.750
 strange as it sounds now 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:44.600
 the way modern realities of residential 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.990
 requirements and how else to call it than 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.890
 the thicker the better yes yes you can see 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.470
 about two millimeters 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.750
 I want to say that the knife worked 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:04.610
 constantly even butchered carcass 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:07.239
 here but I want to mention such pretty 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:12.530
 still a big minus at the knife 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:15.830
 it's his steel she's processed here 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:22.940
 just terrible heat treatment 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:29.890
 here is very bad because I myself 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:35.840
 sharpened a knife here to a very good sharpness 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:41.380
 which usually do not cause censures but 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.440
 after this knife opened 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.440
 tin 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:04.050
 the edge in general can be seen perfectly in 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:06.360
 overall along the entire length of the edge went to 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.350
 Unfortunately, I do not remember exactly under what 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.390
 under what was i pulling the knife but considering 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:20.070
 that here is very much the information that the angle i 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:20.460
 chose not very big very dumb corner 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.270
 took 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.010
 but still it happened so without 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.440
 micro supplies at that time I have not yet 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.570
 I could certainly try 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.540
 I'll probably peretachivat and maybe they 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:44.310
 I will because nobody asked me about 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:48.470
 this is generally such a knife and so wanted 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.470
 say probably if the characteristics 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:04:02.060
 honestly I donâ€™t know why 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:07.170
 length 25 centimeters blade length 13 4 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:10.220
 that's how your hands really lie comfortable 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:16.070
 have but in my opinion interesting forms 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.070
 I even count smth. 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:27.520
 on the steel is not very mildly I can 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.520
 show as a paramilitary singer 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.190
 leganza 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:49.590
 the knife is not my stress again 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.590
 I want to finish this
