can have a look what's inside what sort
of<00:00:19.199> stuff<00:00:19.380> would<00:00:19.500> get<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.130> whether

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
of stuff would get with it and whether

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.090 
of stuff would get with it and whether
it's<00:00:20.580> worth<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.330> extra<00:00:21.449> five<00:00:21.840> or<00:00:22.289> ten<00:00:22.680> pounds

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
it's worth the extra five or ten pounds

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.550 
it's worth the extra five or ten pounds
depending<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.580> where<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.789> get<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.060> now<00:00:24.900> if<00:00:25.410> you

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
depending on where you get it now if you

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.859 
depending on where you get it now if you
get<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:26.130> console<00:00:26.760> then<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:27.810> to

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
get this on console then it's going to

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.550 
get this on console then it's going to
cost<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.289> around<00:00:28.740> 50<00:00:29.609> pounds<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:31.320> that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
cost you around 50 pounds so it's that

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.340 
cost you around 50 pounds so it's that
worth<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.920> probably<00:00:32.279> not<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> pc<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
worth it probably not but on the pc and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.580 
worth it probably not but on the pc and
it's<00:00:35.190> only<00:00:35.370> about<00:00:35.430> 35<00:00:36.030> pounds<00:00:36.290> that<00:00:37.290> probably

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
it's only about 35 pounds that probably

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.860 
it's only about 35 pounds that probably
it<00:00:37.680> could<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:37.920> worth<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:39.180> let's<00:00:39.690> have<00:00:39.809> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
it could be worth it so let's have a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.049 
it could be worth it so let's have a
look<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.260> let's<00:00:40.500> find<00:00:40.739> out<00:00:40.890> ok<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.879> box

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
look and let's find out ok so the box

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.410 
look and let's find out ok so the box
itself<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.899> twice<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.410> width<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:45.059> normal

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
itself is twice the width of a normal

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.090 
itself is twice the width of a normal
case<00:00:46.430> it's<00:00:47.430> got<00:00:47.550> ass<00:00:47.670> nice<00:00:47.850> sleeve<00:00:48.920> let's<00:00:49.920> see

little thing to have so let this one is

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.250

probably<00:02:14.230> our<00:02:14.470> stuff<00:02:14.770> in<00:02:14.920> there<00:02:15.240> like<00:02:16.240> that

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.420 

put<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.380> back<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:22.750> finally<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:25.000> our<00:02:25.150> box

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
put that back then finally in our box

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.940 
put that back then finally in our box
we've<00:02:27.430> got<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.730> game<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:32.620> not<00:02:32.740> for

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
we've got the game so so it's not for

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.230 
we've got the game so so it's not for
sale<00:02:33.070> on<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.310> back<00:02:33.520> because<00:02:33.670> it's<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.030> join<00:02:34.210> a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
sale on the back because it's the join a

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.440 
sale on the back because it's the join a
dietician<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.680> then<00:02:35.860> inside<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:37.120> will<00:02:37.270> be<00:02:37.390> it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
dietician and then inside it will be it

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.150 
dietician and then inside it will be it
again<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.790> that's<00:02:39.790> about<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.330> think<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:41.650> is

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
again and that's about it I think so is

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.150 
again and that's about it I think so is
it<00:02:42.370> worth<00:02:42.520> getting<00:02:42.760> well<00:02:44.040> depends<00:02:45.040> whether

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
it worth getting well depends whether

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.449 
it worth getting well depends whether
you<00:02:45.370> want<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.730> little<00:02:46.600> goodies<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.459> that
