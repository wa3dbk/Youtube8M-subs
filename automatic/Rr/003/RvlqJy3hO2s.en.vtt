 I do not do that again 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.170
 I think everyone can think now 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.280
 how the whole thing works around that 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.870
 vehicle over and over again

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.170
 If he drives the vehicle then so 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.670

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.650
 Now a lot of money gets if you 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.570

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.950
 whole lot in the Bugatti gets you 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.230
