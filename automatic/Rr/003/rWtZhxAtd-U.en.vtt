this episode we're going to go through
how<00:00:22.730> to<00:00:22.760> make<00:00:22.910> a<00:00:23.300> figure<00:00:23.750> eight<00:00:23.990> connector<00:00:24.680> and

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
how to make a figure eight connector and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.060 
how to make a figure eight connector and
a<00:00:25.820> modified<00:00:26.270> figure<00:00:26.810> eight<00:00:26.930> connector<00:00:27.439> we<00:00:27.920> use

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
a modified figure eight connector we use

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.100 
a modified figure eight connector we use
the<00:00:28.250> modified<00:00:28.759> figure<00:00:29.210> eight<00:00:29.360> connector<00:00:29.869> in

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
the modified figure eight connector in

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.830 
the modified figure eight connector in
earrings<00:00:31.099> to<00:00:31.340> change<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.910> orientation<00:00:32.090> of

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
earrings to change the orientation of

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.380 
earrings to change the orientation of
the<00:00:32.960> way<00:00:33.079> the<00:00:33.260> earring<00:00:33.620> hangs<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.670> obviously

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
the way the earring hangs and obviously

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.819 
the way the earring hangs and obviously
we<00:00:35.570> use<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:35.840> regular<00:00:35.989> figure<00:00:36.530> eight<00:00:36.649> as<00:00:36.800> a

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
we use the regular figure eight as a

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.190 
we use the regular figure eight as a
connector<00:00:37.399> quite<00:00:37.760> often<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.720> connect<00:00:39.079> to

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
connector quite often to connect to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.740 
connector quite often to connect to
chain<00:00:39.470> two<00:00:39.680> a<00:00:39.710> clasp<00:00:40.070> or<00:00:40.399> connect<00:00:41.180> components

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
chain two a clasp or connect components

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.139 
chain two a clasp or connect components
imaging<00:00:42.280> we're<00:00:43.280> going<00:00:43.399> to<00:00:43.460> start<00:00:43.730> by<00:00:43.940> making

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
imaging we're going to start by making

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.940 
imaging we're going to start by making
just<00:00:44.540> a<00:00:44.660> regular<00:00:45.020> figure<00:00:45.320> eight<00:00:45.469> connector

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
just a regular figure eight connector

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.669 
just a regular figure eight connector
and<00:00:46.219> we<00:00:46.670> do<00:00:46.880> that<00:00:47.120> with<00:00:47.839> a<00:00:47.870> straight<00:00:48.050> sec<00:00:48.500> than

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
and we do that with a straight sec than

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.040 
and we do that with a straight sec than
a<00:00:48.710> wire<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.309> around<00:00:50.239> those<00:00:50.449> pliers

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
a wire and around those pliers

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.900 
a wire and around those pliers
and<00:00:51.260> we're<00:00:51.829> going<00:00:52.010> to<00:00:52.070> begin<00:00:52.339> we're<00:00:52.820> gonna

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
and we're going to begin we're gonna

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.579 
and we're going to begin we're gonna
make<00:00:53.149> slightly<00:00:53.480> larger<00:00:54.109> figure<00:00:54.440> eight

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
make slightly larger figure eight

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.229 
make slightly larger figure eight
connector<00:00:54.980> than<00:00:55.160> we<00:00:55.280> normally<00:00:55.429> would<00:00:55.820> but<00:00:56.059> we

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
connector than we normally would but we

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.619 
connector than we normally would but we
begin<00:00:56.600> by<00:00:56.780> making<00:00:56.929> the<00:00:57.230> loop<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:58.129> wire

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
begin by making the loop and the wire

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.720 
begin by making the loop and the wire
and<00:00:59.629> we<00:00:59.780> just<00:00:59.989> want<00:01:00.199> to<00:01:00.260> push<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:00.679> wire<00:01:00.890> up<00:01:01.399> and

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
and we just want to push the wire up and

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.720 
and we just want to push the wire up and
over<00:01:02.449> to<00:01:03.079> make<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:03.440> regular<00:01:03.739> feed<00:01:04.400> loop<00:01:05.470> and<00:01:06.730> the

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
over to make a regular feed loop and the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.380 
over to make a regular feed loop and the
pilas<00:01:08.120> looks<00:01:08.360> like<00:01:08.600> that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
pilas looks like that

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.170 
pilas looks like that
now<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:12.620> second<00:01:13.070> loop<00:01:13.250> we're<00:01:13.790> going<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:14.000> make

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
now the second loop we're going to make

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.360 
now the second loop we're going to make
in<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.510> figure<00:01:14.840> eight<00:01:14.990> connector<00:01:15.500> we're

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
in the figure eight connector we're

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.450 
in the figure eight connector we're
going<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:16.670> make<00:01:16.850> in<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:18.590> opposite<00:01:19.100> direction

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
going to make in the opposite direction

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.890 
going to make in the opposite direction
so<00:01:19.610> we're<00:01:19.850> going<00:01:19.970> to<00:01:20.060> grip<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.420> wire<00:01:20.570> like

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
so we're going to grip the wire like

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.100 
so we're going to grip the wire like
that<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:22.130> we're<00:01:22.700> gonna<00:01:22.790> push<00:01:23.150> this<00:01:23.450> wire<00:01:23.810> up

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
that and we're gonna push this wire up

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.560 
that and we're gonna push this wire up
and<00:01:25.450> over<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:28.610> jaws<00:01:28.880> of<00:01:28.910> the<00:01:29.120> pliers<00:01:29.180> are

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
and over and the jaws of the pliers are

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.750 
and over and the jaws of the pliers are
kinda<00:01:29.960> in<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.110> way<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:30.350> we<00:01:30.800> can't<00:01:31.070> finish<00:01:31.400> this

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
kinda in the way so we can't finish this

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.550 
kinda in the way so we can't finish this
as<00:01:32.000> we'd<00:01:32.780> like<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.140> so<00:01:33.290> we're<00:01:33.410> going<00:01:33.500> to

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
as we'd like to so we're going to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.880 
as we'd like to so we're going to
reorient<00:01:33.980> it<00:01:34.310> like<00:01:35.060> that<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:35.710> then<00:01:36.710> we're

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
reorient it like that and then we're

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.500 
reorient it like that and then we're
going<00:01:37.010> to<00:01:37.070> pull<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.670> wire<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.060> rest<00:01:38.240> of<00:01:38.450> the

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
going to pull the wire the rest of the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.840 
going to pull the wire the rest of the
way<00:01:38.630> around<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:39.230> complete<00:01:39.680> our<00:01:39.950> figure<00:01:40.670> eight

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
way around to complete our figure eight

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.560 
way around to complete our figure eight
and<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.840> figure<00:01:42.110> eight<00:01:42.230> looks<00:01:42.470> like<00:01:42.650> that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.660 

when<00:01:47.570> it's<00:01:47.750> removed<00:01:47.930> from<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.920> pliers<00:01:49.250> it

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
when it's removed from the pliers it

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.180 
when it's removed from the pliers it
looks<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:52.180> now<00:01:53.180> we<00:01:53.240> need<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.780> cut<00:01:54.190> the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
looks like that now we need to cut the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.740 
looks like that now we need to cut the
figure<00:01:55.520> eight<00:01:55.640> connector<00:01:56.150> so<00:01:56.360> we're<00:01:56.510> going<00:01:56.690> to

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
figure eight connector so we're going to

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.900 
figure eight connector so we're going to
use<00:01:56.900> our<00:01:57.080> flush<00:01:57.380> cutter<00:01:59.680> and<00:02:00.680> we<00:02:01.250> orient<00:02:01.760> our

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
use our flush cutter and we orient our

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.090 
use our flush cutter and we orient our
flush<00:02:02.180> cutter<00:02:02.510> with<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.960> flat<00:02:03.260> side<00:02:03.830> of<00:02:04.070> the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
flush cutter with the flat side of the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.210 
flush cutter with the flat side of the
flush<00:02:04.430> cutter<00:02:04.760> towards<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.330> finished<00:02:05.660> piece

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
flush cutter towards the finished piece

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.680 
flush cutter towards the finished piece
so<00:02:07.220> it's<00:02:07.400> going<00:02:07.550> to<00:02:07.640> be<00:02:07.760> oriented<00:02:08.209> just<00:02:08.479> like

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
so it's going to be oriented just like

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.430 
so it's going to be oriented just like
that<00:02:11.019> and<00:02:12.099> we're<00:02:13.099> just<00:02:13.250> going<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.489> cut

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
that and we're just going to cut

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.510 
that and we're just going to cut
and<00:02:15.680> that's<00:02:16.220> our<00:02:16.550> figure-eight<00:02:17.120> connector<00:02:18.520> in

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
and that's our figure-eight connector in

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.640 
and that's our figure-eight connector in
order<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:20.000> connect<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:21.200> figure-eight

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
order to connect that figure-eight

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.890 
order to connect that figure-eight
connector<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.490> chain<00:02:23.500> we<00:02:24.500> use<00:02:25.570> our<00:02:26.570> bent

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
connector to a chain we use our bent

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.610 
connector to a chain we use our bent
chain<00:02:27.110> nose<00:02:27.170> pliers<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:29.110> I'm<00:02:30.110> going<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.440> open

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
chain nose pliers and I'm going to open

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.650 
chain nose pliers and I'm going to open
the<00:02:31.070> loop<00:02:31.280> by<00:02:31.760> twisting<00:02:32.240> it<00:02:32.390> up<00:02:32.570> like<00:02:32.930> that

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.230 

connect<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.320> chain<00:02:40.840> like<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.880> close

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
connect the chain like that and close

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.890 
connect the chain like that and close
the<00:02:44.630> loop<00:02:45.280> by<00:02:46.280> twisting<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.970> in<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.360> opposite

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
the loop by twisting it in the opposite

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.800 
the loop by twisting it in the opposite
direction<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:49.940> can<00:02:50.120> give<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.540> squeeze

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
direction and you can give it a squeeze

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.750 
direction and you can give it a squeeze
with<00:02:51.110> your<00:02:51.140> chain<00:02:51.710> nose<00:02:51.740> pliers<00:02:52.190> like<00:02:52.490> that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
with your chain nose pliers like that

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.450 
with your chain nose pliers like that
but<00:02:53.720> that's<00:02:53.990> our<00:02:54.380> figure<00:02:54.770> eight<00:02:54.950> connector

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
but that's our figure eight connector

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.770 
but that's our figure eight connector
and<00:02:55.670> that's<00:02:55.760> how<00:02:55.970> we<00:02:56.030> could<00:02:56.330> make<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.540> figure

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
and that's how we could make a figure

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.600 
and that's how we could make a figure
eight<00:02:56.990> connector<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.560> use<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:57.980> connect<00:02:58.310> a

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
eight connector and use it to connect a

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.450 
eight connector and use it to connect a
clasp<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.780> chain<00:03:00.110> or<00:03:00.320> two<00:03:00.620> components<00:03:01.220> on<00:03:01.430> a

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
clasp to a chain or two components on a

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.220 
clasp to a chain or two components on a
chain<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.420> next<00:03:02.660> thing<00:03:02.840> we're<00:03:02.990> going<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.170> make

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
chain the next thing we're going to make

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.490 
chain the next thing we're going to make
is<00:03:03.590> our<00:03:03.740> modified<00:03:04.190> figure<00:03:04.640> eight<00:03:04.820> connector

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
that I can complete the loop and I have

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.040 
that I can complete the loop and I have
my<00:03:28.370> regular<00:03:28.820> P<00:03:29.330> loop<00:03:29.600> like<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:31.720> now<00:03:32.720> I'm

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
my regular P loop like that now I'm

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.070 
my regular P loop like that now I'm
gonna<00:03:33.170> use<00:03:33.260> my<00:03:33.620> bent<00:03:33.890> chain<00:03:34.160> nose<00:03:34.220> pliers<00:03:35.080> to

that's my modified figure 8 connector
and<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:13.490> changes<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.090> orientation<00:05:14.240> if<00:05:14.930> you

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
and it changes the orientation if you

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.510 
and it changes the orientation if you
were<00:05:15.110> hanging<00:05:15.290> in<00:05:15.530> here<00:05:15.710> it<00:05:16.070> would<00:05:16.190> change<00:05:16.400> the

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
were hanging in here it would change the

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.820 
were hanging in here it would change the
orientation<00:05:16.760> of<00:05:17.360> an<00:05:17.479> earring<00:05:17.750> so<00:05:18.410> that's<00:05:18.650> how

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
orientation of an earring so that's how

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.030 
orientation of an earring so that's how
we<00:05:18.890> make<00:05:19.220> a<00:05:19.490> figure<00:05:20.180> 8<00:05:20.330> connector<00:05:20.979> like<00:05:21.979> this

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
we make a figure 8 connector like this

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.580 
we make a figure 8 connector like this
or<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:22.910> modified<00:05:23.450> figure<00:05:23.870> in<00:05:23.990> connector<00:05:24.440> like

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
or a modified figure in connector like

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.830 
or a modified figure in connector like
them
