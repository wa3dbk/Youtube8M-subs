00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
so just we're just going to dive into

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:56.340 
so just we're just going to dive into
the<00:00:52.769> wonderful<00:00:53.769> world<00:00:54.100> of<00:00:54.639> technique<00:00:55.179> ok<00:00:55.809> so

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
the wonderful world of technique ok so

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.989 
the wonderful world of technique ok so
this<00:00:56.499> is<00:00:56.709> the<00:00:56.829> free<00:00:57.069> stroke<00:00:57.339> stroke<00:00:57.670> it's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:57.999 
this is the free stroke stroke it's

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:00.239 
this is the free stroke stroke it's
called<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:58.269> free<00:00:58.449> stroke<00:00:58.719> ok<00:00:59.289> and<00:00:59.859> the<00:01:00.039> way

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:00.249 
called the free stroke ok and the way

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:04.470 
called the free stroke ok and the way
you<00:01:00.309> get<00:01:00.579> into<00:01:00.879> it<00:01:01.030> is<00:01:02.459> ok<00:01:03.459> let's<00:01:03.699> find<00:01:04.360> the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
you get into it is ok let's find the

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.210 
you get into it is ok let's find the
fulcrum<00:01:05.230> or<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.500> balance<00:01:05.830> point<00:01:05.890> of<00:01:06.160> the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
fulcrum or the balance point of the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.980 
fulcrum or the balance point of the
stick<00:01:06.460> pivot<00:01:07.330> point<00:01:07.600> of<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.900> stake<00:01:09.720> ok<00:01:10.720> yeah

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
stick pivot point of the stake ok yeah

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.110 
stick pivot point of the stake ok yeah
so<00:01:11.320> if<00:01:11.440> you're<00:01:11.560> holding<00:01:11.830> too<00:01:11.980> far<00:01:12.190> back<00:01:12.370> it's

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
so if you're holding too far back it's

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.430 
so if you're holding too far back it's
going<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.300> die<00:01:13.890> too<00:01:14.890> far<00:01:15.130> forward<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:17.320> know

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
going to die too far forward you know

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.310 
going to die too far forward you know
you<00:01:17.950> don't<00:01:18.070> have<00:01:18.160> enough<00:01:18.490> leverage<00:01:18.730> and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
you don't have enough leverage and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.900 
you don't have enough leverage and
you're<00:01:20.320> not<00:01:20.440> getting<00:01:20.740> much<00:01:21.100> rebound<00:01:21.610> so<00:01:21.820> the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
you're not getting much rebound so the

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.420 
you're not getting much rebound so the
whole<00:01:22.030> point<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.360> this<00:01:22.480> is<00:01:22.690> we're<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:24.340> to

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
whole point of this is we're going to

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.040 
whole point of this is we're going to
let<00:01:24.610> gravity<00:01:24.910> and<00:01:25.360> rebound<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:27.390> nature<00:01:28.390> do<00:01:28.870> as

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
let gravity and rebound and nature do as

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.240 
let gravity and rebound and nature do as
much<00:01:29.230> of<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.440> work<00:01:29.590> for<00:01:29.890> us<00:01:29.920> okay<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.570> okay<00:01:31.960> so

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
much of the work for us okay so okay so

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.710 
much of the work for us okay so okay so
free<00:01:33.250> Stokes<00:01:33.520> so<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.760> way<00:01:33.880> you<00:01:33.910> get<00:01:34.120> into<00:01:34.390> ok

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
free Stokes so the way you get into ok

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.840 
free Stokes so the way you get into ok
found<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.830> user<00:01:36.430> little<00:01:36.910> middle<00:01:37.120> finger<00:01:38.850> to

found the user little middle finger to

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.990 
found the user little middle finger to
find<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:40.540> balance<00:01:41.500> point<00:01:41.740> ok<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.640> lightly

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
find that balance point ok and lightly

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.590 
find that balance point ok and lightly

like for that stick to rebound right so

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.570 
like for that stick to rebound right so
so<00:02:24.840> now<00:02:25.050> now<00:02:25.650> what<00:02:25.830> we<00:02:25.980> do<00:02:26.100> for<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.340> free

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
so now now what we do for the free

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.810 
so now now what we do for the free
stroke<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:28.350> just<00:02:28.920> generated<00:02:29.520> from<00:02:29.610> your

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
stroke is it just generated from your

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.150 
stroke is it just generated from your
wrist<00:02:30.000> here<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:31.230> you're<00:02:31.470> trying<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.920> stay<00:02:32.130> out

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
of the way of that rebound as much as

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.710 
of the way of that rebound as much as
you<00:02:35.010> can<00:02:35.190> with<00:02:35.520> your<00:02:35.750> your<00:02:36.750> wrist<00:02:37.910> okay<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.540> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
you can with your your wrist okay so the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.630 
you can with your your wrist okay so the
way<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.200> know<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:40.740> you're<00:02:41.190> staying<00:02:41.430> out<00:02:41.610> of

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
way you know that you're staying out of

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.260 
way you know that you're staying out of
that<00:02:41.760> way<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.660> stick<00:02:43.590> rebounding<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.340> that

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
that way of the stick rebounding is that

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.440 
that way of the stick rebounding is that
the<00:02:45.420> stick<00:02:45.630> will<00:02:45.810> should<00:02:46.020> be<00:02:46.140> vibrated<00:02:46.770> and

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
the stick will should be vibrated and

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.490 
the stick will should be vibrated and
and<00:02:49.670> your<00:02:50.670> stick<00:02:50.880> also<00:02:51.240> makes<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.780> sound<00:02:52.200> a

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
and your stick also makes it a sound a

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.650 
and your stick also makes it a sound a
nice<00:02:52.920> pingy<00:02:53.250> type<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.820> woody<00:02:54.030> sound<00:02:54.330> okay

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
nice pingy type of woody sound okay

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.070 
nice pingy type of woody sound okay
that's<00:02:55.530> not<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.770> stick<00:02:56.130> vibrating<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.930> this

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
that's not the stick vibrating and this

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.740 
that's not the stick vibrating and this
is<00:02:58.260> really<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.280> this<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.210> a<00:03:00.240> great<00:03:00.510> way<00:03:00.690> to

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
is really this is this is a great way to

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.550 
is really this is this is a great way to
get<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.110> tone<00:03:02.600> good<00:03:03.600> tone<00:03:03.870> out<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:04.110> your<00:03:04.290> drums

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
get the tone good tone out of your drums

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.860 
get the tone good tone out of your drums
because<00:03:04.770> when<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.100> when<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.790> bunch<00:03:06.750> of

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
because when you when you a bunch of

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.400 
because when you when you a bunch of
stuff<00:03:06.930> happens<00:03:07.440> when<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.710> squid<00:03:08.190> yeah<00:03:09.980> yeah

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
stuff happens when you squid yeah yeah

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.620 
stuff happens when you squid yeah yeah
RR<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:17.250> when<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:17.910> stay<00:03:18.090> out<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.330> way<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.570> the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
RR so when you stay out the way of the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.440 
RR so when you stay out the way of the
stick<00:03:18.870> you're<00:03:19.680> letting<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:20.209> energy<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.330> the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
stick you're letting that energy of the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:30.430 
stick you're letting that energy of the
steak<00:03:25.400> express<00:03:26.400> itself<00:03:26.840> by<00:03:28.340> rebounding<00:03:29.340> and

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
steak express itself by rebounding and

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.260 
steak express itself by rebounding and
say<00:03:31.440> there's<00:03:31.770> no<00:03:31.980> way<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.220> can<00:03:32.520> you<00:03:33.030> can't

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
say there's no way you can you can't

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.140 
say there's no way you can you can't
move<00:03:33.450> your<00:03:33.660> wrists<00:03:34.170> step<00:03:34.380> past<00:03:34.650> okay<00:03:35.340> there's

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
move your wrists step past okay there's

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.320 
move your wrists step past okay there's
just<00:03:36.390> no<00:03:36.840> way<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.050> can<00:03:37.370> go<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.580> fast<00:03:38.820> that

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
just no way you can go that fast that

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.640 
just no way you can go that fast that
far<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:39.989> one<00:03:40.140> of<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.350> things<00:03:40.410> that's

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
far so one of the things that's

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.040 
far so one of the things that's
happening<00:03:41.070> is<00:03:41.220> by<00:03:41.400> staying<00:03:41.610> on<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.940> way<00:03:42.060> at

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
happening is by staying on the way at

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.610 
happening is by staying on the way at
that<00:03:43.320> probably<00:03:43.980> maybe<00:03:44.600> you<00:03:45.600> know<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.900> last<00:03:46.110> 30

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
that probably maybe you know the last 30

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.590 
that probably maybe you know the last 30
to<00:03:47.239> 20<00:03:48.239> degrees<00:03:48.390> of<00:03:48.900> your<00:03:49.580> of<00:03:50.580> that<00:03:50.910> stick

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
to 20 degrees of your of that stick

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.040 
to 20 degrees of your of that stick
rebound<00:03:52.370> it's<00:03:53.370> assisting<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.450> momentum<00:03:54.930> of

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
rebound it's assisting the momentum of

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.280 
rebound it's assisting the momentum of
the<00:03:55.200> stick<00:03:55.440> is<00:03:55.620> assisting<00:03:56.190> your<00:03:56.690> your<00:03:57.690> muscles

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
into getting into that striking position

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.240 
into getting into that striking position
okay

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
okay

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.680

beats a minute or two of this probably

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.970 
beats a minute or two of this probably
20,000<00:04:48.970> times<00:04:49.180> you<00:04:49.900> know<00:04:49.990> what<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:50.140> mean<00:04:50.260> so

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
20,000 times you know what I mean so

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.100 
20,000 times you know what I mean so
that's<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.430> lot<00:04:51.640> of<00:04:51.669> repetition<00:04:52.150> and<00:04:52.780> if<00:04:52.900> you're

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
that's a lot of repetition and if you're

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.790 
that's a lot of repetition and if you're
absorbing<00:04:53.530> all<00:04:53.890> that<00:04:54.100> energy<00:04:54.330> your<00:04:55.620> for<00:04:56.620> one

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
absorbing all that energy your for one

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.120 
absorbing all that energy your for one
thing<00:04:57.010> at<00:04:57.100> cost<00:04:57.700> energy<00:04:57.970> to<00:04:58.900> choke<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.890> stick

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
thing at cost energy to choke the stick

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.750 
thing at cost energy to choke the stick
and<00:05:00.600> then<00:05:01.620> you<00:05:02.620> have<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:02.890> spend<00:05:03.250> more<00:05:03.580> energy

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
and then you have to spend more energy

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.400 
and then you have to spend more energy
and<00:05:04.090> bring<00:05:04.480> it<00:05:04.600> up<00:05:04.690> into<00:05:04.960> that<00:05:05.080> striking

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
and bring it up into that striking

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.700 
and bring it up into that striking
position<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.960> you<00:05:07.960> know<00:05:08.080> at<00:05:08.200> the<00:05:08.320> same<00:05:08.500> time

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
position and you know at the same time

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.050 
position and you know at the same time
you're<00:05:10.200> entering<00:05:11.200> you<00:05:12.040> know<00:05:12.070> potentially

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
you're entering you know potentially

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.450 
you're entering you know potentially
injure<00:05:13.419> yourself<00:05:13.540> and<00:05:13.930> potato<00:05:14.200> blisters<00:05:15.130> or

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
injure yourself and potato blisters or

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.540 
injure yourself and potato blisters or
whatever<00:05:16.590> okay<00:05:18.600> okay<00:05:19.860> okay<00:05:20.860> so<00:05:21.160> now<00:05:21.310> you<00:05:21.430> just

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
whatever okay okay okay so now you just

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.420 
whatever okay okay okay so now you just
then<00:05:22.419> that<00:05:22.600> stick<00:05:22.840> mouse<00:05:23.020> back<00:05:23.290> up<00:05:23.500> filling<00:05:24.340> a

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
then that stick mouse back up filling a

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.380 
then that stick mouse back up filling a
vibration<00:05:26.160> and<00:05:27.160> then<00:05:27.370> stick<00:05:27.610> vibrate<00:05:28.090> really

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
vibration and then stick vibrate really

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.770 
vibration and then stick vibrate really
good<00:05:29.370> I'm<00:05:30.370> just<00:05:30.580> trying<00:05:30.850> to<00:05:30.880> stay<00:05:31.150> away<00:05:31.750> from

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
good I'm just trying to stay away from

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.230 
good I'm just trying to stay away from
it<00:05:32.169> as<00:05:32.320> much<00:05:32.710> as<00:05:32.740> possible<00:05:32.950> it<00:05:33.669> was<00:05:33.850> like<00:05:33.970> you

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
it as much as possible it was like you

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.630 
it as much as possible it was like you
know<00:05:34.390> bouncing<00:05:34.900> a<00:05:34.960> ball<00:05:35.140> no<00:05:35.919> ball<00:05:36.100> comes<00:05:36.430> up

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
know bouncing a ball no ball comes up

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.110 
know bouncing a ball no ball comes up
you're<00:05:37.240> not<00:05:37.419> like<00:05:37.870> stiff<00:05:38.200> right<00:05:38.500> you<00:05:39.460> know<00:05:39.610> you

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
you're not like stiff right you know you

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.300 
you're not like stiff right you know you
let<00:05:40.330> that<00:05:40.540> ball<00:05:40.780> bring<00:05:41.350> it<00:05:41.470> bitch<00:05:42.010> you<00:05:42.220> know

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
let that ball bring it bitch you know

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.740 
let that ball bring it bitch you know
it's<00:05:42.640> part<00:05:42.820> of<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:42.970> rhythm<00:05:43.330> of<00:05:43.450> the<00:05:43.600> whole

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
it's part of the rhythm of the whole

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.390 
it's part of the rhythm of the whole
thing

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.620 

that<00:05:47.820> now<00:05:49.520> ball<00:05:50.520> bouncing<00:05:51.030> basically<00:05:51.449> here

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
that now ball bouncing basically here

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
hand first say just look at my hair

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.800 
hand first say just look at my hair
while<00:06:16.949> I<00:06:17.009> do<00:06:17.130> this<00:06:20.180> it's<00:06:21.180> almost<00:06:21.449> like<00:06:21.630> the

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
while I do this it's almost like the

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.510 
while I do this it's almost like the
stick<00:06:22.050> leaves<00:06:22.320> my<00:06:22.590> hand<00:06:22.860> you<00:06:23.280> know<00:06:23.400> what<00:06:23.490> I

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
stick leaves my hand you know what I

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.240 
stick leaves my hand you know what I
mean<00:06:23.639> because<00:06:24.330> that's<00:06:25.139> almost<00:06:25.710> what<00:06:25.949> you<00:06:26.070> got

to do I mean I say almost is that it you
know<00:06:29.280> the<00:06:29.430> only<00:06:29.550> thing<00:06:29.639> that's<00:06:29.940> really

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
know the only thing that's really

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.540 
know the only thing that's really
touching<00:06:30.449> it<00:06:30.750> is<00:06:30.870> that<00:06:31.080> these<00:06:32.039> two<00:06:32.310> fingers

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
touching it is that these two fingers

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.060 
touching it is that these two fingers
right<00:06:32.850> here<00:06:35.030> and<00:06:36.030> the<00:06:36.210> that's<00:06:36.840> how<00:06:37.560> you<00:06:37.620> let

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
right here and the that's how you let

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.800 
right here and the that's how you let
that<00:06:38.100> stick<00:06:39.169> expend<00:06:40.169> all<00:06:40.320> of<00:06:40.500> its<00:06:40.650> energy<00:06:41.810> that

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
that stick expend all of its energy that

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.480 
that stick expend all of its energy that
vibration<00:06:45.380> and<00:06:46.380> then<00:06:46.830> we<00:06:46.949> just<00:06:47.160> want<00:06:47.310> to<00:06:47.400> get

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
vibration and then we just want to get

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.820 
vibration and then we just want to get
to<00:06:47.610> the<00:06:47.669> top<00:06:47.880> you<00:06:47.910> just<00:06:48.180> squeeze<00:06:48.449> about<00:06:48.750> you

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:58.990 

all<00:06:52.830> right<00:06:53.510> so<00:06:54.510> yeah<00:06:54.720> real<00:06:55.500> loose<00:06:55.740> loose<00:06:56.460> grip

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.960 

lots<00:07:00.000> of<00:07:00.120> relaxation<00:07:00.449> and<00:07:01.430> you'll<00:07:02.430> get<00:07:02.639> it<00:07:02.760> all

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
lots of relaxation and you'll get it all

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.659 
lots of relaxation and you'll get it all
right<00:07:03.750> let<00:07:04.530> that<00:07:04.710> stick<00:07:04.949> balance<00:07:05.280> for<00:07:05.460> itself

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 
right let that stick balance for itself

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:08.990 
right let that stick balance for itself
