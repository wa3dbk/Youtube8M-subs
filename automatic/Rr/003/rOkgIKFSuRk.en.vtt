00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
shouldn't I be in front too long she

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.180

wasn't<00:02:49.330> quite<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.540> long<00:02:49.660> time<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.160> other

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
wasn't quite a long time and the other

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.740 
wasn't quite a long time and the other
horse<00:02:51.550> when<00:02:51.730> he<00:02:51.760> got<00:02:51.910> motoring<00:02:52.330> he<00:02:52.390> needs<00:02:52.570> it

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
horse when he got motoring he needs it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.510 
horse when he got motoring he needs it
hard<00:02:52.960> horse<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.260> beat<00:02:53.440> there<00:02:54.250> wouldn't<00:02:54.430> be<00:02:54.460> a

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
hard horse to beat there wouldn't be a

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.740 
hard horse to beat there wouldn't be a
lot<00:02:54.550> between<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.030> two<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.240> them<00:02:55.360> really<00:02:55.600> I

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
lot between the two of them really I

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.290 
lot between the two of them really I
think<00:02:56.170> um<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.680> wouldn't<00:02:57.400> know<00:02:57.550> I'd<00:02:57.880> love<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.180> see

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
think um I wouldn't know I'd love to see

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.030 
think um I wouldn't know I'd love to see
them<00:02:58.390> both<00:02:58.510> dead<00:02:58.750> heat<00:02:58.960> obviously<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.710> rather

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
them both dead heat obviously a rather

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.910 
them both dead heat obviously a rather
they<00:03:00.970> dead<00:03:01.150> heat<00:03:01.300> for<00:03:01.450> first<00:03:01.840> place<00:03:02.020> wrong

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
they dead heat for first place wrong

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.060 
they dead heat for first place wrong
third<00:03:03.340> yeah<00:03:04.120> but<00:03:07.470> we<00:03:08.470> just<00:03:08.500> see<00:03:08.740> what<00:03:08.830> happens

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
third yeah but we just see what happens

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.160 
third yeah but we just see what happens
and<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.760> plan<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.180> see<00:03:10.450> them<00:03:10.630> both<00:03:10.840> in<00:03:11.020> the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
and the plan is to see them both in the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.810 
and the plan is to see them both in the
the<00:03:11.500> champion<00:03:11.890> stakes<00:03:12.250> yeah<00:03:12.520> I<00:03:12.550> think<00:03:12.640> they

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
the champion stakes yeah I think they

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.040 
the champion stakes yeah I think they
both<00:03:12.940> deserve<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.330> take<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.540> chance<00:03:13.810> because

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
both deserve to take the chance because

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.620 
both deserve to take the chance because
I<00:03:14.170> mean<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.410> know<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.970> say<00:03:16.150> we'd<00:03:16.270> probably<00:03:16.450> be

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
I mean you know I say we'd probably be

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.140 
I mean you know I say we'd probably be
maybe<00:03:17.020> his<00:03:17.170> last<00:03:17.320> race<00:03:17.620> he<00:03:18.610> went<00:03:18.790> beyond<00:03:19.090> the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
maybe his last race he went beyond the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.000 
maybe his last race he went beyond the
dearth<00:03:19.360> in<00:03:19.510> America<00:03:19.960> I<00:03:20.410> don't<00:03:20.620> think<00:03:20.860> it's

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
dearth in America I don't think it's

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.190 
dearth in America I don't think it's
fair<00:03:21.220> on<00:03:21.250> him<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:23.820> midday<00:03:24.820> will<00:03:25.210> be<00:03:25.330> gained<00:03:26.080> at

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
fair on him and midday will be gained at

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.240 
fair on him and midday will be gained at
probably<00:03:26.530> going<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.740> start<00:03:26.920> at<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.070> end<00:03:27.190> the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
probably going to start at the end the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.670 
probably going to start at the end the
year<00:03:27.280> she's<00:03:27.610> 5<00:03:27.820> now<00:03:28.110> actually<00:03:29.110> should<00:03:29.320> be<00:03:29.350> 6

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
year she's 5 now actually should be 6

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.200 
year she's 5 now actually should be 6
and<00:03:31.560> maybe<00:03:32.560> it's<00:03:32.890> her<00:03:33.070> last<00:03:33.250> race<00:03:33.550> I<00:03:33.850> mean<00:03:33.880> but

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
and maybe it's her last race I mean but

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.420 
and maybe it's her last race I mean but
no<00:03:34.480> we<00:03:35.170> leave<00:03:35.320> it<00:03:35.440> open<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:35.860> mean<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.010> mean<00:03:36.250> if<00:03:36.340> she

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
no we leave it open I mean I mean if she

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.310 
no we leave it open I mean I mean if she
was<00:03:36.520> terribly<00:03:36.790> well<00:03:36.940> in<00:03:36.970> herself<00:03:37.300> I<00:03:37.510> mean<00:03:37.630> she

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
was terribly well in herself I mean she

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.570
