00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
yeah this thing's really turning into a

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.280 
yeah this thing's really turning into a
piece<00:00:03.629> of<00:00:05.480> and<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.690> transmissions

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
piece of and the transmissions

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.250 
piece of and the transmissions
getting<00:00:07.560> worse<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.010> worse<00:00:08.189> every<00:00:08.370> time<00:00:09.260> for

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
getting worse and worse every time for

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.660 
getting worse and worse every time for
wondering<00:00:10.559> why<00:00:10.679> it's<00:00:10.830> bad<00:00:11.040> at<00:00:11.280> what<00:00:11.400> they<00:00:11.519> used

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
wondering why it's bad at what they used

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.250 
wondering why it's bad at what they used
to<00:00:11.759> not<00:00:11.880> be<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.269> bad<00:00:12.509> but<00:00:13.280> uh<00:00:15.109> one<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
to not be so bad but uh one of the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.230 
to not be so bad but uh one of the
friends<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.070> family<00:00:17.310> was<00:00:17.640> back<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.060> boat

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
friends of the family was back in a boat

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.580 
friends of the family was back in a boat
in<00:00:19.340> at<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.550> boat<00:00:20.730> ramp<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.300> he<00:00:22.170> backed<00:00:22.410> into

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
in at the boat ramp and he backed into

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.710 
in at the boat ramp and he backed into
far<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.369> got<00:00:23.609> water<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.060> transmission<00:00:24.570> we

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
far and got water in the transmission we

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.800 
far and got water in the transmission we
didn't<00:00:24.960> know<00:00:25.050> about<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.880> for<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> long<00:00:27.180> time<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
didn't know about it for a long time and

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.900 
didn't know about it for a long time and
we<00:00:28.019> only<00:00:28.140> drive<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.680> thing<00:00:28.859> maybe<00:00:29.099> once<00:00:29.789> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
we only drive this thing maybe once a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.550 
we only drive this thing maybe once a
month<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> weekends<00:00:30.840> or<00:00:30.929> twice<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> month

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
month on the weekends or twice a month

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.580 
month on the weekends or twice a month
maybe<00:00:31.890> three<00:00:32.219> times<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.550> month<00:00:32.870> so<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:33.899> we<00:00:34.440> had

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
maybe three times a month so we we had

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.630 
maybe three times a month so we we had
no<00:00:34.739> idea<00:00:34.770> there's<00:00:35.190> water<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
no idea there's water and the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.100 
no idea there's water and the
transmissions<00:00:36.149> until<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.630> started<00:00:36.809> acting

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
transmissions until it started acting

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.780 
transmissions until it started acting
funny<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:38.210> then<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:40.610> looked<00:00:41.610> at<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
funny and then we I looked at the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.610 
funny and then we I looked at the
transmission<00:00:42.329> fluid<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.350> looked<00:00:43.500> like

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
transmission fluid and it looked like

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.130 
transmission fluid and it looked like
pepto-bismol<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.450> was<00:00:45.570> terrible<00:00:46.020> and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
pepto-bismol and it was terrible and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.369 
pepto-bismol and it was terrible and
after<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.730> then<00:00:47.730> what<00:00:48.059> put<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> put<00:00:49.230> some

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
after that then what put the put some

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.060 
after that then what put the put some
fresh<00:00:49.590> fluid<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.050> ran<00:00:52.770> like

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
fresh fluid in it and it just ran like

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.000 
fresh fluid in it and it just ran like
crap<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.610> mean<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.879> thing<00:00:54.949> transmission<00:00:55.949> as

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
crap I mean this thing transmission as

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.229 
crap I mean this thing transmission as
far<00:00:56.160> as<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.309> transmission<00:00:56.640> go<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> motors

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
far as the transmission go the motors

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.580 
far as the transmission go the motors
really<00:00:57.539> good<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.780> carburetor<00:00:58.199> does<00:00:58.410> have

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
really good the carburetor does have

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.770 
really good the carburetor does have
kind<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.920> dead<00:00:59.100> spot<00:00:59.370> but<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.510> needs<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
kind of a dead spot but it just needs to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.740 
kind of a dead spot but it just needs to
be<00:01:00.870> rebuilt<00:01:01.340> it's<00:01:02.340> already<00:01:02.609> warmed<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.090> it'll

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
be rebuilt it's already warmed up it'll

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.450 
be rebuilt it's already warmed up it'll
start<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.049> up

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.850 

we<00:01:10.970> did<00:01:11.180> burn<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.420> ton<00:01:11.720> of<00:01:11.780> oil<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:12.380> I<00:01:12.470> started

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
we did burn a ton of oil and I started

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.070 
we did burn a ton of oil and I started
it<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.040> other<00:01:13.190> day<00:01:13.370> but<00:01:13.780> once<00:01:14.780> it's<00:01:14.930> been

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
it the other day but once it's been

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.590 
it the other day but once it's been
started<00:01:15.500> up<00:01:15.620> it<00:01:15.770> doesn't<00:01:16.300> it<00:01:17.300> doesn't<00:01:17.450> burn

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
started up it doesn't it doesn't burn

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:29.539 
started up it doesn't it doesn't burn
any<00:01:17.810> oil<00:01:18.020> anymore<00:01:18.880> it's<00:01:19.880> got<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.060> glass<00:01:20.240> back

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.830 

the<00:01:30.549> other<00:01:30.700> winch<00:01:30.909> is<00:01:31.090> no<00:01:31.240> good<00:01:31.450> when<00:01:31.689> you<00:01:31.750> have

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
the other winch is no good when you have

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.469 
the other winch is no good when you have
a<00:01:31.899> bad<00:01:32.079> transmission<00:01:32.740> you<00:01:32.829> can't<00:01:33.039> even<00:01:33.310> get<00:01:34.299> in

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
a bad transmission you can't even get in

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.529 
a bad transmission you can't even get in
any<00:01:34.630> kind<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.930> mud<00:01:35.969> hopefully<00:01:36.969> I<00:01:37.030> can<00:01:37.090> find<00:01:37.329> it

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
any kind of mud hopefully I can find it

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.719 
any kind of mud hopefully I can find it
transmission<00:01:38.110> it's<00:01:38.200> got<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.350> Chrysler<00:01:38.649> 77<00:01:39.579> if

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
transmission it's got a Chrysler 77 if

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:56.320 
transmission it's got a Chrysler 77 if
you<00:01:39.820> can<00:01:39.939> believe<00:01:40.060> that

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.120 

and<00:01:56.900> when<00:01:57.080> you<00:01:57.140> put<00:01:57.290> it<00:01:57.410> in<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.560> reverse<00:01:57.860> or

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
and when you put it in the reverse or

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.370 
and when you put it in the reverse or
drive<00:01:58.160> it<00:01:58.910> starts<00:01:59.270> making<00:01:59.570> this<00:01:59.690> marbles<00:02:00.230> and

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
drive it starts making this marbles and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.910 
drive it starts making this marbles and
a<00:02:00.470> can<00:02:00.770> sound<00:02:03.130> can't<00:02:04.130> really<00:02:04.310> hear<00:02:04.520> right<00:02:04.700> now

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
a can sound can't really hear right now

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.590 
a can sound can't really hear right now
but<00:02:06.920> if<00:02:07.010> you<00:02:07.100> leaks<00:02:07.550> fluid<00:02:07.910> if<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.090> have<00:02:08.240> fluid

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
but if you leaks fluid if you have fluid

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.580 
but if you leaks fluid if you have fluid
it<00:02:10.630> turn<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.780> bunch<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:11.990> times<00:02:12.200> no<00:02:12.380> power

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
it turn it a bunch of times no power

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.080 
it turn it a bunch of times no power
steering<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.860> add<00:02:15.980> fluid<00:02:16.340> it'll<00:02:16.700> run<00:02:16.850> better

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
steering the add fluid it'll run better

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.620 
steering the add fluid it'll run better
transmission<00:02:17.780> will<00:02:18.200> but<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:20.210> baton<00:02:20.480> whether

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
transmission will but the baton whether

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.700 
transmission will but the baton whether
I<00:02:20.720> should<00:02:20.780> put<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.050> little<00:02:21.290> bit<00:02:21.410> of<00:02:21.500> brake<00:02:21.680> fluid

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
I should put a little bit of brake fluid

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.170 
I should put a little bit of brake fluid
in<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.250> that's<00:02:22.400> what<00:02:22.520> somebody<00:02:22.850> told<00:02:22.970> me<00:02:23.120> I

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
in it that's what somebody told me I

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:31.360 
in it that's what somebody told me I
don't<00:02:23.450> know<00:02:23.570> about<00:02:23.840> that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.399 

but<00:02:31.970> this<00:02:32.120> motor<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.599> amazing<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.170> mean<00:02:33.200> it
