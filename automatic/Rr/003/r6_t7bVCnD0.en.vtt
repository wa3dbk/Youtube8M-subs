00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.979
 there is suggestive but you dear viewers 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.479

 strangers and pocket money 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.740
 or still confused the question with the console 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.340
 or mobile phones and many 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.140

 especially after 2,000 seven 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.800
 idea of launching a separate channel for 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.450
 the older viewer looking at slide 6 we 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.360
 can see the number of viewers who 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.790

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.680
 daily most of them on the seventh 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.320
 slide we will know when is best 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.750
 watch jetix after school or in the morning 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.240
 opinion was divided and the output watched our 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.700
 TV channel 8 slide shows us the time 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.010
 Watch jetix and watch for hours without 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.920
 stop or just an hour a day viewers 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.570
 asked to describe jetix in three words 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.940
 comic of course hurts the eyes and now 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.060
 still a rumor but you thought jetix cool 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.280
 exciting entertainment dear 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.110
 the audience asked why they do not want 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.480
 answered cartoons more and more 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.610
 least of all jetix viewers wanted 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.880
 living leading after such a result 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.680
 somewhere the course audience began to cry 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.790
 also asked want i not see 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.890
 music videos 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.820
 it is generally absurd in our opinion it is 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.520
 it's not their tivi 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.170
 Adventure adventures like that 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.870
 popular animated series 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.150
 displays 11 slide further became known 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.610
 if the viewer has access to cable tv on 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.860
 In the 13th slide we see the console issue. 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.000
 remember who in 2 thousand sixth were 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.070
 gaming consoles 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.720
 question about consoles suggesting these 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.489
 results and are great when 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.680
 channel collaboration with developers 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.470
 games and video studio playstation in high esteem 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.600
 at the viewer jetix a 14 slide shows 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.400
 us about having a mobile phone at 2 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.440
 Thousands of the sixth cell phones were not all 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.390
 but the voting result is positive 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.220
 it's good at advertising mobile games and 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.730
 programs with sending sms for short 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.220
 number 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.230
 and after all such advertising was on jetix r15 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.150
 question about your pockets money 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.130
 the manager knew where most of the children were 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.170

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.810
 buy CDs with games or spend 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.880
 money for ordinary toys 16 slide 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.010
 it's also not easy because managers are directly 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.959
 asked about your crucial condition but 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.280
 of course how else to answer 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.280

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.170
