00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 hi people today I want to talk about 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.550
 one small very simple function 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.800
 which nevertheless despite her 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.040
 simplicity and utility are few 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.460
 enjoy called this application 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.020
 text on a curved surface let's 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.750
 let's see how it really is 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.640
 easy and simple for us to start 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.580
 need to create a curved surface 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.390
 This can be done in different ways here 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:35.660
 I had already prepared myself here such of kizik 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:42.719
 such a sketch and make it now 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:45.110
 rotated grandmother like this 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:51.230
 the case is i have matte gold 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:57.109
 as the material chosen is death and let's 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:01.640
 let's make the text on its surface 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.640
 we choose for this front surface 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.479
 sketch and for starters 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.540
 draw a line 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.340
 where our text should generally be a line 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.310
 must be 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.189
 helper and push this one 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:29.420
 button text then choose our line 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:35.009
 and write anything like text 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.950
 text text text text here is very 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.329
 interesting functions like so if 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.930
 I will highlight some text 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.590
 some text or some click 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.270
 rotate here i can set the angle 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.040
 let's say i want 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.040
 50 degrees 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:32.760
 here so he will turn me on 50 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:36.350
 degrees too ugly looks here 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.950
 so click ok 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:48.890
 we leave from sketches now we go in 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.890
 do not select transfer item 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.130
 select this sketch which we only 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.630
 what did and here we have to highlight 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:13.260
 the surface we want 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:19.370
 stage is obtained select the protrusion cutout 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.370
 or mark up we want a ledge click ok 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.200
 independence over complexity of text washed out 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.739
 com history and see just such a picture 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.489
 such a beautiful feature is especially good 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.489
 are you holy 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.680
 eg 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.900
 what color 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.410
 that's all
