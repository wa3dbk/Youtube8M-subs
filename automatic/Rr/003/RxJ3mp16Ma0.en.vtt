this<00:03:30.270> team<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.990> formation<00:03:31.350> was<00:03:31.650> something

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
this team the formation was something

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.890 
this team the formation was something
i've<00:03:32.130> never<00:03:32.160> used<00:03:32.580> before<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.600> actually

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
i've never used before but it actually

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.590 
i've never used before but it actually
allowed<00:03:34.320> me<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:35.100> score<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.610> ton<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.000> goals<00:03:36.360> now<00:03:36.570> I

allowed me to score a ton of goals now I

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.350 
allowed me to score a ton of goals now I
did<00:03:36.930> lose<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.440> first<00:03:37.710> few<00:03:38.220> games<00:03:38.520> i<00:03:38.880> play<00:03:39.150> with

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
did lose the first few games i play with

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.670 
did lose the first few games i play with
semen<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.720> be<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> lot<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.230> get<00:03:40.320> used<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.560> because

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
semen to be a lot to get used to because

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.860 
semen to be a lot to get used to because
I<00:03:41.010> wasn't<00:03:41.490> familiar<00:03:41.730> with<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.150> formation<00:03:42.720> and

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
I wasn't familiar with the formation and

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.780 
I wasn't familiar with the formation and
I<00:03:42.900> did<00:03:43.110> struggle<00:03:43.380> but<00:03:44.100> once<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.400> got<00:03:44.520> used<00:03:44.580> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
I did struggle but once I got used to

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.630 
I did struggle but once I got used to
formation<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.510> realized<00:03:46.020> how<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.640> play

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
formation and I realized how to play

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.250 
formation and I realized how to play
with<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.910> actual<00:03:48.030> formation<00:03:48.600> it<00:03:48.840> was

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
with the actual formation it was

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.110 
with the actual formation it was
incredible<00:03:50.070> and<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.280> didn't<00:03:50.580> lose<00:03:50.730> an<00:03:51.030> entire

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
incredible and I didn't lose an entire

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.480 
incredible and I didn't lose an entire
game<00:03:51.720> once<00:03:51.960> I<00:03:52.080> picked<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:52.410> up<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.740> think<00:03:53.340> the

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
game once I picked it up I think the

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.520 
game once I picked it up I think the
first<00:03:53.700> three<00:03:54.060> games<00:03:54.210> I<00:03:54.510> did<00:03:54.750> actually<00:03:54.870> lose<00:03:55.140> or

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
first three games I did actually lose or

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.740 
first three games I did actually lose or
a<00:03:55.560> drew<00:03:55.920> one<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.220> them<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.520> then<00:03:57.180> after<00:03:57.600> that

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
a drew one of them and then after that

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.290 
a drew one of them and then after that
the<00:03:58.350> extra<00:03:58.890> eight<00:03:59.100> games<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.700> played<00:04:00.030> with<00:04:00.180> his

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
the extra eight games I played with his

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.810 
the extra eight games I played with his
team<00:04:00.510> i<00:04:00.720> won<00:04:01.380> or<00:04:01.710> drew<00:04:02.160> all<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.610> them<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.790> think

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
team i won or drew all of them I think

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.130 
team i won or drew all of them I think
only<00:04:03.120> had<00:04:03.300> two<00:04:03.480> drawers<00:04:03.720> as<00:04:03.840> well<00:04:03.990> which<00:04:04.110> is

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
only had two drawers as well which is

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.710 
only had two drawers as well which is
awesome<00:04:04.470> but<00:04:04.920> seriously<00:04:05.310> once<00:04:06.090> again<00:04:06.240> team

don't be scared if you struggle at start

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.850 
don't be scared if you struggle at start
because<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.420> formation<00:04:09.870> took<00:04:10.020> me<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.380> lot<00:04:10.800> to

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
because the formation took me a lot to

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.740 
because the formation took me a lot to
get<00:04:11.040> used<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.310> like<00:04:11.460> it's<00:04:11.730> something<00:04:12.300> that

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750

fun too
quite<00:04:28.520> similar<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.660> way<00:04:29.810> that<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.139> senior

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
quite similar to the way that the senior

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.379 
quite similar to the way that the senior
trailer<00:04:30.740> plates<00:04:31.040> obviously<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.910> senior<00:04:32.240> is<00:04:32.360> a

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
trailer plates obviously the senior is a

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.170 
trailer plates obviously the senior is a
hell<00:04:32.750> of<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:33.020> lot<00:04:33.170> taller<00:04:33.380> but<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:34.490> was<00:04:34.610> kind<00:04:35.000> of

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
hell of a lot taller but it was kind of

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.850 
hell of a lot taller but it was kind of
that<00:04:35.330> sort<00:04:35.630> of<00:04:35.690> place<00:04:35.870> time<00:04:36.139> I<00:04:36.170> used<00:04:36.530> again<00:04:36.830> and

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
that sort of place time I used again and

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.159 
that sort of place time I used again and
it<00:04:37.100> was<00:04:37.370> really<00:04:37.820> really<00:04:38.000> cool<00:04:38.210> but<00:04:38.810> Clarence

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
it was really really cool but Clarence

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.129 
it was really really cool but Clarence
Adolf<00:04:39.650> was<00:04:39.830> so<00:04:40.160> so<00:04:40.550> strong<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.720> fact<00:04:42.020> that

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
Adolf was so so strong and the fact that

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.320 
Adolf was so so strong and the fact that
he<00:04:42.320> was<00:04:42.440> a<00:04:42.500> little<00:04:42.860> bit<00:04:42.980> slower<00:04:43.220> in<00:04:43.520> that

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
he was a little bit slower in that

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.240 
he was a little bit slower in that
Center<00:04:44.810> attack<00:04:45.020> my<00:04:45.169> position<00:04:45.560> didn't

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
Center attack my position didn't

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.310 
Center attack my position didn't
actually<00:04:46.400> make<00:04:46.669> any<00:04:47.000> effect<00:04:47.540> at<00:04:47.690> all<00:04:47.840> like<00:04:48.110> i

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
actually make any effect at all like i

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.230 
actually make any effect at all like i
was<00:04:48.919> a<00:04:48.950> little<00:04:49.160> bit<00:04:49.310> worried<00:04:49.610> having<00:04:50.060> a

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
was a little bit worried having a

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.970 
was a little bit worried having a
stellar<00:04:50.810> play<00:04:51.080> in<00:04:51.230> that<00:04:51.350> position<00:04:51.500> because<00:04:51.800> i

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
stellar play in that position because i

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.300 
stellar play in that position because i
think<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.460> player<00:04:52.790> like<00:04:52.910> Bernard<00:04:53.389> works

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
think a player like Bernard works

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.440 
think a player like Bernard works
incredible<00:04:55.310> in<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:55.610> position<00:04:55.790> like<00:04:56.120> because

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
incredible in that position like because

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.150 
incredible in that position like because
he's<00:04:56.600> so<00:04:56.720> fast<00:04:56.990> it<00:04:57.410> works<00:04:57.710> so<00:04:57.889> well<00:04:57.919> but

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
he's so fast it works so well but

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.710 
he's so fast it works so well but
currents<00:04:58.550> it's<00:04:58.669> a<00:04:58.760> lot<00:04:59.030> slower<00:04:59.210> than<00:04:59.419> blood

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
currents it's a lot slower than blood

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.320 
currents it's a lot slower than blood
but<00:05:00.530> it<00:05:00.620> really<00:05:00.800> worth<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.310> I<00:05:01.340> had<00:05:01.520> so<00:05:01.820> so<00:05:02.150> much

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
but it really worth and I had so so much

recommend<00:05:07.669> you<00:05:07.790> guys<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.030> build<00:05:08.360> it<00:05:08.540> it's

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
recommend you guys to build it it's

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.020 
recommend you guys to build it it's
literally<00:05:09.169> a<00:05:09.350> hundred<00:05:09.919> thousand<00:05:10.520> coins<00:05:10.700> and

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
literally a hundred thousand coins and

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.730 
literally a hundred thousand coins and
then<00:05:11.419> with<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.780> chemistry<00:05:12.230> stars<00:05:12.470> i<00:05:12.620> think

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
then with the chemistry stars i think

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.470 
then with the chemistry stars i think
it's<00:05:12.860> like<00:05:12.890> an<00:05:13.070> extra<00:05:13.250> 5k<00:05:13.610> which<00:05:13.970> isn't<00:05:14.419> much

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
it's like an extra 5k which isn't much

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.020 
it's like an extra 5k which isn't much
at<00:05:14.840> all<00:05:15.020> but<00:05:15.290> it's<00:05:15.770> so<00:05:16.130> much<00:05:16.190> fun<00:05:16.640> and<00:05:16.880> I'm
