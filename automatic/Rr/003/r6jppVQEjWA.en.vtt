00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 not already rolled a little up to 30 40 and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.140
 after you can go go we're going 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.140
 up to 30 40 well case-insensitive 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:25.490
 20 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:25.490
 we want them to advance his polo 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.230
 again you're going to accelerate a 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.690
 little bit and inserts accelerates again 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.270
 a little bit here you drew a 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.100
 loser snake per match 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.079
 without going too fast against not 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.760
 return 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.739
 and at one point you'll just put 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.760
 a short throttle throttle 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.760
 but a little bit hard now 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:08.190
 ok the golden gas shot as years was a 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.980
 too strong and too not 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.820
 exactly good analysis we start again 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.240
 for you can turn in the direction 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.610
 reverse 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.220
 no more than 30 or 40 what you have 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.860
 seen it's going to be complicated then we 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.180
 start we continue to accelerate 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.710
 and there you'll just put a shot of 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.840
 gas and if it starts to slip or 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.550
 let go of the accelerator now your 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.870
 eyes are supposed to be out there okay 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.750
 that's what you just did 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.280
 by cons do not look at the circle then 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.520
 how will know that it's a little bit of 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.520
 gas 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:49.630
 the beard fred motorcycle stops the cracked and we 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.979
 leave alone thing it's just a small 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.830
 little brutal about acceleration 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.090
 yes I go it is more metering sieving 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.710
 good- for-nothing derivatives when you resume 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.929
 accelerator it's very strong then 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.130
 begin I look good by my window I 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.970
 always look where you want to go 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.970
 believe a little bit of speed 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.940
 same thing accelerator you'll stay that 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:21.050
 stop the back and start again have 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.520
 not be brutal his turn shared custody 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.120
 but from there the tower is made of the 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.409
 the sprinkler accelerates a little bit 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.879
 koga yet 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.739
 and blood that will control you as you have me 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.390
 do it as soon as you 104 slides 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.400
 counterfeit especially art is 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.849
 to accelerate vase it starts again it's 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:55.930
 funny like him I look by opinion you 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:57.489
 acceleration domalain possible but if we 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.900
 look if we succeed at first foyt 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:05.019
 successful tuition at first you roll at 30 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.520
 40 km hour as one 30 or 40 km 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:12.290
 to relaunch 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.210
 a little long ago 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.990
 caspar did you relax right away 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.850
 again 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:22.880
 bah again and in fact you still 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.370
 too brutal of exactly go again 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.160
 it's not easy and not time when 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.900
 is nice 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.310
 at first this party escapes or not 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.980
 it's great what you did not do at first 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.900
 and that's to tell their guards 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.050
 well right you accelerate a little bit 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.160
 more 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:47.570
 look so super super yet 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:04:04.120
 gourmands at 34 cable you redo me 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:04:04.120
 the same thing to leon martin
