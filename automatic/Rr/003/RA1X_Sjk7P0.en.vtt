00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
during reentry which would you regard as

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.380 
during reentry which would you regard as
the<00:01:04.290> most<00:01:04.619> critical<00:01:05.129> moment<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.549> all<00:01:05.700> from<00:01:06.299> the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
my own case it was much more like a

well you certainly won't be able to see
it<00:03:13.269> from<00:03:13.360> here<00:03:13.690> because<00:03:13.840> it's<00:03:14.080> going<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.260> blow

saw coming back in a brief glimpse of it
up<00:03:45.160> in<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.340> night<00:03:45.489> we<00:03:45.610> did<00:03:45.880> indeed<00:03:46.030> dawn<00:03:46.630> we

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
up in the night we did indeed dawn we

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.570 
up in the night we did indeed dawn we
did<00:03:47.019> indeed<00:03:47.170> but<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:47.560> far<00:03:47.739> as<00:03:47.890> I<00:03:47.980> can<00:03:48.040> tell<00:03:48.340> from

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
did indeed but so far as I can tell from

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.699 
did indeed but so far as I can tell from
the<00:03:48.810> calculations<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:49.870> we've<00:03:50.049> done<00:03:50.170> this<00:03:50.560> is

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
the calculations that we've done this is

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.229 
the calculations that we've done this is
not<00:03:50.890> good<00:03:51.040> if<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.250> case<00:03:51.400> now<00:03:51.640> this<00:03:52.030> time

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
not good if the case now this time

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.340 
not good if the case now this time
because<00:03:52.570> of<00:03:52.660> course<00:03:52.780> were<00:03:52.870> wanting<00:03:53.110> to<00:03:53.140> stay

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
because of course were wanting to stay

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.620 
because of course were wanting to stay
light<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:54.400> of<00:03:54.670> course<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:54.940> faster<00:03:55.270> service

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
light and of course the faster service

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.520 
light and of course the faster service
module<00:03:55.930> is<00:03:56.020> concerned

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
module is concerned

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.309 
module is concerned
well<00:03:56.890> that<00:03:57.100> is<00:03:57.250> now<00:03:57.370> fully<00:03:57.700> fueled

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
well that is now fully fueled

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.780 
well that is now fully fueled
and<00:03:58.469> therefore<00:03:59.069> when<00:03:59.219> it<00:03:59.250> comes<00:03:59.430> back<00:03:59.610> into

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
and therefore when it comes back into

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.280 
and therefore when it comes back into
the<00:03:59.909> atmosphere<00:04:00.299> it<00:04:00.569> is<00:04:00.629> certainly<00:04:01.110> gonna

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
the atmosphere it is certainly gonna

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.319 
the atmosphere it is certainly gonna
make<00:04:01.439> a<00:04:01.469> very<00:04:01.650> considerable<00:04:02.069> bang<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.700> if<00:04:03.209> it

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
make a very considerable bang and if it

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.880 
make a very considerable bang and if it
would<00:04:03.450> above<00:04:03.689> our<00:04:03.840> horizon<00:04:04.319> in<00:04:04.469> spite<00:04:04.680> of<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
would above our horizon in spite of the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.220 
would above our horizon in spite of the
daylight<00:04:05.189> we<00:04:05.640> would<00:04:05.879> see<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.120> but<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:06.989> far<00:04:07.170> I

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
daylight we would see that but so far I

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.569 
daylight we would see that but so far I
can<00:04:07.469> tell<00:04:07.500> this<00:04:07.799> is<00:04:07.890> going<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.129> be<00:04:08.189> well<00:04:08.370> below

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
can tell this is going to be well below

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:09.500 
can tell this is going to be well below
our<00:04:08.879> horizon

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
our horizon

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.390 
our horizon
there's<00:04:10.170> one<00:04:10.349> unusual<00:04:10.590> feature<00:04:10.769> this<00:04:11.159> isn't

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
there's one unusual feature this isn't

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.500 
there's one unusual feature this isn't
it<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.609> you<00:04:11.730> talk<00:04:11.969> you're<00:04:12.150> talking<00:04:12.329> about<00:04:12.480> a

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
it that you talk you're talking about a

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.179 
it that you talk you're talking about a
bang<00:04:12.719> and<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.319> bang<00:04:13.469> on<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.650> ground<00:04:13.859> and<00:04:14.069> so

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
bang and the bang on the ground and so

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.849 
bang and the bang on the ground and so
but<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.730> sonic<00:04:15.120> boom<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.169> is<00:04:16.380> made<00:04:16.590> by

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
but the sonic boom that that is made by

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.770 
but the sonic boom that that is made by
the<00:04:16.919> command<00:04:17.430> module<00:04:17.699> is<00:04:17.789> made<00:04:18.030> in<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.690> other

the command module is made in the other
way<00:04:18.930> around<00:04:18.989> from<00:04:19.350> normal<00:04:19.620> normally<00:04:19.919> we<00:04:20.039> hear

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
way around from normal normally we hear

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.529 
way around from normal normally we hear
a<00:04:20.220> sonic<00:04:20.519> boom<00:04:20.639> when<00:04:20.820> an<00:04:20.910> aircraft<00:04:21.060> goes<00:04:21.389> up

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
a sonic boom when an aircraft goes up

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.969 
a sonic boom when an aircraft goes up
through<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.900> speed<00:04:22.079> of<00:04:22.199> sound<00:04:22.229> absolutely

through the speed of sound absolutely

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.140 
through the speed of sound absolutely
this<00:04:23.100> way<00:04:23.250> we<00:04:23.430> hear<00:04:23.550> it<00:04:23.639> when<00:04:23.729> it<00:04:23.789> comes<00:04:23.970> down

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
this way we hear it when it comes down

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.490 
this way we hear it when it comes down
through<00:04:24.449> it<00:04:24.600> exact<00:04:25.020> it's<00:04:25.169> going<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.470> other

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
through it exact it's going the other

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.779 
through it exact it's going the other
way<00:04:25.680> around<00:04:25.889> course<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.430> don't<00:04:26.580> get<00:04:26.699> that

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
way around course you don't get that

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.520 
way around course you don't get that
except<00:04:27.090> with<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.240> spacecraft<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:28.199> know<00:04:28.320> get<00:04:28.440> it

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
except with a spacecraft you know get it

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.870 
except with a spacecraft you know get it
with<00:04:28.620> me<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.860> ask<00:04:29.009> you<00:04:29.130> don't<00:04:29.250> well

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
with me to ask you don't well

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.629 
with me to ask you don't well
occasionally<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:31.320> do<00:04:31.470> with<00:04:31.620> meteorites<00:04:31.949> but

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
occasionally you do with meteorites but

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.469 
occasionally you do with meteorites but
don't<00:04:32.820> forget<00:04:32.910> there's<00:04:33.150> a<00:04:33.180> village<00:04:33.389> of

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
don't forget there's a village of

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.390 
don't forget there's a village of
considerable<00:04:33.990> difference<00:04:34.259> in<00:04:34.380> scale<00:04:34.650> the

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
considerable difference in scale the

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.920 
considerable difference in scale the
average<00:04:35.520> meteor<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.449> kinda<00:04:36.630> thing<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:36.780> call

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
average meteor the kinda thing you call

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.719 
average meteor the kinda thing you call
a<00:04:36.960> shooting<00:04:37.289> star<00:04:37.380> is<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.860> very<00:04:38.099> tiny<00:04:38.430> thing

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
a shooting star is a very tiny thing

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.730 
a shooting star is a very tiny thing
smaller<00:04:39.150> than<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.360> grain<00:04:39.449> of<00:04:39.570> dust<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.169> that

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
smaller than a grain of dust and that

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.409 
smaller than a grain of dust and that
makes<00:04:40.979> kind<00:04:41.190> of<00:04:41.250> display<00:04:41.520> in<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.729> sky<00:04:41.910> so

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
makes kind of display in the sky so

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:43.939 
makes kind of display in the sky so
these<00:04:42.690> things<00:04:42.930> will<00:04:43.229> be<00:04:43.410> visible<00:04:43.650> if<00:04:43.860> we

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
these things will be visible if we

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.080 
these things will be visible if we
happen<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.160> be<00:04:44.250> in<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.370> right<00:04:44.490> place<00:04:44.759> but<00:04:44.970> so

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
happen to be in the right place but so

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.219 
happen to be in the right place but so
far<00:04:45.270> as<00:04:45.330> we<00:04:45.479> are<00:04:45.509> concerned<00:04:45.599> at<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.050> British

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
far as we are concerned at the British

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.620 
far as we are concerned at the British
Isles<00:04:46.380> we<00:04:46.620> are<00:04:46.710> not<00:04:46.889> and<00:04:47.210> unless<00:04:48.210> something's

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.120 
Isles we are not and unless something's
gone<00:04:48.720> very<00:04:48.840> peculiar<00:04:49.349> with<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.590> calculations

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
gone very peculiar with the calculations

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.860 
gone very peculiar with the calculations
of<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.280> service<00:04:50.580> module<00:04:50.729> we<00:04:51.270> shan't<00:04:51.449> even<00:04:51.599> see

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
of a service module we shan't even see

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.200 
of a service module we shan't even see
that<00:04:52.110> we<00:04:52.349> hope<00:04:52.560> they<00:04:52.680> don't<00:04:53.180> fare<00:04:54.180> well

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
that we hope they don't fare well

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.950 
that we hope they don't fare well

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
when the lunar landing module was cast

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.850 
when the lunar landing module was cast
away<00:05:01.169> at<00:05:01.909> 543<00:05:02.909> they<00:05:03.630> of<00:05:03.750> course<00:05:03.960> had<00:05:04.320> much<00:05:04.590> to

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
away at 543 they of course had much to

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.250
