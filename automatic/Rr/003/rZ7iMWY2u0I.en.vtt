the<00:01:04.710> show<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.880> raging<00:01:06.360> blow<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.869> wild

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the show to to raging blow to a wild

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.250 
the show to to raging blow to a wild
strike<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:07.770> whatnot<00:01:08.479> while<00:01:09.479> striking<00:01:09.900> work

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.250 
strike or whatnot while striking work
strike<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.799> could<00:01:10.979> probably<00:01:11.189> put<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.490> into<00:01:12.260> it

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
strike you could probably put it into it

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.539 
strike you could probably put it into it
means<00:01:13.560> every<00:01:13.830> time<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.100> press<00:01:14.250> those<00:01:14.520> buttons

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
means every time you press those buttons

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.810 
means every time you press those buttons
it'll<00:01:15.150> switch<00:01:15.360> your<00:01:15.570> weapons<00:01:16.020> your<00:01:16.110> health

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
it'll switch your weapons your health

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.760 
it'll switch your weapons your health
will<00:01:17.820> bounce<00:01:18.119> around<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.900> nobody's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
will bounce around like nobody's

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.789 
will bounce around like nobody's
business<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:22.220> theoretically<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:25.170> should<00:01:25.200> be

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
business but theoretically you should be

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.550 
business but theoretically you should be
generating<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:27.030> lot<00:01:27.509> more<00:01:27.750> damage<00:01:28.020> because

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
generating a lot more damage because

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.249 
generating a lot more damage because
you're<00:01:28.770> wild<00:01:29.040> strokes<00:01:29.310> will<00:01:29.520> hit<00:01:29.729> harder

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
you're wild strokes will hit harder

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.730 
you're wild strokes will hit harder
you're<00:01:31.259> waging<00:01:31.470> blows<00:01:32.840> look<00:01:33.840> because<00:01:34.530> what

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
you're waging blows look because what

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.620 
you're waging blows look because what
you're<00:01:34.890> doing<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.180> see<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> entire

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
you're doing you have to see the entire

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.600 
you're doing you have to see the entire
disk<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.320> midnight<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.009> I've<00:01:38.070> been<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.430> at

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
disk on midnight and I've been up at

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.740 
disk on midnight and I've been up at
work<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:39.150> day<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:41.060> what<00:01:42.060> you're<00:01:42.240> doing<00:01:42.390> is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
work all day and what you're doing is

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.620 
work all day and what you're doing is
taking<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.799> best<00:01:44.009> out<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.340> both<00:01:44.670> talent<00:01:45.270> trees

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
taking the best out of both talent trees

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.580 
taking the best out of both talent trees
or<00:01:46.110> both<00:01:46.590> specs<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.759> combining<00:01:48.270> them<00:01:48.590> now

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
or both specs and combining them now

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.780 
or both specs and combining them now
that's<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.979> theory<00:01:50.280> anyway<00:01:51.890> in<00:01:52.890> all<00:01:53.250> honesty

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
that's the theory anyway in all honesty

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.760 
that's the theory anyway in all honesty
I<00:01:53.970> don't<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> gear<00:01:54.840> all<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.380> cropper

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
I don't have the gear all the cropper

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.760 
I don't have the gear all the cropper
quipment<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.490> test<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.939> properly<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:58.259> what<00:01:58.740> I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
quipment to test it properly so what I

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.819 
quipment to test it properly so what I
love<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.520> if<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.939> guys<00:02:00.180> can<00:02:00.719> actually<00:02:01.140> see

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
love is if you guys can actually see

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.020 
love is if you guys can actually see
this<00:02:01.890> macro<00:02:02.780> take<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.670> test<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.820> out<00:02:05.969> and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
this macro take it and test it out and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.029 
this macro take it and test it out and
let<00:02:06.390> me<00:02:06.420> know<00:02:06.509> what<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.899> think<00:02:07.170> let<00:02:07.740> me<00:02:07.890> know

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
let me know what you think let me know

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.999 
let me know what you think let me know
if<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.220> works<00:02:08.250> for<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.869> if<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.200> works<00:02:10.470> then

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
if it works for you if it works then

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.250 
if it works for you if it works then
obviously<00:02:11.390> it's<00:02:12.390> going<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:12.900> pretty

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
obviously it's going to be pretty

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.479 
obviously it's going to be pretty
now<00:02:13.620> with<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.640> macro<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:16.230> can<00:02:16.439> use<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:17.310> can

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
now with this macro you can use you can

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.660 
now with this macro you can use you can
play<00:02:17.760> storm<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.360> 22<00:02:18.720> handers<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:20.069> can<00:02:20.250> dragon

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
play storm of 22 handers you can dragon

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.449 
play storm of 22 handers you can dragon
roll<00:02:20.849> with<00:02:21.079> one<00:02:22.079> hand<00:02:22.319> is<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.799> can<00:02:23.010> shop<00:02:23.250> wave

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
roll with one hand is you can shop wave

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.399 
roll with one hand is you can shop wave
or<00:02:23.640> landers<00:02:25.250> basically<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.629> tap<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.230> can

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
or landers basically you can tap you can

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.680 
or landers basically you can tap you can
pretty<00:02:28.739> much<00:02:29.450> set<00:02:30.450> each<00:02:30.950> ability<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.879> let<00:02:33.150> me

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
pretty much set each ability and let me

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.030 
pretty much set each ability and let me
describe<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:35.329> if<00:02:36.329> you<00:02:36.930> find<00:02:37.319> leave<00:02:37.829> your

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
describe this if you find leave your

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.339
