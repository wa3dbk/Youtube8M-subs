00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 in the American town of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.660
 steamboat in colorado has been discovered 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.660
 something really unique an animal mutation 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.289
 that gives a lot to think about is about 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.949
 a calf that has been born with seven legs 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.100
 and two spines something that never 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.080
 had previously been seen if 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.090
 they had seen five-legged calves 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.520
 but a calf with seven legs 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.610
 impressive according to scientists this 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.920
 it's because the division of the embryo does not 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.250
 it occurred in a normal way it did not 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.590
 separated the twins and let's say it 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.710
 they formed nothing more and nothing less than seven 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.020
 legs seven legs and two spines 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.290
 that prevented this living being 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.220
 survive more than ten minutes later 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:59.520
 to be born as soon as I was born because I was alive 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.559
 but after ten minutes she died 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.330
 veterinarian who was responsible for performing 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.690
 This research performing 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.000
 Llama Lee Meyring was the one who attended the 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.810
 case and now the American doctors 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.720
 they are also traveling to this place to 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.820
 check what happened as you can 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.700
 see it's not a normal calf it 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.479
 it's about something really weird and that 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.020
 never before had this happened to this 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.580
 level the question is there is something that 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.980
 we are making us beings 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.370
 humans to create this kind of 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.920
 mutations and anomalies or is something that 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.140
 nature itself has been able to 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.780
 believe 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.120
 all this is to be debated is for 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.610
 debate and after the investigations 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.510
 and the tests I guess it will come to 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.510
 some conclusion
