00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:06.830
 voodoo 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.830
 Heart 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.730
 You are 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.250
 Say to be here 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.230
 early 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.100
 I think after turbo 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.269
 Which one is free? 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.260
 Heart one 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:29.130
 If you can sleep, you can see the demo version in Fall 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:35.480
 That's surface type card underground 1st shot 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:38.140
 I'm talking from the top of the smart basement , but I felt like I had never had a parent 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.140
 In the middle 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.230
 There is no need to do it 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.780
 It does Mase Tei 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.910
 PECO I anti-fear Chottsu 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:58.490
 Ikehara Ikehara bus speed is pretty good 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.800
 A fast movement will react immediately, but again if you have a cat that has such speed 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.170
 I will not give up 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.760
 In it will come out with what tsubo momentum or the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.260
 I mean Chau Hashirashi its 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.980
 Do not let this moth donut also notice Botton 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.980
 I'm water this morning 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.980
 It is possible to break the pillar more than that 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:25.000
 I'll stop thinking about what I'm doing in this middle class 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.000
 That's why the form 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:33.570
 Instead of going to the guy who stopped quite right Te different painted enemies find the timing 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.640
 What does it move ? 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.780
 It's all ok 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.190
 It is about the speed of the ball to say that it is about to put out, but it is probably the designer at the door 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.170
 Speed because 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.170
 I'll wait for a moment and paste it 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.930
 Only it is nice or rules appear first does not say absolutely 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.390
 That's right, right ? 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:31.319
 Sugisaki Ne I 'm easy to understand in the later meters in the video, but just say in words 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:36.510
 It's heating is how to move 5 chapters 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.200
 Only the difference Datte do is do dregs it slowly but it should take a little move faster 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.300
 That's why 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.140
 Anticipation 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.360
 Is that the Well 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.360
 That say important Ichibanko is why 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.900
 voodoo
