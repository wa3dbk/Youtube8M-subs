00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.330
 was designed for the photographer did not

 easy to assemble but will not fall 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.650

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.510
 Masses manufactures which dispenses 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.290
 lights around the surface or 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.210
 distorting and trained the broadcaster 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.910
 divided the beams of light between 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.739
 their bands is direct you 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.660
 note that the funds of garlic peeled 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.000
 is the same as the iphone is put in the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.370
 emitted light and by your flash for 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.059
 mount the late just fix the band 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.879
 in cash and on the code of your flash 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.609
 to shoot the rock seems like 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.300
 as you can see it does not dark 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.840
 no and it's mounted on the arrowhead 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.260
 like that with the broadcasters in front of 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.350
 this way I could quickly turned 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.270
 between vertical and horizontal is 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.390
 kept the same what was the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.610
 light in both sides it mounts 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.490
 on the theme of flash like that with two 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.890
 nets in test phase face we do not know 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.200
 more quickly turned between tic to l 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.150
 horizontally and that we followed the same 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.329
 quality of light in both 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.119
 sides she is removed to create a beautiful 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.880

 here by conversing direct arrows 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.909
 against lightning 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.490
 you notice that the arrows of the rec 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.130
 a contrasting quality of lighting as 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.630
