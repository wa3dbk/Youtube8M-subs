00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.530 
and I think I ended up at about an f +
f9<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.780> i-10<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.549> sky<00:01:08.760> came<00:01:09.060> nice<00:01:09.299> and

de let you go above you sync speed now I

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.149 
de let you go above you sync speed now I

does a hyper Singh work on this and also

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.369 
does a hyper Singh work on this and also
from<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.129> camera<00:02:15.670> as<00:02:16.209> Lord<00:02:16.659> me<00:02:16.870> shutter<00:02:17.109> speed

from the camera as Lord me shutter speed

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.470 
from the camera as Lord me shutter speed
down<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.650> 200<00:02:18.249> of<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.400> second<00:02:18.790> which<00:02:18.969> was<00:02:19.180> missing

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
down a 200 of a second which was missing

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.379 
down a 200 of a second which was missing
speed<00:02:19.780> Emmy<00:02:20.019> 600d<00:02:20.799> and<00:02:21.099> I<00:02:21.609> took<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.879> shot<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.299> it

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:22.389 
speed Emmy 600d and I took a shot and it

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:26.759

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
blew him completely out and so I thought

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.050 
blew him completely out and so I thought
right<00:02:26.829> I'm<00:02:27.189> not<00:02:27.310> going<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.579> mess<00:02:27.730> with<00:02:27.939> this

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
right I'm not going to mess with this

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.399 
right I'm not going to mess with this
right<00:02:28.299> now<00:02:28.329> because<00:02:28.719> I<00:02:28.750> didn't<00:02:28.989> have<00:02:29.079> me<00:02:29.200> come

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
right now because I didn't have me come

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.440 
right now because I didn't have me come
and<00:02:29.560> flash<00:02:30.040> with<00:02:30.280> me<00:02:30.430> but<00:02:30.730> I've<00:02:30.819> had<00:02:30.939> me<00:02:31.090> cannon

and flash with me but I've had me cannon

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.940 
and flash with me but I've had me cannon
I<00:02:31.599> probably<00:02:32.109> could<00:02:32.349> have<00:02:32.379> pulled<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.769> out<00:02:32.920> and

I probably could have pulled it out and
I<00:02:33.280> know<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.639> would<00:02:33.849> have<00:02:33.969> worked<00:02:34.060> in

soon<00:03:35.799> as<00:03:35.979> I<00:03:36.009> went<00:03:36.189> to<00:03:36.340> three<00:03:36.459> 20th<00:03:37.030> which<00:03:37.209> is

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
soon as I went to three 20th which is

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.629 
soon as I went to three 20th which is
once<00:03:37.599> one<00:03:38.199> third<00:03:38.409> of<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.650> stop<00:03:38.889> above<00:03:39.159> my<00:03:39.370> sync

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
once one third of a stop above my sync

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.689 
once one third of a stop above my sync
speed<00:03:39.759> boom<00:03:40.689> went<00:03:41.379> pitch-black<00:03:41.709> now<00:03:42.489> that

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
speed boom went pitch-black now that

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.860 
speed boom went pitch-black now that
would<00:03:42.819> explain<00:03:43.180> why<00:03:43.599> the<00:03:43.629> other<00:03:43.959> day<00:03:44.229> that<00:03:45.870> it

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
would explain why the other day that it

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.629 
would explain why the other day that it
went<00:03:47.169> pitch-black<00:03:47.379> I<00:03:47.709> mean<00:03:47.829> it<00:03:47.919> doesn't<00:03:48.400> even

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
went pitch-black I mean it doesn't even

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.599 
went pitch-black I mean it doesn't even
give<00:03:49.060> you<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.449> line<00:03:49.989> now<00:03:50.500> in<00:03:50.769> all<00:03:50.949> fairness<00:03:50.979> with

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
give you a line now in all fairness with

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.360 
give you a line now in all fairness with
this<00:03:51.759> shot<00:03:52.030> if<00:03:52.239> you<00:03:52.449> busty<00:03:53.079> sync<00:03:53.319> speed<00:03:53.530> on<00:03:53.979> on

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
this shot if you busty sync speed on on

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.229 
this shot if you busty sync speed on on
a<00:03:54.659> normal<00:03:55.659> camera<00:03:55.930> uh<00:03:56.349> I<00:03:56.379> fly<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.310> flash<00:03:57.939> that

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
a normal camera uh I fly a flash that

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.800 
a normal camera uh I fly a flash that
doesn't<00:03:58.719> support<00:03:59.590> I<00:03:59.949> speed<00:04:00.699> sync<00:04:01.030> you'd<00:04:01.569> get<00:04:01.780> a

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
doesn't support I speed sync you'd get a

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.929 
doesn't support I speed sync you'd get a
little<00:04:02.109> line<00:04:02.319> here<00:04:02.349> because<00:04:03.219> I<00:04:03.370> always<00:04:03.579> put<00:04:03.879> my

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
little line here because I always put my

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.879 
little line here because I always put my
shovel<00:04:04.299> button<00:04:04.509> on<00:04:04.629> the<00:04:04.719> top<00:04:04.959> so<00:04:05.469> you<00:04:05.500> get<00:04:05.739> the

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
shovel button on the top so you get the

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.429 
shovel button on the top so you get the
line<00:04:06.069> here<00:04:06.489> and<00:04:07.000> that's<00:04:07.269> why<00:04:07.479> I<00:04:07.750> would<00:04:08.289> have

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:08.439 
line here and that's why I would have

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.689 
line here and that's why I would have
thought<00:04:08.590> specialer<00:04:09.009> than<00:04:09.009> be<00:04:09.250> know<00:04:09.370> that<00:04:09.549> left

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
thought specialer than be know that left

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.699 
thought specialer than be know that left
I<00:04:09.819> thought<00:04:09.969> I<00:04:10.030> would<00:04:10.180> have<00:04:10.269> got<00:04:10.419> away<00:04:10.449> warm<00:04:10.900> 500

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
I thought I would have got away warm 500

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.860 
I thought I would have got away warm 500
easy<00:04:12.039> because<00:04:12.699> the<00:04:13.090> flash<00:04:13.299> just<00:04:13.569> won't<00:04:13.719> have

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
easy because the flash just won't have

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.620 
easy because the flash just won't have
covered<00:04:14.109> up<00:04:14.439> to<00:04:14.650> about<00:04:14.859> here<00:04:15.069> but<00:04:15.969> our<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.359> so

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
covered up to about here but our so so

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.189 
covered up to about here but our so so
wrong<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.409> that's<00:04:18.159> actually<00:04:19.079> it's<00:04:20.079> actually

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
wrong so that's actually it's actually

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.950 
wrong so that's actually it's actually
bug<00:04:20.620> me<00:04:20.799> really<00:04:21.159> because<00:04:21.489> it<00:04:21.639> it<00:04:22.360> says<00:04:22.750> that

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
bug me really because it it says that

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.910 
bug me really because it it says that
you<00:04:23.050> can<00:04:23.229> use<00:04:23.380> 18<00:04:23.740> thousand

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
you can use 18 thousand

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.770 
you can use 18 thousand
a<00:04:24.950> second<00:04:25.430> so<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.700> makes<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:26.030> think<00:04:26.060> yeah<00:04:26.450> and

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
a second so it makes you think yeah and

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.140 
a second so it makes you think yeah and
you<00:04:27.470> can<00:04:27.620> push<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.980> sync<00:04:28.160> speed<00:04:28.340> on<00:04:28.700> any<00:04:28.850> flash

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
you can push the sync speed on any flash

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.850 
you can push the sync speed on any flash
but<00:04:29.690> it<00:04:29.780> didn't<00:04:29.990> work<00:04:30.020> it<00:04:30.290> just<00:04:30.410> goes<00:04:30.620> pitch

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
but it didn't work it just goes pitch

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.940 
but it didn't work it just goes pitch
black<00:04:31.660> so<00:04:32.660> you<00:04:32.720> can't<00:04:33.020> even<00:04:33.140> go<00:04:33.320> one<00:04:33.470> third<00:04:33.800> of

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
black so you can't even go one third of

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.250 
black so you can't even go one third of
a<00:04:34.040> stop<00:04:34.280> over<00:04:34.540> because<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.660> goes<00:04:35.780> pitch<00:04:36.020> black

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
a stop over because it goes pitch black

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.250 
a stop over because it goes pitch black
now<00:04:36.800> when<00:04:37.400> i<00:04:37.430> tried<00:04:37.940> my<00:04:38.350> YN<00:04:39.350> 565<00:04:40.220> x<00:04:41.020> which<00:04:42.020> is

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
now when i tried my YN 565 x which is

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.570 
now when i tried my YN 565 x which is
not<00:04:42.710> a<00:04:42.740> nice<00:04:42.980> beating<00:04:43.580> far<00:04:43.880> either<00:04:44.920> that<00:04:45.920> works

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
not a nice beating far either that works

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.000 
not a nice beating far either that works
a<00:04:46.910> bit<00:04:47.090> better<00:04:47.120> when<00:04:47.870> i<00:04:48.200> took<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.500> shot<00:04:48.770> in<00:04:48.890> the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
a bit better when i took a shot in the

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.970 
a bit better when i took a shot in the
bedroom<00:04:49.400> with<00:04:49.430> my<00:04:49.820> say<00:04:50.090> 50<00:04:50.540> d<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:51.020> I<00:04:51.500> went<00:04:51.680> over

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
bedroom with my say 50 d and I went over

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.920 
bedroom with my say 50 d and I went over
me<00:04:52.100> sync<00:04:52.310> speed<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:52.850> started<00:04:53.390> to<00:04:53.540> just<00:04:53.720> get<00:04:53.900> a

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
me sync speed I started to just get a

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.560 
me sync speed I started to just get a
little<00:04:54.110> line<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.770> then<00:04:55.460> a<00:04:55.760> bigger<00:04:56.000> line<00:04:56.300> and

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
little line and then a bigger line and

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.790 
little line and then a bigger line and
then<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.690> bigger<00:04:56.930> line<00:04:57.170> and<00:04:57.380> then<00:04:57.470> when<00:04:57.650> I<00:04:57.680> took

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
then a bigger line and then when I took

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.650 
then a bigger line and then when I took
it<00:04:58.150> horizontal<00:05:00.640> normal<00:05:01.640> way<00:05:01.820> I<00:05:02.060> started<00:05:02.570> to

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
it horizontal normal way I started to

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.930 
it horizontal normal way I started to
get<00:05:02.750> a<00:05:02.810> line<00:05:03.050> along<00:05:03.350> the<00:05:03.410> bomb<00:05:03.680> so<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.730> Pasha

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
get a line along the bomb so the Pasha

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.110 
get a line along the bomb so the Pasha
flash<00:05:05.300> did<00:05:06.260> give<00:05:06.530> me<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.740> line<00:05:07.040> but<00:05:07.640> the<00:05:07.850> cheap

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
flash did give me the line but the cheap

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.880 
flash did give me the line but the cheap
which<00:05:08.720> you<00:05:08.900> would<00:05:09.020> get<00:05:09.260> when<00:05:09.470> you<00:05:09.560> bust<00:05:09.770> your

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
which you would get when you bust your

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.910 
which you would get when you bust your
sync<00:05:10.160> speed<00:05:10.280> but<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.300> cheap<00:05:11.870> flushes<00:05:12.410> the<00:05:12.560> YN

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
sync speed but the cheap flushes the YN

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.470 
sync speed but the cheap flushes the YN
560<00:05:13.790> and<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.240> YN<00:05:14.660> 560<00:05:15.410> mark<00:05:15.620> two<00:05:16.150> they<00:05:17.150> just

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
560 and the YN 560 mark two they just

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.630 
560 and the YN 560 mark two they just
totally<00:05:18.230> not<00:05:18.350> they<00:05:18.440> did<00:05:18.590> nothing<00:05:18.740> it<00:05:19.430> just

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
totally not they did nothing it just

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.600 
totally not they did nothing it just
went<00:05:19.760> bitch<00:05:19.970> black<00:05:20.210> so<00:05:21.050> you<00:05:21.680> can<00:05:21.890> not<00:05:22.130> push<00:05:22.400> the

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
went bitch black so you can not push the

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.340 
went bitch black so you can not push the
sync<00:05:22.790> speed<00:05:22.970> even<00:05:23.660> though<00:05:23.750> your<00:05:23.930> camera<00:05:24.200> will

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
sync speed even though your camera will

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.200 
sync speed even though your camera will
let<00:05:24.530> you<00:05:24.740> you<00:05:25.010> can<00:05:25.190> just<00:05:25.340> speed<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.730> shut<00:05:25.910> up<00:05:26.090> in

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
let you you can just speed to shut up in

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.780 
let you you can just speed to shut up in
it<00:05:26.330> says<00:05:26.720> I<00:05:26.750> speed<00:05:27.200> sinks<00:05:27.590> engaged<00:05:27.980> what

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
it says I speed sinks engaged what

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.760 
it says I speed sinks engaged what
happens<00:05:29.150> is<00:05:29.360> that<00:05:31.060> it<00:05:32.170> just<00:05:33.170> totally<00:05:33.380> not<00:05:33.650> they

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
happens is that it just totally not they

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.090 
happens is that it just totally not they
gives<00:05:33.920> you<00:05:34.010> a<00:05:34.040> black<00:05:34.310> line<00:05:34.550> and<00:05:35.410> I<00:05:36.410> actually

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
gives you a black line and I actually

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.750 
gives you a black line and I actually
didn't<00:05:37.640> think<00:05:38.980> mellanox<00:05:39.980> if<00:05:40.160> I<00:05:40.250> change<00:05:40.520> it<00:05:40.640> to

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
didn't think mellanox if I change it to

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.690 
didn't think mellanox if I change it to
Fisk<00:05:40.940> Owen<00:05:41.440> yeah<00:05:42.440> I'd<00:05:42.860> after<00:05:43.040> an<00:05:43.280> air<00:05:43.430> belies

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
Fisk Owen yeah I'd after an air belies

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.980 
Fisk Owen yeah I'd after an air belies
because<00:05:44.030> I'm<00:05:44.090> just<00:05:44.270> thinking<00:05:44.570> if<00:05:44.660> I<00:05:44.720> change

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
because I'm just thinking if I change

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.470 
because I'm just thinking if I change
McCarron<00:05:45.560> to<00:05:45.710> first<00:05:46.010> would<00:05:46.820> it<00:05:46.850> do<00:05:47.090> anything

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
McCarron to first would it do anything

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.940 
McCarron to first would it do anything
then<00:05:47.660> but<00:05:47.870> no<00:05:48.020> it<00:05:48.140> would<00:05:48.260> just<00:05:48.410> keep<00:05:48.680> me<00:05:48.860> in

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
then but no it would just keep me in

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.370 
then but no it would just keep me in
missing<00:05:49.220> speed<00:05:49.490> then<00:05:49.730> so<00:05:50.210> yeah<00:05:51.050> the<00:05:51.440> YN<00:05:51.800> 565<00:05:52.430> VX

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
missing speed then so yeah the YN 565 VX

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.870 
missing speed then so yeah the YN 565 VX
behaved<00:05:54.380> where<00:05:54.860> I<00:05:54.890> get<00:05:55.160> the<00:05:55.190> line<00:05:55.490> so<00:05:55.820> you

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
behaved where I get the line so you

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.790 
behaved where I get the line so you
could<00:05:56.090> cheat<00:05:56.390> you<00:05:56.600> think<00:05:56.840> speed<00:05:57.140> a<00:05:57.380> little<00:05:57.620> bit

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
could cheat you think speed a little bit

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.680 
could cheat you think speed a little bit
I<00:05:58.100> would<00:05:58.370> have<00:05:58.490> got<00:05:58.580> away<00:05:58.610> with<00:05:58.850> it<00:05:59.030> here<00:05:59.270> at

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
I would have got away with it here at

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.230 
I would have got away with it here at
500<00:06:00.470> probably<00:06:01.220> because<00:06:01.460> if<00:06:01.580> it<00:06:01.970> would<00:06:02.180> have

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
500 probably because if it would have

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.060 
500 probably because if it would have
covered<00:06:02.420> about<00:06:02.690> our<00:06:02.960> for<00:06:03.230> the<00:06:03.290> frame<00:06:03.530> so<00:06:04.010> I

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
covered about our for the frame so I

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.440 
covered about our for the frame so I
still<00:06:04.340> would<00:06:04.490> have<00:06:04.520> got<00:06:04.700> away<00:06:04.730> with<00:06:04.940> it<00:06:05.090> here

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
still would have got away with it here

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.720 
still would have got away with it here
and<00:06:05.750> it's<00:06:06.530> been<00:06:06.710> all<00:06:06.860> fairness<00:06:07.160> now<00:06:07.460> on<00:06:07.610> know

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
and it's been all fairness now on know

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.820 
and it's been all fairness now on know
about<00:06:08.030> it<00:06:08.270> next<00:06:08.690> time<00:06:08.960> I'll<00:06:09.200> make<00:06:09.230> sure<00:06:09.530> I<00:06:09.560> take

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
about it next time I'll make sure I take

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.340 
about it next time I'll make sure I take
my<00:06:10.040> canon<00:06:10.340> 580ex<00:06:11.090> which<00:06:11.750> would<00:06:11.990> have<00:06:12.140> done<00:06:12.320> I

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
my canon 580ex which would have done I

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.660 
my canon 580ex which would have done I
speed<00:06:12.740> sync<00:06:13.010> and<00:06:13.190> it<00:06:13.280> wouldn't<00:06:13.460> have<00:06:13.550> been<00:06:13.610> a

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670 
speed sync and it wouldn't have been a

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.510 
speed sync and it wouldn't have been a
problem<00:06:13.760> and<00:06:14.350> so<00:06:15.350> that's<00:06:15.470> a<00:06:15.680> negative<00:06:15.830> for<00:06:16.340> me

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
problem and so that's a negative for me

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.350 
problem and so that's a negative for me
I'm<00:06:17.420> not<00:06:17.960> disappointed<00:06:18.380> but<00:06:18.950> I<00:06:19.010> I<00:06:19.550> thought

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
I'm not disappointed but I I thought

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.700 
I'm not disappointed but I I thought
with<00:06:20.570> it<00:06:20.720> letting<00:06:20.900> your<00:06:21.140> speed<00:06:21.380> up<00:06:21.560> be<00:06:21.680> sure

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
with it letting your speed up be sure

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.580 
with it letting your speed up be sure
that<00:06:22.520> you<00:06:22.700> could<00:06:22.940> use<00:06:23.210> I<00:06:23.480> speed<00:06:23.930> sync<00:06:24.200> on<00:06:24.410> any

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
that you could use I speed sync on any

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.040 
that you could use I speed sync on any
flash<00:06:24.830> like<00:06:25.430> you<00:06:25.610> could<00:06:25.790> with<00:06:25.970> a<00:06:26.000> GTR<00:06:26.570> double

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050

and they let you do that even with

and they let you do that even with

I<00:06:38.980> then<00:06:39.980> did<00:06:40.220> for<00:06:40.910> some<00:06:41.060> reason<00:06:41.450> I<00:06:41.570> have<00:06:41.720> the
