00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hi, I'm Mariana and in this case I'm going 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.060
 to show the books that I acquired in the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.280
 June, the first book I acquired 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.290
 in the month of June I wait for your side of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:17.400
 my side I think she took out the book 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.810
 never say never is the lemon read but 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.660
 the truth is that I wanted to read a lot 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.990
 something from her and but by your side I was made 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.970
 super interesting so I asked for it and then 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.820
 I'm super eager to read it on 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.020
 next book that I asked for was my first 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.780
 kiss tvt rules yes i think yes i called 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.610
 a lot of attention a lot of attention 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.780
 because I did for the author of 17 years of 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.030
 age that I've got millions of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.230
 readers around the world related and 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.940
 it was me its part made me like that 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.219
 interesting and then I shared it in my 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.200
 Facebook page and you said that 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.539
 it looked really good to read it and not 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.789
 I know that then I asked and I hope to read it 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.160
 soon the next book that came to me and 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.020
 really it made me really happy is 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.200
 so dream of blue jeans that is 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.750
 the third part of the trilogy 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.480
 songs for Paula not from the trilogy 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.460
 good morning princess then I am 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.990
 Super super super excited already 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.660
 I want to read in fact then because 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.580
 all in one I read but maybe because 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.020
 I'm afraid because it is the last ya ya 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.020
 the trilogy ends then 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.400
 many feelings found in part 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.830
 the movie will come out already the 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.730
 trailer is super good the truth to 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.430
 beginning when I saw the trailer it was like 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.220
 so I have not started the book I like the 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.520
 idea that also like the movie the 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.640
 breakfast club 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.740
 breakfast not like that is not 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.190
 is good in Spanish is the club of the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.400
 five 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.340
 I remember advice in English well this 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.590
 it will be very similar like that but afterwards it is not 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.509
 nothing like the movie then 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.820
 super blood I recommend these 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.310
 books because they are so good they are 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.380
 really good the next book indeed 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.680
 is my current reading and the me before you 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.690
 by yoyo voice moyes 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.470
 you already know that you never have to pronounce 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:15.700
 good to the authors but good is mint 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:20.730
 reading and this book is about a 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:24.610
 26-year-old girl who loses her job and 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.700
 get one not so much desired by her 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:34.209
 it's a job that you have to take care of 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:36.160
 a guy a young man who is in a 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.370
 wheelchair and can not use the 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.650
 arms or legs then you have to 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.390
 stop eating that has to be talk 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.190
 so you do not get bored and more details do not 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.960
 for a moment I thought they were going to 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:56.370
 fall in love but I'm not thinking that anymore 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:59.070
 I do not know yet there are many theories 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.200
 there are about 200 or 100 pages left to 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.930
 finish it I hope to finish it this end of 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.640
 week and well I do not know when I go up this 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.860
 video but I hope to finish it soon for 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.680
 can you talk more in detail about this 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.750
 book the 7 book I asked for was in hyde 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.420
 david lozano 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.660
 I saw this book with a girl who climbs 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.140
 videos from Spain but I do not remember 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.900
 who was 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.569
 and I think it was the presentation of the 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.060
 writer and he came with his little book then 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.459
 the truth is that the cover is mop 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.170
 as well as what do you need from the book you see 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.890
 Super good 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.640
 I read the synopsis and it looks interesting but 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.130
 I do not know why I have not yet 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.880
 him but what looks interesting looks 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.340
 interesting and then I take love and 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.830
 other strange words this book that 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.540
 apparently they are going to make film I know 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.940
 I really like reading the book 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.530
 because the movie is going to come out but it's over 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.750
 to leave the book 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.910
 because many times publishers do not 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.090
 they peel the book until they are going to do it 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:10.660
 movie I do not know why they do that 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.640
 Well , I already have this I hope the 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.220
 I really started reading and I know very good 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.949
 it's interesting health differently than 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.630
 that I have read and finally this book does not 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.630
 I know if it is suitable for everyone 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.850
 a certain day is in a bookstore and I saw it 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.760
 and it was like 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.580
 is the book sounds interesting league the 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.590
 synopsis and me 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.710
 is what I've been looking for all my 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.639
 life nothing lie is not true but 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.810
 how not 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:46.949
 it's something like 50 shadows of serious but not 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:50.279
 so 50 shadows of serious and it's called 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:52.949
 ecstasy of mesh banks says first 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:55.139
 part of the breathless trilogy here 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.900
 so little or much I read about the 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:03.820
 synopsis is that 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.680
 like the sister of his best friend 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.229
 like what 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.630
 have fantasies or salt to xavi has 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.370
 fantasies with your best friend 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.800
 brother 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.880
 and apparently it's already going 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.139
 so I think it's for seniors 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.389
 18 years old girls do not read that let me double 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:28.590
 today, if it is very strong, then later 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:29.740
 I tell you that I do not say anything better, I do not say 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.650
 nothing 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.910
 experiment in were two books that did not 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.910
 I put those who for me 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.020
 well the truth is that these two books 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:45.379
 I ordered them from January or February to 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.289
 Klaus but we did not have a chance to 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:50.539
 see us until recently and finally the 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:54.499
 I have the first esfandiar the rain 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:58.770
 worldwide and we are a little bit is not 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:06:01.349
 beautiful when I arrived was like 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.210
 I do not know if I hug you clear because I already 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.789
 I missed or I do not know if he grabs the book 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.430
 first the next book was 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:11.430
 Aristotle Walking Discover the Secret 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.550
 of the universe this book I wanted it 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.770
 buy because lewis lewis rhyme this what 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.770
 he read and says it's great so 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:23.580
 I bought it but unfortunately as I am 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:26.129
 a little bit loose I wanted to look in pdf in 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.370
 Spanish and I did not find it but I found 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:30.900
 a blog where they were reviewing it and 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:35.009
 it kind of caught my attention then 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:39.020
 I started reading and I read the spoiler more 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.020
 spoiler of the universe 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.040
 then it will not make sense anymore 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.780
 me but still I want to read it because it 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.660
 look super interesting and apart the cover 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.410
 She's super coquette and the name is 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.290
 great 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.400
 then you will see everything that comes here 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.610
 commonly when a book has all 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.800
 these things is because it is so terrific 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.950
 I did not doubt it and I said clearly I want 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:06.250
 that book and well now yes those have been 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.660
 the books that in the month of July I 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.550
 I would like very much to be told in the 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.040
 comments that we read you guys bought 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.930
 in June and which ones they wanted to buy but 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.970
 they could not because I do not know they were not 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.460
 in the bookstore because they had no money 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.290
 like me and well this is already in that the 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.430
 I want a lot constant and see them later 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.430
 in another video there
