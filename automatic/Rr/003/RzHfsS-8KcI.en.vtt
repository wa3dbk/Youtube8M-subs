00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.010
 of negron and life with sleep 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.680
 but it is a city with many 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.780
 students has basically two 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.610
 neighborhoods where they are all nucleated 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.619
 that are new córdoba and güemes that 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.390
 it generated that they begin to open more bars 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.130
 and that more people start to walk through 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.890
 places in the city where 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.850
 normally they did not walk at night 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.430
 They mainly know us all by 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.070
 Take Fernet with coca and little by little 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.880
 what is bars we have been achieving that 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.430
 to take other things eat big 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.610
 in clubs and it has stopped me from certain 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.840
 way in a bowling alley I already behaved myself 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.280
 the customers in a bowling told him 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.680
 good night that can serve you for 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.080
 take and suddenly they had three things to 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.520
 serve to take and I studied science 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.500
 education and I received from that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.990
 waiting for the title I started working 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.460
 behind a bar and I stayed and left 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.340
 being left was supposed to be a job 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.780
 for a couple of months and now I am 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.300
 happy because I know that finding the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.670
 new passion is fun of negron and is 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.300
 life with swing consists of three parts 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.820
 one of campari one is insane rosso and one 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.340
 of jean english and the particular detail 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.050
 who have china lollipop with 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.530
 chopsticks lollipops china black sugar 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:10.060
 glucose and china we cooked wanted to make 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.250
 the Chinese part of the thief 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.760
 in what we focus mainly 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.650
 the bartenders is having your first bar in 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.510
 this time I can open it in a 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.090
 house the living room of the bar is the living room of 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.980
 my house when it's my turn to open the bar and I 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.080
 Today I'm at the bar alone and I love it 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.750
 It is one of the moments that I like the most 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.360
 the time before entering work are 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.080
 two hours of having almost the entire bar for 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.780
 I alone silence the beautiful bar I am the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.450
 bar 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.840
 an ounce of campari thirty centimeters 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.840
 cubic 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.840
 the reason and see progress in English 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:54.010
 now let's proceed 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.190
 position it and I think black does not even 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.080
 the classic cocktail bar is in some way 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.940
 the best companion for a great 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.069
 moment cost four words to 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.950
 writing them is like a few years ago 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.180
 I was imposed like hello I'm the black 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.180
 we serve it 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.849
 your put all of oranges oil is 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.629
 the particular touch that my recipe has 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:24.720
 arrivals in my toy boat 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.560
 recipe is 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.560
 they saw it 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.920
 fun of negron and takes three quarters 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.440
 of ounces of campari 111 scienceno white 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.209
 and an ounce of gin that I will be more 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.010
 rooibos is an infusion that comes from 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.690
 south africa and I also put husks of 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.700
 tangerine my version of black in 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.560
 excesses to mary joe comes from a song 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.750
 de belle and sebastian that counts 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.459
 some stories a little tragic and 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.959
 decadent to me I thought I was 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.300
 good to offer something that was 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.300
 comforting just before the 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.180
 decadence besides being bartender me 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.480
 like to read novels read fiction is a 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.110
 way of living other stories 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.900
 a passive but viable way besides 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.610
 novels I read cocktail books to me 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.380
 personally recipe books 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.380
 maybe they are the ones who call me the least 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.510
 attention to me makes more sense the 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.190
 read a book that brings you to voice 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.979
 understand why they combine well 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.750
 certain flavors since I started 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.500
 listen to music called me a lot the 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.330
 attention the battery everything I just feel 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.580
 and struck up a personal relationship with the 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.260
 battery without other instruments yo 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.350
 I do not particularly have a band because I do not 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.350
 I have time to have a band 85% 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.550
 of my life is the bar we started with three 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.550
 fourth campaign sauces 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:53.810
 the ounce of white science is not what 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:57.460
 is going to give the sweet touch 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.810
 and in the end the 5 in the pray 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.190
 that combines very well with light 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.680
 and choose to serve it in a cup 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.050
 exactly because of the strong ingredient 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.540
 of the roll that is an infusion and usually 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.790
 take explained today is that you 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.130
 is trying new things he was encouraged 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.500
 try them the clientele is changing 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.480
 he assured they are the ones that are behind 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.280
 from the bar we love there's nothing 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.260
 better than go and ask the bartender for a 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.930
 swallow that he himself would take base with 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.930
 much more just yet if we serve 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.690
 the decoration is a shell 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.820
 horizontal tangerine this is my version 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.820
 of negron and from that more nervous 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:53.489
 I'm going to prepare a balestrini negroni 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.259
 based a little on my grandfather I think that 

00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:57.299
 It is one of the most classic drinks and more 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.669
 lived in the world when we went out to 

00:05:57.299 --> 00:06:01.949
 other bars we take negrón and we go to 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.349
 add seawater ocean water 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.199
 Atlantic I have a love for the sea 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.689
 I did not draw 23 years ago that 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.829
 I grab a pencil I told my partner if 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:12.599
 we could make some sea monsters 

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:14.699
 that had to do with the theme of the 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.559
 boat and inside the pardilla this is going 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.750
 be on the fire and if even more all 

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:21.350
 together 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.540
 beyond producing in a certain way 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.560
 that goes according to where you work 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.510
 you have to be comfortable 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.200
 I always dreamed of representing my country and 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.520
 I think it's a little I represent it 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.389
 doing jobs and the truth that I 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.389
 put proud
