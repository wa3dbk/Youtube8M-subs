plastic<00:03:53.750> bait<00:03:54.879> but<00:03:55.879> what<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.209> did<00:03:56.510> is<00:03:56.540> inside<00:03:57.109> to

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
plastic bait but what I did is inside to

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.670 
plastic bait but what I did is inside to
give<00:03:57.799> it<00:03:57.949> the<00:03:58.040> durability<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:59.329> sound<00:03:59.810> the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
give it the durability the sound the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.629 
give it the durability the sound the
flotation<00:04:01.579> of<00:04:01.790> wood<00:04:02.480> is<00:04:03.319> basically<00:04:04.099> this<00:04:04.400> bait

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
flotation of wood is basically this bait

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.849 
flotation of wood is basically this bait
is<00:04:04.819> injected<00:04:05.389> with<00:04:05.540> foam<00:04:05.810> I<00:04:06.109> got<00:04:06.709> the

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
is injected with foam I got the

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.550 
is injected with foam I got the
densities<00:04:07.340> just<00:04:07.669> right<00:04:07.959> even<00:04:08.959> where<00:04:09.169> when<00:04:09.470> you

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
densities just right even where when you

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.399 
densities just right even where when you
listen<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.129> the<00:04:10.250> knock<00:04:10.489> in<00:04:10.729> it<00:04:10.879> it<00:04:11.510> sounds<00:04:12.199> like

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
listen to the knock in it it sounds like

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.240 
listen to the knock in it it sounds like
an<00:04:12.620> original<00:04:12.919> like<00:04:13.579> old<00:04:13.879> wood<00:04:14.120> plug<00:04:14.449> so<00:04:15.250> very

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
an original like old wood plug so very

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.509 
an original like old wood plug so very
subtle<00:04:16.870> very<00:04:17.870> nice<00:04:18.320> very<00:04:18.769> simple<00:04:19.310> and

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
basically pull out of the package and

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.090 
basically pull out of the package and

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
hook up ratio also trying to make it as

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.030 
hook up ratio also trying to make it as
weedless<00:04:38.090> as<00:04:38.270> possible<00:04:38.780> as<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.500> can<00:04:39.650> see<00:04:39.860> the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
weedless as possible as you can see the

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.830 
weedless as possible as you can see the
front<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.520> tip<00:04:40.700> of<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:40.910> hooks<00:04:41.120> are<00:04:41.330> just

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
front of the tip of the hooks are just

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.260 
front of the tip of the hooks are just
at<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.320> end<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.740> bill<00:04:42.950> so<00:04:43.640> if<00:04:43.790> you<00:04:43.940> swim

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
at the end of the bill so if you swim

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.110 
at the end of the bill so if you swim
this<00:04:44.450> bait<00:04:44.660> up<00:04:44.900> and<00:04:45.230> over<00:04:45.530> brush<00:04:46.000> you're<00:04:47.000> going

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
this bait up and over brush you're going

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.760 
this bait up and over brush you're going
to<00:04:47.180> have<00:04:47.360> a<00:04:47.390> pretty<00:04:47.720> good<00:04:47.870> chance<00:04:48.170> of<00:04:48.440> not

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
to have a pretty good chance of not

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.490 
to have a pretty good chance of not
getting<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.310> hooked<00:04:49.610> or<00:04:49.850> fouled<00:04:50.200> but<00:04:51.200> when<00:04:51.470> a

fish<00:04:51.710> does<00:04:51.950> hit<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.340> and<00:04:52.520> it<00:04:52.640> grabs<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.060> bait

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
fish does hit it and it grabs the bait

fish does hit it and it grabs the bait
all<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:54.170> do<00:04:54.350> is<00:04:54.500> you<00:04:54.590> do<00:04:54.740> a<00:04:54.770> real<00:04:55.070> set<00:04:55.430> that

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
all you do is you do a real set that

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.520 
all you do is you do a real set that
drops<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.390> hooks<00:04:56.630> down<00:04:56.930> and<00:04:57.230> you<00:04:57.350> have<00:04:57.500> a

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
drops the hooks down and you have a

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.280 
drops the hooks down and you have a
really<00:04:57.950> good<00:04:58.130> hook<00:04:58.310> up<00:04:58.460> ratio<00:04:58.750> they're<00:04:59.750> double

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
really good hook up ratio they're double

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.110 
really good hook up ratio they're double
Gamakatsu<00:05:00.650> one<00:05:01.490> ought<00:05:01.700> to<00:05:02.450> ex<00:05:02.660> strong<00:05:02.960> hooks<00:05:03.380> I

basically it's just a toothpick this is
the<00:05:22.340> same<00:05:22.550> kind<00:05:22.760> of<00:05:22.850> stuff<00:05:23.060> I<00:05:23.210> did<00:05:23.360> on<00:05:23.480> wood

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
the same kind of stuff I did on wood

the same kind of stuff I did on wood
plugs<00:05:23.930> 35<00:05:24.500> years<00:05:24.740> ago<00:05:25.240> it's<00:05:26.240> simple<00:05:26.720> it's

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
plugs 35 years ago it's simple it's

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.320 
plugs 35 years ago it's simple it's
direct<00:05:27.770> it<00:05:28.040> does<00:05:28.400> its<00:05:28.610> job<00:05:28.670> you're<00:05:29.180> not<00:05:29.270> going

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
direct it does its job you're not going

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.610 
direct it does its job you're not going
to<00:05:29.510> have<00:05:29.600> a<00:05:29.660> problem<00:05:30.020> with<00:05:30.140> it<00:05:30.290> and<00:05:30.440> that's

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
to have a problem with it and that's

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.200 
to have a problem with it and that's
what<00:05:30.830> we're<00:05:30.950> going<00:05:31.070> to<00:05:31.100> build<00:05:31.670> for<00:05:31.910> you<00:05:32.030> guys

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
what we're going to build for you guys

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.000 
what we're going to build for you guys
something<00:05:32.570> that<00:05:32.810> you<00:05:32.930> could<00:05:33.080> very<00:05:33.950> easily

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
something that you could very easily

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.750 
something that you could very easily
change<00:05:34.700> out<00:05:34.910> tails<00:05:35.180> if<00:05:35.390> you<00:05:35.480> want<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:37.220> tail<00:05:37.490> is

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
change out tails if you want the tail is

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.510 
change out tails if you want the tail is
an<00:05:37.910> 8<00:05:38.180> section<00:05:39.430> plastic<00:05:40.540> rat<00:05:41.540> tail<00:05:41.900> that<00:05:42.860> is<00:05:42.920> C

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
an 8 section plastic rat tail that is C

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.840 
an 8 section plastic rat tail that is C
shaped<00:05:43.910> so<00:05:44.690> at<00:05:44.900> this<00:05:45.080> time<00:05:45.410> there's<00:05:46.250> no<00:05:46.520> chance

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
shaped so at this time there's no chance

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.360 
shaped so at this time there's no chance
for<00:05:47.150> that<00:05:47.240> hook<00:05:47.510> to<00:05:47.810> capture<00:05:48.560> that<00:05:48.740> tail<00:05:49.010> so

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
for that hook to capture that tail so
