00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.149

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.000
 come on 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.780
 Good, I came back here, we already have one. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.539
 scorpion level 13 and now I'm going for a 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.080
 spider he has to attack're team is already 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.600
 in aggressive mode then I 'll go already 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.540
 I left here prepared and I'll put the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.280
 spider and there we will see who wins this 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.280
 first round then let's go 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.780
 good people did not even smell 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.020
 first round was that of the same scorpion 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.020
 and from what I realized I did not see the level 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.020
 of the spider but it was not seemed to be well 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.210
 easy here for him next to us 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.660
 will do the opposite I go domestic 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.640
 spider and then I put scorpion 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.430
 beauty then let's prepare the second 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.310
 round here and there I 'll be right back 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.930
 good people already have our spider here 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.540
 level 18 okay so I slept it 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.420
 That with the strong team, it's not for her to stay. 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.330
 We already put her as aggressive. 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.610
 so let's put the scorpion now and 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.830
 Let's see who takes this second round. 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.620
 beauty then I already left it here ready 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.720
 she is already in aggressive mode then 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.720
 Let's see here let's put the scorpion 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.079
 good people, how have you seen there? 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.010
 a good fight and I scorpion led to 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.189
 best 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.980
 are they were levels well a good 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:51.709
 similar in the then so the scorpion 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.579
 apparently he's actually stronger 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.709
 that the spider then so the scorpion 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.310
 already won this but let's make one 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.730
 Third round here just for us to have. 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.920
 It sure is just for us to take the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.900
 Beauty doubt then I'll prepare the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.659
 round here and the time you have 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.239
 Okay, I'll be back then, let's go. 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.540
 Good guys, we already have one more spider here. 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.909
 Is this from here is level 13? 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.769
 so let's put another scorpion on 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.159
 here and we'll see what happens 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.989
 remembering that the scorpion has already led to 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.810
 two rounds but we'll see if 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.420
 she can get a little bit here by 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.000
 less then let up here a little and 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.090
 here I go for a scorpion so let's go 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.090
 to see 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:07.190
 The guys like you saw what's the 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:11.120
 The conclusion I draw is this struggle that is 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.180
 first the spider she started to 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.160
 attack first right 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.359
 so she got the upper hand there 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:24.830
 because she gave nÃ© several several hits 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:27.830
 before on the scorpion and she has her level 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.789
 13 in the galley the scorpion was level 4 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.970
 then the others they were levels 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:38.330
 similar here is the level between 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.090
 spider and scorpion the level on the spider 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.229
 it was much bigger then I think in this 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.680
 if here 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.870
 the scorpion had no chance even beyond 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.810
 from his lower level he began to 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.600
 get the first but as we saw 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.130
 there in the first two fights between right 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.580
 similar levels 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.650
 the scorpion it really is stronger 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.200
 at least it's what looks like beauty 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.450
 so this is it, and I hope 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.090
 you have enjoyed this video does not 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.930

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.840
 battle 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.120
 remembering that if you want to see some 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.520
 specific battle did not want to suggest only 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.789

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.370

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.830
 one then leave in the comments to the 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.470

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:34.180
