00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.480
 the most common question that asked me 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.189
 is how to get the girl in 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.250
 victoria's secret is exactly this great one 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.740
 Look sexy in the big waves 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.179
 there is a very different medium for it 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.980
 mostly the curling iron the two 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.439
 Variations is once the smooth one 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.119
 curling tipped tip 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.260
 once a bit thicker curling iron 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.760
 if you clip it 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.650
 the difference between the two things is 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.480
 which lace bandages I can do completely 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.650
 Just work in the hair and I have 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.050
 a bit more tension in the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.600
 tip through the large curling iron take 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.399
 I have a bigger wave and I can 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.780
 the tipsy bit with 1 I cling 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.579
 I would say mine today 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.100
 narrow or not in the end 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.600
 both not a front for strand 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.430
 I have a relaxed side 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.329
 and very important is a heat protection 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.100
 product I still died of what 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.920
 i do i turn the hair easy 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.610
 Wild died with a bit of caution 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.610
 the tips 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.350
 that's right ten counter in it 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.510
 That's how I work my way through 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.580
 behind the next beaches of the Johanna 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.590
 let's start pointing up in there too 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.990
 still the approach is the special 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.150
 a bit around but go now 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.740
 hold on and then just before 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.100
 let everything show you now completely 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.590
 short 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.220
 by the great associations the same 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.049
 Principle no bumps makes her clip 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.070
 it will be the same even now 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.990
 the only difference is that the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.619
 loose butt is bigger and a little bit 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.619
 loose field 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.170
 to get this extremely sexy look 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.759
 to turn the beautiful hair backwards 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.619
 Of course you can vary it by 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.509
 the looser a bit wilder I have 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.840
 a bit more orderly have that me 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:47.079
 always hurt to the rear 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.850
 start again when I have the whole head 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.560
 by having forward go forward 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.009
 bow first on with fingers 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.479
 shake all the way to the back 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.549
 then I would take such a sensation 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.619
 and there are little brothers this 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.869
 extra volume go from god bwv before that 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.390
 for example, being in over there is quite easy 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.280
 exactly is so far the only approach 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.369
 thank you a little massage 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.260
 bit too long and 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.080
 finished easily with the curling iron 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.349
 years of turning head over brush 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.640
 with hairspray or with the really great 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.769
 Volume powder the hair bit 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.209
 I love the structure it is 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.190
 very modern if a bit decent 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.970
 is not that accurate and it has one 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.970
 really great wave
