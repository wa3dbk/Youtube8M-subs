again this is the hand technique video I
put<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.710> three<00:01:02.039> years<00:01:02.070> ago<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.789> was<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> video

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
of me for it might be good but that's

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.450 
of me for it might be good but that's
cool<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.080> okay<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.740> come<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> terms<00:01:11.310> with

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
might be good anyway so check it out

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.090 
might be good anyway so check it out
today<00:01:14.900> here's<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> next<00:01:16.200> step<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.650> next

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
today here's the next step of this next

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.679 
today here's the next step of this next
step<00:01:17.280> three<00:01:17.549> years<00:01:17.729> later<00:01:18.000> we're<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
step three years later we're going to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.010 
step three years later we're going to
experiment<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:19.320> something<00:01:19.439> new<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:21.020> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
experiment with something new so the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.330 
experiment with something new so the
next<00:01:22.200> step<00:01:22.350> we're<00:01:22.439> gonna<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.890> talk<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
next step we're gonna do is talk a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.010 
next step we're gonna do is talk a
little<00:01:23.490> bit<00:01:23.610> about<00:01:23.640> utilizing<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> fingers

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
little bit about utilizing the fingers

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.999 
little bit about utilizing the fingers
and<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.229> think<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.560> video<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.890> mentioned

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
and I think in that video I mentioned

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.830 
and I think in that video I mentioned
the<00:01:26.369> fact<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.700> once<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.240> get<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.630> fast

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the fact that once you get really fast

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.990 
the fact that once you get really fast
you<00:01:28.110> start<00:01:28.350> utilizing<00:01:28.680> your<00:01:28.979> fingers<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.490> so

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
you start utilizing your fingers and so

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.670 
you start utilizing your fingers and so
here's<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.270> very<00:01:30.450> simple<00:01:30.930> technique<00:01:31.259> as<00:01:31.530> you're

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
here's a very simple technique as you're

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.270 
here's a very simple technique as you're
playing<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.729> take<00:01:33.210> your<00:01:33.329> fingers<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.280> you'll

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
playing to take your fingers and you'll

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.100 
playing to take your fingers and you'll
basically<00:01:35.970> do<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> Down<00:01:36.509> stroke<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.020> you'll

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
basically do a Down stroke and you'll

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.770 
basically do a Down stroke and you'll
snap<00:01:37.409> them<00:01:37.619> up<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.159> will<00:01:38.610> show<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.570> you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
snap them up so I will show that to you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.240 
snap them up so I will show that to you
in<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.110> minute<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.439> drum<00:01:40.590> pad<00:01:40.770> I'll<00:01:41.009> step

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
in a minute on the drum pad I'll step

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.609 
in a minute on the drum pad I'll step
away<00:01:41.340> from<00:01:41.460> me<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.420> hammer<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
away from me on the hammer and go to the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.859 
away from me on the hammer and go to the
pad<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> go<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.210> check<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.720> out

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
pad so there you go so check this out

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.999 
pad so there you go so check this out
see<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.619> think

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
see what you think

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
come down let listing

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.699 
come down let listing
let's<00:02:52.360> take<00:02:52.510> bounce<00:02:52.690> right<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.140> know<00:02:53.260> it's

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
let's take bounce right you know it's

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.560 
let's take bounce right you know it's
coming<00:02:53.890> down<00:02:54.100> Connie<00:02:54.940> goes<00:02:55.150> against<00:02:55.420> what<00:02:55.540> I

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
coming down Connie goes against what I

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.630 
coming down Connie goes against what I
was<00:02:55.690> saying<00:02:55.840> before<00:02:55.959> but<00:02:56.800> as<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.220> comes<00:02:57.430> down

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
was saying before but as it comes down

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.540 
was saying before but as it comes down
and<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.060> does<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:58.360> little<00:02:58.510> rebound<00:02:59.200> back<00:02:59.500> up

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
and it does that little rebound back up

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.830 
and it does that little rebound back up
yellow<00:03:00.550> see<00:03:01.080> yellow<00:03:02.580> rebound<00:03:03.580> so<00:03:04.360> what<00:03:04.720> you'll

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
yellow see yellow rebound so what you'll

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.140 
yellow see yellow rebound so what you'll
do<00:03:05.019> as<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.709> comes<00:03:05.890> down<00:03:06.100> you'll<00:03:06.550> come<00:03:06.970> down

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
do as it comes down you'll come down

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.509 
do as it comes down you'll come down
with<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.360> stroke<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:07.870> then<00:03:08.380> you'll<00:03:08.470> hit<00:03:09.310> and

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
with a stroke and then you'll hit and

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.850 
with a stroke and then you'll hit and
then<00:03:09.700> you'll<00:03:09.820> snap<00:03:10.209> back<00:03:10.510> up<00:03:10.780> unlike<00:03:11.739> the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
then you'll snap back up unlike the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.900 
then you'll snap back up unlike the
Moeller<00:03:12.070> technique<00:03:12.160> which<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.760> big

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
Moeller technique which is a big

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.280 
Moeller technique which is a big
whipping<00:03:13.269> thing<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.600> course<00:03:13.750> my<00:03:13.930> hand<00:03:14.140> leave

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
whipping thing of course my hand leave

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.410 
whipping thing of course my hand leave
the<00:03:14.410> screen<00:03:14.650> but<00:03:14.850> you're<00:03:15.850> you're<00:03:16.030> basically

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
the screen but you're you're basically

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.600 
the screen but you're you're basically
just<00:03:16.510> hitting<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.440> snapping<00:03:18.250> back<00:03:18.400> up<00:03:18.489> in<00:03:18.549> a

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
just hitting and snapping back up in a

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.050 
just hitting and snapping back up in a
second<00:03:18.880> one's<00:03:19.000> here

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
second one's here

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:49.020 
second one's here
so<00:03:22.060> you're<00:03:22.209> basically<00:03:22.360> down<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.680> snap<00:03:48.030> and

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
so you're basically down and snap and

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.110 
so you're basically down and snap and
obviously<00:03:50.070> both<00:03:51.070> hands<00:03:51.280> are<00:03:51.430> doing<00:03:51.640> it<00:03:51.730> you

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
obviously both hands are doing it you

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:27.010 
obviously both hands are doing it you
can<00:03:52.239> see<00:03:52.390> that<00:04:14.400> so<00:04:15.400> stick<00:04:15.790> up<00:04:15.940> is<00:04:16.289> yeah

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020
