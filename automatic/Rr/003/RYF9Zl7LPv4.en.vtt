00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.909
 Hello friends this week at the channel 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.620
 come to experiments we are going to make a 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.990
 house for birds this is a project 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.280
 that I had in mind for a while 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.629
 I think it looks very good and in fact it is 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.299
 very useful at least for the birds 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.129
 live there we do it and then until 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.530
 we went to hang it on a good pine that 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.600
 we need then we need a hammer 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.180
 a bit of wood like this brush 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.490
 raw material that are basically 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.890
 sheets of a bed frame that we have changed 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.500
 at home asia do not have to throw anything away 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.900
 It has utility a saw one meter and 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.619
 some small little brads we go for 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.800
 there 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.039
 first we measure 15 centimeters all 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.070
 the woods is worth and now this to 20 two 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.019
 of them we mark with a marker and 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.059
 this at an angle that is let's say the 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.089
 front and back and the others will be 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.069
 the sides cut with the saw and 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.550
 let's sand a little bit so that 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:57.370
 they stay there like asperities good splinters 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.530
 we see that you have to make a cut in 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.640
 angle so that then the little chew marries 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.829
 all right 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.159
 and well let's make the hole of the 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.229
 good window I have not used drill 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.540
 because I'm going to do it rustic 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.820
 with the minimum scissors materials like this 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.060
 everyone can do it you see me 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.580
 there he follows the hair of the mountain 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.490
 sheet rather and we cut then I come back 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.520
 to take out and there's a rasp 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.020
 to remove more imperfections so that the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.790
 little bird that good is not going to do 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.280
 damage but not so that it enters and leaves without 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.320
 problem we choose and perfect 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.180
 well there goes the stick where the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.610
 Little bird will be able to pose at the door of 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.430
 your house and so nothing watch over a 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.350
 little if they come good vermin there are 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.840
 danger or just give it the air 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.479
 we measure about eight centimeters we go I 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.170
 I think that with eight goes over to a 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.929
 good bird fits you there and now with 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.090
 with white tail we join so that 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.890
 do not leave the stick and it is already so 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.850
 well let's do the assembly first 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.009
 we nail like three brads on each side 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.900
 we cry out very carefully not to open 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.520
 the woods though good are very finite 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.060
 the nails but good you have to go with 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.709
 careful and now the background that we have not 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.930
 done before because we did not know very well 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.990
 that I was going to stay so good 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.680
 we put a rag like this so as not to damage 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.200
 the angle of the top and now 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.420
 let's make the roof we present everything 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.850
 this as well as a little bit to eye such to the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.240
 march that we are doing but 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.120
 well no problem, we are checking and 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.340
 We also cut well, we already have the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.980
 roof so we present it is more or 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.620
 less well and we're going to put before 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.660
 close all this fluff I had for 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.390
 a hamster's house I had long ago 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.650
 and good guess for the birds 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.850
 nesting it will come to you phenomenal 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.190
 we nail one side and another is very good 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.400
 because nothing above seems to enter a 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.880
 little air but nothing happens we 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.400
 put back as we have seen a car park 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.390
 and that's it, the bird is coming 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.069
 arrives t-01 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.140
 good friends we have come to the site 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.040
 where are we going to place our house for 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.900
 birds 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.500
 I believe that this pine is an ideal place 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.180
 where every little bird would want to live in his 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.700
 detached villa attached to the trunk of this 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.890
 tree so well we 're not going to hurt the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.950
 tree making no hole even with a 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.940
 nail or anything so with the can camo and 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.840
 a rope we will manage to 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.989
 hold it and that good a family that 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.250
 have chosen to live here be happy to 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.250
 take care of your chicks 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.769
 well I think that here is quite 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.500
 well you have more twigs to support yourself and 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.569
 inside as we've seen before this is a 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.599
 doll so that they no longer enter to live 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.129
 and here already good and will attend and their babies 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.680
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.440
 this project is very well I think that a 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.299
 more doing you will like it because good 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.420
 who does not have who does not want to have in 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.700
 its not close to your house in park what 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.620
 let it be a little house that he has made and 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.080
 know that inside there are some birds 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.579
 living and that's always good 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.500
 care of nature so nothing 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.910
