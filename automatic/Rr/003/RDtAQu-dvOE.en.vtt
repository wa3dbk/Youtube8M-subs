00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.160 
bag they think you press these two
buttons<00:02:53.320> over<00:02:53.560> here<00:02:53.700> but<00:02:54.700> actually<00:02:55.299> and<00:02:56.019> then

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
buttons over here but actually and then

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.170 
buttons over here but actually and then
you<00:02:56.350> push<00:02:56.530> around<00:02:56.650> but<00:02:57.130> it's<00:02:57.250> not<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.970> just

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
you push around but it's not you just

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.080 
you push around but it's not you just
pull<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.660> trick<00:02:58.950> pull<00:02:59.950> straight<00:03:00.220> up<00:03:00.250> it's

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
pull this trick pull straight up it's

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.900 
pull this trick pull straight up it's
using<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.510> magnet<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.890> don't<00:03:03.220> get<00:03:03.310> confused<00:03:03.430> and

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
using a magnet so don't get confused and

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.360 
using a magnet so don't get confused and

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
compartments inside I guess it's just

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.090
