 how to do it because little words if exelance &amp; i'm a metin2 2 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:29.869
 hey jude the sheet 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.380
 forecasts for 10elotto 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.060
 j2me 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.150
 because derived Celtic hanging harp 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.610
 well done 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.730
 when the ball searches for sources 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.320
 where to resign 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.250
 the tuscia 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.890
 also the lineout 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.630
 I players have to take a seat between the two dotted lines umea 5 a a 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.760
 15 meters from the edge of the field there are two parallel rows in it 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.220
 complete the tuscia ehm we must hope at least 2 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.250
 up to 14, if one wants, normally those of the line up are at most 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.480
 melee package is an organized jump you can do lift there 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.720
 it can help not to hinder and very dangerous 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.040
 instead you have to try to contend for the ball that is coming 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.090
 then known with this word of yours or the game opens with a passage or 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.170
 status xibar to the group 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.170
 makes me so becomes a fine that advances pushing the opponent packet 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.180
 for this site the name of the melee mix package used to being together 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.740
 the ball goes thick 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.870
 because it is often kicked out 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.170
 it is easy to see present in this case 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.660
 the red chased out 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.360
 he kicked 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.630
 if however 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.570
 the red alessia calcium 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.660
 from which we say 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.400
 not tactically of the same. 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.400
 there would be a remittance to another place 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.290
 yes, but what a juno and you want me to learn to draw a face 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.239
 it is so 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.709
 within the b line 22 meters 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.909
 to the line of his own half 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.889
 you can kick the ball out directly 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.529
 and in this case the ball is returned to play at the point where it passed 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:29.239
 external line but if you have already passed this line we say if in the area more 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.379
 central of the field 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.379
 ask for the ball to let it out you have to make it bounce 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:40.139
 inside the field before letting it out if the ball doesn't bounce inside 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.419
 the remittance is made precisely at the point where the is 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.649
 soccer player 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.299

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.309
 do pure bio examples if the anguish is raining 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:58.719
 I have to go out.
