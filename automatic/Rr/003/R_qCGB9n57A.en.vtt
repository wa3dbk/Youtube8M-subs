how to take out the inner sleeves from

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.570 
how to take out the inner sleeves from
these<00:00:07.319> bushings<00:00:07.770> as<00:00:07.919> you<00:00:08.010> can<00:00:08.160> see<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.430> one's

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
these bushings as you can see that one's

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.520 
these bushings as you can see that one's
already<00:00:08.820> gone<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.390> the<00:00:09.570> front<00:00:10.020> upper

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
already gone this is the front upper

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.830 
already gone this is the front upper
control<00:00:10.800> arm<00:00:11.420> now<00:00:12.420> I'm<00:00:12.510> going<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.690> show<00:00:12.780> you

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
control arm now I'm going to show you

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.110 
control arm now I'm going to show you
how<00:00:13.020> to<00:00:13.080> use<00:00:13.230> heat<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.920> do<00:00:14.310> the<00:00:14.400> same<00:00:14.610> thing<00:00:14.910> to

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
how to use heat to do the same thing to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.480 
how to use heat to do the same thing to
get<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.360> actual<00:00:15.720> bushing<00:00:16.259> out<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.949> tried<00:00:17.460> a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
get the actual bushing out I tried a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.800 
get the actual bushing out I tried a
couple<00:00:17.640> different<00:00:18.000> methods<00:00:18.089> of<00:00:18.419> doing<00:00:18.539> this

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
couple different methods of doing this

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.529 
couple different methods of doing this
and<00:00:19.410> none<00:00:20.339> of<00:00:20.460> them<00:00:20.550> really<00:00:20.730> worked<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.300> tried

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and none of them really worked I tried

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.720 
and none of them really worked I tried
drilling<00:00:21.810> them<00:00:22.050> out<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.499> just<00:00:23.279> using<00:00:23.550> brute

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
drilling them out and just using brute

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.730 
drilling them out and just using brute
force<00:00:23.759> and<00:00:24.359> pressing<00:00:24.689> them<00:00:24.749> out<00:00:24.929> and<00:00:25.169> so<00:00:25.560> far

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
force and pressing them out and so far

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.130 
force and pressing them out and so far
this<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> best<00:00:26.339> thing<00:00:26.759> that<00:00:27.019> that<00:00:28.019> I've

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
this is the best thing that that I've

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.319 
this is the best thing that that I've
found<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:29.099> same<00:00:29.579> tools<00:00:29.789> here<00:00:29.999> we're<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 
found so same tools here we're going to

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.550 
found so same tools here we're going to
use<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.839> torch<00:00:32.270> get<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.360> lit<00:00:33.510> here<00:00:33.750> there<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.290> go

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
use a torch get it lit here there you go

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.230 
use a torch get it lit here there you go
and<00:00:34.650> this<00:00:35.430> time<00:00:35.610> I've<00:00:35.700> got<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> screwdriver

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.240 
and this time I've got a screwdriver

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.570 
and this time I've got a screwdriver
just<00:00:36.570> because<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.900> fits<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.170> little<00:00:37.260> bit<00:00:37.440> better

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
just because it fits a little bit better

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.790 
just because it fits a little bit better
same<00:00:38.580> concept<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.330> sleeves<00:00:40.170> except<00:00:40.680> this

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
same concept as the sleeves except this

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.170 
same concept as the sleeves except this
time<00:00:40.980> we're<00:00:41.160> heating<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.460> from<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> outside

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
time we're heating it from the outside

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.790 
time we're heating it from the outside
in<00:00:43.550> but<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.700> still<00:00:44.970> are<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:46.200> burning<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
in but we still are not burning the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.330 
in but we still are not burning the
actual<00:00:47.250> bushing<00:00:47.640> all<00:00:48.120> we're<00:00:48.330> doing<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:49.250> sit<00:00:50.250> in

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
actual bushing all we're doing is sit in

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.470 
actual bushing all we're doing is sit in
the<00:00:50.430> outside

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.910 

same<00:00:53.840> deals<00:00:54.080> last<00:00:54.380> time<00:00:54.590> it's<00:00:54.770> going<00:00:54.860> to

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
same deals last time it's going to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.819 
same deals last time it's going to
create<00:00:55.130> a<00:00:55.220> little<00:00:55.370> layer<00:00:55.670> Walton<00:00:56.390> rubble

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
create a little layer Walton rubble

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.009 
create a little layer Walton rubble
rubber<00:00:58.129> itself<00:00:58.579> and<00:00:59.420> then<00:00:59.570> we're<00:00:59.780> just<00:00:59.809> going

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
rubber itself and then we're just going

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.979 
rubber itself and then we're just going
to<00:01:00.079> push<00:01:00.199> it<00:01:00.320> out<00:01:01.269> this<00:01:02.269> is<00:01:02.420> a<00:01:02.449> really<00:01:02.690> small

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
to push it out this is a really small

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.509 
to push it out this is a really small
bushing<00:01:03.440> so<00:01:03.469> this<00:01:03.649> is<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:03.890> front<00:01:04.189> upper

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
bushing so this is the front upper

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.539 
bushing so this is the front upper
control<00:01:04.759> arm<00:01:05.409> but<00:01:06.409> a<00:01:06.439> word<00:01:06.710> of<00:01:06.830> caution<00:01:07.040> the

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
control arm but a word of caution the

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.270 
control arm but a word of caution the
larger<00:01:08.060> ones<00:01:08.270> such<00:01:09.170> as<00:01:09.200> these<00:01:09.710> rears<00:01:10.009> that

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
larger ones such as these rears that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.160 
larger ones such as these rears that
I've<00:01:10.369> just<00:01:10.549> done<00:01:10.790> they're<00:01:11.630> actually<00:01:11.960> under<00:01:12.140> a

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
I've just done they're actually under a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.990 
I've just done they're actually under a
considerable<00:01:12.770> amount<00:01:12.950> of<00:01:13.070> pressure<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:13.729> when

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
considerable amount of pressure so when

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.690 
considerable amount of pressure so when
you<00:01:14.119> melt<00:01:14.420> it<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.780> then<00:01:14.840> start<00:01:15.170> pushing<00:01:15.560> it

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
you melt it and then start pushing it

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.249 
you melt it and then start pushing it
I've<00:01:16.700> had<00:01:16.939> one<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.390> them<00:01:17.509> that<00:01:17.659> really<00:01:18.049> popped

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
I've had one of them that really popped

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.460 
I've had one of them that really popped
out<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.619> there<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:18.770> pretty<00:01:19.130> good<00:01:19.310> rate<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:20.960> just

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
out of there a pretty good rate so just

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.450 
out of there a pretty good rate so just
be<00:01:21.560> careful<00:01:21.890> when<00:01:21.979> you're<00:01:22.070> doing<00:01:22.159> this

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
be careful when you're doing this

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.010 
be careful when you're doing this
because<00:01:22.820> that's<00:01:23.119> a<00:01:23.270> very<00:01:23.420> hot<00:01:23.720> piece<00:01:23.990> of

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
because that's a very hot piece of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.359 
because that's a very hot piece of
molten<00:01:24.409> rubber<00:01:24.590> that's<00:01:24.860> gonna<00:01:25.009> go<00:01:25.130> flying

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
molten rubber that's gonna go flying

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.399 
molten rubber that's gonna go flying
across<00:01:25.640> your<00:01:25.880> driveway<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:26.539> you<00:01:27.140> don't<00:01:27.289> want

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
across your driveway and you don't want

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.050 
across your driveway and you don't want
to<00:01:27.470> get<00:01:27.530> hurt

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.880 

so<00:01:32.270> we'll<00:01:32.510> give<00:01:32.659> this<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:32.869> try<00:01:33.110> here<00:01:33.500> we've<00:01:33.710> got

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
so we'll give this a try here we've got

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.560 
so we'll give this a try here we've got
it<00:01:34.040> smoking<00:01:34.340> pretty<00:01:34.700> good<00:01:34.880> that's<00:01:35.060> usually<00:01:35.540> a

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
it smoking pretty good that's usually a

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.000 
it smoking pretty good that's usually a
pretty<00:01:35.720> good<00:01:35.960> indication<00:01:36.350> that<00:01:36.560> there's<00:01:36.860> some

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
pretty good indication that there's some

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.920 
pretty good indication that there's some
molten<00:01:37.190> rubber<00:01:37.430> in<00:01:37.670> there<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:38.119> lot<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:38.600> times<00:01:38.750> it

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
molten rubber in there a lot of times it

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.749 
molten rubber in there a lot of times it
starts<00:01:39.080> seeing<00:01:39.470> some<00:01:39.799> of<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.010> rubber<00:01:40.280> bubble

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
starts seeing some of the rubber bubble

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.719 
starts seeing some of the rubber bubble
up<00:01:40.940> around<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.540> outside<00:01:42.220> let's<00:01:43.220> go<00:01:43.490> ahead<00:01:43.580> and

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
up around the outside let's go ahead and

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:52.600 
up around the outside let's go ahead and
try<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:43.940> put<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.360> down<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.840> push<00:01:51.460> kinda<00:01:52.460> hard

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
try it put that down and push kinda hard

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.600 
try it put that down and push kinda hard
to<00:01:52.640> do<00:01:52.790> it<00:01:52.880> one-handed<00:01:53.240> but<00:01:54.159> it<00:01:55.159> is<00:01:56.110> that<00:01:57.110> is<00:01:57.350> it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
to do it one-handed but it is that is it

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.770 
to do it one-handed but it is that is it
again<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.790> one<00:01:58.880> was<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.090> pretty<00:01:59.270> easy<00:01:59.330> one<00:01:59.690> to

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
again that one was a pretty easy one to

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.620 
again that one was a pretty easy one to
do<00:01:59.930> but<00:02:00.920> some<00:02:01.190> of<00:02:01.310> these<00:02:01.460> I've<00:02:01.880> had<00:02:02.149> completely

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
do but some of these I've had completely

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.499 
do but some of these I've had completely
fused<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.960> outer<00:02:05.960> steel<00:02:06.740> sleeve<00:02:07.509> like

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
fused to the outer steel sleeve like

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.210 
fused to the outer steel sleeve like
it's<00:02:08.660> like<00:02:08.780> glue<00:02:09.110> almost<00:02:09.709> I<00:02:09.890> don't<00:02:10.039> know<00:02:10.100> if

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
it's like glue almost I don't know if

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.710 
it's like glue almost I don't know if
they<00:02:10.340> actually<00:02:10.459> put<00:02:10.700> glue<00:02:10.940> on<00:02:10.970> them<00:02:11.300> or<00:02:11.450> if

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
they actually put glue on them or if

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.900 
they actually put glue on them or if
it's<00:02:11.900> just<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.860> they've<00:02:13.040> fused<00:02:13.550> on<00:02:13.730> there

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
it's just that they've fused on there

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.370 
it's just that they've fused on there
with<00:02:14.000> age<00:02:14.209> but<00:02:14.959> they're<00:02:15.110> pretty<00:02:15.290> much

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
with age but they're pretty much

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.800 
with age but they're pretty much
impossible<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:16.160> get<00:02:16.310> out<00:02:16.340> without<00:02:16.819> heat<00:02:17.120> so

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
impossible to get out without heat so

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.210 
impossible to get out without heat so
this<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.110> best<00:02:18.260> way<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.440> found<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:18.920> hope<00:02:19.040> this

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
this is the best way I found I hope this

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.390 
this is the best way I found I hope this
helps<00:02:19.519> somebody<00:02:19.670> Thanks
