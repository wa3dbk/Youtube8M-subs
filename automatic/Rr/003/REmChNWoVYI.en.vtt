let's<00:00:19.320> try<00:00:19.500> start<00:00:19.830> drawing<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.160> was<00:00:20.220> quite

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
let's try start drawing I was quite

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.310 
let's try start drawing I was quite
young

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.929 

I<00:00:27.410> have<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> particular<00:00:29.249> way<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.369> dissecting

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
I have a particular way of dissecting

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.000 
I have a particular way of dissecting
visual<00:00:30.419> information<00:00:34.340> it's<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:36.739> think<00:00:37.739> it's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
visual information it's I think it's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.920 
visual information it's I think it's
very<00:00:38.250> easy<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.879> get<00:00:39.000> overwhelmed<00:00:39.390> by<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
very easy to get overwhelmed by the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:49.569 
very easy to get overwhelmed by the
amount<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.760> visual<00:00:41.760> information<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.570> exists

kind of scope I'm drawing what I'm

at<00:01:25.039> when<00:01:26.039> I<00:01:26.070> stand<00:01:26.399> back<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.970> do<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.360> lot<00:01:27.539> of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
at when I stand back I do a lot of

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.210 
at when I stand back I do a lot of
looking<00:01:27.780> I'd<00:01:28.020> probably<00:01:28.200> look<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.770> much<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
looking I'd probably look as much as I

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.779 
looking I'd probably look as much as I
actually<00:01:29.429> draw<00:01:30.920> I'm<00:01:31.920> constantly<00:01:32.280> flicking<00:01:32.670> my

actually draw I'm constantly flicking my

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.600 
actually draw I'm constantly flicking my
eye<00:01:32.819> around<00:01:33.270> different<00:01:34.050> shapes

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
eye around different shapes

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.760 
eye around different shapes
relationships<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.990> know<00:01:37.080> I<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.560> nose

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
relationships of you know I to the nose

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.590 
relationships of you know I to the nose
trying<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> see<00:01:38.429> what<00:01:38.789> this<00:01:38.940> shape<00:01:39.179> is<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
trying to see what this shape is the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.180 
trying to see what this shape is the
distance<00:01:39.899> from<00:01:40.050> here<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.289> here<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:41.159> distance

from here to here but just any kind of
form<00:01:44.909> or<00:01:45.060> something<00:01:45.330> that<00:01:45.539> can<00:01:45.659> relate<00:01:45.899> to

form or something that can relate to

form or something that can relate to
something<00:01:46.229> else<00:01:46.500> I'm<00:01:46.979> constantly<00:01:47.869> trying<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
something else I'm constantly trying to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.990 
something else I'm constantly trying to
look<00:01:49.200> at<00:01:49.319> those<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:50.610> moving<00:01:50.820> my<00:01:50.969> eye

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
look at those and be moving my eye

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.870 
look at those and be moving my eye
around<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.950> try<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.490> translate<00:01:53.790> that

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
around and then I try to translate that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.219 
around and then I try to translate that
to<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> drawing<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.600> try<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.780> do<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.020> same

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
to the drawing and I try to do the same

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.870 
to the drawing and I try to do the same
thing<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> drawing<00:01:55.979> I'll<00:01:56.369> try<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.610> flick

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
thing on the drawing I'll try to flick

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
thing on the drawing I'll try to flick
my<00:01:57.000> eyes<00:01:57.149> around<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.810> same<00:01:58.079> sort<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> patterns

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
my eyes around the same sort of patterns

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.340 
my eyes around the same sort of patterns
on<00:01:58.950> my<00:01:59.070> drawing<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.640> try<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> see<00:02:00.960> into<00:02:01.229> it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
on my drawing and try to see into it

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.149 
on my drawing and try to see into it
sort<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.310> intuitively<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:04.500> distance<00:02:04.979> or<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
sort of intuitively the distance or the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.950 
sort of intuitively the distance or the
amount<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.520> time<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.850> takes<00:02:06.000> my<00:02:06.210> eye<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.420> go

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
amount of time it takes my eye to go

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.139 
amount of time it takes my eye to go
from<00:02:07.170> one<00:02:07.409> point<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.920> another<00:02:08.039> point<00:02:08.280> both<00:02:09.030> on

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
from one point to another point both on

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:49.640 
from one point to another point both on
the<00:02:09.239> model<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.570> in<00:02:09.690> my<00:02:09.780> drawing

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:59.839 

I<00:02:56.060> hope<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.180> can<00:02:57.360> make<00:02:57.510> work<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:59.519> feels

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
I hope I can make work that that feels

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.850 
I hope I can make work that that feels
honest<00:03:01.340> not<00:03:02.340> just<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.700> me<00:03:02.819> but<00:03:02.849> also<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.860> the
