00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:05.089 
I'm gonna show you how to mop in flash

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.810 
I'm gonna show you how to mop in flash
just<00:00:06.089> kidding<00:00:06.420> being<00:00:06.690> silly<00:00:07.109> okay<00:00:07.830> morphing

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
just kidding being silly okay morphing

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.259 
just kidding being silly okay morphing
is<00:00:09.000> basically<00:00:09.480> taking<00:00:09.900> one<00:00:10.139> vector<00:00:10.559> shape<00:00:10.980> and

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
is basically taking one vector shape and

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.640 
is basically taking one vector shape and
taking<00:00:12.269> another<00:00:12.509> vector<00:00:12.750> shape<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.290> and

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
taking another vector shape and and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.070 
taking another vector shape and and
morphing<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.700> first<00:00:14.910> shape<00:00:15.089> into<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.780> next

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
morphing the first shape into the next

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.050 
morphing the first shape into the next
shape<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:16.830> basically<00:00:17.220> if<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.640> haven't<00:00:17.820> confused

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
shape so basically if I haven't confused

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.650 
shape so basically if I haven't confused
you<00:00:18.359> right<00:00:18.630> there<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:19.350> taken<00:00:19.680> one<00:00:19.890> shape<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
you right there it's taken one shape and

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.640 
you right there it's taken one shape and
transforming<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.779> into<00:00:21.960> another<00:00:22.140> shape<00:00:22.500> that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
transforming it into another shape that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.470 
transforming it into another shape that
you've<00:00:22.769> created<00:00:23.039> down<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.640> timeline<00:00:23.850> let's

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
you've created down the timeline let's

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.029 
you've created down the timeline let's
show<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.689> how<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.930> do<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.289> if<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.830> haven't

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
show you how to do that if you haven't

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.620 
show you how to do that if you haven't
already<00:00:26.099> done<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.460> go<00:00:26.880> ahead<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.150> open<00:00:27.210> up<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
already done it go ahead and open up the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.370 
already done it go ahead and open up the
tools<00:00:27.869> palette<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:30.050> let's<00:00:31.050> go<00:00:31.170> ahead<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
tools palette and let's go ahead and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.299 
tools palette and let's go ahead and
start<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.740> we're<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> mix<00:00:32.160> your

start so we're going to mix your

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.970 
start so we're going to mix your
ordering<00:00:32.520> keyframe<00:00:32.880> one<00:00:33.410> very<00:00:34.410> easy<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:34.890> we

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
ordering keyframe one very easy to do we

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.560 
ordering keyframe one very easy to do we
just<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.250> take<00:00:35.399> simple<00:00:35.610> drawings<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.360> take

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
just can take simple drawings to take

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.910 
just can take simple drawings to take
your<00:00:36.690> paintbrush<00:00:36.899> we'll<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.800> this

little bit of attitude like how dare you
morph<00:00:59.430> me<00:00:59.609> okay<00:01:00.420> that's<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:00.960> keyframe<00:01:01.379> one<00:01:01.789> so

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
morph me okay that's my keyframe one so

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.179 
morph me okay that's my keyframe one so
now<00:01:02.969> I'm<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> go<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.750> down<00:01:04.739> line<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
now I'm going to go and down line and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.800 
now I'm going to go and down line and
depending<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.580> how<00:01:05.790> long<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.630> want<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
depending on how long you want the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.179 
depending on how long you want the
animation<00:01:07.290> or<00:01:07.350> how<00:01:07.500> short<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.920> want<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
animation or how short you want to

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.070 
animation or how short you want to
animation<00:01:08.700> depends<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.570> where<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.869> put<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
animation depends on where you put the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.480 
animation depends on where you put the
next<00:01:10.229> keyframe<00:01:10.439> all<00:01:11.010> right<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.310> you're<00:01:11.400> gonna

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
next keyframe all right so you're gonna

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.090 
next keyframe all right so you're gonna
click<00:01:12.119> any<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.630> want<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.080> go<00:01:13.619> insert

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
click any one you want and go insert

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.410 
click any one you want and go insert
timeline<00:01:14.840> blank<00:01:15.840> keyframe<00:01:17.000> mm-hmm

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
timeline blank keyframe mm-hmm

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.660 
timeline blank keyframe mm-hmm
blank<00:01:18.869> keyframe<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.130> now<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> new

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
blank keyframe and so now you have a new

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
blank keyframe and so now you have a new
keyframe<00:01:21.030> down<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> same<00:01:21.900> layer<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.560> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
keyframe down on the same layer but you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.160 
keyframe down on the same layer but you
didn't<00:01:23.700> carry<00:01:23.970> over<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.420> same<00:01:24.630> shape<00:01:24.930> we're

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
didn't carry over that same shape we're

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.030 
didn't carry over that same shape we're
actually<00:01:25.290> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> create<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.860> different

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
actually going to create a different

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.620 
actually going to create a different
shape<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.610> we're<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
shape so we're going to go to the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.880 
shape so we're going to go to the
paintbrush<00:01:28.049> maybe<00:01:28.409> we'll<00:01:28.590> change<00:01:28.770> our

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
paintbrush maybe we'll change our

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.450 
paintbrush maybe we'll change our
different<00:01:29.220> color<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:30.020> we'll<00:01:31.250> let's<00:01:32.250> draw<00:01:32.430> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
different color and we'll let's draw a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.420 
different color and we'll let's draw a
new<00:01:32.759> shape<00:01:32.790> kay<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:34.619> any<00:01:34.860> shape<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.220> want

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
new shape kay so any shape that you want

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.170 
new shape kay so any shape that you want
I'm<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> draw<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> little<00:01:36.210> fishy

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.649 

alright<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.460> there's<00:01:44.729> our<00:01:44.850> new<00:01:45.030> shape<00:01:45.299> okay

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
alright so there's our new shape okay

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.789 
alright so there's our new shape okay
and<00:01:46.130> let's<00:01:47.130> go<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.579> more<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.930> we'll<00:01:49.649> go

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and let's go one more and we'll go

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.780 
and let's go one more and we'll go
insert<00:01:50.189> time-line

blank<00:01:51.240> keyframe<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:52.110> maybe<00:01:53.070> we'll<00:01:53.280> make

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
blank keyframe and maybe we'll make

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.530 
blank keyframe and maybe we'll make
let's<00:01:56.040> make<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.750> really<00:01:57.750> strange<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:59.540> of

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
let's make a really strange and of

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.660 
let's make a really strange and of
course<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.960> know<00:02:01.049> there's<00:02:01.290> much<00:02:02.159> better<00:02:02.490> ways

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
course you know there's much better ways

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.280 
course you know there's much better ways
to<00:02:02.880> do<00:02:03.329> morphing<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.930> much<00:02:04.079> better<00:02:04.350> ways<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
to do morphing and much better ways to

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.540 
to do morphing and much better ways to
create<00:02:07.290> objects<00:02:07.950> I'm<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.250> doing<00:02:08.429> this

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
create objects I'm just doing this

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.580 
create objects I'm just doing this
really<00:02:08.789> fast<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.660> guys<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.110> see<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
really fast just for you guys to see and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.530 
really fast just for you guys to see and
maybe<00:02:11.370> later<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.910> down<00:02:12.150> line<00:02:12.330> when<00:02:12.510> we

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
maybe later on the down line when we

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.020 
maybe later on the down line when we
actually<00:02:12.840> start<00:02:13.050> creating<00:02:13.379> on

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
actually start creating on

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.540 
actually start creating on
you<00:02:14.990> know<00:02:15.080> really<00:02:15.350> intricate<00:02:15.830> drawings<00:02:16.040> then

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
you know really intricate drawings then

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.400 
you know really intricate drawings then
then<00:02:16.850> I'll<00:02:17.000> actually<00:02:17.240> use<00:02:17.540> those<00:02:17.690> as<00:02:17.870> examples

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
then I'll actually use those as examples

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.380 
then I'll actually use those as examples
but<00:02:18.650> right<00:02:18.830> now<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.910> draw<00:02:20.090> something

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
but right now just to draw something

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.880 
but right now just to draw something
simple<00:02:20.660> together<00:02:20.870> because<00:02:21.110> we're<00:02:21.290> just

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
simple together because we're just

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.620 
simple together because we're just
learning<00:02:22.220> flash<00:02:23.530> okay<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.800> maybe<00:02:25.010> he's<00:02:25.220> got

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
learning flash okay and maybe he's got

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.960 
learning flash okay and maybe he's got
really<00:02:26.630> short<00:02:26.870> feet<00:02:29.500> okay<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:30.739> he's<00:02:31.430> not<00:02:31.700> very

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
really short feet okay and he's not very

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.350 
really short feet okay and he's not very
happy<00:02:32.150> okay<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.680> idea<00:02:34.069> is<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.340> not<00:02:34.760> create<00:02:35.120> any

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
happy okay the idea is to not create any

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.240 
happy okay the idea is to not create any
of<00:02:35.480> these<00:02:35.630> into<00:02:35.930> symbols<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.560> just<00:02:36.739> want<00:02:36.920> raw

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
of these into symbols you just want raw

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.610 
of these into symbols you just want raw
drawings<00:02:38.000> morphing<00:02:38.810> into<00:02:38.959> each<00:02:39.290> other<00:02:39.470> that's

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
drawings morphing into each other that's

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.440 
drawings morphing into each other that's
the<00:02:39.709> only<00:02:39.860> way<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.069> works<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:40.970> now<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.180> got

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
the only way it works so now you got

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.940 
the only way it works so now you got
these<00:02:41.660> three<00:02:41.989> pictures<00:02:42.290> on<00:02:42.530> these<00:02:42.650> three

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
these three pictures on these three

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.880 
these three pictures on these three
different<00:02:43.220> key<00:02:43.580> frames<00:02:44.050> but<00:02:45.050> now<00:02:45.350> we<00:02:45.410> want

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
different key frames but now we want

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.070 
different key frames but now we want
them<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.040> morph<00:02:46.459> into<00:02:46.640> each<00:02:46.940> other<00:02:47.209> okay<00:02:48.019> so

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
them to morph into each other okay so

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.290 
them to morph into each other okay so
you<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.470> click<00:02:48.620> on<00:02:48.739> one<00:02:48.980> frame<00:02:49.489> or<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.150> go

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
you just click on one frame or you go

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.520 
you just click on one frame or you go
down<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.720> properties<00:02:50.870> palette<00:02:51.260> and

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
down to the properties palette and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.940 
down to the properties palette and
choose<00:02:51.640> shape<00:02:52.640> tween<00:02:53.180> you're<00:02:54.019> choosing<00:02:54.739> to

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
choose shape tween you're choosing to

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.650 
choose shape tween you're choosing to
morph<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:56.050> tween<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.410> shape<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.550> so<00:02:59.420> now<00:02:59.600> you

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
morph and tween the shape and so now you

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.420 
morph and tween the shape and so now you
notice<00:03:00.050> I<00:03:00.140> made<00:03:00.319> inside<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.739> timeline<00:03:01.010> in

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
notice I made inside the timeline in

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.979 
notice I made inside the timeline in
between<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:01.790> made<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.030> green<00:03:02.300> box<00:03:02.510> with<00:03:02.690> an<00:03:02.870> arrow

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
between I made a green box with an arrow

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.590 
between I made a green box with an arrow
that<00:03:03.800> means<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.970> shape<00:03:05.180> tween<00:03:05.390> is<00:03:05.480> in

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
that means that the shape tween is in

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.330 
that means that the shape tween is in
effect<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.200> it's<00:03:06.530> going<00:03:06.769> to<00:03:06.890> take<00:03:07.040> all<00:03:07.220> the

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
effect and it's going to take all the

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.610 
effect and it's going to take all the
rest<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.700> frames<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.260> transform<00:03:09.260> one

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
rest of the frames and transform one

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.140 
rest of the frames and transform one
shape<00:03:09.860> into<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.160> other<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:10.790> if<00:03:10.880> I<00:03:10.940> take<00:03:11.090> my

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
shape into the other so if I take my

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.620 
shape into the other so if I take my
playhead<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:12.069> drag<00:03:13.069> you'll<00:03:13.910> notice<00:03:14.269> how<00:03:14.390> it

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
playhead and drag you'll notice how it

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.460 
playhead and drag you'll notice how it
automatically<00:03:15.290> takes<00:03:15.680> one<00:03:15.890> shape<00:03:16.160> and

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
automatically takes one shape and

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.449 
automatically takes one shape and
transform<00:03:18.470> see<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.739> other<00:03:18.890> let's<00:03:19.250> see<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.430> in

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
transform see the other let's see you in

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.280 
transform see the other let's see you in
the<00:03:19.549> movie<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:20.060> commander<00:03:20.390> turn<00:03:20.600> or<00:03:20.959> PC<00:03:21.260> you

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
the movie so commander turn or PC you

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.009 
the movie so commander turn or PC you
return<00:03:21.650> PC<00:03:22.519> is<00:03:22.760> control<00:03:23.209> return<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:23.870> I'm

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
return PC is control return so I'm

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.330 
return PC is control return so I'm
taking<00:03:24.200> one<00:03:24.500> shape<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.010> next<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:27.220> if<00:03:28.220> I

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
taking one shape to the next and if I

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.830 
taking one shape to the next and if I
wanted<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.640> be<00:03:28.760> kind<00:03:28.940> of<00:03:29.060> smooth<00:03:29.329> about<00:03:29.660> the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
wanted to be kind of smooth about the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.280 
wanted to be kind of smooth about the
next<00:03:30.230> transition<00:03:30.799> I<00:03:31.040> can<00:03:31.519> actually<00:03:32.060> take<00:03:32.959> this

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
next transition I can actually take this

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.590 
next transition I can actually take this
shape<00:03:33.920> while<00:03:34.519> it's<00:03:34.730> selected<00:03:34.850> but<00:03:35.390> by

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
shape while it's selected but by

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
shape while it's selected but by
clicking<00:03:35.900> on<00:03:36.019> here<00:03:36.230> hit<00:03:36.980> command<00:03:37.310> C<00:03:37.579> and<00:03:38.620> maybe

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
clicking on here hit command C and maybe

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.009 
clicking on here hit command C and maybe
I'll<00:03:39.799> come<00:03:40.040> here<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:41.380> say<00:03:42.380> insert<00:03:42.890> timeline

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
I'll come here and say insert timeline

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.900 
I'll come here and say insert timeline
blank<00:03:45.019> keyframe<00:03:45.730> edit<00:03:46.730> paste<00:03:47.630> in<00:03:47.840> place<00:03:47.900> and

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
blank keyframe edit paste in place and

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.430 
blank keyframe edit paste in place and
morph<00:03:49.910> that<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.420> then<00:03:50.600> now<00:03:50.780> it'll<00:03:51.109> look<00:03:51.230> like

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
morph that and then now it'll look like

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.280 
morph that and then now it'll look like
it<00:03:51.650> just<00:03:51.680> transitions<00:03:52.489> itself<00:03:52.989> from<00:03:53.989> one<00:03:54.140> to

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
it just transitions itself from one to

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.620
