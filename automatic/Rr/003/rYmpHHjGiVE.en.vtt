his<00:01:23.340> main<00:01:23.610> propeller<00:01:24.030> does<00:01:24.330> spin<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.290> we've

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
his main propeller does spin but we've

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.890 
his main propeller does spin but we've
got<00:01:25.650> kind<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.189> design<00:01:26.580> flaw<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.600> here

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
got kind of a design flaw going on here

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.569 
got kind of a design flaw going on here
and<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.049> don't<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.890> mine<00:01:29.189> or<00:01:29.460> if

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and I don't know if it's just mine or if

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.670 
and I don't know if it's just mine or if
all<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.939> them<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.500> see

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
all of them are like this so you can see

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.109 
all of them are like this so you can see
the<00:01:31.829> propeller<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.310> kind<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.700> hitting<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the propeller is kind of hitting the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.050 
the propeller is kind of hitting the
back<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.170> helicopter<00:01:34.729> here's<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.790> closer

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
back of the helicopter here's a closer

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
back of the helicopter here's a closer
look<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.540> not<00:01:36.840> every<00:01:37.380> propeller<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.250> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
look it's not every propeller but you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.510 
look it's not every propeller but you
see<00:01:38.579> how<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.200> hits<00:01:40.200> these<00:01:40.439> little<00:01:40.770> lips<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
see how it hits these little lips on the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.139 
see how it hits these little lips on the
back<00:01:41.869> that's<00:01:42.869> kind<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.380> frustrating<00:01:44.030> but<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
back that's kind of frustrating but the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.940 
back that's kind of frustrating but the
small<00:01:45.390> propeller<00:01:45.750> works<00:01:46.020> great<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.649> spins

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
small propeller works great it spins

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.490 
small propeller works great it spins
really<00:01:47.159> fast<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.909> really<00:01:48.329> smooth

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
really fast and really smooth

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.540 
really fast and really smooth
as<00:01:51.870> a<00:01:52.870> box<00:01:53.260> mention<00:01:53.740> he<00:01:53.920> does<00:01:54.160> have<00:01:54.340> working

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
as a box mention he does have working

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.430 
as a box mention he does have working

and<00:02:29.930> probably<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.040> coolest<00:02:31.220> feature<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:32.060> that

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959

it's<00:02:40.310> pretty<00:02:40.579> cool<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:40.819> want<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.120> put<00:02:41.269> water<00:02:41.480> in

there<00:02:41.900> but<00:02:42.110> you<00:02:42.170> could<00:02:42.319> probably<00:02:42.440> put<00:02:42.769> flour

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
there but you could probably put flour

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.039 
there but you could probably put flour
in<00:02:43.190> there<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:43.579> pretend<00:02:43.730> it's<00:02:44.090> fire<00:02:44.360> retardant

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
in there and pretend it's fire retardant

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.589 
in there and pretend it's fire retardant
and<00:02:45.620> obviously<00:02:46.340> he<00:02:46.579> doesn't<00:02:46.790> fly<00:02:47.090> on<00:02:47.269> his<00:02:47.450> own

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
and obviously he doesn't fly on his own

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.009 
and obviously he doesn't fly on his own
but<00:02:48.049> it's<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.410> lot<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.650> fun<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.069> pretend<00:02:49.250> he<00:02:49.549> Kim

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
but it's a lot of fun to pretend he Kim
