00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
so you look outside right in the first

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.720 
so you look outside right in the first
thing<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.469> see<00:00:13.709> through<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.010> window<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.610> that

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
thing you see through the window is that

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.060 
thing you see through the window is that
the<00:00:14.820> running<00:00:15.059> conditions<00:00:15.599> are<00:00:15.719> terrible

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
the running conditions are terrible

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
the running conditions are terrible
they're<00:00:17.070> far<00:00:17.460> from<00:00:17.490> ideal<00:00:19.820> your<00:00:20.820> first

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
they're far from ideal your first

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.810 
they're far from ideal your first
inclination<00:00:21.360> is<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.840> go<00:00:22.020> back<00:00:22.200> to<00:00:22.349> bed<00:00:22.820> wait

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
inclination is to go back to bed wait

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.660 
inclination is to go back to bed wait
until<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.210> warms<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:25.039> maybe<00:00:26.039> hang<00:00:26.340> tight<00:00:26.640> until

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
until it warms up maybe hang tight until

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.130 
until it warms up maybe hang tight until
the<00:00:27.119> rain<00:00:27.300> or<00:00:27.570> snow<00:00:27.689> stops<00:00:29.990> which<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the rain or snow stops which the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.780 
the rain or snow stops which the
majority<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.650> us<00:00:31.769> would<00:00:31.920> find<00:00:32.129> completely

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
majority of us would find completely

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.190 
majority of us would find completely
reasonable<00:00:33.059> by<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> way

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.560 

but<00:00:36.770> let<00:00:36.920> me<00:00:36.950> explain<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.610> scenario<00:00:38.120> from<00:00:38.420> a

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
but let me explain the scenario from a

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.830 
but let me explain the scenario from a
different<00:00:38.960> name<00:00:39.940> because<00:00:40.940> this<00:00:41.090> is<00:00:41.240> the<00:00:41.360> exact

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
different name because this is the exact

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.810 
different name because this is the exact
situation<00:00:42.590> when<00:00:42.830> it's<00:00:42.950> most<00:00:43.160> important<00:00:43.790> to

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
situation when it's most important to

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.640 
situation when it's most important to
get<00:00:44.030> out<00:00:44.120> of<00:00:44.150> bed<00:00:44.270> to<00:00:44.990> put<00:00:45.170> your<00:00:45.290> running<00:00:45.620> shoes

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:57.860 
get out of bed to put your running shoes
on<00:00:46.010> and<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.610> head<00:00:46.790> out<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.090> front<00:00:47.330> door

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.100 

there<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.890> an<00:00:59.039> undervalued<00:00:59.570> benefit<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
there is an undervalued benefit that

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.389 
there is an undervalued benefit that
comes<00:01:01.140> from<00:01:01.500> putting<00:01:01.770> yourself<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.309> an

uncomfortable situation from forcing
yourself<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.570> little<00:01:06.600> bit

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
yourself to be just a little bit

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.030 
yourself to be just a little bit
irrational<00:01:09.320> when<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.440> look<00:01:10.619> at<00:01:10.740> those<00:01:10.830> who

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
irrational when you look at those who

have been successful what separates them

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.370 
have been successful what separates them
is<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.820> they<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.030> things<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.899> they<00:01:16.110> make

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
is that they do things and they make

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.180 
is that they do things and they make
sacrifices<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.430> others<00:01:18.000> would<00:01:18.270> not<00:01:19.190> they're

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
sacrifices that others would not they're

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.090 
sacrifices that others would not they're
the<00:01:20.340> people<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.790> study<00:01:21.090> until<00:01:21.479> 4am<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.830> wake

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the people that study until 4am or wake

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.710 
the people that study until 4am or wake
up<00:01:23.280> when<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.550> dark<00:01:23.729> outside<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.300> practice

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
up when it's dark outside to practice

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.859 
up when it's dark outside to practice
free<00:01:24.960> throws<00:01:25.610> whatever<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.790> specific<00:01:27.479> skill

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
free throws whatever the specific skill

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.210 
free throws whatever the specific skill
set<00:01:27.899> maybe<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:29.580> pattern<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.270> always<00:01:30.660> the<00:01:30.840> same

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
set maybe the pattern is always the same

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.410 
set maybe the pattern is always the same
they<00:01:32.220> were<00:01:32.280> willing<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.820> pay<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> price<00:01:33.390> that

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
they were willing to pay a price that

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.700 
they were willing to pay a price that
most<00:01:33.960> wouldn't

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
most wouldn't

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:45.920 
most wouldn't
they<00:01:36.580> wanted<00:01:37.000> it<00:01:37.120> just<00:01:37.510> a<00:01:37.630> little<00:01:37.659> bit<00:01:38.140> more

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.870 

so<00:01:46.560> what<00:01:46.710> could<00:01:46.830> this<00:01:46.950> possibly<00:01:47.190> have<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.760> do

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
so what could this possibly have to do

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.520 
so what could this possibly have to do
with<00:01:47.910> running<00:01:48.150> in<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.480> rain

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.210 

it<00:01:54.010> has<00:01:54.159> everything<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.670> do<00:01:54.880> with<00:01:54.909> it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.370 

why<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:58.180> that<00:01:58.210> when<00:01:58.420> you<00:01:58.540> run<00:01:58.750> outside<00:01:59.110> on<00:01:59.320> a

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
why is it that when you run outside on a

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.840 
why is it that when you run outside on a
cold<00:01:59.410> rainy<00:02:00.040> day<00:02:00.640> no<00:02:01.000> one's<00:02:01.180> out<00:02:01.330> there

cold rainy day no one's out there

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.550 
cold rainy day no one's out there
it's<00:02:03.450> not<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:03.930> you're<00:02:03.960> doing<00:02:04.229> anything

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
it's not because you're doing anything

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.320 
it's not because you're doing anything
that<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.220> itself<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.240> great<00:02:06.570> or<00:02:06.720> heroic<00:02:08.330> you're

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
that in itself is great or heroic you're

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.170 
that in itself is great or heroic you're
running<00:02:09.630> alone<00:02:09.840> because<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.289> sucks<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:11.640> sucks

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
running alone because it sucks it sucks

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.000 
running alone because it sucks it sucks
to<00:02:12.360> run<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.690> rain<00:02:12.930> right<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.650> have<00:02:13.739> cold

relaxing more enjoyable it's

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.100 
relaxing more enjoyable it's
uncomfortable<00:02:19.970> but<00:02:20.970> you're<00:02:21.270> out<00:02:21.420> there<00:02:21.750> when
