lightning bolt on top of it now this
really<00:01:55.780> isn't<00:01:56.020> my<00:01:56.200> design<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:57.670> is<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.480> lego

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
really isn't my design this is the lego

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.969 
really isn't my design this is the lego
ninjago<00:02:00.780> Garmadon<00:02:03.630> bouncing<00:02:04.979> little

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979

ninjago Garmadon bouncing little
lightning<00:02:06.400> bolt<00:02:06.670> thing<00:02:08.460> so<00:02:09.460> this<00:02:09.880> isn't<00:02:10.179> my

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
lightning bolt thing so this isn't my

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.200 
lightning bolt thing so this isn't my
design<00:02:10.660> but<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:12.610> think<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.970> looks<00:02:13.120> pretty

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
design but I just think it looks pretty

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.300 
design but I just think it looks pretty
cool<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.870> then<00:02:14.500> they<00:02:14.920> tried<00:02:15.460> it<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:16.150> resemble

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
cool and then they tried it to resemble

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.190 
cool and then they tried it to resemble
sidon<00:02:18.310> which<00:02:18.850> he<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.420> son<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:19.660> poseidon

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
sidon which he is the son of poseidon

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.650 
sidon which he is the son of poseidon
and<00:02:20.820> then<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:22.030> get<00:02:22.500> casual<00:02:23.760> Percy<00:02:24.760> now<00:02:25.540> we're
