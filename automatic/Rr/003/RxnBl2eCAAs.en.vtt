other thing I wanted to go over is this
the<00:02:23.190> stand<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.670> built<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:25.370> just<00:02:26.370> stand<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.270> I'm

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
the stand I built is just stand that I'm

the stand I built is just stand that I'm
going<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.570> use<00:02:27.630> for<00:02:28.700> screen<00:02:29.700> printing<00:02:30.650> and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
going to use for screen printing and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.870 
going to use for screen printing and
this<00:02:33.510> mounts<00:02:34.350> on<00:02:34.500> top<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:37.730> these<00:02:38.730> are

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
this mounts on top and these are

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.590 
this mounts on top and these are
spring-loaded<00:02:39.330> hinges<00:02:40.050> how<00:02:40.620> much<00:02:40.770> Adam<00:02:41.600> and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
spring-loaded hinges how much Adam and

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.870 
spring-loaded hinges how much Adam and
they're<00:02:43.140> adjustable<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.520> more<00:02:45.350> anyway

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
they're adjustable so the more anyway

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.190 
they're adjustable so the more anyway
the<00:02:47.880> concept<00:02:48.270> behind<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:51.170> not<00:02:52.170> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
the concept behind this is not a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.680 
the concept behind this is not a
two-by-four<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:53.040> like<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> like<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.180> 1<00:02:54.480> by<00:02:54.660> 6

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
two-by-four but like a like a 1 by 6

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.930 
two-by-four but like a like a 1 by 6
will<00:02:55.350> be<00:02:55.940> screwed<00:02:56.940> on<00:02:57.090> there<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.480> then<00:02:58.940> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
will be screwed on there and then the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.960 
will be screwed on there and then the
screen<00:03:00.270> print<00:03:02.180> does<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.450> screen<00:03:04.820> these<00:03:05.820> will

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
screen print does the screen these will

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.620 
screen print does the screen these will
be<00:03:06.090> short<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.050> just<00:03:08.040> imagine<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:09.150> see<00:03:09.330> if<00:03:09.480> I

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
be short and just imagine you see if I

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.060 
be short and just imagine you see if I
