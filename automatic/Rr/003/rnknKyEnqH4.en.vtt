00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.910
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.790
 we can see the sky is very gray at 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.200
 above the vegetable garden there are signs that 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.150
 do not deceive we arrive at the end of the summer 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.830
 we're in september another sim 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.210
 who is not deceiving is the shooters 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.240
 potatoes that start to turn yellow 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.770
 sign that the harvest is approaching so 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.270
 today for this harvest we are 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.620
 not at all in the vegetable garden where we are 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.040
 on my terrace because they are scared 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.570
 she says 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.070
 I have them cultivate this year in 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.829
 this tower so an apple tower 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.840
 earth the goal of the game it was our plant 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.399
 and that four potatoes and see 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.190
 what is the proofed we can in 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.780
 so draw bah the result was all of 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.170
 following with the harvest we will dismount the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.910
 tower 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.620
 little by little and look at the apples from 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.239
 land that we draw and immediately 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.260
 for the beans result for me 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.570
 simplify a little life it's already 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.250
 cut off all the branches 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.420
 for not being young and so 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.980
 the first step the one I'm already going 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.150
 see what happens on the surface 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:14.970
 I was already fired to shoot a little on 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:16.890
 the normal stems is that on the surface we 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.780
 has the smallest and big and small 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.640
 potatoes that we have here it's all 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.780
 simply because it is formed 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.340
 as well as those that are 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.700
 surfaces are the last ones that are 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700
 trained 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.799
 so that's what's on the surface so 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.570
 it's not fantastic in surprises for 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.920
 the moment we will remove some floors 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.530
 and because that's where 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.899
 able to dismantle the floors we arrive 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.539
 really on the lower part of the tower 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.619
 for now I do not hide that I 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.179
 am a little disappointed with their school 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.770
 because by two three small potatoes 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.329
 here and there it did not give much 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.890
 thing 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.329
 so the fact that normally the apple of 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.170
 land had to develop at each 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.000
 level and create tuber ac ac in me 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.380
 well not well animated so 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.750
 I did note that the earth was 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.599
 quite dry on the low parts so 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.069
 can that be a phenomenon 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.920
 blocking for apple growth 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.690
 of land eventually you are too 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.870
 many on the facebook page and a site 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.340
 internet having said that even in culture 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.690
 in the open field the potatoes this 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.220
 year to easter have not given much 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.620
 Was it not a year in order to 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.980
 shut up I do not know maybe it's two 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.840
 moderating element on the on the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.640
 success of this experience 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.170
 together we go we'll go see a little 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.130
 what does it look like on the end of 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.170
 the plateau stop here we wondered 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.030
 how to get out of the head tlg 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.230
 optical just a jump I put the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.329
 earth as I go to the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.329
 garden so that's pretty clean camp m 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.180
 it's not a bad thing to pass by already 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.180
 does not have much 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.140
 always 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.180
 here we come on potatoes 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.650
 a little bigger on the bottom of 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.650
 the tower it was time 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.480
 so that's the end of the experience 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.780
 potato tower for this year 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.850
 whose results are still a 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.500
 little bit for his of that 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.470
 I was waiting for my few apples 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.790
 earth but nvidia mirobolants good I 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.350
 did not expect miracles 1 you 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.000
 said the goal is not performance 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.270
 but it's the most it's me who has it 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.670
 done for that it's successful for sure 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:43.349
 after I will condemn like 7 to 2 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.030
 from the experience of one because I have 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.459
 started quite late in the year of 15 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.690
 races a little bit earlier than two the 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.190
 chosen variety might not have been 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.780
 adapted I do not remember very well the 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.550
 but I would put the name down in 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.450
 comments 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:59.580
 then the climate maybe I do not know 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.060
 early summer rainy after a little 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.650
 dry 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.750
 I do not know if it's very suitable for 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.100
 potatoes this year so to see 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.510
 I do not know if I will retry 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.800
 the experience after level material you 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.660
 said I thought it was enough 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.470
 solid is pretty well done so it's 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.600
 sure it went well 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.549
 it's easy to mount, be careful 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.900
 by denying with moisture the wood that 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.300
 swells so do not go there like a 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.610
 fake wild what I did so I 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.230
 broken a few small pieces so in 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.230
 disassembling pay attention to laizy underneath 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.190
 so see you soon for new 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.540
 experiences around soup to hesitate 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.520
 do not put your comments we go and 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.080
 then if you have experienced 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.080
 give your results also goodbye
