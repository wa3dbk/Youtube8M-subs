you<00:01:43.720> can<00:01:43.870> take<00:01:44.080> this<00:01:44.409> really<00:01:45.159> really<00:01:45.400> thick

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
you can take this really really thick

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.440 
you can take this really really thick
and<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:47.380> holds<00:01:47.560> these<00:01:47.800> great<00:01:48.130> Peaks<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:49.300> very

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
and it holds these great Peaks it's very

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.160

flexible
I<00:01:50.200> can<00:01:50.380> even<00:01:50.560> sand<00:01:50.800> it<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:51.040> could<00:01:51.159> even<00:01:51.340> carve<00:01:51.580> it

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
I can even sand it I could even carve it

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.730 
I can even sand it I could even carve it
which<00:01:51.940> is<00:01:52.060> kind<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.270> neat<00:01:52.420> if<00:01:52.600> I<00:01:53.260> want<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.560> put

which is kind of neat if I want to put

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.440 
which is kind of neat if I want to put
this<00:01:53.890> down<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.400> let<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.520> dry<00:01:54.790> I<00:01:54.820> can<00:01:55.090> put<00:01:55.240> color

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
this down and let it dry I can put color

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.390 
this down and let it dry I can put color
on<00:01:55.630> top<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.870> it<00:01:56.140> or<00:01:56.320> I<00:01:56.350> can<00:01:56.500> mix<00:01:56.770> color<00:01:57.040> into

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.070 
on top of it or I can mix color into
this<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:57.729> all<00:01:57.940> these<00:01:58.090> are<00:01:58.150> fully<00:01:58.510> intermixed

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
this and all these are fully intermixed

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.240 
this and all these are fully intermixed
will<00:01:59.290> so<00:01:59.350> you<00:01:59.409> can<00:01:59.530> do<00:01:59.620> all<00:01:59.770> sorts<00:01:59.799> of

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
will so you can do all sorts of

will so you can do all sorts of
customized<00:02:01.210> effects<00:02:01.600> with<00:02:01.840> them<00:02:02.020> so<00:02:02.290> that's<00:02:02.409> a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
customized effects with them so that's a

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.560 
customized effects with them so that's a
really<00:02:02.710> neat<00:02:02.890> one<00:02:03.070> I<00:02:03.100> like<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.520> lot<00:02:03.640> over

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
really neat one I like that a lot over

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.020 
really neat one I like that a lot over
here<00:02:04.720> we<00:02:04.840> also<00:02:04.870> have<00:02:05.110> slow<00:02:05.530> dry<00:02:05.799> medium<00:02:06.220> now<00:02:06.850> if

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
here we also have slow dry medium now if

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.160 
here we also have slow dry medium now if
you<00:02:07.120> want<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.330> get<00:02:07.450> your<00:02:07.600> paint<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:08.019> be<00:02:08.140> a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
you want to get your paint to be a

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.410 
you want to get your paint to be a
little<00:02:08.409> bit<00:02:08.679> more<00:02:09.340> slow<00:02:09.610> drying<00:02:09.850> like<00:02:10.090> an<00:02:10.209> oil

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
little bit more slow drying like an oil

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.449 
little bit more slow drying like an oil
paint<00:02:10.690> for<00:02:10.869> instance<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.470> can<00:02:11.650> add<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.430> a

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
paint for instance you can add this to a

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.240 
paint for instance you can add this to a
1<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.819> 1<00:02:12.850> ratio<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:14.260> your<00:02:14.470> paint<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:14.980> it

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
1 to 1 ratio to your paint and it

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.220 
1 to 1 ratio to your paint and it
doesn't<00:02:15.490> have<00:02:15.580> an<00:02:15.670> acrylic<00:02:15.850> binder<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.780> so

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
doesn't have an acrylic binder in it so

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.690 
doesn't have an acrylic binder in it so
you<00:02:17.590> want<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.830> make<00:02:17.950> sure<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.370> don't<00:02:18.580> go

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
you want to make sure that you don't go

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.520 
you want to make sure that you don't go
over<00:02:18.819> that<00:02:18.910> 1<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.300> 1<00:02:19.450> ratio<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.200> will<00:02:20.319> slow

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
over that 1 to 1 ratio and it will slow

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.410 
over that 1 to 1 ratio and it will slow
down<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.860> drying<00:02:21.130> rate<00:02:21.280> by<00:02:21.459> 50%<00:02:21.520> give<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.360> a

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
down the drying rate by 50% give you a

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.720 
down the drying rate by 50% give you a
lot<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.690> time<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.990> blend<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.530> over<00:02:24.100> here<00:02:24.400> let's

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
lot of time to blend and over here let's

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.070 
lot of time to blend and over here let's
say<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:24.910> want<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.090> do<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.330> opposite<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.780> want

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
say you want to do the opposite you want

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.480 
say you want to do the opposite you want
to<00:02:26.140> make<00:02:26.260> your<00:02:26.440> acrylic<00:02:26.920> paint<00:02:27.130> more<00:02:27.310> like

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
to make your acrylic paint more like

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.460 
to make your acrylic paint more like
watercolor<00:02:28.060> this<00:02:28.420> is<00:02:28.569> really<00:02:28.900> nice<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.290> flow

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
watercolor this is really nice the flow

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.920 
watercolor this is really nice the flow
improver<00:02:30.069> you<00:02:30.400> add<00:02:30.550> 10%<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.450> no<00:02:31.780> more

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
improver you add 10% of that no more

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.480 
improver you add 10% of that no more
than<00:02:32.080> 10%<00:02:32.290> because<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.860> also<00:02:32.980> doesn't<00:02:33.280> have<00:02:33.430> a

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
than 10% because it also doesn't have a

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.730 
than 10% because it also doesn't have a
binder<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.120> water<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.990> then<00:02:35.170> use<00:02:35.349> that<00:02:35.380> as

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
binder to water and then use that as

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.290 
binder to water and then use that as
your<00:02:35.890> medium<00:02:36.220> get<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.790> really<00:02:37.000> flow

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
your medium get it to really flow

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.820 
your medium get it to really flow
beautifully<00:02:37.540> like<00:02:37.959> watercolor<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.590> that's<00:02:38.709> a

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
beautifully like watercolor so that's a

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.070 
beautifully like watercolor so that's a
great<00:02:39.099> versatility<00:02:39.819> of<00:02:39.849> acrylics<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.569> then

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
great versatility of acrylics and then

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.050 
great versatility of acrylics and then
over<00:02:41.260> here<00:02:41.290> we<00:02:41.530> have<00:02:41.560> varnishes<00:02:42.250> got<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.819> matte

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
over here we have varnishes got a matte

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.730 
over here we have varnishes got a matte

and let's say the painting does get a
nick<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.370> or<00:02:54.580> something<00:02:54.910> later<00:02:55.000> on<00:02:55.240> got<00:02:55.720> a
