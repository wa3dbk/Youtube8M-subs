00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:14.119
 we continue with all field tdn Itapúa department today we are in 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.130
 the district said henao touring the springs park 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.259
 later we will be showing a month all the activities that can be 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.929
 perform in this place surrounded by nature and as we also see is 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.519
 surrounded by animals have agricultural production have a huge reserve 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:32.530
 forest 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.830
 let's get to know this place later now let's talk about yerba mate 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.060
 that also occurs in this region specifically beautiful view is the 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.010
 capital of yerba mate we were a few days ago in this place 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.050
 in 2009 aerodynamics where one of the main tasks was on the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.960
 yerba mate production a program that drives the cooperative colonias 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.300
 together we will know the summary of the general situation of this item 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.350
 yerba mate 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.980
 it's a traditional Paraguayan achievement 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.630
 that mobilizes the productive industrial and commercial sectors 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.180
 is where high domestic consumption so it generates income 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.930
 both for domestic sales and for exports 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.300
 apart from this 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.680
 it is a strategic crop from the point of view of hand occupation 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.090
 working 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.210
 the cooperative united colonies 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.380
 is working for more than 55 years in the production of this item 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.730
 and based on technological advances are prioritizing aspects 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.420
 of improvement of production techniques 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.480
 ground 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.690
 and the management of pests 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.220
 the bears we continue with the management of the plants because the pruning for the plant 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.290
 of yerba mate is fundamental to the yerba mate plan from a tree 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.570
 70 years since I raised 70 years of michoacán 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.380
 if I have to take care lee is damaged by only being damaged by plague in his touch 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.169
 to be 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.609
 always giving it a touch of power 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.799
 and also the subject of plagues that in a tribute on behalf of a crop 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.569
 p that make us human to attack pests 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.700
 and logically like this one feeding always in the same place on the ground 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.779
 I have also kept the nutrients 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:33.409
 they are using the plant using clients in 80 and that has to be 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:34.719
 go refilling 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:40.279
 any crop is soybean corn will be the producer applies about 260 kilos of 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.919
 fertilizer has almost never been applied 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.609
 for us we are in that phase of 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.289
 Hence the need for cultivation in relation to many people and we are seeing the 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:54.960
 way that you have the credit with respect and holy and apply 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.510
 in good shape we are also very interested in improving the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.409
 plants 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:06.649
 in the genetic improvement of plants have plants that produce more 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.629
 per se 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.039
 and who 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:14.029
 do not be plots of that type of plants that's why we're with these 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:15.419
 agreements with 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.639
 with the inta people of argentina 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.549
 in are working on that in those areas 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.640
 and the advice that we have is fundamental and the experience that 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.269
 we do not win too express very important for uses 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:32.489
 based on these works being carried out by the cooperative 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.579
 is driving the performance parameters of six thousand kilos per 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.249
 hectare on average that is twice the national average yield 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.829
 the manager of the yerbatera section 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.730
 expressed that the herb is a very profitable achievement for the partners of the 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.449
 cooperative 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:53.969
 the operating surface of the cooperative amounts to some three thousand 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.249
 five hundred hectares of production 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:00.699
 that generate about 20 million kilos of paper collected annually 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:06.949
 we demand others we continue v in the same way working 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.870
 of those plant lifespan are not not 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.459
 we will only be able to completely renovate a plant that has 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.539
 a structure of 30 years 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:18.539
 we can only recognize that plant from the ground 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.470
 then a technique that we are applying is learning 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.860
 we are hitting 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.550
 and that allows the yerbal 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.659
 instead of 70 years should receive more time 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.389
 yerba mate is one of the items of agro-industrial production of the 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.680
 cooperative 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.659
 currently offers to the market 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.199
 the yerba mate colón 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.979
 manufactured in the processing plant located in the city of obligated 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.289
 Itapúa department
