wits<00:00:29.169> of<00:00:29.320> fabric<00:00:29.800> simply<00:00:30.790> because<00:00:31.270> I<00:00:31.300> wanted

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
wits of fabric simply because I wanted

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
fabric and working your way up once you

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.689 
fabric and working your way up once you
have<00:00:51.190> it<00:00:51.309> up<00:00:51.429> like<00:00:51.969> this<00:00:52.589> then<00:00:53.589> what<00:00:54.399> you<00:00:54.429> want

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
usually like to go ahead and use one of

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.829 
usually like to go ahead and use one of
our<00:00:59.739> zip<00:01:00.010> locks<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:01.329> comes<00:01:01.629> with<00:01:01.749> our

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
our zip locks that comes with our

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.899 
our zip locks that comes with our
packages<00:01:02.469> and<00:01:03.390> use<00:01:04.390> this<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:05.140> hold<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:06.520> pleats

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
packages and use this to hold the pleats

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:07.980 
packages and use this to hold the pleats
in<00:01:07.210> place

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
in place

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.850 
in place
I<00:01:08.880> will<00:01:09.880> not<00:01:10.150> over<00:01:10.810> tighten<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.470> zip<00:01:11.500> lock

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
I will not over tighten the zip lock

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.070 
I will not over tighten the zip lock
because<00:01:12.550> I<00:01:12.760> will<00:01:12.910> be<00:01:13.180> needing<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:13.630> adjust<00:01:13.720> the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
because I will be needing to adjust the

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.380 
because I will be needing to adjust the

on both swags all I'm going to do is
just<00:01:24.460> simply<00:01:24.970> run<00:01:25.300> another<00:01:25.780> zip<00:01:26.110> lock<00:01:26.430> between

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
just simply run another zip lock between

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.390 
just simply run another zip lock between
the<00:01:27.670> two<00:01:27.910> zip<00:01:28.240> locks<00:01:28.510> and<00:01:28.870> have<00:01:29.770> them<00:01:30.010> meet<00:01:30.220> in

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
the two zip locks and have them meet in

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.899 
the two zip locks and have them meet in
the<00:01:30.490> middle

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.389 

this<00:01:37.450> will<00:01:37.689> bring<00:01:37.899> them<00:01:38.020> together<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:38.710> all<00:01:39.369> I

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
this will bring them together and all I
