00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the beginning so that I thought maybe

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.050 
the beginning so that I thought maybe
that's<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.619> shadow<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.189> when<00:01:35.640> he<00:01:35.759> was<00:01:35.880> being

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
that's the shadow or when he was being

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.850 
that's the shadow or when he was being
electrocuted<00:01:36.479> or<00:01:37.049> torture<00:01:37.470> or<00:01:37.590> something

electrocuted or torture or something
like<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.130> maybe<00:01:38.430> that's<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.240> way<00:01:39.360> he<00:01:39.509> looked

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.710 
gripe I have is I wish they would have
given<00:04:28.510> him<00:04:28.780> a<00:04:28.870> calf<00:04:29.280> swole<00:04:30.280> much<00:04:31.210> like<00:04:31.510> they

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
given him a calf swole much like they

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.470 
given him a calf swole much like they
did<00:04:31.960> with<00:04:32.110> cap<00:04:32.380> it<00:04:33.370> would<00:04:33.580> allow<00:04:34.030> for<00:04:34.300> better

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
did with cap it would allow for better

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.620 
did with cap it would allow for better
poses<00:04:35.139> and<00:04:35.530> better<00:04:35.980> stances<00:04:36.639> in<00:04:36.820> my<00:04:36.970> opinion<00:04:37.419> I

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
poses and better stances in my opinion I

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.980 
poses and better stances in my opinion I
mean<00:04:38.370> trying<00:04:39.370> to<00:04:39.490> do<00:04:39.730> because<00:04:40.600> of<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.840> way

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
mean trying to do because of the way

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.020 
mean trying to do because of the way
it's<00:04:41.440> been<00:04:41.650> spotted<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:42.160> head<00:04:42.340> then<00:04:42.639> it's

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
it's been spotted the head then it's

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.430 
it's been spotted the head then it's
been<00:04:43.150> sculpted<00:04:43.600> it's<00:04:43.750> very<00:04:43.930> hard<00:04:44.110> for<00:04:44.230> him<00:04:44.320> to

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
been sculpted it's very hard for him to

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.930 
been sculpted it's very hard for him to
look<00:04:44.500> up<00:04:44.680> so<00:04:44.860> you<00:04:44.950> can<00:04:45.100> do<00:04:45.220> that<00:04:45.370> scene<00:04:45.700> when

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
look up so you can do that scene when

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.940 
look up so you can do that scene when
he's<00:04:46.120> even<00:04:46.870> pushed<00:04:47.080> off<00:04:47.260> the<00:04:47.380> car<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:47.860> then

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
he's even pushed off the car and then

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.400 
he's even pushed off the car and then
he's<00:04:48.100> sliding<00:04:48.490> it's<00:04:49.389> like<00:04:49.630> sliding<00:04:49.900> like<00:04:50.200> that

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
he's sliding it's like sliding like that

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.760 
he's sliding it's like sliding like that
very<00:04:50.919> difficult<00:04:51.930> but<00:04:52.930> all<00:04:53.200> you<00:04:53.380> know<00:04:53.500> it's<00:04:53.680> a

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
very difficult but all you know it's a

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.880 
very difficult but all you know it's a
great<00:04:54.010> sculpt<00:04:54.690> articulation<00:04:55.690> good<00:04:56.350> enough<00:04:56.650> I

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
great sculpt articulation good enough I

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.730 
great sculpt articulation good enough I
mean<00:04:57.130> despite<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.730> lack<00:04:57.910> of<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.150> calf<00:04:58.750> so

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
mean despite the lack of the calf so

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.980 
mean despite the lack of the calf so
well<00:04:59.919> it's<00:05:00.190> still<00:05:00.430> a<00:05:00.730> pretty<00:05:00.970> pretty<00:05:01.419> decent

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
well it's still a pretty pretty decent

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.980 
well it's still a pretty pretty decent
so<00:05:03.750> just<00:05:04.750> for<00:05:05.380> some<00:05:05.800> size<00:05:06.190> comparison<00:05:07.000> here<00:05:07.810> is

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
so just for some size comparison here is

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.960 
so just for some size comparison here is
