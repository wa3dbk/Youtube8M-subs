former military veterans to get back

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.439 
former military veterans to get back
into<00:00:56.239> rotary<00:00:57.110> flight<00:00:57.500> again<00:00:57.830> I<00:00:58.070> myself<00:00:59.000> am<00:00:59.360> a

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
into rotary flight again I myself am a

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.619 
into rotary flight again I myself am a
former<00:00:59.690> veteran<00:01:00.140> Royal<00:01:00.470> Air<00:01:00.650> Force<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.629> the

former veteran Royal Air Force and the

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.060 
former veteran Royal Air Force and the
challenge<00:01:03.050> was<00:01:03.140> put<00:01:03.379> to<00:01:03.530> me<00:01:03.650> to<00:01:03.739> come<00:01:03.920> up<00:01:04.040> with

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
challenge was put to me to come up with

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.760 
challenge was put to me to come up with
the<00:01:04.280> system<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:04.670> allow<00:01:05.000> us<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.269> fly<00:01:05.510> it<00:01:05.930> works

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
the system that allow us to fly it works

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.160 
the system that allow us to fly it works
in<00:01:07.040> just<00:01:07.340> about<00:01:07.520> any<00:01:07.760> aircraft<00:01:08.030> we<00:01:08.720> adapt<00:01:09.050> the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
in just about any aircraft we adapt the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.290 
in just about any aircraft we adapt the
pilot<00:01:09.590> we<00:01:09.710> don't<00:01:09.890> adapt<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.550> aircraft<00:01:11.060> and

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
pilot we don't adapt the aircraft and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.060 
pilot we don't adapt the aircraft and
that's<00:01:11.930> what<00:01:12.080> makes<00:01:12.290> this<00:01:12.470> system<00:01:12.860> so

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
that's what makes this system so

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.300 
that's what makes this system so
successful<00:01:14.080> there's<00:01:15.080> three<00:01:15.380> components<00:01:16.100> to

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
successful there's three components to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.850 
successful there's three components to
the<00:01:16.430> system<00:01:16.820> all<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:17.810> primary<00:01:18.200> controls<00:01:18.650> are

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
the system all the primary controls are

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.190 
the system all the primary controls are
put<00:01:19.010> in<00:01:19.100> with<00:01:19.250> this<00:01:19.340> controller<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:20.750> has<00:01:20.990> what

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
put in with this controller it has what

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.660 
put in with this controller it has what
we<00:01:21.229> call<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.470> cooling<00:01:21.800> out<00:01:21.890> switch<00:01:22.159> on<00:01:22.370> the<00:01:22.400> top

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
we call a cooling out switch on the top

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.060 
we call a cooling out switch on the top
and<00:01:22.880> basically<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.290> two<00:01:24.470> inputs<00:01:24.860> weather

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
and basically the two inputs weather

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.070 
and basically the two inputs weather
before<00:01:25.280> word<00:01:25.640> will<00:01:25.850> be<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.000> right<00:01:26.299> leg<00:01:26.510> input<00:01:26.900> if

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
before word will be a right leg input if

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.260 
before word will be a right leg input if
we<00:01:27.770> come<00:01:27.979> backwards<00:01:28.460> it's<00:01:28.850> going<00:01:29.060> to<00:01:29.090> give<00:01:29.240> us

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
we come backwards it's going to give us

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.030 
we come backwards it's going to give us
a<00:01:29.479> left<00:01:29.690> pedal<00:01:29.990> input<00:01:30.140> which<00:01:30.680> is<00:01:30.830> going<00:01:30.979> to

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
a left pedal input which is going to

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.880 
a left pedal input which is going to
retract<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.610> leg<00:01:32.200> this<00:01:33.200> part<00:01:33.470> is<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.710> leg
