00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
those guys out before the chopper would

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.630 
those guys out before the chopper would
take<00:00:36.570> them<00:00:36.750> out<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.500> they<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.160> stand<00:00:38.520> there

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
take them out but they just stand there

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.670 
take them out but they just stand there
it's<00:00:39.239> like<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.629> can't<00:00:39.899> even<00:00:40.110> take<00:00:40.350> them<00:00:40.530> out

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
it's like you can't even take them out

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560 
it's like you can't even take them out
or<00:00:40.710> even<00:00:40.950> shoot<00:00:41.340> them<00:00:41.579> because<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.180> chopper

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
or even shoot them because the chopper

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.490 
or even shoot them because the chopper
has<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.989> kill<00:00:43.170> them<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.420> that<00:00:45.420> didn't<00:00:45.840> work<00:00:45.989> I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
has to kill them so that didn't work I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.639 
has to kill them so that didn't work I
did<00:00:46.980> try<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.430> SOG<00:00:48.059> there<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> good<00:00:49.289> spot

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
did try it in SOG there was a good spot

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.340 
did try it in SOG there was a good spot
that<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.010> thought<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.309> had<00:00:50.899> but<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.989> think<00:00:52.230> I

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
that I thought I had but I think I

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.319 
that I thought I had but I think I
actually<00:00:52.530> got<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.890> four<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.730> most<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:54.239> I

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
actually got like four at most like I

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.700 
actually got like four at most like I
can't<00:00:54.480> even<00:00:54.690> shoot<00:00:54.870> at<00:00:55.020> these<00:00:55.110> guys<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.620> they

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
can't even shoot at these guys and they

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.189 
can't even shoot at these guys and they
won't<00:00:55.890> get<00:00:56.010> taken<00:00:56.160> down<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:58.050> we're

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
won't get taken down so what we're

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.619 
won't get taken down so what we're
actually<00:00:58.350> gonna<00:00:58.680> do<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.280> move<00:00:59.940> into<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.359> next

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
actually gonna do is move into the next

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.779 
actually gonna do is move into the next
room<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.350> that's<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:02.100> we're<00:01:02.219> gonna<00:01:02.309> look<00:01:02.609> at

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
room and that's what we're gonna look at

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.939 
room and that's what we're gonna look at
getting<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.270> because<00:01:03.780> there<00:01:04.500> tends<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.860> be

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
getting it because there tends to be

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.859 
getting it because there tends to be
quite<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.820> few<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.299> these<00:01:06.390> guys<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
quite a few of these guys in here and

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.700 
quite a few of these guys in here and
obviously<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.960> cooked<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.590> too

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
obviously I cooked that a little too

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.140 
obviously I cooked that a little too
much<00:01:10.890> out<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:11.909> trying<00:01:12.030> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
much out of that I was just trying to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.300 
much out of that I was just trying to
kill<00:01:12.299> myself<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:14.369> think<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.420> think<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
kill myself so I think I think that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
kill myself so I think I think that
second<00:01:17.310> room<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.909> where<00:01:18.750> all<00:01:18.780> these<00:01:18.960> guys

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
second room here where all these guys

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.840 
second room here where all these guys
are<00:01:19.409> coming<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.770> probably<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.280> best<00:01:20.549> but

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
are coming out is probably the best but

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.499 
are coming out is probably the best but
the<00:01:20.970> thing<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:22.040> these<00:01:23.040> guys<00:01:23.310> tend<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.060> avoid

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the thing is these guys tend to avoid

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.300 
the thing is these guys tend to avoid
grenades<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.500> look<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:25.740> all<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.890> guys<00:01:26.009> okay

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
grenades like look at all the guys okay

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.649 
grenades like look at all the guys okay
so<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.580> looks<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.210> probably<00:01:27.479> gonna

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
so it looks like this is probably gonna

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.800 
so it looks like this is probably gonna
be<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.869> good<00:01:28.080> spot<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.180> quite<00:01:30.420> honest

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
be a good spot and to be quite honest

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.840 
be a good spot and to be quite honest
there<00:01:31.020> aren't<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.619> many<00:01:31.680> good<00:01:32.040> spots<00:01:32.520> in

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
there aren't that many good spots in

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.789 
there aren't that many good spots in
order<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.210> try<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.479> get<00:01:33.720> five<00:01:34.110> kills<00:01:34.500> with

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
order to try and get five kills with

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.340

frag so we're not gonna do it here and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.749 
frag so we're not gonna do it here and
so<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.200> try<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.439> cook<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.399> make<00:02:02.700> sure

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
so I try to cook it just to make sure

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.880 
so I try to cook it just to make sure
that<00:02:03.090> they<00:02:03.210> wouldn't<00:02:03.479> get<00:02:03.540> away<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.770> still

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that they wouldn't get away but I still

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.609 
that they wouldn't get away but I still
didn't<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.850> mean<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.960> frags<00:02:07.259> I

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
didn't get it I mean it the frags I

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.320 
didn't get it I mean it the frags I
don't<00:02:07.799> know<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:08.099> they're<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.910> little

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
don't know I think they're just a little

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.790 
don't know I think they're just a little
bit<00:02:09.479> underpowered<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.349> guy<00:02:10.470> could<00:02:10.530> be

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
bit underpowered like a guy could be

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.229 
bit underpowered like a guy could be
like<00:02:11.009> two<00:02:11.220> feet<00:02:11.370> away<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.819> he<00:02:11.940> doesn't<00:02:12.090> get

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
like two feet away and he doesn't get

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.770 
like two feet away and he doesn't get
