00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
the CPU is not taken off as well as we

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.600 
the CPU is not taken off as well as we
expected<00:03:15.260> but<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.470> market<00:03:16.709> has<00:03:17.160> switched

Windows 8 yeah so what what over your

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.060 
Windows 8 yeah so what what over your
boards<00:03:27.750> when<00:03:27.870> does<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:28.049> certified<00:03:28.650> what<00:03:28.980> does

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
boards when does a certified what does

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.830 
boards when does a certified what does
that<00:03:29.160> mean<00:03:29.400> we<00:03:29.910> are<00:03:29.940> working<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.480> make<00:03:30.630> all<00:03:30.810> of

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
that mean we are working to make all of

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.600 
that mean we are working to make all of
our<00:03:30.989> boards<00:03:31.320> windows<00:03:31.650> 8<00:03:31.799> certified<00:03:32.340> they're

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
our boards windows 8 certified they're

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.390 
our boards windows 8 certified they're
all<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:32.880> Windows<00:03:33.360> 8<00:03:33.540> compatible<00:03:33.870> right<00:03:34.410> but

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
all in Windows 8 compatible right but

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.370 
all in Windows 8 compatible right but
there<00:03:35.580> are<00:03:35.930> also<00:03:36.930> difference<00:03:37.230> then<00:03:37.350> between

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
there are also difference then between

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.039 
there are also difference then between
compatible<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.400> certified<00:03:38.930> compatible<00:03:39.930> is

you<00:03:40.290> will<00:03:40.410> be<00:03:40.530> able<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.769> load<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.370> board<00:03:41.610> the

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
you will be able to load the board the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.060 
you will be able to load the board the

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
board you might have to run it in a

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.759 
board you might have to run it in a
legacy<00:03:52.230> mode<00:03:52.380> okay<00:03:53.810> what<00:03:54.810> there<00:03:55.079> are<00:03:55.290> certain

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769

features necessary for official windows

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.699 
features necessary for official windows
certification<00:04:01.140> okay<00:04:01.670> those<00:04:03.260> include<00:04:04.260> the

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
certification okay those include the

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.590 
certification okay those include the
UEFA<00:04:05.610> bars<00:04:06.920> version<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.850> speed<00:04:09.329> of<00:04:09.480> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
boot time okay so with this with boot

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.460 
boot time okay so with this with boot
you<00:04:12.450> know<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.720> thing<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.900> we<00:04:13.049> take<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.320> time

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
you know the thing that we take the time

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.350 
you know the thing that we take the time
is<00:04:13.709> checking<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.640> memory<00:04:14.940> check<00:04:15.209> in

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
is checking the memory check in

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.789 
is checking the memory check in
detecting<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.840> USB<00:04:16.169> ports<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.590> stuff<00:04:16.709> like

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
detecting the USB ports and stuff like

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.170 
detecting the USB ports and stuff like
that<00:04:16.859> so<00:04:17.010> is<00:04:17.459> there<00:04:17.579> some<00:04:17.729> sort<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:17.970> way<00:04:18.120> of

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
that so is there some sort of way of

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.270

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
telling that detection off well we'd

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.310 
telling that detection off well we'd
hope<00:04:20.459> so<00:04:20.700> because
