00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
Kobe and Timmy were the greatest two of

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.309 
Kobe and Timmy were the greatest two of
their<00:02:17.189> generation<00:02:17.519> I<00:02:18.209> personally<00:02:18.780> would<00:02:19.109> put

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
was not a big deal if you put Kobe ahead

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.740 
was not a big deal if you put Kobe ahead
of<00:02:23.579> Duncan<00:02:23.909> and<00:02:24.599> Kareem<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:26.219> me<00:02:26.489> is<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.150> second

legacy that those guys bring I just

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.569 
legacy that those guys bring I just
think<00:02:57.719> that<00:02:57.750> squad<00:02:58.169> is<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.409> best<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:59.099> Jordan

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
think that squad is the best the Jordan

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.149 
think that squad is the best the Jordan
squad<00:02:59.879> is<00:03:00.150> good<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:01.019> feel<00:03:01.260> like<00:03:01.500> with

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
squad is good I just feel like with

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.179 
squad is good I just feel like with
Jordan<00:03:02.790> Wade<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:03.719> iverson<00:03:04.590> that's<00:03:04.889> pretty

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
Jordan Wade and iverson that's pretty

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.030 
Jordan Wade and iverson that's pretty
much<00:03:05.430> three<00:03:05.760> shooting<00:03:06.120> guards<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.799> don't<00:03:07.799> I

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
much three shooting guards I don't I

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.439 
much three shooting guards I don't I
don't<00:03:08.069> I<00:03:08.340> think<00:03:08.760> they<00:03:08.939> would<00:03:09.120> be<00:03:09.239> able<00:03:09.299> to

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:09.449 
don't I think they would be able to

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.530 
don't I think they would be able to
coexist<00:03:10.430> but<00:03:11.430> then<00:03:11.579> you<00:03:11.760> still<00:03:12.000> got<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.299> feed

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
coexist but then you still got to feed

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.629 
coexist but then you still got to feed

before<00:05:31.349> I<00:05:31.409> get<00:05:31.529> out<00:05:31.650> of<00:05:31.710> here<00:05:31.800> I<00:05:31.889> will<00:05:31.979> say<00:05:32.310> this

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
before I get out of here I will say this

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.939 
before I get out of here I will say this
if<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:33.240> magic<00:05:33.690> team<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.169> Jordan<00:05:34.529> team<00:05:34.740> made<00:05:34.919> a

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
if the magic team and Jordan team made a

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.730 
if the magic team and Jordan team made a
trade<00:05:35.339> and<00:05:35.610> put<00:05:35.969> weight<00:05:36.270> on<00:05:36.599> magic<00:05:37.229> steam<00:05:37.469> and

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
trade and put weight on magic steam and

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.680 
trade and put weight on magic steam and
put<00:05:38.250> Durant<00:05:38.969> on<00:05:39.409> Jordans<00:05:40.409> team<00:05:40.650> then<00:05:41.550> I<00:05:42.029> feel

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
put Durant on Jordans team then I feel

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.930 
put Durant on Jordans team then I feel
like<00:05:42.810> as<00:05:43.020> close<00:05:43.680> as<00:05:43.979> these<00:05:44.190> four<00:05:44.460> teams<00:05:44.760> are

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
like as close as these four teams are

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.519 
like as close as these four teams are
they<00:05:45.180> get<00:05:45.389> even<00:05:45.510> closer<00:05:47.510> would<00:05:48.510> be<00:05:48.750> because

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529 
they get even closer would be because

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:51.680 
they get even closer would be because
then<00:05:49.830> that<00:05:49.860> brings<00:05:50.250> down<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.639> size<00:05:51.029> level<00:05:51.570> it

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
then that brings down the size level it

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.200 
then that brings down the size level it
balances<00:05:52.289> things<00:05:52.560> out<00:05:52.830> I<00:05:53.099> don't<00:05:53.729> know<00:05:53.880> man

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210
