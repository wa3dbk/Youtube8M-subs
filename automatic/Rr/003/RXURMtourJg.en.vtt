00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
I'll show you what the variations are so

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.949 
I'll show you what the variations are so
this<00:02:03.179> one<00:02:03.360> starts<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.259> verses<00:02:04.530> are<00:02:05.959> with

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
this one starts out the verses are with

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.509 
this one starts out the verses are with
this<00:02:07.200> progression<00:02:07.739> so<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.979> starts<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.310> an<00:02:08.399> E

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
this progression so it starts on an E

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.840 
this progression so it starts on an E
minor<00:02:08.670> seven<00:02:09.590> that's<00:02:10.590> basically<00:02:11.130> ch2<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> minor

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
minor seven that's basically ch2 a minor

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.160 
minor seven that's basically ch2 a minor
with<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:13.250> g-string<00:02:14.450> instead<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.810> second

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
with the g-string instead of the second

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.800 
with the g-string instead of the second
so<00:02:17.069> that's<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.459> minor<00:02:17.700> lift<00:02:18.120> your<00:02:18.329> finger<00:02:18.690> off

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
so that's a minor lift your finger off

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.259 
so that's a minor lift your finger off
the<00:02:18.840> g-string<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.819> you<00:02:20.819> got<00:02:20.940> an<00:02:21.030> E<00:02:21.120> minor

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
the g-string and you got an E minor

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.990 
the g-string and you got an E minor
seven<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:22.079> it<00:02:22.170> goes<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.440> deep

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
seven then it goes to a deep

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.910 
seven then it goes to a deep
then<00:02:25.000> achieve

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
then achieve

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.510 
then achieve
than<00:02:27.920> an<00:02:28.040> E<00:02:28.190> minor

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.440 

back<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> minor<00:02:31.840> 7

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
back to the a minor 7

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.120 
back to the a minor 7
in<00:02:34.040> 287<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.300> d7<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.990> pretty<00:02:37.230> much<00:02:37.380> ad<00:02:37.830> but

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
in 287 and a d7 is pretty much ad but

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.920 
in 287 and a d7 is pretty much ad but
instead<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.520> with<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.849> second<00:02:39.270> fret<00:02:39.510> third

fret<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.550> high<00:02:44.610> E<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:46.010> back<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.310> am

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:17.020 

and<00:03:07.730> then<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:08.850> goes<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.650> minor<00:03:10.650> seven<00:03:11.010> again

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.880 

a<00:03:17.110> minor

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
a minor

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.320 
a minor
so<00:03:20.280> that's<00:03:20.460> just<00:03:20.640> like<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.940> first<00:03:21.180> time

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
so that's just like the first time

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.500 
so that's just like the first time
around<00:03:21.570> but<00:03:21.840> then<00:03:22.020> it<00:03:22.430> finishes<00:03:23.430> on<00:03:26.510> and

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
around but then it finishes on and

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.010 
around but then it finishes on and
that's<00:03:27.690> just<00:03:27.990> a<00:03:28.140> minor<00:03:28.620> 7<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.310> d7<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:30.210> so

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
that's just a minor 7 to d7 and so

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.600 
that's just a minor 7 to d7 and so
that's<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.500> verse<00:03:31.800> that's<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.220> pattern<00:03:32.370> you

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
that's the verse that's the pattern you

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.950 
that's the verse that's the pattern you
play<00:03:32.790> for<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.030> verses<00:03:33.420> so<00:03:33.570> again<00:03:33.810> all

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
play for the verses so again all

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:45.190 
play for the verses so again all
together<00:03:34.080> you've<00:03:34.440> got

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.760 

you

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:56.790 

you

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.730 

and<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.360> first<00:03:59.540> verse<00:03:59.900> that's<00:04:00.170> all<00:04:00.410> just

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
and in the first verse that's all just

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.590 
and in the first verse that's all just
sort<00:04:00.920> of<00:04:01.040> long<00:04:01.310> single<00:04:01.730> strums<00:04:02.150> like<00:04:02.390> I<00:04:02.480> was

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
sort of long single strums like I was

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.270 
sort of long single strums like I was
playing<00:04:02.870> it<00:04:02.990> there<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.350> in<00:04:03.890> subsequent

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
playing it there and in subsequent

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.980 
playing it there and in subsequent
verses<00:04:04.820> you<00:04:05.240> can<00:04:05.390> do<00:04:05.450> it<00:04:05.540> like<00:04:05.660> that<00:04:05.750> if<00:04:05.900> you

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
verses you can do it like that if you

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:13.410 
verses you can do it like that if you
want<00:04:06.200> or<00:04:06.380> you<00:04:06.530> can<00:04:06.560> just<00:04:06.740> strum<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:07.370> out

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.940 

whatever<00:04:14.420> so<00:04:14.900> either<00:04:15.140> way<00:04:15.380> you<00:04:15.440> want<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.709> do<00:04:15.800> it

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
whatever so either way you want to do it

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:34.770 
whatever so either way you want to do it
and<00:04:16.190> in<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.239> chorus<00:04:17.600> is<00:04:17.750> like<00:04:17.959> this

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.110 

and<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.889> progression<00:04:36.310> is<00:04:36.550> just<00:04:36.729> g<00:04:37.979> e-minor

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
and that progression is just g e-minor

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.629 
and that progression is just g e-minor
hmm<00:04:40.150> that<00:04:40.569> a<00:04:40.599> minor<00:04:40.960> 7<00:04:42.150> d7

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
hmm that a minor 7 d7

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.279 
hmm that a minor 7 d7
and<00:04:45.639> strumming<00:04:46.209> pattern<00:04:46.539> wise<00:04:46.719> it's<00:04:47.109> just

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
and strumming pattern wise it's just

00:04:47.289 --> 00:05:05.290 
and strumming pattern wise it's just
like<00:04:47.439> this

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.520 

and<00:05:06.300> then<00:05:06.389> it<00:05:06.479> goes<00:05:06.599> back<00:05:06.780> into<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.110> verse<00:05:07.259> and

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530

and then it goes back into the verse and
the<00:05:07.620> whole<00:05:07.860> song<00:05:08.159> is<00:05:08.430> just<00:05:08.990> verse-chorus

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990

the<00:05:13.229> end<00:05:13.970> there's<00:05:14.970> a<00:05:15.030> bit<00:05:15.150> of<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.300> key<00:05:15.479> change

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810

with<00:05:18.330> that<00:05:18.479> key<00:05:18.659> change<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.199> when<00:05:19.289> you're

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
with that key change and when you're

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:20.899 
with that key change and when you're
playing<00:05:19.620> over<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:19.889> key<00:05:20.039> change<00:05:20.340> its<00:05:20.729> these
