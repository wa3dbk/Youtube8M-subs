00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.190
 however, the result of the sanction is now 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.039
 West as they say on the face course 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.020
 dollar today rose to 50 7 with 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.420
 half rubles setting a new 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.130
 historical maximum euro in its 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.770
 queue also imitated on Moscow 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.020
 the exchange now it costs almost 70 rubles 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.950
 experts explain this shortage 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.680
 foreign currency 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.690
 demand exceeds supply from here 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.359
 the price increases and the quantity increases 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.730
 speculation because of this hundreds of people can 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.760
 be literally in the street of speech 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.680
 about those who took a mortgage in the currency in these 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.200
 minutes at the central bank building begins 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.329
 rally when you are set up and loans 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.910
 attracted not high interest and 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.380
 quick approval and now because 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.850
 the weakening of the ruble many 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.410
 bona fide customers have become 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.969
 insolvent 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 Our correspondent works at the rally 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.920
 alexey dotsenko u is now coming out with us 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.210
 Directly communication Alexey Hello 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.450
 tell what they want 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.450
 protesters 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.970
 hello tatyana gathered here 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.619
 today about the central bank want so 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.930
 say stay afloat and not 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.700
 go broke every day to pay 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.350
 currency loss and more and more difficult 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.010
 some already do not have such 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.750
 opportunities 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.369
 half a year ago these people even 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.260
 could not assume that like this 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.530
 simultaneously become potential 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.810
 homeless but experts advise two 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.180
 possible options to transfer your currency 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.150
 for a ruble mortgage or ask 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.009
 bank deferment of loan repayment 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.630
 But those who came here offer 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.610
 let's solve your problem 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.770
 let's hear what 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.030
 today we want to achieve the central bank 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.430
 just one 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.090
 to set the currency corridor 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.760
 there is from the interest rate that was 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.580
 under contracts maximum plus 15 percent 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.440
 or will we all be on the street and 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.240
 requests to solve this problem on 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.640
 state level format in 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.940
 tripartite state banks 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.420
 borrowers 2008 I started paying on 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.610
 course 24 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.830
 for the dollar paid 1200 dollars well then 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.890
 it happened somewhere in the region of 30-35 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.620
 Now at the moment I pay 70,000 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.630
 rubles at the rate of 55 at the moment 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.500
 today more than well, I have a passport 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.500
 transferred you to develop 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.880
 In fairness , I must say what else 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.709
 half a year ago central bank management 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.360
 offered the investor to transfer currency 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.430
 ruble loss but not all 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.680
 heard it or not all turned out 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.500
 or else today these people are real 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.150
 hostages of the situation , many do not even 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.880
 not enough money for food 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.400
 loan repayment and here with one of these 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.400
 families met my colleague she derkach 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.590
 one year old people playing the soldiers of the elder 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.810
 brother of basil dolls mom and dad i'm not 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.000
 buy and even Santa Claus is now hardly 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.920
 put them under the Christmas tree because 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.599
 that parents have a mortgage in dollars 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.060
 every day in scattering all or only 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.569
 would not be worse only you do not go only you 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.550
 not worse 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.380
 this syndrome maria jokingly calls 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.380
 currency addiction every morning 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.340
 constant ritual view the dollar rate 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.140
 a graduate diploma she is already 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.550
 understands the financial exchange and even 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.890
 learned to make predictions 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.410
 otherwise the monthly payment does not eat up 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.450
 80 percent of the family budget and from that 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.130
 How much is a dollar today ? 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.380
 how much money they will live 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.760
 tomorrow I have greatly reduced costs 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.330
 Soap on these all sorts of washing 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.910
 powders 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.420
 I probably even became wet wipes 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.580
 choose others ie those who 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.549
 cheaper Mary and her husband took a mortgage five 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.319
 years ago, 265 thousand dollars was enough for 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.810
 microscopic dvushku on the outskirts 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.940
 Moscow to the beginning of the crisis extinguished a third 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.310
 long but a jump in the dollar multiplied 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.769
 balance for a few days now to the bank 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.200
 they owe 9 million rubles instead 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.940
 initial 6 if in a situation 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.709
 it turns out that we can not pay 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.160
 there we will naturally have to return 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.620
 Bank apartment in which we live 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.169
 here and even stay with two three 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.299
 millions of debts in the debts of Grigory you 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.430
 not yet climbed but the family but direct from 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.870
 Petersburg is on the verge of being threatened 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.550
 the education of the son of a platnik and 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.410
 psychological state of the head 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.270
 family of vitali on the hospital 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.580
 a few months gets a penny 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.990
 salary and unable to feed a family and 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.230
 insatiable mortgage 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.080
 what awaits us after the new year 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.970
 can't even imagine spring in 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.870
 the month of April we will have to pay more 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.090
 annual insurance is more than monthly 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.220
 we now have a payment 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.030
 and if we previously could afford 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.980
 somewhere to go to the theater to the cinema then generally 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.960
 over the course of these 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.050
 especially now we are not at all 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.700
 allow ourselves to the case after the crisis 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.920
 2008 foreign currency loans have lost their former 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.900
 popularity but those who decided to play 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.090
 this russian roulette is still 1000 y 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.220
 banks have assistance mechanisms such 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.440
 to customers but in fact they do not take off 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.360
 financial burden the first option is to take 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.580
 new loan in rubles and pay off 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.250
 foreign exchange that because of the mad course at all 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.880
 not profitable for borrower 2 to go for credit 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.740
 holidays 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.300
 but here again there is no guarantee that after 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.400
 them dollar will bounce back 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.620
 there is also a third option to agree 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.260
 experts consider it the best 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.689
 There are banks that I think are 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.459
 correctly offered 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:37.159
 let's say if possible 

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:40.620
 restructure your debt 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:42.900
 a few percentage points decrease 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.610
 no mortgage rates 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.100
 another family of such offers from banks 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.500
 loss of profit is not clear yet 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.660
 state close to aspirations panic people 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.580
 are going to go to the central bank to demand 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.680
 freeze currency rates for borrowers 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.780
 yet mary is on maternity leave with two children 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.030
 working remotely at night helping her husband 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.530
 pull monthly payment projected 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.570
 experts substantial attenuation 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.490
 currencies in the coming months 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.410
 to wait not worth it, Sergei Derkach 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.699
 bondarenko alexander ivanov andrey without 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:13.320
 surnames and larisa raevskaya world 24 but 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.660
 time at the mortgage agency 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.120
 Housing Lending, however, was told that 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.840
 see the need to help currency 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.840
 borrowers
