00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello everyone this month in flat six 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.180
 magazines we offer you a try 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.799
 quite exceptional this porsche 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.530
 that you have in front of you in the footsteps 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.269
 quite a one it's a singer singer 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.179
 he is a craftsman of genius based in 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.789
 california who decided to recreate some 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.680
 old-fashioned porsche on the basis of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.359
 newer models and in fact it's a 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.970
 true concept that is absolutely 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.740
 extraordinary that we will try 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.949
 on a on a long course pretty much 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.300
 in the 1500 km to summarize very quickly 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.620
 the singer 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.329
 alain bazille 6964 from 1992 totally 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.239
 transformed the body is totally 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.329
 entirely made of carbon with a motor 3 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.699
 liters of 360 horses and an interior 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.650
 with a quite amazing finish 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.559
 the whole of a cocktail completely 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.550
 explosive that we're going to explore with 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.550
 you for several days 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.870
 Oh 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.990
 we 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.590
 the 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.040
 imagine a 911 rally porsche that 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.810
 would have been dressed by a big 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.349
 dressmaker 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.760
 imagine an old-fashioned 911 porsche and 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.670
 who would not have sacrificed much 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.440
 I feel of a modern 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.870
 the singer it's a little bit all that a 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.270
 concept 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.950
 little wonder it's very upscale 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.570
 this is a model that we will make a 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.600
 tremendous pleasure during the 1500 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.040
 kilometers from this trip there is everything 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.750
 that it is necessary especially on small 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.660
 roads it's absolutely great there is the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.490
 the chassis the brakes the engine all there 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.990
 is at the same time in an environment 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.420
 quite amazing there is especially this 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.870
 music that you heard during 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.310
 during this video during this test 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.170
 just hope that she will not be 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.640
 too much copied because it's a 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.380
 concept is so interesting 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.670
 so innovative all that will interest 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.510
 a lot of people 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.890
 at all times 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.890
 for the moment lna and moon 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.620
