00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.750
 welcome back to everyone today we are ready with 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.610
 another video all for you one 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.039
 very simple decoration that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.529
 we will realize with imposing we will realize a 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.680
 tuft that you can use as 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:28.619
 decoration for your plan 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:34.200
 they start right away so I have my leek 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.660
 already washed and dried cut the porn 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.860
 of the height that more than me 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.739
 it affects the higher the more it is cut 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.719
 the decoration will be born higher 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.730
 so if I have to put it in a dish 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.239
 it will suffice to say this height 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.949
 here if I want to use it instead like 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.920
 as a dip in a composition it can 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:01.500
 doing even higher did one thing 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:05.600
 intermediate then arrives here carried out 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.880
 this first cut yes we say there is 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.570
 a leaf that comes off so this is 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.450
 we can therefore eliminate it 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:22.970
 make incisions laterally on the 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:26.820
 on our choir we cut 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:32.130
 we can have three cut it into four 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.049
 also in six in six segments 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.020
 since the choir I have now in hand 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.609
 it's a lot 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.549
 tight is small as they plant time 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:49.039
 difficult to make the quarry there 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:52.039
 we can do 66 wedges a little 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.539
 closer or 4 a little wider than I 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:02:01.340
 for simplicity 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:03.319
 I'll show you how to make it 4 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.219
 so I practice an incision not up to 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:16.489
 first fund up to this height here on i 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:23.120
 two sides and then still half coming 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:27.020
 almost there is here 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.150
 you exactly four 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.470
 at this point it is child's play yes 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.970
 keeps out the first the first leaf it 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.970
 then wanting we can pin it 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:50.110
 then we must do nothing but 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:53.160
 praying from within 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.020
 the next leaves 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.020
 in this way with brown 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.019
 and go ahead 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.310
 more leaf 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.030
 at some point I'll find the part 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:20.420
 green of the leek and can decide if 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.900
 let it protrude cut it to bend 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.900
 also 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.659
 here 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.470
 once folded all the leaves like 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.590
 what is the result 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.689
 at this point you can decide whether to keep 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.769
 the tuft straight like this or 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.769
 cut it to the height 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:15.590
 height of your food so this is 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.590
 a 4 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:30.260
 let 's say the four-beer bow 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:36.250
 four petals see with me how it comes 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.250
 instead you are so I make a first cut 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.460
 divido will allow here I do second 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.940
 cut on the other side and here I have to 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:54.979
 split into two thirds while the e is here 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:05:00.220
 a third I make a cut not another 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.220
 third the same here 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.590
 without getting to the same end 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:18.150
 leave the first leaf out and start 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:20.910
 to bend here is the result is 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:25.500
 definitely a bigger and more flower 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:29.600
 articulated because you are six petals like 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:36.720
 see I bent up to five 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:38.640
 petals 5 leaves inward le 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:46.020
 external leaves can be felt in 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:47.220
 so that the appearance of a first 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.350
 leaf 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.260
 You saw that I cut a movie 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.660
 porn a little longer then how you 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.610
 I said before a flower came to me more 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:02.340
 big I had cut closer to 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:05.750
 base her a lower flower here too 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:10.220
 I can decide to keep the bow here 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.220
 maybe fraying the bit more 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.979
 or if to cut it completely if 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.979
 trim it with 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:34.050
 and trim it with eco cut it here and 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:34.050
 trim it what the other leaves do 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:45.440
 this decoration does not allow can 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:50.380
 be prepared in advance is served 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.380
 on the plate at the last moment 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:02.260
 as you have seen then the decoration 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:05.030
 very very simple to make 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.670
 beautiful effect does not always seem one 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:12.010
 star with this is our everything 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.010
 determined at the next tutorial, etc.
