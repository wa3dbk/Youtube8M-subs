pretty much it I wish that the this head
unit<00:02:15.510> was<00:02:16.080> iPod<00:02:16.680> friendly<00:02:17.130> though<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.580> could

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
pretty cool but they'll be probably

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.360 
pretty cool but they'll be probably
another<00:02:24.870> project<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.740> town<00:02:26.040> really<00:02:26.280> have

enough money to afford a different one

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.710 
enough money to afford a different one
right<00:02:27.900> now<00:02:28.050> because<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.530> one<00:02:28.740> sounds<00:02:28.920> fine

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720

right now I'm probably gonna go ahead
and<00:02:34.520> get<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.550> better<00:02:35.700> amp<00:02:36.030> because<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.630> one<00:02:36.750> I

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
and get a better amp because the one I

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.630

a 400-watt yeah 400 or 500 my speakers

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.030 
a 400-watt yeah 400 or 500 my speakers
say<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:47.340> RMS<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.660> 350<00:02:49.660> on<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.870> subs<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.530> really

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
say the RMS is 350 on the subs so really

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.150 
say the RMS is 350 on the subs so really
I'm<00:02:51.160> only<00:02:51.280> putting<00:02:51.550> 200<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.630> each<00:02:52.990> one<00:02:53.260> so

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
I'm only putting 200 to each one so

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.470 
I'm only putting 200 to each one so
they're<00:02:54.340> kind<00:02:54.520> of<00:02:54.580> underpowered<00:02:54.970> right<00:02:55.360> now

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
they're kind of underpowered right now

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.810 
they're kind of underpowered right now
they<00:02:55.870> sound<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.230> lot<00:02:56.350> better<00:02:56.620> but<00:02:56.860> before<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:57.640> get

but there's an upgrade from this one

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.390 
but there's an upgrade from this one
because<00:03:20.800> it's<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.070> older<00:03:21.880> model<00:03:22.240> but<00:03:22.450> um<00:03:23.410> the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
because it's the older model but um the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.860 
because it's the older model but um the
newer<00:03:24.610> model<00:03:25.030> has<00:03:25.270> a<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.850> don't<00:03:27.940> know<00:03:28.090> it's

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
newer model has a I don't know it's

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.690 
newer model has a I don't know it's
bluetooth<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.650> can<00:03:29.740> connect<00:03:30.160> your<00:03:30.250> iPhone

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
bluetooth so you can connect your iPhone

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.070 
bluetooth so you can connect your iPhone
or<00:03:30.880> something<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.450> but<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.720> doesn't<00:03:31.870> have

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
or something to it but it doesn't have

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.100 
or something to it but it doesn't have
an<00:03:32.170> auxilary<00:03:32.560> port<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.250> know<00:03:33.940> that<00:03:34.270> iPods<00:03:34.810> are

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
an auxilary port I know that iPods are

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.500 
an auxilary port I know that iPods are
don't<00:03:35.740> have<00:03:35.920> Bluetooth<00:03:36.190> aren't<00:03:36.790> friendly

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
don't have Bluetooth aren't friendly

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.830 
don't have Bluetooth aren't friendly
like<00:03:37.720> that<00:03:37.990> I<00:03:38.020> wish<00:03:38.380> they<00:03:38.560> did<00:03:38.770> but<00:03:39.450> yeah<00:03:40.450> so

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
like that I wish they did but yeah so

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.180 
like that I wish they did but yeah so
that's<00:03:41.020> why<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.200> stuck<00:03:41.530> with<00:03:41.650> this<00:03:41.830> model

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
that's why I stuck with this model

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.960 
that's why I stuck with this model
because<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.580> has<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.880> auxilary<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:44.880> then<00:03:45.880> the

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
because it has the auxilary but then the

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.520 
because it has the auxilary but then the
other<00:03:46.120> one<00:03:46.330> that<00:03:46.360> I<00:03:46.630> think<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.930> face<00:03:47.140> flips

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
other one that I think the face flips

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.430 
other one that I think the face flips
down<00:03:47.740> put<00:03:48.130> in<00:03:48.220> CDs<00:03:48.610> and<00:03:49.170> but<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.290> don't

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
down put in CDs and but I don't

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.470 
down put in CDs and but I don't
know<00:03:50.560> if<00:03:50.680> it's<00:03:50.800> attached<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.150> reason<00:03:52.390> I

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
know if it's attached and the reason I

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.810 
know if it's attached and the reason I
got<00:03:52.510> this<00:03:52.810> one<00:03:53.080> too<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:54.250> because<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.640> can

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
got this one too is because you can

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.120 
got this one too is because you can
detach<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.420> which<00:03:55.780> you've<00:03:56.200> all<00:03:56.380> probably

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130

attaches<00:04:00.130> real<00:04:00.340> nice<00:04:00.520> goes<00:04:01.360> in<00:04:01.570> really<00:04:01.750> easy<00:04:02.820> I

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
attaches real nice goes in really easy I

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.990 
attaches real nice goes in really easy I

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:18.469 
whatever it's called the line my trunk

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:20.899 
whatever it's called the line my trunk
because<00:06:19.469> I<00:06:19.650> heard<00:06:19.830> that<00:06:20.009> it<00:06:20.189> makes<00:06:20.550> the<00:06:20.729> bass

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
because I heard that it makes the bass

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:24.709 
because I heard that it makes the bass
sound<00:06:21.270> better<00:06:21.529> it<00:06:22.529> doesn't<00:06:22.969> leak<00:06:23.969> so<00:06:24.449> if<00:06:24.629> you

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:24.719 
sound better it doesn't leak so if you

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.559 
sound better it doesn't leak so if you
have<00:06:24.840> like<00:06:24.960> air<00:06:25.229> leaks<00:06:25.469> or<00:06:25.740> anything<00:06:25.919> that

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:26.569 
have like air leaks or anything that

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.140 
have like air leaks or anything that
bass<00:06:27.569> can<00:06:27.870> get<00:06:28.020> out<00:06:28.169> of<00:06:28.349> air<00:06:28.680> and<00:06:28.979> it<00:06:29.909> just

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
bass can get out of air and it just

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.600 
bass can get out of air and it just
passes<00:06:30.360> up<00:06:30.870> I<00:06:31.159> think<00:06:32.159> there's<00:06:32.340> there's

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610
