00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.650
 the 11-year-old chiara was allowed for this 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.420
 top meeting joyce sombroek interviewer 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.460
 blog about the two at hockey club 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.049
 typical each other comes in kia joice it 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.420
 ins and outs of your questions 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.130
 keeperstas and mine asks 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.560
 you object most in the boom 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.850
 which feature and last crimpers so 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.130
 very awesome 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.619
 What a great question so I think if 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.869
 goalkeeper must dare with you anyway 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.890
 yes it should not be afraid of the ball like that 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.320
 grow door 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.290
 yes and it is also very happy it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.040
 can be distinctive so a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.300
 make a difference 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.500
 my penalty corner penalty ball so there is 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.260
 properties that of keeper whole 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.000
 be important with your door with 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.280
 are mentally strong 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.800
 that is the pose grace but also that you 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.129
 switch very quickly like a ball in 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.730
 is not going either 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.930
 And that the art is not exciting 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.609
 to go 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.690
 And in addition, it is very handy if you like 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.690
 you are agile and real 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.990
 lay in between by sitting in it 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.990

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.530

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.560
 as a cage would be one and the same amounts 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.500
 go around like it and what would your package 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.800
 the transfer amount must be long 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.530

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.340

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.050
 audience that once god born but yes that 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.700
 depends on how much people like it 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.100
