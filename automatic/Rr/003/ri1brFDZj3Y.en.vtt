headers 5 series compares to a 3 series
we<00:00:43.500> also<00:00:43.649> went<00:00:43.950> ahead<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.250> focused<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
we also went ahead and focused on the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.299 
we also went ahead and focused on the
wiring<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:46.200> controls<00:00:46.770> most<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.250> these

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
wiring that controls most of these

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.270 
wiring that controls most of these
functions<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.000> throttle<00:00:48.780> body<00:00:49.100> starter<00:00:50.100> and

functions here throttle body starter and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.479 
functions here throttle body starter and
so<00:00:51.030> forth<00:00:51.649> where<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.920> was<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.640> same<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
so forth where it was the same and the

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.439 
so forth where it was the same and the
525<00:00:56.489> had<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.149> same<00:00:57.710> connection<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:59.030> the<00:01:00.030> one

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
525 had the same connection as the one

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.590 
525 had the same connection as the one
in<00:01:02.120> those<00:01:03.120> connections<00:01:03.600> were<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> same<00:01:03.989> ok

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
in those connections were the same ok

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.910 
in those connections were the same ok
this<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.810> engine<00:01:07.140> from<00:01:07.320> an<00:01:07.439> x5<00:01:08.210> 3.05<00:01:09.210> 2502<00:01:10.140> and

this connection was from an o2 325
completely<00:01:14.939> different<00:01:16.820> ok<00:01:17.820> now<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.060> move

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
completely different ok now we move

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.060 
completely different ok now we move

that is the DME or the brain for the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.389 
that is the DME or the brain for the
computer<00:01:51.479> right<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:52.040> differences<00:01:53.040> see<00:01:53.280> how

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
computer right here differences see how

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.109 
computer right here differences see how
it<00:01:53.549> goes<00:01:54.200> from<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.979> here<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.850> forth

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
it goes from here to here and so forth

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.840 
it goes from here to here and so forth
so<00:01:57.450> we'll<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.719> talking<00:01:57.899> about<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:59.100> this

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
so we'll be talking about this in this

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.350 
so we'll be talking about this in this
video<00:02:00.979> ok<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.640> wiring<00:02:03.060> harness

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
video ok so this is the wiring harness

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.719 
video ok so this is the wiring harness
to<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.540> 5<00:02:03.810> series<00:02:04.200> usually<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.520> blue

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
to the 5 series usually the blue

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.700 
to the 5 series usually the blue
connections<00:02:06.299> connect<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.960> transmission

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
connections connect to the transmission

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.550 
connections connect to the transmission
and<00:02:08.750> I'm<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.140> go<00:02:10.289> ahead<00:02:10.379> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
and I'm not going to go ahead and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.589 
and I'm not going to go ahead and
explain<00:02:10.830> where<00:02:11.370> each<00:02:11.610> connection<00:02:12.030> goes<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
explain where each connection goes to

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.850 
explain where each connection goes to
hopefully<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.020> can<00:02:13.110> figure<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.560> out

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
hopefully you can figure that out

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.700 
hopefully you can figure that out
okay<00:02:14.550> we're<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.600> doing<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.110> quick<00:02:16.320> overview

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
okay we're just doing a quick overview

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.150 
okay we're just doing a quick overview
here<00:02:17.070> this<00:02:17.880> connection<00:02:18.710> compared<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.950> this

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
here this connection compared to this

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.910 
here this connection compared to this
3.0<00:02:20.970> x5<00:02:21.570> engine<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:24.330> right<00:02:24.600> here<00:02:24.960> we<00:02:25.500> compare

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
3.0 x5 engine this right here we compare

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.740 
3.0 x5 engine this right here we compare
them<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.250> they're<00:02:26.340> about<00:02:26.400> they<00:02:27.090> have<00:02:27.600> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
them and they're about they have the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.750 
them and they're about they have the
similar<00:02:28.230> connections<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.070> know<00:02:29.190> where<00:02:29.400> this

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
similar connections you know where this

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.680 
similar connections you know where this
blue<00:02:30.120> one<00:02:30.300> here<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:31.470> down<00:02:32.250> there<00:02:32.460> somewhere

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
blue one here is down there somewhere

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.210 
blue one here is down there somewhere
the<00:02:33.690> relays<00:02:34.110> are<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.470> same<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:36.950> yeah<00:02:37.950> these

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
the relays are the same so yeah these

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.760 
the relays are the same so yeah these
are<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.490> same<00:02:38.700> now<00:02:39.480> let's<00:02:39.630> go<00:02:39.780> through<00:02:39.990> 46

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
are the same now let's go through 46

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.710 
are the same now let's go through 46
engine<00:02:41.990> ok<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.110> e46<00:02:43.670> wiring<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.210> DME

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
engine ok the e46 wiring to the DME

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.090 
engine ok the e46 wiring to the DME
transmission<00:02:46.230> get<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> little<00:02:46.800> bit<00:02:46.920> more

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
transmission get a little bit more

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.610 
transmission get a little bit more
confusing<00:02:47.390> especially<00:02:48.390> with<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.110> engine

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
confusing especially with this engine

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.190 
confusing especially with this engine
because<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.190> was<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> menu<00:02:50.810> it's<00:02:51.810> gonna<00:02:51.930> have

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
because it was a menu it's gonna have

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.350 
because it was a menu it's gonna have
less<00:02:52.440> wires<00:02:52.770> because<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.820> didn't<00:02:54.150> have<00:02:54.330> a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
less wires because it didn't have a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.800 
less wires because it didn't have a
transmission<00:02:54.959> transmission<00:02:56.030> computer<00:02:57.030> so

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
transmission transmission computer so

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.220 
transmission transmission computer so
but<00:02:58.250> mostly<00:02:59.250> 46<00:02:59.940> it's<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.390> whole<00:03:00.630> separate<00:03:01.050> wire

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
but mostly 46 it's a whole separate wire

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.560 
but mostly 46 it's a whole separate wire
you<00:03:01.560> see<00:03:01.740> that<00:03:03.650> right<00:03:04.650> there<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.700> then<00:03:06.090> pretty

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
you see that right there and then pretty

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.260 
you see that right there and then pretty
much<00:03:06.690> these<00:03:07.200> connections<00:03:07.890> are<00:03:08.160> for<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:11.270> o2

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
much these connections are for the o2

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.080 
much these connections are for the o2
sensors<00:03:12.720> all<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.470> connections<00:03:13.980> for<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.910> back

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
sensors all the connections for the back

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.380 
sensors all the connections for the back
of<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.330> light<00:03:15.510> somewhere<00:03:16.440> here<00:03:16.650> right<00:03:16.830> here

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
of the light somewhere here right here

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.790 
of the light somewhere here right here
transmission<00:03:18.390> backup<00:03:18.720> light<00:03:18.930> now<00:03:19.650> I'm

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
transmission backup light now I'm

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.280 
transmission backup light now I'm
guessing<00:03:20.070> if<00:03:20.430> this<00:03:20.670> was<00:03:20.940> an<00:03:21.239> automatic<00:03:22.610> engine

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
guessing if this was an automatic engine

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.050 
guessing if this was an automatic engine
automatic<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.470> will<00:03:25.590> also<00:03:25.890> have<00:03:26.100> wires<00:03:26.400> for

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
automatic it will also have wires for

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.360 
automatic it will also have wires for
the<00:03:27.470> transmission<00:03:28.470> computer<00:03:29.040> which<00:03:29.220> it

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
the transmission computer which it

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.199 
the transmission computer which it
doesn't<00:03:29.700> but<00:03:30.690> as<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:30.900> can<00:03:31.019> see<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.470> e46<00:03:32.209> has

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
doesn't but as you can see the e46 has

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.560 
doesn't but as you can see the e46 has
different<00:03:33.959> wiring<00:03:34.340> harnesses<00:03:35.400> this<00:03:36.360> one's

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
different wiring harnesses this one's

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.920 
different wiring harnesses this one's
removable<00:03:37.110> completely<00:03:37.709> removable<00:03:38.130> here<00:03:38.930> same

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
removable completely removable here same

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.479 
removable completely removable here same
thing<00:03:40.170> here<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.590> one<00:03:40.709> that<00:03:40.830> goes<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.220> side

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
thing here the one that goes to the side

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.960 
thing here the one that goes to the side
is<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.730> little<00:03:41.910> bit<00:03:42.120> different<00:03:42.480> okay<00:03:43.640> so<00:03:44.640> those

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
is a little bit different okay so those

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.150 
is a little bit different okay so those
are<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.330> differences<00:03:46.200> what<00:03:47.010> this

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
are the differences what this

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.110 
are the differences what this
information<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.910> gonna<00:03:48.060> help<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.709> or<00:03:49.709> gonna

help you when you want to go ahead and
for<00:03:52.680> example<00:03:52.950> again<00:03:53.400> by<00:03:53.670> an<00:03:54.090> engine<00:03:54.840> from<00:03:55.769> a

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
for example again by an engine from a

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.960 
for example again by an engine from a
525<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.030> they<00:03:57.780> tell<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.080> how<00:03:58.260> about<00:03:58.350> 325<00:03:58.970> you

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
525 and they tell you how about 325 you

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.699 
525 and they tell you how about 325 you
don't<00:04:00.120> know<00:04:00.269> already<00:04:00.450> offhand<00:04:01.110> that<00:04:01.200> you're

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
don't know already offhand that you're

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.140 
don't know already offhand that you're
you're<00:04:02.160> not<00:04:02.190> gonna<00:04:02.430> be<00:04:02.640> able<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.970> do<00:04:03.120> a

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
you're not gonna be able to do a

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.790 
you're not gonna be able to do a
straight<00:04:03.480> swap<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:04.110> know<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.290> can<00:04:04.500> just<00:04:04.650> go

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
straight swap you know you can just go

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.890 
straight swap you know you can just go
ahead<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.010> put<00:04:05.970> in<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.239> engine<00:04:06.600> from<00:04:06.810> a

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
ahead and put in the engine from a

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.110 
ahead and put in the engine from a
3-series<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.650> your<00:04:07.769> 5<00:04:08.010> series<00:04:08.370> you're<00:04:09.000> gonna

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
3-series to your 5 series you're gonna

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.240 
3-series to your 5 series you're gonna
have<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.570> go<00:04:09.690> ahead<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:09.989> change<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.560> wiring

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
have to go ahead and change the wiring

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.020 
have to go ahead and change the wiring
schematics<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:12.900> make<00:04:13.049> sure<00:04:13.080> you<00:04:13.350> get<00:04:14.030> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
schematics so make sure you get the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.399 
schematics so make sure you get the
wiring

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409 
wiring

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.259 
wiring
information<00:04:18.409> here<00:04:18.829> so<00:04:19.819> again<00:04:19.909> there's<00:04:20.180> a

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
information here so again there's a

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.460 
information here so again there's a
fight<00:04:20.569> series<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.639> x5<00:04:22.639> 3.0<00:04:23.419> models<00:04:23.810> have

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
fight series and x5 3.0 models have

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.149 
fight series and x5 3.0 models have
about<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:25.039> same<00:04:25.879> plugs<00:04:26.750> in<00:04:26.990> terms<00:04:27.259> of<00:04:27.440> the

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:28.159 
about the same plugs in terms of the

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.490 
about the same plugs in terms of the
wiring<00:04:28.580> harness<00:04:28.879> the<00:04:29.720> only<00:04:29.900> difference<00:04:30.289> is

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
wiring harness the only difference is

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.939 
wiring harness the only difference is
the<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:31.280> this<00:04:31.550> e<00:04:31.729> 46<00:04:32.300> model<00:04:32.629> later<00:04:33.440> on<00:04:33.680> we're

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
the is this e 46 model later on we're

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.980 
the is this e 46 model later on we're
gonna<00:04:34.069> go<00:04:34.340> ahead<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.729> pull<00:04:35.120> out<00:04:35.300> an<00:04:35.539> engine

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
gonna go ahead and pull out an engine
