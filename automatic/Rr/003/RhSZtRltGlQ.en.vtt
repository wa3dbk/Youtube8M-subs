00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:13.609
 This is a good time point. 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:17.589
 the one who wants it too and the one here also, but besides that, she's still 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:22.580
 a supersport that exists of more sophisticated on two wheels as well as 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:23.759
 mine 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.729
 just like mine because you still have the pope's finger when they move from the dead 

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:29.380
 just like this 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.970
 just like this 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.520
 but if they have all this in common after all what will be that is different 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.520
 between them 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.429
 but you will need the genius of the same person 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.429
 Massimo Tamburini 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.830
 is not a name of the most famous here but this man who is for the 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.820
 motorcycles as well as pinifarina with that of a diary that stand for the charges 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.100
 served by the style of the two wheels it has already been called 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.540
 ansa by massimo tamburini 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.510
 always managed to do 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.350
 lines as well as beautiful functional and later 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.480
 in terms of aerodynamics 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.480
 of beauty resistance 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.060
 we open this is perhaps the most unknown of the three 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.840
 the company came up with ways to run, and today it works to be 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.090
 recognized as manufactured dreams in exclusivity 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.660
 something like a blacksmith's two sizes 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.030
 you can lose 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.800
 but two months working out a piece that many people practically 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.659
 that I could see 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.659
 want to stay inside the motorshow too are hand carved 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:19.949
 the couple finished 2008 applied 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.049
 luciana security 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.279
 the brake discs are larger 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.869
 the track has the same differentiated structure 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:27.949
 It will decide 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:31.589
 the most advanced braking system ever the fighter and a motorcycle 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.060
 Imagine that I have 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.069
 10 to 15% more performance on each item of a sports motorcycle ' 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.890
 conventional yesterday at 15% there plus brake I can abuse one more 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.099
 curve input has an additional 15 percent and stability in a 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:56.049
 it's a cool thing here or until the present day in the day-to-day of the bike 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:03:01.129
 is a pen drive after you finish walking with it you just connect one 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.239
 computer where currently information about speed position 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.229
 of the accelerator image affected by the internet or even for those who want 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.959
 put a pin to know what was his performance upon death 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.569
 this being the green city with the energy spent 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.969
 that 312 would not be suitable or not this number in at least for now is the 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.969
 she can achieve nothing bad right. 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:46.389
 at the time of making the curve one more touch of time 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.239
 the clutch 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.229
 Do you know why she would be? 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:52.460
 the rear technician 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.760
 when you brake very hard at the intake of curvim reduces with drought the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.660
 1 the motor brake only that the wheel wheel rear wheel is practically coming in a 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.490
 believe that the front brake then reduces the possibility of 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.520
 locking or keep the bike on the rail at a tank entrance 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.690
 it's a famous something else 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.690
 in venice 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:19.079
 It has more to do with your style.
