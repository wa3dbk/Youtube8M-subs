from<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.520> software<00:02:00.000> itself<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:01.369> there<00:02:02.369> you

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
from the software itself and there you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.600 
from the software itself and there you
go<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:02.909> if<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.570> give<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:04.520> second<00:02:05.520> to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
go so if we just give it a second to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.330 
go so if we just give it a second to
initialize<00:02:06.229> we<00:02:07.229> start<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:10.039> wait<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
initialize we start the wait for the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.850 
initialize we start the wait for the
widgets<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.879> stuff<00:02:12.150> if

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
widgets and stuff if

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.620 
widgets and stuff if
go<00:02:13.100> into<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.730> way<00:02:13.820> you<00:02:13.850> check<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.240> if<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:14.480> go

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
go into the way you check it if you go

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.290 
go into the way you check it if you go
into<00:02:14.840> your<00:02:14.930> Settings<00:02:15.350> menu<00:02:15.730> go<00:02:16.730> into<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.090> same

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
into your Settings menu go into the same

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.820 
into your Settings menu go into the same
pace<00:02:17.540> where<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:17.900> went<00:02:18.080> before<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:18.680> that's

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
pace where you went before so that's

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.810 
pace where you went before so that's
about<00:02:19.220> device<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:20.110> then<00:02:21.110> here<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:22.580> build

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
about device and then here the build

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.820 
about device and then here the build
number<00:02:23.150> will<00:02:23.300> change<00:02:23.330> as<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:24.410> can<00:02:24.560> see<00:02:24.680> this

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
number will change as you can see this

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.160 
number will change as you can see this
was<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.040> different<00:02:25.490> build<00:02:25.640> number<00:02:25.940> before<00:02:26.170> so

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
was a different build number before so

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.600 
was a different build number before so
now<00:02:27.320> it's<00:02:27.470> change<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.070> new<00:02:28.220> update<00:02:28.580> and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
now it's change to the new update and

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.970 
now it's change to the new update and
that's<00:02:31.610> basically<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.680> you'll<00:02:33.680> get<00:02:33.800> this

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
that's basically it and you'll get this

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.620 
that's basically it and you'll get this
much<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.400> say<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.820> device<00:02:35.090> has<00:02:35.270> successfully

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
much to say the device has successfully

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.480 
much to say the device has successfully
been<00:02:35.990> updated<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:36.950> was<00:02:37.100> just<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> quick
