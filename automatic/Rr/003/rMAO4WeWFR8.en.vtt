00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.520
 How are you 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.410
 hi friends today we are going to make a cream 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.560
 of towns and apple you can take 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.230
 both cold and hot is very 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.169
 similar to one more bitches to make 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.279
 this apple cream and towns we are going to 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.279
 need the following ingredients 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.280
 some large towns we will use already 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.110
 only the white part has to be washed 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.760
 well because they do not usually have a little bit 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:46.730
 of earth an apple 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:51.390
 butter cream for cooking 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.750
 water salt black pepper and then to 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.710
 decorate the cream with ham sticks 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.119
 let's start a casual on fire and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.119
 we are going to put the ladybug 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.280
 once we have melted the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.290
 butter we're going to put the eggs 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.290
 that we have cut them into discs 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.660
 and we also add the apple 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.680
 we will remove it a little bit so that 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.680
 go suffering a little 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.840
 we see some laps and now we are going to 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.840
 throw the water 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.079
 and also a cube of chicken broth 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.409
 that when the 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:47.700
 ingredients I forgot to put it 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.700
 where will we be a little bit 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.500
 we will remove and let cook all the 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.500
 vegetables already simmered covered 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.700
 we remove it and let it do 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.670
 while it's finished boiling we're going to 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.860
 put the pepper the salt is not the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.560
 we still put it because we will try it 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.060
 then it is not a case that we are left 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.840
 too strong with the moment and has 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.840
 let it rain 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.650
 while the leeks are boiling 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.780
 of the apple we are going to fry the ham that 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.780
 We have cut into very thin strips so 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.540
 we will put in a little pan what 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.540
 we have to let cook a lot 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.290
 it does not have to be crispy 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.290
 we will pour a little oil very little 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.280
 and we will remove 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.599
 in doing we already have it crispy and 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.420
 now we will put them on top of a paper 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.100
 of cooking so that it is left over 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.140
 leftover oil 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.390
 extinguish them also already the fire 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.390
 we've let it cook for 15 minutes 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.670
 now let's beat the leeks and the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.780
 apple we will leave a little broth 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.540
 that is going to remain in the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.230
 casserole because otherwise we would be left 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.230
 too much liquid 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.400
 we will also add the milk cream and 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.400
 now to beat 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.280
 plus 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.750
 we must add the broth that has 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.650
 left over because we have a cream left 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.650
 too thick 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.460
 we have tasted it of salt and it is sweet and 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.460
 we add I am to taste 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.430
 finally we will serve our cream 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.040
 if you see that you have very thick you 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.629
 you can add a little more water or 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.629
 cream of milk to your liking 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.290
 to finish we will put over the 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.290
 crispy ham 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.680
 good friends and friends already have ready 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.080
