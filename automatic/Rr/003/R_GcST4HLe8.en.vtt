00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
quite different for me because everyone

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.050 
quite different for me because everyone
would<00:02:51.769> tell<00:02:52.010> me<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.400> should<00:02:52.610> string<00:02:52.880> your

would tell me you should string your
hair<00:02:53.269> you<00:02:53.569> should<00:02:53.780> do<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:54.049> to<00:02:54.170> your<00:02:54.260> hair<00:02:54.349> why

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
hair you should do this to your hair why

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.890 
hair you should do this to your hair why
did<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.130> this<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.700> I'm<00:02:55.970> thinking<00:02:56.420> why

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
did you like this and I'm thinking why

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.830

is<00:02:56.959> your<00:02:57.170> hair<00:02:57.349> straight<00:02:57.680> because<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.690> like<00:02:59.690> my

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
is your hair straight because I like my

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.449 
is your hair straight because I like my
hair<00:03:00.019> natural<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.709> mean<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.010> think<00:03:01.250> it's

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
hair natural and I mean I think it's

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.390 
hair natural and I mean I think it's
better<00:03:01.760> it's<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.209> better<00:03:02.360> choice<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:03.400> it's

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
better it's a better choice and it's

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.550 
better it's a better choice and it's
just<00:03:04.790> easier<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.450> deal<00:03:05.720> with<00:03:05.750> rather<00:03:06.260> than

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
just easier to deal with rather than

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.559 
just easier to deal with rather than
people<00:03:07.069> think<00:03:07.370> it's<00:03:07.519> easier<00:03:07.819> to<00:03:07.940> deal<00:03:08.540> with

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
people think it's easier to deal with

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.690 
people think it's easier to deal with
straightened<00:03:09.200> hair<00:03:09.380> because<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:10.400> don't<00:03:10.579> have
