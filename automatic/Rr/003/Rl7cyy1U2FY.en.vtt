00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
all the time and two minutes seems to be

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.189 
all the time and two minutes seems to be
the<00:04:59.110> magic<00:04:59.560> number<00:05:00.449> if<00:05:01.449> you<00:05:01.660> do<00:05:01.840> them<00:05:02.020> for

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
the magic number if you do them for

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.250 
the magic number if you do them for
three<00:05:02.440> minutes<00:05:03.000> what's<00:05:04.000> going<00:05:04.210> to<00:05:04.240> happen<00:05:04.630> the

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
three minutes what's going to happen the

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.920 
three minutes what's going to happen the
moisture<00:05:05.740> inside<00:05:06.039> the<00:05:06.729> mushroom<00:05:07.150> is<00:05:07.360> going<00:05:07.870> to

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
moisture inside the mushroom is going to

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.420 
moisture inside the mushroom is going to
really<00:05:08.169> come<00:05:08.410> out<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:08.830> when<00:05:08.949> you<00:05:09.039> bite<00:05:09.220> into

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
really come out and when you bite into

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.320 
really come out and when you bite into
it<00:05:09.610> you're<00:05:09.820> going<00:05:09.880> to<00:05:10.030> get<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.449> very<00:05:10.870> mushy<00:05:11.289> bite

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
it you're going to get a very mushy bite

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.879 
it you're going to get a very mushy bite
so<00:05:13.330> you<00:05:13.389> really<00:05:13.780> want<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.080> keep<00:05:14.380> within<00:05:14.650> that

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
so you really want to keep within that

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.969 
so you really want to keep within that
two<00:05:15.190> minute<00:05:15.460> mark<00:05:15.960> so<00:05:16.960> I'll<00:05:17.050> just<00:05:17.229> do<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.800> rest
