into<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.570> into<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.250> bullet<00:00:18.199> um<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.439> is

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
into the into the the bullet um this is

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.349 
into the into the the bullet um this is
gonna<00:00:19.560> be<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> nine-millimeter<00:00:20.640> but<00:00:21.330> uh

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
gonna be a for a nine-millimeter but uh

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.370 
gonna be a for a nine-millimeter but uh
it<00:00:22.320> should<00:00:22.500> be<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:23.039> same<00:00:23.250> for<00:00:23.279> almost<00:00:24.380> any

it should be the same for almost any
type<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.070> suggest<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.180> order<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.570> make<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
type I suggest in order to make the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.620 
type I suggest in order to make the
little<00:00:28.859> aluminum<00:00:29.369> thing<00:00:29.789> you're<00:00:30.269> gonna<00:00:30.390> put

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
little aluminum thing you're gonna put

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.900 
little aluminum thing you're gonna put
in<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:30.779> there's<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.309> small

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
in here there's going to be a small

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.740 
in here there's going to be a small
primer<00:00:33.660> hole<00:00:34.430> first<00:00:35.430> off<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:36.030> use<00:00:36.180> like<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> hole

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
primer hole first off to use like a hole

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.720 
primer hole first off to use like a hole
punch<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.950> punch<00:00:38.250> through<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
punch and just punch through the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.090 
punch and just punch through the
aluminum<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.719> make<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.350> get<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> perfect<00:00:40.950> circle

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
aluminum to make to get a perfect circle

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.910 
aluminum to make to get a perfect circle
and<00:00:41.520> second<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:43.079> you're<00:00:43.230> using<00:00:43.379> your<00:00:43.649> drill

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
and second when you're using your drill

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.180 
and second when you're using your drill
bit<00:00:43.950> make<00:00:44.670> sure<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.149> at<00:00:45.780> least<00:00:45.960> grind<00:00:46.920> off<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
bit make sure to at least grind off a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.790 
bit make sure to at least grind off a
little<00:00:47.460> bit<00:00:47.640> off<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.000> edge<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.469> as

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
little bit off the edge so it's not as

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.240 
little bit off the edge so it's not as
sharp<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.420> this<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.739> completely

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
sharp as this as it's just completely

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.520 
sharp as this as it's just completely
flat<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.780> size<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.110> Volterra

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
flat and one of the size of Volterra

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.430 
flat and one of the size of Volterra
will<00:00:56.129> start<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.730> tearing<00:00:57.090> up<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:58.410> just

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
will start to tearing up this it just

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.549 
will start to tearing up this it just
takes<00:00:58.980> trial<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.670> error<00:00:59.879> basically<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.260> as

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
takes trial and error basically so as

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.650 
takes trial and error basically so as
you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.980> see<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:03.000> slightly

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
you can see this one is just slightly

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.590 
you can see this one is just slightly
bigger<00:01:04.220> big<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.760> still<00:01:05.970> move<00:01:06.119> around<00:01:06.420> in

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
bigger big you can still move around in

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.320 
bigger big you can still move around in
there<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.280> then<00:01:08.960> next<00:01:09.960> step<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.619> get<00:01:10.920> this

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
there and then next step is to get this

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.840 
there and then next step is to get this
and<00:01:12.860> then<00:01:13.860> cut<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.310> little<00:01:14.970> little<00:01:15.869> slits

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
and then cut out little little slits

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.120 
and then cut out little little slits
little<00:01:17.850> slits<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.570> side<00:01:19.229> just<00:01:20.060> small<00:01:21.060> ones

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
little slits on the side just small ones

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.350 
little slits on the side just small ones
alright<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.610> see<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
alright as you can see here I have the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.929 
alright as you can see here I have the
same<00:01:24.630> disc<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.189> see<00:01:26.369> there's<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.700> bunch

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
same disc as you can see there's a bunch

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.600 
same disc as you can see there's a bunch
of<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.240> slits<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:28.560> over<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.009> all<00:01:29.369> over

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
of little slits all over this all over

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.060 
of little slits all over this all over
the<00:01:29.729> side<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:32.180> of<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> primer<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.070> now

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the side of the of the primer so now

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.640 
the side of the of the primer so now
what<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.400> do<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.329> place<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.810> right<00:01:37.200> over

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
what you do is you place it right over

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.999 
what you do is you place it right over
the<00:01:37.770> hole<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.720> I'm<00:01:40.020> trying<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:40.890> this

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the hole you get I'm trying to do this

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.639 
the hole you get I'm trying to do this
with<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.460> hand<00:01:41.810> which<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.020> little<00:01:43.409> bit<00:01:43.470> more

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
with one hand which is a little bit more

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.539 
with one hand which is a little bit more
harder<00:01:44.479> but<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.540> try<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.170> as

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
harder but you try to get it as

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.219 
harder but you try to get it as
perfectly<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> center<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.570> of

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
perfectly to the center as you can of

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.880 
perfectly to the center as you can of
all<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.619> lines<00:01:50.990> this<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.200> happens<00:01:52.740> is

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
all your lines this is what happens is

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.230 
all your lines this is what happens is
that<00:01:52.920> all<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.369> lines<00:01:53.610> when<00:01:53.850> they<00:01:53.970> start

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
that all the lines when they start

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.450 
that all the lines when they start
bending<00:01:54.420> into<00:01:54.780> each<00:01:54.990> other<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.530> start<00:01:56.189> creating

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
bending into each other I start creating

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.649 
bending into each other I start creating
a<00:01:56.810> bigger<00:01:57.810> hole<00:01:58.460> like<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.729> as<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.509> see

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
a bigger hole like that as you can see

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.139 
a bigger hole like that as you can see
there<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.560> outside<00:02:02.009> edges<00:02:02.369> already<00:02:02.850> starting

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
there the outside edges already starting

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.280 
there the outside edges already starting
to<00:02:03.180> bent<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.229> now<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.360> now<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:07.079> go

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
to bent so now you have a so now you go

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.139 
to bent so now you have a so now you go
in<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.129> start<00:02:08.340> hammering<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.819> little<00:02:09.030> bit

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
in and just start hammering a little bit

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:09.930 
in and just start hammering a little bit
harder

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
harder

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.670 
harder
just<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.060> get<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.360> primer<00:02:11.720> pocket<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.560> can

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
just to get the primer pocket you can

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.290 
just to get the primer pocket you can
see<00:02:12.860> already<00:02:12.980> took<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.370> check<00:02:13.760> out<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.060> drill

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
see already took a check out the drill

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.830 
see already took a check out the drill
bit<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:15.500> see<00:02:16.400> it's<00:02:16.550> already<00:02:16.790> sent<00:02:17.270> down<00:02:17.569> as

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
bit and see it's already sent down as

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.000 
bit and see it's already sent down as
you<00:02:18.560> can<00:02:18.709> see<00:02:18.920> in<00:02:19.069> there<00:02:19.250> like<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.620> primer<00:02:21.620> I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
you can see in there like the primer I

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.400 
you can see in there like the primer I
mean<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.580> little<00:02:22.910> pocket<00:02:23.450> for<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.959> primaries

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
mean the little pocket for the primaries

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.059 
mean the little pocket for the primaries
in<00:02:24.560> there<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:25.750> licking<00:02:26.750> wall<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.769> I'm<00:02:27.890> just

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
in there and licking wall so I'm just

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.250 
in there and licking wall so I'm just
gonna<00:02:28.190> take<00:02:28.400> something<00:02:28.640> small<00:02:28.910> not<00:02:29.690> actually

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
gonna take something small not actually

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.449 
gonna take something small not actually
hit<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:31.700> try<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.360> pop<00:02:32.599> it<00:02:32.810> out<00:02:32.930> or<00:02:34.209> see<00:02:36.459> sky

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
hit it just try to pop it out or see sky

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.540 
hit it just try to pop it out or see sky
this<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.569> harder<00:02:38.870> with<00:02:39.019> one<00:02:39.200> hand<00:02:39.410> okay<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.430> I

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
this is harder with one hand okay so I

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.630 
this is harder with one hand okay so I
got<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.880> into<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.180> hole<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.450> just<00:02:41.600> pop<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.959> out

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
got it into the hole and just pop it out

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.380 
got it into the hole and just pop it out
see<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.760> came<00:02:43.970> out<00:02:44.239> so<00:02:45.819> these<00:02:46.819> primers<00:02:47.120> are

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
see it came out so these primers are

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.190 
see it came out so these primers are
actually<00:02:47.780> um<00:02:49.090> me<00:02:50.090> as<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:50.450> can<00:02:50.630> let<00:02:50.989> me<00:02:51.049> try<00:02:51.170> to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
actually um me as you can let me try to

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.289 
actually um me as you can let me try to
get<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.530> close<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.980> camera<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:53.000> can<00:02:53.150> see

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
get it close to the camera you can see

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.900 
get it close to the camera you can see
their<00:02:53.480> little<00:02:53.510> cups<00:02:54.349> so<00:02:55.160> basically<00:02:55.580> when<00:02:55.880> you

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
their little cups so basically when you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
their little cups so basically when you
put<00:02:56.180> them<00:02:56.330> into<00:02:56.480> inside<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.380> primer<00:02:57.709> though

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
put them into inside the primer though

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.390 
put them into inside the primer though
you<00:02:59.930> already<00:03:00.080> have<00:03:00.380> filled<00:03:00.950> up<00:03:01.160> with<00:03:01.340> a

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
you already have filled up with a

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.900 
you already have filled up with a
whatever<00:03:01.880> powder<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:03.709> anvil<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.549> ambu

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
whatever powder and the anvil the ambu

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.210 
whatever powder and the anvil the ambu
you<00:03:05.060> actually<00:03:05.390> get<00:03:05.599> it<00:03:05.720> off<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.200> real<00:03:06.860> primer

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
you actually get it off the real primer

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.210 
you actually get it off the real primer
for<00:03:07.519> this<00:03:07.730> but<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.660> just<00:03:08.840> basically<00:03:09.769> put<00:03:10.099> it

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
for this but you just basically put it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.199 
for this but you just basically put it
put<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:10.730> in<00:03:10.849> there

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
put it in there

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.690 
put it in there
doesn't<00:03:11.599> matter<00:03:11.720> if<00:03:11.959> it's<00:03:12.080> like<00:03:12.549> blocky<00:03:13.549> on

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
doesn't matter if it's like blocky on

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.340 
doesn't matter if it's like blocky on
the<00:03:13.850> top<00:03:14.090> because<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.720> moment<00:03:15.109> you<00:03:15.230> actually

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
the top because the moment you actually

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.310 
the top because the moment you actually
strike<00:03:15.920> it<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.910> pressure<00:03:17.239> within<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.720> primer

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
strike it the pressure within the primer

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.590 
strike it the pressure within the primer
will<00:03:18.650> start<00:03:18.980> actually<00:03:19.329> expanding<00:03:20.329> all<00:03:20.480> the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
will start actually expanding all the

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.050 
will start actually expanding all the
walls<00:03:20.810> around<00:03:21.109> it<00:03:21.350> Internet<00:03:21.950> yes<00:03:22.430> again<00:03:22.940> all

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
walls around it Internet yes again all

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.680 
walls around it Internet yes again all
the<00:03:23.209> gases<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.260> escape<00:03:24.670> inside<00:03:25.670> this<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.209> so

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
the gases to escape inside this and so

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.420 
the gases to escape inside this and so
this<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:27.049> going<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.260> basically<00:03:27.440> seal<00:03:28.010> itself

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
this is going to basically seal itself

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.090 
this is going to basically seal itself
off<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:28.730> moment<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.359> actually<00:03:29.660> gets<00:03:29.810> struck<00:03:30.230> so

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
off a moment it actually gets struck so

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.059 
off a moment it actually gets struck so
that's<00:03:31.489> something<00:03:32.359> for<00:03:32.390> this<00:03:32.720> primer<00:03:33.079> I'm

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
that's something for this primer I'm

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.220 
that's something for this primer I'm
just<00:03:34.430> showing<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.730> straight<00:03:35.510> off<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.959> primer

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
just showing you straight off the primer

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.330 
just showing you straight off the primer
like<00:03:36.440> that<00:03:36.709> but<00:03:37.370> um<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:38.540> would<00:03:38.720> actually<00:03:39.340> get

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
like that but um you would actually get

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.030 
like that but um you would actually get
a<00:03:40.400> little<00:03:40.639> anvil<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.510> little<00:03:42.380> animal<00:03:42.799> from<00:03:42.980> the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
a little anvil a little animal from the

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.270 
a little anvil a little animal from the
from<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.030> actual<00:03:44.269> primer<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:45.280> sometimes

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
from the actual primer and sometimes

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.920 
from the actual primer and sometimes
it's<00:03:46.459> hard<00:03:46.609> sometimes<00:03:46.970> it's<00:03:47.389> hard<00:03:47.540> taking<00:03:47.840> off

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
it's hard sometimes it's hard taking off

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.870 
it's hard sometimes it's hard taking off
an<00:03:48.109> anvil<00:03:48.290> from<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.829> primer<00:03:49.100> but<00:03:49.730> what<00:03:49.850> I

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
an anvil from the primer but what I

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.970 
an anvil from the primer but what I
would<00:03:50.000> do<00:03:50.269> is<00:03:50.450> just<00:03:50.720> soak<00:03:51.260> it<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:51.440> little<00:03:51.709> bit<00:03:51.859> in

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
would do is just soak it a little bit in

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.629 
would do is just soak it a little bit in
water<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.609> then<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.959> now<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:54.739> then<00:03:54.889> just<00:03:55.130> get

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
water and then and now and then just get

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.849 
water and then and now and then just get
a<00:03:55.670> little<00:03:55.910> small<00:03:56.380> something<00:03:57.380> and<00:03:57.530> just<00:03:57.560> start

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
a little small something and just start

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.590 
a little small something and just start
scraping<00:03:58.340> because<00:03:58.970> usually<00:03:59.150> there's<00:03:59.510> a

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
scraping because usually there's a

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.099 
scraping because usually there's a
leftover<00:04:00.670> dust<00:04:01.670> on<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.180> on<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.569> primers<00:04:02.989> in

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
leftover dust on the on the primers in

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.729 
leftover dust on the on the primers in
order<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:03.440> get<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:04.600> anvil<00:04:05.600> off<00:04:05.720> but<00:04:06.590> yeah

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
order to get the the anvil off but yeah

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.840 
order to get the the anvil off but yeah
it's<00:04:06.980> going<00:04:07.130> to<00:04:07.190> look<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.459> little<00:04:07.579> bit<00:04:07.790> like

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
it's going to look a little bit like

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.270 
it's going to look a little bit like
this<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.480> sometimes<00:04:09.019> it<00:04:09.470> goes<00:04:09.829> a<00:04:09.859> little<00:04:10.100> bit

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
this and sometimes it goes a little bit

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.629 
this and sometimes it goes a little bit
deeper<00:04:11.380> this<00:04:12.380> pocket<00:04:12.859> I<00:04:13.010> mean<00:04:13.220> this<00:04:13.340> primer

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
deeper this pocket I mean this primer

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.020 
deeper this pocket I mean this primer
goes<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:14.269> little<00:04:14.510> bit<00:04:14.720> deeper<00:04:15.019> then<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:16.190> it's

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
goes a little bit deeper then and it's

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.509 
goes a little bit deeper then and it's
not<00:04:17.180> completely<00:04:17.780> as<00:04:18.140> flat<00:04:18.500> but

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
not completely as flat but

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.760 
not completely as flat but
on<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:21.090> only<00:04:21.329> problem<00:04:21.720> you<00:04:22.410> wouldn't<00:04:22.650> really

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
on the only problem you wouldn't really

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.439 
on the only problem you wouldn't really
have<00:04:22.949> any<00:04:23.099> problems<00:04:23.550> because<00:04:23.819> a<00:04:23.849> firing<00:04:24.240> pin

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
have any problems because a firing pin

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:25.670 
have any problems because a firing pin
should<00:04:24.599> be<00:04:24.750> at<00:04:24.840> least<00:04:25.020> long<00:04:25.259> enough<00:04:25.289> to

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
should be at least long enough to

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.659 
should be at least long enough to
actually<00:04:25.830> strike<00:04:26.759> this<00:04:27.000> but<00:04:28.220> other<00:04:29.220> than<00:04:29.430> that

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
actually strike this but other than that

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.540 
actually strike this but other than that
it's<00:04:30.270> actually<00:04:30.659> better<00:04:30.900> if<00:04:31.080> it's<00:04:31.229> al<00:04:31.590> if<00:04:32.310> it's

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
it's actually better if it's al if it's

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.730 
it's actually better if it's al if it's
not<00:04:32.759> protruding<00:04:33.569> out<00:04:33.720> of<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.900> boat<00:04:34.169> out<00:04:34.349> of

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
not protruding out of the boat out of

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.399 
not protruding out of the boat out of
the<00:04:34.860> bullet<00:04:35.190> because<00:04:35.280> in<00:04:35.610> case<00:04:36.270> like<00:04:36.569> when<00:04:37.259> it

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
the bullet because in case like when it

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.529 
the bullet because in case like when it
chambers<00:04:37.770> around<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.759> might<00:04:39.300> actually

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
chambers around it might actually

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.510 
chambers around it might actually
accidentally<00:04:40.440> fire<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:40.949> so<00:04:41.099> it's<00:04:41.250> better<00:04:41.400> to

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
accidentally fire it so it's better to

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.589 
accidentally fire it so it's better to
be<00:04:41.639> inside<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.900> let<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.169> find<00:04:43.560> pin<00:04:43.830> hit<00:04:44.069> that

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
be inside and let the find pin hit that

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.619 
be inside and let the find pin hit that
but<00:04:45.599> that's<00:04:45.870> how<00:04:46.139> you<00:04:46.199> do<00:04:46.560> these<00:04:47.370> primers<00:04:47.789> I'm

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
but that's how you do these primers I'm

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.890 
but that's how you do these primers I'm
just<00:04:48.900> gonna<00:04:49.020> deep<00:04:50.009> Prime<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.520> right<00:04:50.699> now<00:04:50.900> put

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
just gonna deep Prime it right now put

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.909 
just gonna deep Prime it right now put
it<00:04:52.020> over<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.319> hole<00:04:52.620> put<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.610> little<00:04:54.620> thing<00:04:55.620> and

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
it over a hole put it a little thing and

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.559 
it over a hole put it a little thing and
I'm<00:04:55.979> not<00:04:56.009> going<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.280> push<00:04:56.430> it<00:04:56.550> up<00:04:56.909> put<00:04:57.270> a<00:04:57.300> lot<00:04:57.509> of

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
I'm not going to push it up put a lot of

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.050 
I'm not going to push it up put a lot of
pressure<00:04:57.810> because<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.259> don't<00:04:58.650> want<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.860> damn<00:04:59.699> it

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
pressure because I don't want to damn it

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.640 
pressure because I don't want to damn it
damage<00:05:00.509> this<00:05:01.470> uh<00:05:02.449> this<00:05:03.449> one<00:05:03.630> I<00:05:03.659> did<00:05:03.990> but<00:05:04.470> as<00:05:04.560> you

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
damage this uh this one I did but as you

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.980 
damage this uh this one I did but as you
can<00:05:04.740> see<00:05:04.800> everybody<00:05:05.250> pop<00:05:05.669> it<00:05:05.849> off<00:05:06.000> wait<00:05:08.990> it

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
can see everybody pop it off wait it

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.709 
can see everybody pop it off wait it
comes<00:05:10.229> out

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:13.719 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:15.509 

and<00:05:14.110> it's<00:05:14.649> just<00:05:14.830> a<00:05:14.919> little<00:05:15.069> piece<00:05:15.279> of<00:05:15.309> aluminum

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:15.519 
and it's just a little piece of aluminum

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:19.739 
and it's just a little piece of aluminum
so<00:05:16.509> it<00:05:16.749> should<00:05:16.899> be<00:05:17.049> pretty<00:05:17.199> easy<00:05:17.349> to<00:05:17.559> make
