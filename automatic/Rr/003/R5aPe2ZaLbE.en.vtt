yeah<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.730> yeah<00:00:42.210> yeah<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:44.309> way<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.700> it's

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
yeah it is yeah yeah the way that it's

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.850 
yeah it is yeah yeah the way that it's
done<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> diagram<00:00:45.870> there<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.320> nearly

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
done in the diagram there is nearly

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.760 
done in the diagram there is nearly
impossible<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.850> play<00:00:48.030> even<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.930> an<00:00:49.410> awesome

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
impossible to play even for an awesome

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.490 
impossible to play even for an awesome
guitar<00:00:49.950> player<00:00:50.370> um<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.289> takes<00:00:52.440> a

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
guitar player um it is this just takes a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.840 
guitar player um it is this just takes a
lot<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.710> pressure<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> would<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:53.670> is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
lot of pressure so what I would do is

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.670 
lot of pressure so what I would do is
don't<00:00:54.120> worry<00:00:54.329> about<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.930> last<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:55.620> at

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
don't worry about this last one here at

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.060 
don't worry about this last one here at
the<00:00:55.770> bottom<00:00:56.270> just<00:00:57.270> focus<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.410> B<00:00:58.649> note

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the bottom just focus on the B note

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.369 
the bottom just focus on the B note
though<00:00:59.430> at<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> bottom<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.109> those

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
though at the bottom and then those

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.260 
though at the bottom and then those
three<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:02.969> with<00:01:03.149> two

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
three and then you can do it with two

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.700 
three and then you can do it with two
fingers<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:03.840> that's<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.439> when<00:01:04.680> I

do that it's higher up I could do it but
that's<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.460> takes<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.820> lot<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.000> yeah<00:01:21.509> cloud<00:01:22.140> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
that's like takes a lot of yeah cloud a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.719 
that's like takes a lot of yeah cloud a
finger<00:01:22.500> muscle<00:01:22.830> there<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.100> another<00:01:23.460> way<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
finger muscle there is another way to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.700 
finger muscle there is another way to
play<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> B<00:01:24.420> major<00:01:24.689> though<00:01:25.080> which<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.590> the
