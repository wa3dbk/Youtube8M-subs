00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 very good everyone I'm Pablo Ortega and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.580
 today iphone now we bring you the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.030
 review and analysis of iphone 6 plus in 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.030
 Spanish 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.390
 here we have with us the iPhone 6 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.060
 plus from the US operator and 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.990
 we see how the package in this case has 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.170
 increased in size 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.450
 and we do not find the drawing directly 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.840
 of the iphone captured here but that 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.750
 we only find its shape 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.770
 This is the 16 gb diamond model 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.780
 of golden color let's open it there is 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.130
 I have to say that it draws attention 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.179
 its dimensions we will remove the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.179
 protective sticker 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.420
 and we see the beauty of the design that 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.360
 Normally, the finish is customary 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.950
 in gold we are going to compare it with a 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.750
 samsung galaxy s 5 with a screen 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.030
 5.1 inches and we're also going to 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.710
 compare it with the iphone 5s we see that 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.020
 there's a big jump of size so 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.970
 whether you liked the size of 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.920
 your traditional iphone us 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.709
 We recommend that you jump directly to 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.140
 5.5 inches if you have not tried a 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.360
 phone of these dimensions 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.300
 previously this is the new lens of 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.240
 the camera that we found on the iPhone 6 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.060
 plus but also on iPhone 6 we are going to 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.750
 Turn it on 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.000
 in this case we have the button 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.239
 lit on the right side 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.430
 from here on the iphone 5 sa this side 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.030
 because it 's easier to handle it now with 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.340
 hands 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.940
 the volume keys is maintained in the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.940
 same site 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.930
 and iPhone 6 is going to turn on 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.359
 directly with the 8 integrated the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.359
 iphone 6 plus gives us two options of 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.129
 traditional display or one in 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.799
 which we can see the icons so 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.489
 bigger let's see the differences 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.489
 this is the traditional way 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.740
 and this is the zoom mode 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.690
 where you see everything a little bigger 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.180
 and I think that in this case it's going to be convenient 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.579
 use the zoom mode 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.790
 We start using our iPhone 6 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:20.609
 plus with the iPhone 6 plus a paul down 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.650
 jumped to 55 inches responding to 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.170
 consumer requests in 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.760
 the international markets we have seen 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.040
 how in the case of Sanson this 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.049
 strategy has worked and for that reason 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.780
 apple has launched two models of 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.120
 iphones with different dimensions in the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.849
 iphone 6 case we went from the 4 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.989
 inches to 4.7 inches and in this 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.739
 iphone 6 plus 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.769
 we have a resolution of 1920 x 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.889
 1080 pixels on a 5.5 screen 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:53.099
 inch we have to say that the iphone 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:55.379
 6 plus is integrated in 28 a landscape mode 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.870
 so we can navigate between 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.299
 applications more easily this 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.700
 mode stands out above all in tools 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.489
 as messages and emails 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.709
 because we can see the screen 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.450
 divided in two and get more 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.209
 information about the application itself what 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.799
 which facilitates navigation in them 8 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.199
 we also have to highlight a way 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.200
 new accessibility that allows us 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.750
 drive 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.760
 iPhone 6 with one hand which has been 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.560
 more complicated position and we know that 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.660
 He has always defended that which is good 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.420
 be able to manage a phone with only one 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.330
 hand although we have to highlight that 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.169
 this mode does not a little effect 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.349
 strange 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.270
 as for the design of the iphone 6 it 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.729
 goes back a little to its origins we have 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.249
 One piece of aluminum with edges 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.439
 rounded and highlights the camera a little 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:47.840
 in the back that has been a 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:50.330
 very prominent element during the last 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.980
 week and since apple will present the 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.100
 Iphone 6 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.830
 there are three models available tourist 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:02.180
 spatial gold and silver and are 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:05.910
 available in 16 gb 64gb and 128gb pola 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.920
 has eliminated 32 gigs capacity 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.840
 As for the camera as it has been in 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.460
 the 8 megapixels but this does not mean 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.740
 that is a bad thing because the 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.110
 lens that now makes an autofocus 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.760
 way much faster and that we 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.160
 allows you to get better pictures 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.110
 quality in fact we are facing one of the 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.420
 best cameras built into the 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.400
 smartphones in the market the 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.900
 technical specifications of the camera 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.750
 front are left as is 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.930
 ideal for facetime video calls 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.610
 in high quality that we do have to 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.140
 highlight that now in camera mode 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.000
 slow here was only possible 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.950
 record at 120 frames per second 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.830
 now we can also use the option 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:47.100
 of 240 frames per second in the 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.980
 new iphones increases screen increase 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.560
 the dimensions but the iphone 6 follows 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.280
 being very fine in fact it is finer than 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.860
 the previous models 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.070
 and we have to say that the interior 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.470
 it's still very powerful we have now 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.169
 the processor to 8 we can navigate the 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.150
 iphone in a fluid way with them 8 and not 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.790
 as it happens in previous devices 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.580
 from the company of the apple bitten in 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.550
 which 28 runs slower 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.680
 as for example on the iphone 4s in the 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.600
 iphone 6 plus body we follow 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.340
 finding touch side and that detector 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.710
 footprints that allows us to access 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.870
 our phone safely in so 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.450
 only a second is still one of the 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.490
 best detectors we find in the 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.230
 market if we compare it for example with 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.240
 the samsung fingerprint detector 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.590
 galaxy s 5 which is more uncomfortable than 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.960
 use 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:42.230
 The great novelty in the iphone sets resides 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.840
 on your nfc chip that we will not be able to 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.460
 explode because apple only has 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.400
 integrated so we can make payments 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.620
 with our phone this option will be 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.720
 available in the USA from the month that 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.730
 it comes in business as McDonald's and 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.460
 macys but at the moment we do not know the 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.600
 expansion plans of the company but 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.850
 apple is insisting that it's going to 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.580
 work on security issues and that to 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.080
 pulpÃ­ in fact it is already very safe this is 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.330
 The great novelty of the iPhone 6 as 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.520
 we say that it is already available in a 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.310
 first batch of countries including USA 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.470
 we have to advance that effectively 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.630
 the iphone 6 plus has had problems of 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.700
 production and it is difficult to find it in 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.010
 the establishments right now if 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.630
 you ask for an iphone 6 put in usa through 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.700
 from the apple web you have to wait 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.580
 until October to receive your 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.050
 unity we have been able to do 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.530
 with a model thanks to the operator 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:35.300
 American and has the iPhone 6 plus 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:39.200
 will be available in Spain next 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:42.640
 Friday for a price of 799 euros per 

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.640
 the basic model of 16
