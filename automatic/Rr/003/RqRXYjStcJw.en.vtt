00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.050
 tired of eating the same dishes 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.660
 boring chicken this week I'll show 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:17.200
 how to prepare chicken faster and more 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.390
 tasty skinless chicken breasts to 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.300
 they are often the protein of preference 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.070
 when it comes to quickly serving the 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.710
 problem is that if they are not cooked 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.890
 you can properly dry it too much 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.349
 I'm going to show you a very simple technique 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.870
 and quick to prepare a tasty chicken 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.199
 that guarantees a tender result and 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.330
 juicy what we're going to do is season 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.089
 the chicken with a little salt and pepper 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.370
 golden on one side and then give it the 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.400
 turn add a little liquid and 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.500
 condiments and cover the pan so that 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.130
 the chicken is cooked in its own steam and 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.290
 juices that's all 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.810
 I'm going to start with a little salt and 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.150
 pepper on the chicken breasts if 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.970
 have a low salt diet you can skip 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.640
 the part of the salt if you want only about 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.590
 few turns if you do not have a mill 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.170
 pepper in your house I recommend you 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.240
 get one the fresh pepper has a 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.130
 very good taste I already have the pan 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.970
 hot so add the oil 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.890
 after the hot pan is 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.960
 the reason why I do this is because 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.600
 when the pan is hot it can 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.450
 use less oil because it will spread 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.450
 quickly with the heat 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.360
 this is a nonstick skillet so 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.570
 maybe it is not necessary to use oil but 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.729
 let's use a little to give it flavor 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.430
 it's hot and I'm going to take this chicken and 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.430
 place the seasoned side in the pan 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.840
 can you hear it sizzling I'm going to 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.090
 put there for a few minutes until 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.070
 Brown once it is golden on one side 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.800
 let's turn it over and finish 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.100
 cooking it the chicken is already golden brown 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.370
 on one side so I'm going to turn it look 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.500
 how beautiful is it looks really good so 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.230
 I'm just going to turn it around and I'm going to do 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.020
 something very simple I'm just going to spray it 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.120
 with a bit of this dry aragon I like 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.300
 he is aragon tastes good with chicken and 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.190
 It's a little light and sweet what I'm going to 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.680
 do is add a little juice 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.770
 orange to the pan and you can see that it 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.560
 it's bubbling I'm going to put the lid on it and 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.930
 lower a little the temperature smells very 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.940
 well I would like you to see the steam that 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.070
 is accumulating on the cover is 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.830
 dripping on the chicken and it's really 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.410
 the secret of this recipe to keep 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.510
 the wet chicken because if you put the chicken 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.300
 on the grill or on the grill all the 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.580
 chicken moisture evaporates and let dry 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.650
 let cook a little longer and 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.870
 when you are ready you will see how tender and 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.360
 juicy that is actually 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.519
 while the chicken is cooked and the time 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.819
 depends on the thickness of the breasts 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.220
 chicken but I calculated more or less 10 to 15 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.349
 minutes let's talk about the ways in 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.349
 which can vary this dish since 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.180
 there are almost endless varieties in 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.549
 As for the condiments, it can be 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.829
 any herb that he likes I use 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.680
 is Aragon but you can try any 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.980
 another herb that tastes good spices 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.110
 you can use ginger garlic onion onion 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.370
 powder or you can treat the curry from 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.769
 chicken 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.260
 You can also use a variety of 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.049
 liquids you can try with wine wine 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.150
 white or red work very well almost 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.030
 all alcohol evaporates when cooked 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.549
 so do not worry you can use broth 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.610
 or chicken broth if you want the juices of 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.980
 fruit work very well already use juice 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.680
 orange but you can use juice 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.170
 lemon or lime I have prepared it with pomegranate 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.900
 which forms a very sweet glaze 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.269
 about the chicken you can also use 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.640
 different types of vinegar can try 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.579
 the balsamic vinegar that gets a bit 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.980
 thick and syrupy wine vinegar 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.260
 of rice a little lighter 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.000
 the other thing that can be done if you are going to 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.849
 use the chicken breasts in others 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.280
 dishes in a salad for example and not 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.890
 has too much seasoning can only 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.470
 cook it with a little water or broth and 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.500
 then add the seasonings later 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.780
 when he's finishing his dish some 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.539
 good combinations that I like juice 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.510
 of lemon with cumin garlic powder and chili 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.790
 powder with more spicy flavor use 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.010
 sweetgrass as being do 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.750
 prepare it with orange juice but 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.900
 It also tastes good with balsamic vinegar 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.240
 because it's also the sweet medium too 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.730
 You can try some ginger in 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.250
 powder and glaze with wine vinegar 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.620
 rice and soy sauce can also 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.560
 visit the site download and techint 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.210
 dotcom for a detailed recipe and 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.039
 other dressing suggestions 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.979
 now that the chicken is completely 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.860
 cooked this is the last step but it is 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.259
 the extremely important part so 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.630
 I'm going to take off the lid and I'm going to take out the 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.639
 pieces of chicken for a moment too 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.130
 I want you to notice that I'm putting them 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.530
 on a clean plate it is important to have 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.590
 careful when preparing poultry or 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.630
 fish because of cross contamination 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.910
 place it on the cutting board where 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.099
 I had the raw chicken I'm going to raise the 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.710
 temperature a little and mix what 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:24.169
 He left juices in the pan just for 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.419
 let it cook for a while more is going to 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.820
 express and evaporate enough to 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.139
 be able to glacier the chicken and that's it 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.970
 pretty good 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.680
 I only have a couple of tablespoons of 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.820
 liquid in the pan but believe me 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.820
 it is very tasty 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.580
 I'm going to turn this off and the last step is 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.650
 place the chicken here a moment and what 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.130
 I'm going to flip and cover it with this 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.400
 Delicious glaze looks pretty and that's 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.400
 all 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.680
 I'm going to put it on my plate here and if 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.110
 you want and you have something else left in the pan 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.660
 you can put the liquid on top of this 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.060
 way and if you really want to be 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.280
 creative you can put a little parsley 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.000
 above so that it appears as 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.000
 restaurant 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.370
 What I do want to do is cut it for 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.830
 show him that well cooked is so 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.710
 juicy too and I hope you can see 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.930
 which is perfectly cooked is 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.820
 very juicy and this means that the 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.360
 chicken is very soft and they are nothing 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.360
 dry 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.490
 I hope you inspired it to try 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.400
 this technique remember that it is very 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:40.130
 where he turned the simple use seasoned 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.039
 add a little liquid for hair and now 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.370
 is and can have the scene ready in 15 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.370
 minutes
