hi guys it's just a quick video to show
you<00:00:03.330> how<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.929> make<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.589> GoPro<00:00:05.460> pole<00:00:05.790> cam<00:00:06.089> for

you how to make a GoPro pole cam for

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.830 
you how to make a GoPro pole cam for
yourself<00:00:06.950> how<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:07.980> did<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.210> bought<00:00:09.540> a

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
yourself how I did it is I bought a

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.470 
yourself how I did it is I bought a
hiking<00:00:10.559> crutch<00:00:10.860> yeah<00:00:11.460> that's<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.969> handle<00:00:12.360> of

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
hiking crutch yeah that's the handle of

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.320 
hiking crutch yeah that's the handle of
the<00:00:12.599> hiking<00:00:12.840> crush<00:00:13.230> there<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.549> it's<00:00:15.059> an

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
the hiking crush there it's a it's an

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.980 
the hiking crush there it's a it's an
aluminium<00:00:15.599> pole<00:00:16.379> that's<00:00:16.680> also<00:00:16.949> telescopic<00:00:17.990> so

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
aluminium pole that's also telescopic so

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.980 
aluminium pole that's also telescopic so
it<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.880> kind<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.000> compact<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.539> shrink<00:00:21.810> down

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
it can kind of compact and shrink down

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.290 
it can kind of compact and shrink down
and<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:23.039> expanded<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.609> quite<00:00:24.090> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
and can be expanded to quite a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.630 
and can be expanded to quite a
reasonable<00:00:24.990> length<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.920> that's<00:00:26.130> why<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.340> think

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
reasonable length so that's why I think

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.429 
reasonable length so that's why I think
it's<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.029> good<00:00:27.210> choice<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:27.570> making<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.199> pole

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
it's a good choice for making a pole

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.049 
it's a good choice for making a pole
camp<00:00:29.510> if<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.660> can<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:31.489> put<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.669> all<00:00:32.880> together

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
camp if I can just put that all together

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.860 
camp if I can just put that all together
there<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.750> go<00:00:34.100> now<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.450> down<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.719> its

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
there we go now it's down to its

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.280 
there we go now it's down to its
shortest<00:00:37.739> length<00:00:38.300> with<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.140> can

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
shortest length with like that you can

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.819 
shortest length with like that you can
easily<00:00:40.649> put<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.879> your<00:00:42.000> backpack<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:43.559> take

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
easily put it in your backpack and take

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.139 
easily put it in your backpack and take
it<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.340> when<00:00:44.520> you're<00:00:44.640> traveling<00:00:44.820> around

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
it with you when you're traveling around

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.720 
it with you when you're traveling around
and<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.719> expand<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.590> when<00:00:47.579> you're

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and then just expand it when you're

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.799 
and then just expand it when you're
going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.940> fold<00:00:48.350> it's<00:00:49.350> attached<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.160> be<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
going to fold it's attached to be to the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.689 
going to fold it's attached to be to the
pole<00:00:52.020> using<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.559> standard<00:00:52.949> mounts<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.340> came

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
pole using the standard mounts that came

with a GoPro this is the bicycle the
bicycle<00:00:57.510> helmet<00:00:58.230> mount<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.010> just

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
bicycle helmet mount and I just

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.250 
bicycle helmet mount and I just
tightened<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.090> tight<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.660> could<00:01:00.719> around

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
tightened it as tight as I could around

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.619 
tightened it as tight as I could around
the<00:01:01.410> handle<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> crutch<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.579> then<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.239> just

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the handle of the crutch and then I just

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.170 
the handle of the crutch and then I just
inserted<00:01:04.080> got<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> piece<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.189> metal<00:01:05.610> before<00:01:06.150> I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
inserted got a piece of metal before I

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.410 
inserted got a piece of metal before I
had<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> piece<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.720> wood<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:06.930> inserted<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:08.420> in

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
had a piece of wood just inserted it in

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.539 
had a piece of wood just inserted it in
there<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> take<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.500> slack<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.130> stop<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
there to take up the slack and stop the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.649 
there to take up the slack and stop the
camera<00:01:11.880> from<00:01:12.110> wobbling<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.680> down<00:01:14.659> paul

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
camera from wobbling up and down paul

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.960 
camera from wobbling up and down paul
cost<00:01:15.930> about<00:01:16.170> 10<00:01:16.590> US<00:01:16.950> dollars<00:01:17.400> which<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.790> think

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
cost about 10 US dollars which I think

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.719 
cost about 10 US dollars which I think
probably<00:01:18.299> makes<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.750> one<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> cheaper

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
probably makes it one of the cheaper

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.090 
probably makes it one of the cheaper
pole<00:01:20.729> cam<00:01:21.030> options<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.900> know<00:01:22.590> some

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
pole cam options I know some

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.940 
pole cam options I know some
professional<00:01:23.850> pole<00:01:24.180> accessories<00:01:24.930> or<00:01:25.470> much

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
professional pole accessories or much

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.780 
professional pole accessories or much
are<00:01:26.850> much<00:01:27.060> heavier<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.430> don't<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
are much heavier and don't have the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.600 
are much heavier and don't have the
telescopic<00:01:30.680> in-and-out<00:01:32.570> ability<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.920> think

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
telescopic in-and-out ability so I think

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.719 
telescopic in-and-out ability so I think
this<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.970> definitely<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.360> good<00:01:36.570> option<00:01:37.729> when

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
this is definitely a good option when

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.030 
this is definitely a good option when
you're<00:01:38.880> filming<00:01:39.150> since<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.350> adjust<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you're filming since you can adjust the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.859 
you're filming since you can adjust the
angle<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> camera<00:01:42.240> when<00:01:42.509> you're<00:01:42.630> filming

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
angle of the camera when you're filming

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.660 
angle of the camera when you're filming
if<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.159> camera<00:01:44.490> exactly

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
if you have the camera exactly

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.660 
if you have the camera exactly
horizontal<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:46.680> get<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> pole<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.610> your

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
horizontal you will get the pole in your

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.300 
horizontal you will get the pole in your
shot<00:01:48.329> if<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.689> don't<00:01:48.960> want<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.229> hold<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
shot if you don't want that hold the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.920 
shot if you don't want that hold the
pole<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.880> bit<00:01:51.030> down<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.450> adjust<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
pole a little bit down and adjust the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.710 
pole a little bit down and adjust the
angle<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> camera<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.329> you<00:01:54.329> won't<00:01:54.570> get

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
angle of the camera and you won't get

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.929 
angle of the camera and you won't get
the<00:01:54.780> pole<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.229> your<00:01:55.380> shot<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.890> it'll<00:01:56.219> look<00:01:56.340> much

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
the pole in your shot so it'll look much

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.890 
the pole in your shot so it'll look much
more<00:01:57.210> natural<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:58.229> your<00:01:58.290> videos
