they take citric acid it's how they're

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.219 
they take citric acid it's how they're
synthesized<00:01:21.090> or<00:01:21.450> they<00:01:21.540> extract<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.200> from

synthesized or they extract it from

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.800 
synthesized or they extract it from
fruit<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.159> they<00:01:23.970> put<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.600> as<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
fruit and they put it in as a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.240 
fruit and they put it in as a
preservative<00:01:25.140> because<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.830> work<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.130> an

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
preservative because it can work as an

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.580 
preservative because it can work as an
antioxidant<00:01:26.990> absorb<00:01:27.990> all<00:01:28.170> those<00:01:28.350> free

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
antioxidant absorb all those free

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.920 
antioxidant absorb all those free
radical<00:01:28.979> molecules<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:29.820> don't<00:01:30.000> damage

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
radical molecules so they don't damage

that guac fresh right so citric acid in
that<00:01:50.130> sense<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> good<00:01:50.909> thing<00:01:51.090> preserves

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
that sense is a good thing preserves

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.710 
that sense is a good thing preserves
things<00:01:52.130> but<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.250> far<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:53.549> your<00:01:53.700> teeth<00:01:53.970> go<00:01:54.360> it's

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
a bad thing because citric acid can

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
a bad thing because citric acid can
actually<00:01:58.680> weaken<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.399> enamel<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.119> your<00:02:00.270> teeth

the<00:02:00.990> enamel<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.890> outer<00:02:02.070> coating<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.729> your

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
the enamel is the outer coating on your

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.969 
the enamel is the outer coating on your
teeth<00:02:03.090> which<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> protective<00:02:04.710> part

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
teeth which is the protective part

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.069 
teeth which is the protective part
underneath<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.790> enamel<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> layer<00:02:06.840> called

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
underneath the enamel is a layer called

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.919 
underneath the enamel is a layer called
dentin<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.890> dent<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.729> as<00:02:08.849> much<00:02:09.000> softer<00:02:09.569> so

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
dentin and dent in as much softer so

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.059 
dentin and dent in as much softer so
once<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.349> work<00:02:10.800> through<00:02:11.220> or<00:02:11.459> your

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
once you work through or your

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.280 
once you work through or your
that<00:02:12.730> protective<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.510> enamel<00:02:13.720> layer<00:02:14.019> on<00:02:14.200> the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
that protective and enamel layer on the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.530 
that protective and enamel layer on the
outside<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:15.370> get<00:02:15.549> into<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.879> much<00:02:16.060> softer

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
outside you get into the much softer

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.809 
outside you get into the much softer
dentin<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.230> then<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.590> acids<00:02:18.099> produced<00:02:18.250> by

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
dentin and then the acids produced by

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.449 
dentin and then the acids produced by
bacteria<00:02:19.720> in<00:02:19.780> your<00:02:20.019> mouth<00:02:20.200> will<00:02:21.010> erode<00:02:21.250> that

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
bacteria in your mouth will erode that

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.520 
bacteria in your mouth will erode that
dentin<00:02:21.849> much<00:02:22.150> much<00:02:22.450> faster<00:02:22.720> than<00:02:23.049> they<00:02:23.319> eroded

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
dentin much much faster than they eroded

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.679 
dentin much much faster than they eroded
the<00:02:23.709> enamel<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:24.879> once<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.209> break<00:02:25.360> through<00:02:25.599> the

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
the enamel so once you break through the

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.710 
the enamel so once you break through the
enamel<00:02:25.900> your<00:02:26.620> teeth<00:02:26.890> will<00:02:27.250> decay<00:02:27.640> much<00:02:28.120> faster

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
enamel your teeth will decay much faster

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.780 
enamel your teeth will decay much faster
okay<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:29.890> want<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.099> keep<00:02:30.220> your<00:02:30.310> enamel<00:02:30.579> in

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
okay so you want to keep your enamel in

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.589 
okay so you want to keep your enamel in

wash<00:03:33.860> some<00:03:34.130> of<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.280> acid<00:03:34.640> off<00:03:34.730> because<00:03:35.030> the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
wash some of the acid off because the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.940 
wash some of the acid off because the
acid<00:03:35.600> is<00:03:35.750> gonna<00:03:35.900> weaken<00:03:36.410> your<00:03:36.500> enamel<00:03:36.740> and

acid is gonna weaken your enamel and
that's<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.190> bad<00:03:37.310> thing<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:38.480> get<00:03:38.630> that<00:03:38.660> acid<00:03:39.260> out

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
that's a bad thing so get that acid out

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.110 
that's a bad thing so get that acid out
of<00:03:39.530> there<00:03:39.650> as<00:03:39.740> quickly<00:03:39.950> as<00:03:40.130> you<00:03:40.190> can<00:03:40.250> but<00:03:41.000> don't

brush right away wait until the enamel

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.660 
brush right away wait until the enamel
has<00:03:44.540> had<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.780> chance<00:03:44.990> to<00:03:45.260> remineralize<00:03:45.670> harden
