hello and welcome I'm Marshall brain and
today<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.269> would<00:00:12.630> like<00:00:12.780> for<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.080> imagine

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
today I would like for you to imagine

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.259 
today I would like for you to imagine
that<00:00:13.620> we<00:00:13.740> are<00:00:13.889> traveling<00:00:14.639> through<00:00:14.910> space

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
that we are traveling through space

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.620 
that we are traveling through space
because<00:00:16.139> today's<00:00:16.650> big<00:00:17.100> science<00:00:17.609> question<00:00:18.119> is

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
because today's big science question is

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.340 
because today's big science question is
what<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.369> light<00:00:20.760> year<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:21.720> hear<00:00:21.930> about<00:00:22.050> light

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
what is a light year we hear about light

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.349 
what is a light year we hear about light
years<00:00:22.590> all<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.070> time<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.730> here's<00:00:23.910> an<00:00:24.029> example

what<00:00:37.440> scientists<00:00:38.010> think<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.430> would<00:00:38.550> look<00:00:38.730> like

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
what scientists think it would look like

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.479 
what scientists think it would look like

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
scientists believe that the Milky Way

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.389 
scientists believe that the Milky Way
galaxy<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:42.090> about<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.750> hundred<00:00:43.079> thousand<00:00:44.070> light

years<00:00:44.430> across<00:00:45.350> that's<00:00:46.350> big<00:00:46.910> scientists<00:00:47.910> have

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
years across that's big scientists have

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.900 
years across that's big scientists have
also<00:00:48.300> told<00:00:48.809> us<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.079> our<00:00:49.469> nearest<00:00:49.910> galactic

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
also told us that our nearest galactic

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.630 
also told us that our nearest galactic
neighbor<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.930> end<00:00:52.110> dromeda<00:00:52.800> galaxy<00:00:53.399> and

neighbor is the end dromeda galaxy and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.680 
neighbor is the end dromeda galaxy and
that<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> Andromeda<00:00:55.110> galaxy<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.910> 2.2<00:00:56.910> million

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
that the Andromeda galaxy is 2.2 million

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.860 
that the Andromeda galaxy is 2.2 million
light<00:00:58.230> years<00:00:58.260> away<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.190> distances<00:01:00.000> are<00:01:00.059> huge

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
light years away the distances are huge

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.500 
light years away the distances are huge
they're<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.250> huge<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.120> they're<00:01:03.270> nearly

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
they're so huge that they're nearly

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
they're so huge that they're nearly
impossible<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:04.379> us<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.650> imagine<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.880> let's

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
impossible for us to imagine so let's

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.070 
impossible for us to imagine so let's
start<00:01:06.299> at<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> beginning

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
start at the beginning

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.649 
start at the beginning
light<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> light<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.210> comes<00:01:09.450> out<00:01:09.630> of

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
light like the light that comes out of

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.039 
light like the light that comes out of
this<00:01:09.840> flashlight<00:01:10.340> moves<00:01:11.340> very<00:01:11.850> very<00:01:12.420> very

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
this flashlight moves very very very

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.490 
this flashlight moves very very very
fast<00:01:13.619> how<00:01:14.520> fast<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.380> scientists<00:01:16.380> have

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
fast how fast is it scientists have

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.560 
fast how fast is it scientists have
figured<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.369> light<00:01:17.640> moves<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.299> about<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
figured out that light moves at about a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.530 
figured out that light moves at about a
hundred<00:01:19.170> eighty<00:01:19.409> six<00:01:19.799> thousand<00:01:20.549> miles<00:01:20.909> per

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
hundred eighty six thousand miles per

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.370 
hundred eighty six thousand miles per
second

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
second

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.020 
second
that<00:01:22.860> means<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.520> turn<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
that means that if you turn on a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.270 
that means that if you turn on a
flashlight<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.229> measure<00:01:25.560> how<00:01:25.979> fast

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
flashlight and you can measure how fast

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.190 
flashlight and you can measure how fast
the<00:01:26.610> light<00:01:26.790> was<00:01:27.030> going<00:01:27.270> as<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.689> leaves<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the light was going as it leaves the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200 
the light was going as it leaves the
flashlight<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.009> would<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.400> able<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> move<00:01:29.909> at

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
flashlight it would be able to move at

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.010 
flashlight it would be able to move at
about<00:01:31.310> 186,000<00:01:32.310> miles<00:01:32.490> per<00:01:32.759> second<00:01:33.450> what

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
about 186,000 miles per second what

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.200 
about 186,000 miles per second what

measuring<00:02:03.899> distance<00:02:04.799> now<00:02:05.399> we're<00:02:05.579> used<00:02:05.759> to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
measuring distance now we're used to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.280 
measuring distance now we're used to
measuring<00:02:06.149> distance<00:02:06.689> with<00:02:06.869> things<00:02:07.140> like

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
measuring distance with things like

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.070 
measuring distance with things like
rulers<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.160> tape<00:02:08.429> measures<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> light

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
rulers and tape measures but a light

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.930 
rulers and tape measures but a light
year<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.410> for<00:02:10.709> measuring<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.610> really

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
year is for measuring really really

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.370 
year is for measuring really really
really<00:02:12.209> big<00:02:12.690> distance

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
really big distance

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.310 
really big distance
is<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.740> light<00:02:14.220> year<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.550> about<00:02:14.910> six<00:02:15.660> trillion

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
is a light year is about six trillion

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.270 
is a light year is about six trillion
miles<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.940> problem<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.600> six<00:02:19.080> trillion<00:02:19.710> miles

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
miles the problem is six trillion miles

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.000 
miles the problem is six trillion miles
is<00:02:20.670> almost<00:02:21.030> impossible<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.840> imagine<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:22.830> let's

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
is almost impossible to imagine so let's

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.620 
is almost impossible to imagine so let's
try<00:02:23.130> something<00:02:23.430> just<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.700> little<00:02:23.730> bit<00:02:24.180> smaller

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
try something just a little bit smaller

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.890 
try something just a little bit smaller
let's<00:02:25.380> look<00:02:25.560> at<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.860> light<00:02:26.190> second<00:02:27.000> since<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
let's look at the light second since the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.710 
let's look at the light second since the
speed<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.410> light<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:29.270> 186,000<00:02:30.270> miles<00:02:30.450> per

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
speed of light is 186,000 miles per

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.510 
speed of light is 186,000 miles per
second<00:02:31.500> one<00:02:31.980> light<00:02:32.400> second<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:34.280> 186,000<00:02:35.280> miles

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
second one light second is 186,000 miles

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.450 
second one light second is 186,000 miles
that's<00:02:36.450> easier<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.320> imagine<00:02:37.620> because<00:02:38.190> the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
that's easier to imagine because the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.510 
that's easier to imagine because the
moon<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:39.060> about<00:02:39.210> one<00:02:39.870> light<00:02:40.230> second<00:02:40.860> away<00:02:41.160> if

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
moon is about one light second away if

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.310 
moon is about one light second away if
you<00:02:42.060> look<00:02:42.240> at<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.450> distance<00:02:42.810> between<00:02:43.080> the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
you look at the distance between the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.090 
you look at the distance between the
Earth<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.800> moon

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
Earth and the moon

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
Earth and the moon
it's<00:02:44.430> about<00:02:45.440> 240,000<00:02:46.440> miles<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:47.520> works<00:02:47.850> out

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
it's about 240,000 miles that works out

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.190 
it's about 240,000 miles that works out
to<00:02:48.470> 1.3<00:02:49.470> light<00:02:50.310> seconds<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.930> let's<00:02:51.960> imagine

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
to 1.3 light seconds so let's imagine

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.050 
to 1.3 light seconds so let's imagine
that<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.830> friend<00:02:53.220> living<00:02:53.820> on<00:02:53.940> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
that you have a friend living on the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.270 
that you have a friend living on the
moon<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.900> call<00:02:55.350> her<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:55.800> your<00:02:55.980> new

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
moon and you call her with your new

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.900 
moon and you call her with your new
radio<00:02:56.850> telephone<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:58.110> say<00:02:58.350> hi<00:02:58.890> how<00:02:59.460> are<00:02:59.640> you

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
radio telephone you say hi how are you

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.200 
radio telephone you say hi how are you
it<00:03:00.480> would<00:03:00.690> take<00:03:01.040> 1.3<00:03:02.040> seconds<00:03:02.550> for<00:03:02.790> your<00:03:02.910> voice

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
it would take 1.3 seconds for your voice

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.300 
it would take 1.3 seconds for your voice
to<00:03:03.570> get<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.140> moon<00:03:04.320> because<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.770> moon<00:03:04.950> is

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
to get to the moon because the moon is

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.600 
to get to the moon because the moon is
1.3<00:03:06.270> light<00:03:06.510> seconds<00:03:07.080> away<00:03:07.170> your<00:03:07.860> friend<00:03:08.220> says

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
1.3 light seconds away your friend says

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.870 
1.3 light seconds away your friend says
great<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.930> now<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.140> takes<00:03:10.290> 1.3<00:03:11.130> seconds<00:03:11.640> for

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
great and now it takes 1.3 seconds for

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.520 
great and now it takes 1.3 seconds for
your<00:03:12.000> friend's<00:03:12.360> voice<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.840> get<00:03:12.960> back<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.500> earth

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
your friend's voice to get back to earth

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.610 
your friend's voice to get back to earth
so<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.250> would<00:03:14.370> sound<00:03:14.550> like<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:15.180> hi<00:03:15.900> how<00:03:16.470> are

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
so it would sound like this hi how are

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.400 
so it would sound like this hi how are
you

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.220 

great<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.550> mean<00:03:20.940> listen<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.510> how<00:03:21.720> long<00:03:21.930> that

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
great I mean listen to how long that

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.270 
great I mean listen to how long that
delay<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.860> hi<00:03:23.670> how<00:03:24.210> are<00:03:24.390> you

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.180 

great<00:03:28.150> even<00:03:28.780> at<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.260> speed<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.710> light<00:03:29.920> it

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
great even at the speed of light it

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.950 
great even at the speed of light it
takes<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.670> lot<00:03:30.880> of<00:03:30.910> time<00:03:31.270> to<00:03:31.510> get<00:03:31.660> a<00:03:31.690> message

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
takes a lot of time to get a message

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.380 
takes a lot of time to get a message
from<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.590> earth<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.220> moon<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.760> back<00:03:33.940> if

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
from the earth to the moon and back if

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.570 
from the earth to the moon and back if
we<00:03:34.690> want<00:03:35.020> to<00:03:35.110> go<00:03:35.200> bigger<00:03:35.620> we<00:03:35.980> can<00:03:36.010> talk<00:03:36.400> about

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
we want to go bigger we can talk about

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.480 
we want to go bigger we can talk about
the<00:03:36.850> light<00:03:37.090> minute<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:38.020> light<00:03:38.710> minute<00:03:39.190> is<00:03:39.340> about

the light minute a light minute is about

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.920 
the light minute a light minute is about
eleven<00:03:40.330> million<00:03:40.570> miles<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.770> Sun<00:03:42.190> is<00:03:42.580> about<00:03:42.930> 93

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
eleven million miles the Sun is about 93

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.410 
eleven million miles the Sun is about 93
million<00:03:44.230> miles<00:03:44.620> from<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.310> earth<00:03:45.580> therefore

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
million miles from the earth therefore

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.610 
million miles from the earth therefore
it<00:03:47.050> takes<00:03:47.410> sunlight<00:03:47.830> about<00:03:48.690> 8.3<00:03:49.690> minutes<00:03:50.320> to

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
it takes sunlight about 8.3 minutes to

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.920 
it takes sunlight about 8.3 minutes to
get<00:03:50.770> from<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.040> Sun<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.700> earth<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.270> the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
get from the Sun to the earth and the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.620 
get from the Sun to the earth and the
Sun<00:03:53.290> is<00:03:53.650> eight<00:03:54.130> point<00:03:54.400> three<00:03:54.580> light<00:03:55.180> minutes

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
Sun is eight point three light minutes

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.630 
Sun is eight point three light minutes
away<00:03:55.780> from<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.320> earth<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:56.800> then<00:03:57.250> there's<00:03:57.459> the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
away from the earth and then there's the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.900 
away from the earth and then there's the
light<00:03:57.850> hour<00:03:58.120> which<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.140> about<00:03:59.580> 670<00:04:00.580> billion

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
light hour which is about 670 billion

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.380 
light hour which is about 670 billion
miles<00:04:01.209> our<00:04:01.720> solar<00:04:02.470> system<00:04:03.010> is<00:04:03.130> about<00:04:03.390> 5.6

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
miles our solar system is about 5.6

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.780 
miles our solar system is about 5.6
billion<00:04:04.840> miles<00:04:05.260> across<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:06.250> means<00:04:06.489> it<00:04:06.670> would

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
billion miles across that means it would

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.229 
billion miles across that means it would
take<00:04:06.820> light<00:04:07.590> 8.4<00:04:08.590> hours<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:09.520> get<00:04:09.640> across<00:04:10.030> our

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
take light 8.4 hours to get across our

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.840 
take light 8.4 hours to get across our
solar<00:04:10.510> system<00:04:11.110> so<00:04:11.620> our<00:04:11.800> solar<00:04:12.100> system<00:04:12.640> is

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850

so<00:04:17.859> now<00:04:17.980> that<00:04:18.040> you<00:04:18.250> know<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.430> little<00:04:18.609> bit<00:04:18.790> about

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
so now that you know a little bit about

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.210 
so now that you know a little bit about
light<00:04:19.269> hours<00:04:19.780> like<00:04:20.049> minutes<00:04:20.410> light<00:04:20.590> seconds

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
light hours like minutes light seconds

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.830 
light hours like minutes light seconds
we<00:04:21.430> can<00:04:21.579> kind<00:04:21.760> of<00:04:21.850> put<00:04:22.090> this<00:04:22.210> all<00:04:22.570> in

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
we can kind of put this all in
