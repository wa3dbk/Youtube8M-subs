00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.850 
have good shows so every six months
probably<00:01:47.270> something<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:47.630> mean<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:48.380> never<00:01:48.530> want

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
probably something I mean you never want

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.040 
probably something I mean you never want
to<00:01:48.920> over<00:01:48.979> expose<00:01:49.550> yourself<00:01:50.030> in<00:01:50.330> in<00:01:50.780> North

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
to over expose yourself in in North

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.139 
to over expose yourself in in North
America<00:01:51.649> which<00:01:51.950> just<00:01:52.160> becomes<00:01:52.700> too<00:01:52.820> familiar

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
America which just becomes too familiar

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.730 
America which just becomes too familiar
so

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.920 
so
I<00:01:54.799> think<00:01:55.700> it's<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.880> great<00:01:56.030> city<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:56.570> hope<00:01:56.750> for

for<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.870> know<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:00.900> was<00:04:01.349> just<00:04:01.590> making

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
for the know I was just making

the<00:04:06.870> other<00:04:06.989> day<00:04:07.200> and<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:07.920> had<00:04:08.040> like<00:04:08.189> a<00:04:08.250> permanent

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
the other day and I had like a permanent

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.020 
the other day and I had like a permanent
keycard<00:04:09.629> hotel<00:04:10.620> card<00:04:11.159> style<00:04:11.400> think<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:11.849> just

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
keycard hotel card style think so just

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.220 
keycard hotel card style think so just
wondering<00:04:12.180> why<00:04:12.390> does<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.599> one<00:04:12.810> keep<00:04:13.019> its

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
wondering why does that one keep its

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.319 
wondering why does that one keep its
magnetism<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:14.099> think<00:04:14.400> they<00:04:14.519> do<00:04:14.579> it<00:04:14.790> on<00:04:14.849> purpose

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
magnetism I think they do it on purpose

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.509 
magnetism I think they do it on purpose
like<00:04:15.599> they<00:04:15.750> give<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.019> less<00:04:16.169> magnetism<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:17.190> could

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
like they give it less magnetism I could

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.340 
like they give it less magnetism I could
have<00:04:17.639> a<00:04:17.759> superpower<00:04:18.209> what<00:04:18.600> would<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.870> be

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
have a superpower what would it be

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.770 
have a superpower what would it be
yes<00:04:19.590> I'd<00:04:20.430> like<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.729> duplicate<00:04:21.269> myself<00:04:21.630> so<00:04:21.750> I

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
yes I'd like to duplicate myself so I

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.150 
yes I'd like to duplicate myself so I
don't<00:04:21.959> have<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.139> do<00:04:22.289> some<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.710> work<00:04:22.740> like

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
don't have to do some of the work like

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.909 
don't have to do some of the work like
and<00:04:23.370> just<00:04:23.520> like<00:04:23.669> and<00:04:24.600> send<00:04:24.840> my<00:04:24.990> said<00:04:25.530> Michael

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
and just like and send my said Michael

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.950 
and just like and send my said Michael
on<00:04:26.009> but<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.880> know<00:04:27.000> in<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.270> TV<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.810> movies

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
on but you know in the TV and the movies

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.290 
on but you know in the TV and the movies
like<00:04:28.470> every<00:04:28.830> time<00:04:29.039> some<00:04:29.759> of<00:04:29.789> them<00:04:29.970> are

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
like every time some of them are

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.580 
like every time some of them are
themselves<00:04:30.479> they're<00:04:30.870> clones<00:04:31.110> don't<00:04:31.320> want<00:04:31.530> to

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
themselves they're clones don't want to

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.620 
themselves they're clones don't want to
do<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.830> work<00:04:31.979> either<00:04:32.220> a<00:04:32.729> clone<00:04:33.090> with<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.300> lot<00:04:33.510> of

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
do the work either a clone with a lot of

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.750 
do the work either a clone with a lot of
work<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:33.960> think<00:04:33.990> that's<00:04:34.560> happy<00:04:34.979> to<00:04:35.160> do<00:04:35.340> whatever

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
work I think that's happy to do whatever

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.460 
work I think that's happy to do whatever
it<00:04:36.000> was<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.240> didn't<00:04:36.449> want<00:04:36.479> to<00:04:36.690> do<00:04:36.780> if<00:04:37.169> you<00:04:37.350> add

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
it was I didn't want to do if you add

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.740 
it was I didn't want to do if you add
your<00:04:37.620> own<00:04:37.680> country<00:04:38.220> won't<00:04:38.850> be<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.150> three<00:04:39.510> laws

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
your own country won't be the three laws

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.080 
your own country won't be the three laws
everyone<00:04:40.710> else<00:04:40.979> would<00:04:41.100> have<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.400> ride<00:04:41.760> a<00:04:41.789> bike

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
everyone else would have to ride a bike

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.400 
everyone else would have to ride a bike
but<00:04:42.479> okay

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
but okay

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.200 
but okay
they<00:04:43.650> get<00:04:43.919> driven<00:04:44.130> around<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.910> then<00:04:45.030> there'd

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
they get driven around and then there'd

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.240 
they get driven around and then there'd
be<00:04:45.300> no<00:04:45.360> global<00:04:45.690> warming<00:04:45.900> either<00:04:46.440> my<00:04:46.860> countries

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
be no global warming either my countries

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.460 
be no global warming either my countries
I<00:04:47.340> got<00:04:47.490> places<00:04:47.940> going<00:04:48.180> people<00:04:48.600> that's<00:04:48.870> one<00:04:49.110> if

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
I got places going people that's one if

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.469 
I got places going people that's one if
they're<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.830> most<00:04:50.010> important<00:04:50.760> raw<00:04:50.970> would<00:04:51.300> be

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
they're the most important raw would be

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.060 
they're the most important raw would be
that<00:04:51.720> like<00:04:51.900> people<00:04:52.590> are<00:04:52.650> public

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
that like people are public

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.439 
that like people are public
transportation<00:04:53.820> could<00:04:54.030> have<00:04:54.120> play<00:04:54.270> their

transportation could have play their

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.260 
transportation could have play their
music<00:04:54.539> out<00:04:55.400> what's<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.550> third<00:04:56.699> one<00:04:56.760> said<00:04:57.240> I
