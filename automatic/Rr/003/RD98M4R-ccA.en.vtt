00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
roots okay and this is why you can clone

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.840 
roots okay and this is why you can clone
a<00:02:03.509> tomato<00:02:04.350> plants<00:02:04.799> pretty<00:02:04.979> easily

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
a tomato plants pretty easily

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.120 
a tomato plants pretty easily
you<00:02:06.240> ever<00:02:06.450> notice<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.170> little<00:02:07.200> hairs<00:02:07.799> on

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
you ever notice all the little hairs on

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.210 
you ever notice all the little hairs on
the<00:02:08.549> stem<00:02:08.880> they're<00:02:09.420> actually<00:02:09.959> little<00:02:10.470> wannabe

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
the stem they're actually little wannabe

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.180 
the stem they're actually little wannabe
roots<00:02:11.850> okay<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.600> if<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.410> give<00:02:13.620> them<00:02:13.799> a<00:02:13.890> chance

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
roots okay so if you give them a chance

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.150 
roots okay so if you give them a chance
they<00:02:14.610> will<00:02:15.420> all<00:02:15.690> turn<00:02:15.959> into<00:02:16.019> roots<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:16.890> that's

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
they will all turn into roots so that's

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.300 
they will all turn into roots so that's
why<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.370> little<00:02:17.700> hairs<00:02:18.060> are<00:02:18.299> there<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:20.040> same

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
why you little hairs are there the same

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.210 
why you little hairs are there the same
thing<00:02:20.640> if<00:02:20.940> your<00:02:21.720> plant<00:02:22.019> is<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.530> garden<00:02:23.010> and

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
thing if your plant is in the garden and

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.990 
thing if your plant is in the garden and
then<00:02:23.370> goes<00:02:23.579> like<00:02:24.090> on<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:24.750> ground<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:26.489> kind<00:02:26.940> of

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
then goes like on the ground it kind of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.640 
then goes like on the ground it kind of
acts<00:02:27.209> like<00:02:27.299> a<00:02:27.450> vine<00:02:27.810> it'll<00:02:28.200> just<00:02:28.440> grow

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
acts like a vine it'll just grow

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.670 
acts like a vine it'll just grow
wherever<00:02:29.579> it<00:02:29.790> touches<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.299> ground<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:31.500> will

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
wherever it touches the ground it will

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.300 
wherever it touches the ground it will
actually<00:02:31.890> start<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.640> grow

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
actually start to grow

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.150 
actually start to grow
and<00:02:33.459> take<00:02:34.150> hold<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.780> in<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.830> particular

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
and take hold of in that particular

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.550 
and take hold of in that particular
place<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:36.970> makes<00:02:37.240> your<00:02:37.480> whole<00:02:38.200> plant

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
place so I makes your whole plant

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.440 
place so I makes your whole plant
stronger<00:02:39.160> because<00:02:39.310> it's<00:02:39.550> rooted<00:02:39.819> all<00:02:40.150> over

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
stronger because it's rooted all over

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.100 
stronger because it's rooted all over
the<00:02:40.540> place

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
the place

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.210 
the place
okay<00:02:41.819> so<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.870> is<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.350> amount<00:02:44.500> buried<00:02:45.040> its

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
okay so this is the amount buried its

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.130 
okay so this is the amount buried its
whole<00:02:45.430> stem<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:46.480> leave<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.870> tip

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
whole stem and just leave the tip

00:02:47.140 --> 00:03:40.430 
whole stem and just leave the tip
sticking<00:02:47.950> out<00:02:48.130> okay<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:50.709> there<00:02:51.220> we<00:02:51.370> go

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.460 

okay<00:03:41.310> well<00:03:41.580> this<00:03:42.000> is<00:03:42.240> what<00:03:42.420> it<00:03:42.540> looks<00:03:42.750> like<00:03:42.960> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
okay well this is what it looks like the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.970 
okay well this is what it looks like the
whole<00:03:43.650> stem<00:03:44.010> has<00:03:44.250> been<00:03:44.490> buried<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:46.140> it's<00:03:46.770> just

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
whole stem has been buried and it's just

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.300 
whole stem has been buried and it's just
a<00:03:47.130> tip<00:03:47.400> that's<00:03:47.940> sticking<00:03:48.480> out<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.100> this<00:03:50.100> is

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
a tip that's sticking out so this is

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.460 
a tip that's sticking out so this is
actually<00:03:50.790> gonna<00:03:50.970> grow<00:03:51.330> into<00:03:51.600> another<00:03:51.870> big

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
actually gonna grow into another big

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.750 
actually gonna grow into another big
tomato<00:03:53.160> plant<00:03:54.440> as<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.470> see<00:03:56.040> there's<00:03:56.550> already
