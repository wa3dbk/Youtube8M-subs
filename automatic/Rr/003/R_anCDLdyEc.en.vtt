 Uribe to government peace dialogues 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.490
 saints with the FARC are not new have 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.710
 been constant and increasingly hard 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.720
 from the moment it was known 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.680
 which state and guerrilla would sit 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.680
 converse in Havana 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.230
 it's with the popular base 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.440
 the dialogue is with the doctors and with the

 At work, the dialogue is with the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.590
 mothers head of family the dialogue is 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.640
 with employers and workers the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.340
 dialogue is not with the parties despite their 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.110
 today's strong opposition the former president 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.759
 tried to do the same thing as saints a 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.130
 person authorized by him went beyond 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.440
 when raising the guerrilla leader of the

 Valle del Cauca Pablo Catatumbo 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.040
 possibility of clearing an area and of 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.960
 give security to the parties the 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.180
 Written moments of the time give an account 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.860
 that the economist henry acosta patiño 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.320

 projected a draft proposal that 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.869
 would scandalize those who are opposed today 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.509
 to the process that is advanced in Cuba if 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.009
 saints did something similar we think that 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.720
 the conditions are given to carry 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.429
 out a meeting where they are addressed 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.200
 issues such as the following conditions 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.700

 representatives of the security farc 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.410
 for the inhabitants of the area 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.259
 feasibility of a cessation of hostilities 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.840
 with government reciprocity and steps 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.700
 for a successful peace process the letter 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.890
 the commissioner would sign it and restrepo 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.450

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.069
 security for the encounter with 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.870
 guerrilla was considering as area 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.910
 of clearing the area between the municipalities

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.709
 commissioned restrepo confirms to the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.349

 says that mediation is suspended 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.660
 because a new stage was beginning with
