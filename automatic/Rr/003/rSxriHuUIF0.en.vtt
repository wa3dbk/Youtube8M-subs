00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.960
 different than making a video 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.890
 talking about curiosity raising such a drawing 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.960

 when I play pokémon black and pokémon go 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.820

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.050
 with a name pokémon web and pokémon green 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.280
 occurred a strange phenomenon that 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.629
 children aged 7 to 12 years 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.910
 especially those who played with 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.070
 Earphone for listening and better 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.410
 sound effects between the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.050
 children appeared the effects 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.739
 unexplained bleeding in the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:54.340
 nose and irritability insomnia moments 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.890
 attacks of fear and strong seen the game in 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.230
 that children are stuck in the game 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.480
 endless hours and hours even 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.010
 cry when parents and forced them to 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.340
 flood the console 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.899
 about 70% of these cases ended in 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.940
 suicide 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.170
 according to the investigations in the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.360
 majority of cases in which children 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.940
 had symptoms 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.330
 the game had not progressed beyond the 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.240
 city ​​and then there comes a more 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.270
 deep revealed tones of wind music 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.670
 on the spot an undetected frequency 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.160
 by adults since they have a game 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.450
 fully formed but some 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.670
 children could hear in the 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.220
 weeks all copies of the first 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.740
 game edition have been withdrawn from the market 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.289
 and the game was relaunched with the version 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.849
 remastered music with strange 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.250
 frequency removed 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:51.369
 in the version of music that we all 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.989
 we are supposed to have at least three shades 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.569
 that the original version 

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:57.310
 although this is not confirmed due to 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.560
 to the rare copy of the first edition 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.330
 about the game 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.509
 the few copies recovered from this 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.319
 first edition the non-game function and a 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.770
 game clock did not work anymore 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:13.870
 this story began to be 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.280
 1997 for the first time on the site that is 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.770
 appearing on the screen 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.220
 address that no longer exists 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.290
 a lot of time on youtube it is available 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.200
 a supposed version of the original song from the 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.180
 play the significant number of suicide 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.980
 between the Japanese pending and after 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.550
 many investigations the authorities 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.130
 reached the conclusion that this 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.840
 these were caused by the pokémon game in 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.180
 that the children were greatly 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.220
 affected by background music playing 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.060
 in the city demonstrating the behavior 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.980
 weird 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.940
 in the vast majority of cases reaching 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.640
 commit suicide 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.860
 the song was tossed slightly to 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.570
 the later versions of the game that 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.450
 been withdrawn for whom it is 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:03:00.090
 dangerous and the story has been 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:03.510
 not to prejudice sales before 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.240
