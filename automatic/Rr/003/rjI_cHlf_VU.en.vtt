00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:06.650 

so<00:00:05.399> I'm<00:00:05.460> going<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.609> show<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.790> how<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.090> use<00:00:06.390> a

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
so I'm going to show you how to use a

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.709 
so I'm going to show you how to use a
flat<00:00:07.319> iron<00:00:07.350> on<00:00:07.769> naturally<00:00:08.430> curly<00:00:08.760> hair<00:00:08.790> what

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
flat iron on naturally curly hair what

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.170 
flat iron on naturally curly hair what
I've<00:00:09.840> done<00:00:10.049> first<00:00:10.500> was<00:00:11.010> we<00:00:11.580> did<00:00:11.850> a<00:00:11.879> nice

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.180 
I've done first was we did a nice

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.260 
I've done first was we did a nice
blow-dry<00:00:13.160> before<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.279> got<00:00:14.430> started<00:00:14.459> so<00:00:15.029> we<00:00:15.119> got

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:15.270 
blow-dry before we got started so we got

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.550 
blow-dry before we got started so we got
the<00:00:15.389> majority<00:00:15.930> of<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.980> wave<00:00:17.279> out<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.970> way

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
the majority of the wave out that way

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.900 
the majority of the wave out that way
so<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.650> can<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.160> couple<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.610> different

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
so you can do that a couple of different

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.310 
so you can do that a couple of different
ways<00:00:21.030> without<00:00:21.300> blow-drying<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.080> if<00:00:22.170> you

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
ways without blow-drying it if you

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.010 
ways without blow-drying it if you
wanted<00:00:22.620> to<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.980> could<00:00:23.160> always<00:00:24.020> experiment

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
wanted to you could always experiment

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.960 
wanted to you could always experiment
with<00:00:25.050> pinning<00:00:25.530> it<00:00:25.650> all<00:00:25.770> back<00:00:26.100> and<00:00:26.370> letting<00:00:26.789> an

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
with pinning it all back and letting an

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.660 
with pinning it all back and letting an
air<00:00:27.180> dry<00:00:27.539> all<00:00:28.170> pulled<00:00:28.380> back<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.310> all<00:00:29.520> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
air dry all pulled back so that all the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.970 
air dry all pulled back so that all the
top<00:00:29.910> was<00:00:30.270> really<00:00:30.630> really<00:00:30.810> straight<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.470> then

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
top was really really straight and then

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.310 
top was really really straight and then
you<00:00:32.009> would<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.579> go<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.320> define

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
you would just have to go in and define

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.069 
you would just have to go in and define
the<00:00:34.739> bottom<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:36.030> flatiron<00:00:36.539> is<00:00:36.659> a<00:00:36.690> really

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the bottom the flatiron is a really

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.899 
the bottom the flatiron is a really
powerful<00:00:37.230> tool<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.769> you<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.309> really<00:00:38.640> want<00:00:38.819> to

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:38.909 
powerful tool so you just really want to

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:40.430 
powerful tool so you just really want to
use<00:00:38.999> that<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.239> touch<00:00:39.449> up<00:00:39.659> anything<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.319> you

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
use that to touch up anything that you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.739 
use that to touch up anything that you
missed<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:41.789> I'm<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.089> do<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.569> we're

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:42.749 
missed so what I'm going to do is we're

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:45.169 
missed so what I'm going to do is we're
going<00:00:42.839> to<00:00:42.899> take<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.530> small<00:00:44.190> section<00:00:44.489> here<00:00:44.909> on

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.179 
going to take a small section here on

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.619 
going to take a small section here on
the<00:00:45.420> side<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.699> quickly<00:00:47.909> pin<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.510> rest

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the side and just quickly pin the rest

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.619 
the side and just quickly pin the rest
of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> hair<00:00:49.109> up<00:00:50.089> brush<00:00:51.089> it<00:00:51.269> through<00:00:51.300> with<00:00:51.510> our

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
of the hair up brush it through with our

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.660 
of the hair up brush it through with our
fingers<00:00:52.050> I've<00:00:52.260> already<00:00:52.649> put<00:00:52.859> a<00:00:53.159> heat

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
fingers I've already put a heat

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.399 
fingers I've already put a heat
protectant<00:00:54.210> over<00:00:54.569> this<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.050> one<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> I

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
protectant over this and the one that I

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.719 
protectant over this and the one that I
used<00:00:55.799> was<00:00:56.069> a<00:00:56.100> gloss<00:00:56.460> based<00:00:56.789> heat<00:00:57.239> protectant

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
used was a gloss based heat protectant

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.189 
used was a gloss based heat protectant
be<00:00:59.729> sure<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.179> whatever<00:01:00.359> you're<00:01:00.719> using<00:01:00.749> as<00:01:01.170> a

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
be sure that whatever you're using as a

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.079 
be sure that whatever you're using as a
heat<00:01:01.440> protectant<00:01:01.949> says<00:01:02.219> heat<00:01:02.489> protectant

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
heat protectant says heat protectant

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:04.880 
heat protectant says heat protectant
some<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> things<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:04.559> think<00:01:04.739> are

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
some of the things that we think are

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.680 
some of the things that we think are
protecting<00:01:05.400> our<00:01:05.519> hair<00:01:05.700> actually<00:01:05.909> aren't<00:01:06.420> so

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
protecting our hair actually aren't so

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.060 
protecting our hair actually aren't so
just<00:01:06.870> make<00:01:06.990> sure<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.229> has<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.650> label

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
just make sure it has that little label

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.819 
just make sure it has that little label
on<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.840> then<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:09.990> I'm<00:01:10.079> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.259> do<00:01:10.469> is<00:01:10.680> I

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
on it then what I'm going to do is I

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.600 
on it then what I'm going to do is I
always<00:01:10.860> use<00:01:11.579> a<00:01:11.610> comb<00:01:12.090> when<00:01:12.479> I'm<00:01:12.600> flat<00:01:12.930> ironing

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
always use a comb when I'm flat ironing

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.120 
always use a comb when I'm flat ironing
the<00:01:14.610> reason<00:01:14.969> I<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:15.149> this<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.680> gonna

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
the reason I do this is it's just gonna

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.800 
the reason I do this is it's just gonna
straighten<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.670> hair<00:01:17.820> before<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.270> even<00:01:18.479> glows

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
straighten the hair before it even glows

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.310 
straighten the hair before it even glows
goes<00:01:19.289> into<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> flat<00:01:20.189> iron<00:01:20.780> what<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:21.899> doing

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
goes into the flat iron what I'm doing

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.550 
goes into the flat iron what I'm doing
is<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:23.219> we<00:01:23.430> already<00:01:23.780> blew<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.049> hair<00:01:25.259> dry

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
is because we already blew the hair dry

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.399 
is because we already blew the hair dry
I'm<00:01:25.890> skipping<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.520> midpoint<00:01:26.880> here<00:01:27.570> because

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
I'm skipping this midpoint here because

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.779 
I'm skipping this midpoint here because
I<00:01:28.530> want<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> little<00:01:29.130> bit<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.399> volume<00:01:29.579> so

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
I want to have a little bit of volume so

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.459 
I want to have a little bit of volume so
what<00:01:30.060> I'm<00:01:30.149> really<00:01:30.479> using<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.899> flat<00:01:31.109> iron<00:01:31.409> for

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
what I'm really using the flat iron for

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.700 
what I'm really using the flat iron for
is<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.700> define<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.659> smooth<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.229> ends<00:01:34.409> of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
is just to define and smooth the ends of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.029 
is just to define and smooth the ends of
the<00:01:34.829> hair<00:01:36.079> only<00:01:37.079> time<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.350> would<00:01:37.500> not<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:38.009> that

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
the hair only time I would not do that

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.679 
the hair only time I would not do that
is<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.609> had<00:01:38.759> something<00:01:39.119> around<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.450> face

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
is if you had something around the face

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.090 
is if you had something around the face
that<00:01:39.990> maybe<00:01:40.170> needed<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.649> little<00:01:40.859> bit<00:01:40.950> of

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that maybe needed a little bit of

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.810 
that maybe needed a little bit of
smoothing

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.060 

so<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:45.480> you<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.230> I'm<00:01:46.320> using<00:01:46.500> my<00:01:46.770> comb

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
so if you can see when I'm using my comb

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.610 
so if you can see when I'm using my comb
my<00:01:47.340> comb<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:48.060> right<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.750> front<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.500> my

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
my comb just that's right in front of my

it usually takes just as much time to do
it<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.110> way<00:02:04.320> as<00:02:04.470> it<00:02:04.650> does<00:02:04.830> to<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.340> go
