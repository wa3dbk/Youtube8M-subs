alternates the best way to go with these

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.780 
alternates the best way to go with these
we<00:00:39.840> do<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.230> arm<00:00:40.379> at<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.590> time<00:00:40.620> once<00:00:41.430> again<00:00:41.610> the

we do one arm at a time once again the
most<00:00:41.940> important<00:00:42.510> thing<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.020> movement

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
most important thing in this movement

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.380

has that be armed straited at the bottom

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.420 
has that be armed straited at the bottom
of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.570> movement<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.440> ang<00:00:46.620> keeps<00:00:47.010> his<00:00:47.160> palms

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
of the movement see ang keeps his palms

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.700 
of the movement see ang keeps his palms
forward<00:00:47.760> all<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.149> time<00:00:48.360> he<00:00:48.750> drags<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.379> up<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
forward all the time he drags it up and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
forward all the time he drags it up and
actually<00:00:50.070> makes<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.670> hard<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:51.510> seize

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
actually makes it hard you can seize

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.720 
actually makes it hard you can seize
bicep<00:00:52.289> peaking<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.920> flexing<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> top<00:00:53.699> of

the<00:00:53.879> movement<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.510> more<00:00:55.020> importantly<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the movement and more importantly and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.740 
the movement and more importantly and
say<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:55.949> stretching<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.850> getting<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.449> full

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
say it's stretching and getting a full

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.229 
say it's stretching and getting a full
range<00:00:58.079> from<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> bottom<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.010> movement<00:00:59.489> if
