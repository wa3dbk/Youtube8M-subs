gameplay if you missed it at the

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.980 
gameplay if you missed it at the
beginning<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.180> video<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.480> showed<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:06.960> guys

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
beginning the video I showed you guys

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.129 
beginning the video I showed you guys
that<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.379> got<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.680> mic<00:00:08.010> pick<00:00:08.250> for<00:00:08.429> only<00:00:09.139> 7600

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
that I got a mic pick for only 7600

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.230 
that I got a mic pick for only 7600
coins<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.280> definitely<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:12.000> good

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
coins and that is definitely a good

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.509 
coins and that is definitely a good
snipe<00:00:12.690> because<00:00:13.440> our<00:00:13.769> best<00:00:13.980> quarterback<00:00:14.400> was

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
snipe because our best quarterback was

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.580 
snipe because our best quarterback was
Andy<00:00:14.969> Dalton<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.540> then<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:15.990> use<00:00:16.109> Dennis<00:00:16.410> Dixon

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
Andy Dalton and then we use Dennis Dixon

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.470 
Andy Dalton and then we use Dennis Dixon
the<00:00:16.859> read<00:00:17.039> option<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.640> now<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:17.850> got<00:00:18.060> BIC<00:00:18.330> at

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the read option so now we got BIC at

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
solution at quarterback he's only

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.029 
solution at quarterback he's only

from all the way back there third down

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.590 
from all the way back there third down
and<00:00:57.840> four<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.800> Game<00:00:59.039> four<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.370> season<00:01:00.359> one

and four this is Game four of season one
so<00:01:00.960> we're<00:01:01.350> almost<00:01:01.440> halfway<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.920> getting<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
so we're almost halfway to getting a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.219 
so we're almost halfway to getting a
playoff<00:01:02.550> berth<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.910> believe<00:01:03.120> if<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.420> win<00:01:03.629> our

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
playoff berth I believe if we win our

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.810 
playoff berth I believe if we win our
next<00:01:04.379> two<00:01:04.680> games<00:01:04.890> then<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.280> automatically<00:01:05.670> get

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
next two games then we automatically get

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.730 
next two games then we automatically get
a<00:01:05.880> playoff<00:01:06.180> berth<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:06.720> if<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.260> win<00:01:07.439> eight

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
a playoff berth and then if we win eight

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.320 
a playoff berth and then if we win eight
games<00:01:08.010> then<00:01:08.670> that's<00:01:08.939> when<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
games then that's when we got a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.880 
games then that's when we got a
first-round<00:01:09.750> bye<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.290> those<00:01:10.439> are<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> goals

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
first-round bye so those are the goals

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.160 
first-round bye so those are the goals
right<00:01:11.159> now<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:11.909> got<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> pic<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.540> every

Vicks<00:02:20.519> so<00:02:20.819> you<00:02:21.269> know<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:22.049> fun<00:02:22.260> with<00:02:22.379> it<00:02:22.470> while

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
Vicks so you know that fun with it while

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.000 
Vicks so you know that fun with it while
we're<00:02:22.739> at<00:02:22.799> it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
we're at it

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.070 
we're at it
so<00:02:23.220> your<00:02:23.400> 14-7<00:02:24.150> he<00:02:24.330> doesn't<00:02:24.540> even<00:02:24.629> call<00:02:24.810> play

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
so your 14-7 he doesn't even call play

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.360 
so your 14-7 he doesn't even call play
right<00:02:25.260> away<00:02:25.379> so<00:02:25.500> now<00:02:25.709> fourth<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.159> seven

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
right away so now fourth and seven

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.789 
right away so now fourth and seven
becomes<00:02:26.580> 1412<00:02:27.209> he<00:02:27.299> still<00:02:27.629> goes<00:02:27.840> for<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.379> he

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
becomes 1412 he still goes for it and he

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.800 
becomes 1412 he still goes for it and he
does<00:02:29.099> not<00:02:29.400> get<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.879> meaning<00:02:30.180> Lawson<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.599> all

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
does not get it meaning Lawson is all

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.839 
does not get it meaning Lawson is all
over<00:02:31.049> that<00:02:31.200> rough<00:02:31.709> seven<00:02:32.190> nothing<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.730> this

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
over that rough seven nothing and this

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.759 
over that rough seven nothing and this
was<00:02:33.090> probably<00:02:33.269> one<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.140> dumbest<00:02:34.590> things

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
was probably one of the dumbest things

Davis<00:07:16.430> in<00:07:16.550> our<00:07:16.639> team<00:07:16.819> so<00:07:16.849> that's<00:07:17.030> definitely<00:07:17.300> a

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:17.569 
Davis in our team so that's definitely a

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:18.939 
Davis in our team so that's definitely a
huge<00:07:17.780> advantage<00:07:18.080> here<00:07:18.590> you<00:07:18.650> see<00:07:18.770> I'm<00:07:18.860> running

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:18.949 
huge advantage here you see I'm running

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:20.320 
huge advantage here you see I'm running
backward<00:07:19.490> and<00:07:19.580> stuff<00:07:19.729> I<00:07:19.819> didn't<00:07:20.000> really<00:07:20.180> want

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330 
backward and stuff I didn't really want

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.640 
backward and stuff I didn't really want
to<00:07:20.360> go<00:07:20.479> backward<00:07:20.840> but<00:07:20.930> Stephen<00:07:21.199> Jackson<00:07:21.349> kept

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.650 
to go backward but Stephen Jackson kept

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.409 
to go backward but Stephen Jackson kept
on<00:07:21.740> falling<00:07:21.919> backward<00:07:22.430> so<00:07:22.789> I<00:07:22.849> can<00:07:23.000> only<00:07:23.210> just

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:23.419 
on falling backward so I can only just

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:24.550 
on falling backward so I can only just
circle<00:07:23.690> around<00:07:23.750> here<00:07:24.050> so<00:07:24.199> I<00:07:24.259> could<00:07:24.409> make<00:07:24.530> a

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
circle around here so I could make a

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.320 
circle around here so I could make a
play<00:07:24.770> at<00:07:25.009> least<00:07:25.190> Stanfield<00:07:25.699> will<00:07:25.879> range<00:07:26.060> at

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.330 
play at least Stanfield will range at

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.420 
play at least Stanfield will range at
the<00:07:26.719> very<00:07:26.870> least<00:07:27.139> even<00:07:27.590> though<00:07:27.680> you<00:07:27.740> know<00:07:27.919> fuel

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.430 
the very least even though you know fuel

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.800 
the very least even though you know fuel
or<00:07:28.729> not<00:07:28.879> doesn't<00:07:29.150> really<00:07:29.330> matter<00:07:29.539> cause<00:07:29.690> we're

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:29.810
