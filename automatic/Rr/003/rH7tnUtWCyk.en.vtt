00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:19.160
 skewer of salmon marinated salad 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.720
 chews will have said with such a title all 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.470
 is said so we immediately attack 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.320
 by the recipe 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.919
 I have here a very beautiful salmon pavÃ© 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.990
 Norway 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.490
 I will check that there are no longer 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:34.149
 of stops you follow me there is one left 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:36.340
 small so my little clip and we take off 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.660
 then 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.620
 good there he remains the skin you can 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.930
 ask your fishmonger 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.620
 take it off me I'll do it hop 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.270
 small incisions and then with the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.130
 blade of the knife well flat 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.540
 I'm going along in order to remove the whole 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.870
 skin you my salmon pavement norway 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.970
 and well closes a very easy job the 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.220
 sizes and beautiful cube I'm size 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.300
 slightly 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.890
 Here it will make us beautiful 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.810
 skewers before closing a skewer 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.200
 we will make them marinate these cubes of 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.009
 Salmon 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.350
 I will add olive oil from 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.149
 pepper salt 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.790
 I join grounds app and I take 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:17.299
 almost all the rest of a lime 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.270
 I crush my lime 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.840
 way to get the most juice out of 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.920
 tip of the fingers 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.420
 we go in dresses and his little cubes of the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.280
 marinade and I will be able to attack 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.650
 but a game skewer pierces through 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.830
 using small wooden picks but 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.080
 that edge which binds salmon skewer y 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.720
 summer and who says been told necessarily 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.229
 barbecue I will be able to deposit my 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.060
 little skewers and there for cooking 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.470
 it's really a question of 30 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.790
 seconds by phase i'm just going to do 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.700
 double-sided cooking 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.299
 in fact I want the center that remains 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.000
 still slightly orange limit raw 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.180
 go look 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.189
 so here too 20 to 30 seconds not 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.330
 the more we have a high quality fish 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.400
 with this norway salmon 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.320
 so as to enjoy it in the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.140
 better conditions so I recover 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.209
 my little skewers 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:17.840
 so here we see the center is 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:20.329
 still limit vintage is perfect hop 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.800
 now to accompany these small 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.270
 skewers we will really stay in the 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.569
 freshness with a small salad of 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.230
 chewed up 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:31.040
 so here I have some match sheets on 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.900
 will decorate them with radishes I 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.260
 two versions black radish 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.250
 'our beefy and small pink radishes 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.310
 we will attack by black radish 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.739
 I'm going to cut one end but the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.849
 people is slightly now I'm going 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.739
 get out my mandolin I adjust them for 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.650
 make thin slices 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:57.440
 yes can almost a hole be seen at 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.940
 through I now continue the 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.920
 small radishes I cut both 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.569
 extremities 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.129
 I quickly pass them under water and 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.560
 as for me says black slices 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:11.200
 fine enough I can add now 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.200

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.810

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.879
 two beautiful skewers 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.970
 little reminder of the marinade I kept 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.489

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.390
 a little bit of my salad in the kitchen 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.959
 nothing is lost so I kept my 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.760
 marinade 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.530
