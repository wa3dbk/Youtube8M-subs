00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
perspective on this whole leak I'm

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.550 
perspective on this whole leak I'm
thinking<00:01:14.490> they're<00:01:15.240> opening<00:01:15.689> up<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.930> job<00:01:16.229> in

thinking they're opening up the job in

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.490 
thinking they're opening up the job in
february2014<00:01:17.900> expecting<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> get<00:01:19.110> someone

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
february2014 expecting to get someone

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.520 
february2014 expecting to get someone
employed<00:01:19.830> by<00:01:20.189> similar<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.030> 2014<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:22.140> they're

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
employed by similar of 2014 if they're

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.249 
employed by similar of 2014 if they're
hiring<00:01:22.979> artists<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.150> conceptual<00:01:24.840> art<00:01:25.110> I

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
hiring artists for conceptual art I

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.859 
hiring artists for conceptual art I
think<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:25.799> about<00:01:26.580> early<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> process

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
think that's about early in the process

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.929 
think that's about early in the process
that<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.470> you're<00:01:28.650> starting<00:01:29.009> conceptual<00:01:29.729> art

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that if you're starting conceptual art

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.569 
that if you're starting conceptual art
for<00:01:30.210> call<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.600> duty<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.740> summer<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
for call of duty in the summer and the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.390 
for call of duty in the summer and the
it's<00:01:32.909> going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.210> released<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.750> fall<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.770> it

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
it's going to be released in fall it it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.969 
it's going to be released in fall it it
doesn't<00:01:35.670> add<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.659> I'm<00:01:37.380> thinking<00:01:37.439> that

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
doesn't add up so I'm thinking that

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.440 
doesn't add up so I'm thinking that
they're<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.400> hiring<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.970> person

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
they're going to be hiring this person

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.870

the main character that you play as in
campaign<00:05:08.770> some<00:05:09.250> information<00:05:10.000> on<00:05:10.240> zombies<00:05:10.870> and

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
campaign some information on zombies and

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.350 
campaign some information on zombies and
the<00:05:11.470> fact<00:05:11.710> that<00:05:11.890> sledgehammer<00:05:12.400> games<00:05:12.760> is<00:05:13.180> not

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
the fact that sledgehammer games is not

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.360 
the fact that sledgehammer games is not
working<00:05:13.780> which<00:05:13.990> is<00:05:14.230> kind<00:05:14.620> of<00:05:14.740> what's<00:05:15.070> to<00:05:15.250> be

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
working which is kind of what's to be

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.430 
working which is kind of what's to be
expected<00:05:15.640> now<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.330> only<00:05:16.540> real<00:05:16.870> issue<00:05:17.110> is<00:05:17.320> that

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
expected now the only real issue is that

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.040 
expected now the only real issue is that
he<00:05:17.740> doesn't<00:05:17.770> have<00:05:18.100> true<00:05:18.940> proof<00:05:19.360> that<00:05:19.930> he

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
he doesn't have true proof that he

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.590 
he doesn't have true proof that he
worked<00:05:20.440> for<00:05:20.770> treyarch<00:05:21.190> and<00:05:21.370> if<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:22.240> worked<00:05:22.510> for

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
worked for treyarch and if I worked for

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.780 
worked for treyarch and if I worked for
Trey<00:05:22.930> are<00:05:23.080> can<00:05:23.260> I<00:05:23.380> no<00:05:23.860> longer<00:05:24.010> work<00:05:24.310> for<00:05:24.370> them

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
Trey are can I no longer work for them

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.970 
Trey are can I no longer work for them
I'm<00:05:24.940> not<00:05:25.120> sure<00:05:25.300> how<00:05:25.540> I<00:05:25.570> would<00:05:25.810> get<00:05:26.170> proof<00:05:26.530> so

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
I'm not sure how I would get proof so

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.950 
I'm not sure how I would get proof so
the<00:05:27.100> only<00:05:27.220> way<00:05:27.460> that<00:05:27.670> we<00:05:27.760> can<00:05:27.820> really<00:05:28.420> know<00:05:28.660> if

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
the only way that we can really know if

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.590 
the only way that we can really know if
this<00:05:29.290> is<00:05:29.320> true<00:05:29.860> is<00:05:30.100> just<00:05:30.790> a<00:05:30.940> wait<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:31.330> see

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
this is true is just a wait and see

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.560 
this is true is just a wait and see
until<00:05:32.250> officially<00:05:33.250> they<00:05:33.460> announce<00:05:33.820> what<00:05:34.450> the
