00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.000
 No. 16 36116 almost 2002 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.950
 51 points pace 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.220
 I myself feel in Fu say that I would place Tteyuu awareness chute has become well 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.140
 Not 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.140
 After all the number of shoots increased 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.420
 In a place where you can shoot 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.430
 I say that the number of times I have run myself has increased 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.760
 So I think that the idea is fundamentally so fundamentally 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.160
 I Fu say before and wonder if changes are 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.360
 Ummm 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.530
 think 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.530
 What is the reason for changing the way of thinking 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.960
 Rainy Day My Soccer Career 0 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:47.850
 I didn't think about playing in the older brother's club, and that's because I myself 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.940
 After all I was disappointed 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.940
 After all 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.870
 That pressure to do something 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.970
 That 's a great wind Before you fight that season 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.780
 But what is the goal of this year 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:08.040
 That's why it's only natural for the team to win, but more than last week 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.520
 I just have to raise my personal goals 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.340
 At that time I tried to stick to the numbers I asked 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.400
 Purchase day 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.000
 After the end of this year 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.290
 that 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.250
 It is evaluated over 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.220
 Not not it was casually admission of about Tteyuu I was shown winning 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:32.970
 After all the numbers that you can see are probably not necessary 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:36.440
 I will be very confident and also in my future football life 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.420
 Well, I think I can't use it. 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.940
 This No. Rail Conscious Tune 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.280
 I want to go to talk when I quite out in representative 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.450
 Even though this stance is different 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.720
 That 's when I got that ball 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.409
 The wedding 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.850
 I want to show you 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.850
 This is that 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.040
 It says that it will not change his stance even if the environment changes 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.830
 In my own red-light district road 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.200
 There will ne 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.200
 It's not an under guard and I 'm not sure 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:19.350
 After all, if there is an environment, Marley will change , and the demand for surroundings will also change. 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:23.930
 I think that it is very difficult to pierce yourself in that 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.930
 Is another really enemy only to think I school that it is their own
