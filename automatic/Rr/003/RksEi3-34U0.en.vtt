00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
textured 1 2 3 4 5 6 keys but the issue

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.400 
textured 1 2 3 4 5 6 keys but the issue
with<00:02:53.600> them<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.620> does<00:02:54.770> not<00:02:55.030> have<00:02:56.030> the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
with them is it does not have the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.720 
with them is it does not have the
symbols<00:02:57.410> such<00:02:57.590> as<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.740> exclamation<00:02:58.340> point<00:02:58.520> at

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
symbols such as the exclamation point at

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.750 
symbols such as the exclamation point at
and<00:02:59.120> asterisks<00:02:59.750> and<00:02:59.810> such<00:03:00.170> on<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:01.340> red<00:03:01.490> keys

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
and asterisks and such on the red keys

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.530 
and asterisks and such on the red keys
so<00:03:02.000> I<00:03:02.030> tend<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:02.450> leave<00:03:02.990> it<00:03:03.140> as<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:04.510> become<00:03:05.510> a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
so I tend to leave it as this become a

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.830 
so I tend to leave it as this become a
question<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:06.260> people<00:03:06.530> wonder<00:03:06.740> is<00:03:07.210> are<00:03:08.210> those

question that people wonder is are those

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.720
