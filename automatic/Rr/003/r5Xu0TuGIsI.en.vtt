00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.610
 Well, as you have seen in the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.860
 title be here I bring you a new 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.290
 seed this already many people or several 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.360
 people or subscribers have been me 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.600
 asking that a seed that 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.109
 have an island and then a single tree 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.940
 like a sky blog guy but good with a 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.610
 seed in a world in an open world 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.640
 where can we be going through what 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.699
 not good in this case this is the seed 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.339
 the seeds is called sprite as the 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.610
 soda that we take like that is called sprite 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.750
 but the s is capital letter good if not 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.519
 they can see how they want 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.070
 description of the video will be the 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.780
 seed put there so that they can 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.390
 see description directly 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.129
 good video friends I already told you what 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.629
 it contains the seed and right now they saw it 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.629
 the seed generated right now I see them 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.950
 and good friends, we are already here in the 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.750
 Generated seed and good friends already 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.090
 being in the seed generated as you see 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.400
 Well let's go for a little round 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.160
 so you can see this how is the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.050
 seed the seed, as I told the 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.570
 principle of the video is an island be 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.040
 completely surrounded by water this as 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.170
 will be watching are surrounded by 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.350
 mountains but do not trust because these 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.330
 mountains are completely from txanpi 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.180
 cows or mushrooms as you like 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.690
 say this and this is the only and the only 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.430
 island with pasture let's say that green is already 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.340
 we know that the grass is really 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.080
 green but on the other islands is what 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.520
 what is michelle's pasture I 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.680
 no and this is the only one and it's the one 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.040
 contains a tree and well 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.259
 these seeds to plant wheat 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.390
 is let's say these seeds are me 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.640
 he did quite pretty impressive by 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.460
 the same thing that is only an island 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.110
 with a tree this if you do not believe me 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.910
 I already went through what has been everything 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.490
 the map as you see here we have the map already 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.470
 discovered all all the islands that they see 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.239
 around are txanpi cows or 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.569
 mushrooms I repeat as you want 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.790
 to call 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.639
 but hey this is the only island up 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.829
 has cane also this is the only island 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:20.920
 that has what is being a tree or 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:23.620
 a tree only and good here is where 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.569
 will have to survive let's say that a 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.069
 skype type block in quotes and I 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.349
 I really liked sharing it with you 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.989
 Well, since enough friends 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.109
 subscribers asked me for this seed not 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.090
 good and good friends this is what 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:39.069
 the seed is coming this I do not go 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.709
 more as I tell you all the seeds 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.409
 I say all the islands that are here 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.599
 around are completely from txanpi 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.770
 cows this is a tip in case you see a 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.900
 cow is 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.880
 let's say put it in a pen and 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.290
 they will have infinite food with what comes 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.360
 being the wooden bowls is a 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.340
 advice in case you want to take it for 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.990
 be in this not good survival 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.120
 this one I leave with these seeds 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.520
 I hope you liked it is one is a 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.620
 little bit this seed of what 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.480
 usual but as you see then nothing else is 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.830
 what is this island being good to you 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.390
