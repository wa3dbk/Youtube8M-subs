of<00:01:12.090> these<00:01:12.260> channels<00:01:13.260> um<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:15.150> there<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
of these channels um so there this is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.480

the<00:01:15.930> first<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.740> then<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.750> second

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
the first one and then the second

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.600 
the first one and then the second
application<00:01:21.440> it's<00:01:22.440> going<00:01:22.620> to<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.800> for<00:01:23.160> one<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
application it's going to be for one of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.990 
application it's going to be for one of
the<00:01:24.590> like<00:01:25.590> one<00:01:25.800> of<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.980> sections<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.490> you

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the like one of the sections that you

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.070 
the like one of the sections that you
probably<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.450> notice<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.870> so<00:01:28.020> V<00:01:28.260> dubbed<00:01:28.790> 25

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
probably just notice it so V dubbed 25

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.360 
probably just notice it so V dubbed 25
so<00:01:31.080> it's<00:01:31.290> pretty<00:01:31.440> much<00:01:31.620> the<00:01:31.680> same<00:01:31.920> thing<00:01:31.980> in

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
so it's pretty much the same thing in

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.810 
so it's pretty much the same thing in
there<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:32.910> just<00:01:33.120> strictly<00:01:34.280> his<00:01:35.280> portion

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
there but it's just strictly his portion

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.330 
there but it's just strictly his portion
of<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.020> application<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.860> then<00:01:38.040> you

kind<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.850> be<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.000> next<00:03:57.209> one<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.600> then<00:03:57.690> after

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
kind of be a next one and then after

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.020 
kind of be a next one and then after
once<00:03:58.350> it's<00:03:58.590> all<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.579> clicking<00:03:59.940> is

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
once it's all that is that clicking is

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.789 
once it's all that is that clicking is
that<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.690> have<00:04:00.810> access<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.350> list<00:04:01.650> of

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
that you have access to a list of

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.840 
that you have access to a list of
channels<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:03.620> so<00:04:04.620> it's<00:04:04.769> pretty<00:04:05.100> much<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.790> for

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
channels and so it's pretty much it for

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.229 
channels and so it's pretty much it for
that<00:04:06.329> folder<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.320> folder<00:04:08.100> that<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.060> went

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
that folder so the folder that I went

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.420 
that folder so the folder that I went
into<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.630> IPTV<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.320> first<00:04:10.560> one<00:04:10.799> you<00:04:11.010> just<00:04:11.040> you

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
into the IPTV the first one you just you

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.509 
into the IPTV the first one you just you
see<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.820> it<00:04:11.970> gets<00:04:12.120> very<00:04:12.299> very<00:04:12.570> very<00:04:12.900> complete

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
see that it gets very very very complete

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.979 
see that it gets very very very complete
would<00:04:14.519> probably<00:04:14.880> take<00:04:15.000> hours<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.450> hours<00:04:15.780> just

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
would probably take hours and hours just

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.680 
would probably take hours and hours just
to<00:04:16.320> go<00:04:16.440> through<00:04:16.470> all<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:18.209> specific

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
to go through all the the specific

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.199 
to go through all the the specific
channels<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:19.289> all<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.530> specific<00:04:20.209> functions

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
channels and all the specific functions

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.770 
channels and all the specific functions
of<00:04:21.359> this<00:04:21.479> but<00:04:21.720> it's<00:04:21.840> a<00:04:21.930> very<00:04:22.039> in-depth

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
of this but it's a very in-depth

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.770 
of this but it's a very in-depth
worthwhile<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:25.050> application<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:26.570> very<00:04:27.570> easy

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
worthwhile the application and very easy

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.980 
worthwhile the application and very easy
to<00:04:27.930> add<00:04:28.169> in<00:04:28.440> so<00:04:29.510> you<00:04:30.510> know<00:04:30.570> you're<00:04:30.750> going<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:30.930> be

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
to add in so you know you're going to be

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.770 
to add in so you know you're going to be
able<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.200> add<00:04:31.320> in<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.680> enjoy<00:04:32.010> it<00:04:32.570> there's<00:04:33.570> that

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
able to add in and enjoy it there's that

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.409 
able to add in and enjoy it there's that
so<00:04:34.260> there's<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.590> V<00:04:34.740> dubbed<00:04:34.979> and<00:04:35.910> then<00:04:36.210> if<00:04:36.300> you

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
so there's the V dubbed and then if you

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.119 
so there's the V dubbed and then if you
debit<00:04:36.630> sorted<00:04:37.080> out<00:04:37.200> this<00:04:37.470> one's<00:04:37.650> probably<00:04:37.770> the

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
debit sorted out this one's probably the

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.089 
debit sorted out this one's probably the
s<00:04:38.219> out<00:04:39.119> of<00:04:39.300> all<00:04:39.449> of<00:04:39.479> them<00:04:39.599> in<00:04:39.989> terms<00:04:40.229> of<00:04:40.529> just

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
s out of all of them in terms of just

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.379 
s out of all of them in terms of just
the<00:04:41.249> organization<00:04:42.149> and<00:04:42.360> how<00:04:43.050> it's<00:04:43.259> sorted

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
the organization and how it's sorted

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.729 
the organization and how it's sorted
because<00:04:45.389> everything<00:04:45.779> is<00:04:45.899> well<00:04:46.110> sorted<00:04:46.499> in

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:46.739 
because everything is well sorted in

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:49.159 
because everything is well sorted in
specific<00:04:47.729> categories<00:04:47.819> as<00:04:48.300> you<00:04:48.449> can<00:04:48.599> see<00:04:48.779> here

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
specific categories as you can see here

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.469 
specific categories as you can see here
so<00:04:49.830> that's<00:04:50.129> the<00:04:50.279> V<00:04:50.489> dubbed<00:04:50.839> folder<00:04:52.969> after<00:04:53.969> that

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
so that's the V dubbed folder after that

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.869 
so that's the V dubbed folder after that
there<00:04:54.869> is<00:04:55.169> we're<00:04:55.979> going<00:04:56.069> to<00:04:56.129> try<00:04:56.339> to<00:04:56.369> whack<00:04:56.639> in

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
a particularly really good folder

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.119 
a particularly really good folder
because<00:05:21.539> there's<00:05:22.199> a<00:05:22.289> lot<00:05:22.439> of<00:05:22.469> less<00:05:22.860> known
