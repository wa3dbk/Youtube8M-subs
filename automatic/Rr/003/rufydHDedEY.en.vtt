just a kind of a feeling with a melody
and<00:02:33.840> then<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.290> try<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.710> kind<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.130> paint<00:02:35.580> a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
and then I try to kind of paint a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.210 
and then I try to kind of paint a
picture<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.210> kind<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.930> roughly<00:02:37.770> with<00:02:37.950> with

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
picture of kind of roughly with with

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.370 
picture of kind of roughly with with
that<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.640> melody<00:02:39.090> at<00:02:39.180> least<00:02:39.360> at<00:02:39.510> first<00:02:39.780> with<00:02:40.350> a

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
that a melody at least at first with a

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.870 
that a melody at least at first with a
melody<00:02:40.800> for<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.130> feeling<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:41.790> know

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
melody for that feeling you know

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.880 
melody for that feeling you know
whatever<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.330> feeling<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.900> which<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.770> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
whatever the feeling is which is the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.860 
whatever the feeling is which is the
most<00:02:44.100> important<00:02:44.610> thing<00:02:44.790> about<00:02:44.880> music<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.630> think

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
most important thing about music I think

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.840 
most important thing about music I think
it's<00:02:45.990> it's<00:02:46.290> definitely<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.830> language<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.760> it

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
it's it's definitely a language and it

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.640 
it's it's definitely a language and it
ends<00:02:48.120> really<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.480> language<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.080> heart<00:02:49.260> you

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
ends really a language of the heart you

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.070 
ends really a language of the heart you
know<00:02:49.880> but<00:02:50.880> but<00:02:51.120> that's<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.480> hardest<00:02:51.900> thing<00:02:52.050> to

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
know but but that's the hardest thing to

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.810 
know but but that's the hardest thing to
keep<00:02:52.440> happening<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:53.190> think<00:02:53.430> for<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.610> tongue

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
keep happening I think for a tongue

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.100 
keep happening I think for a tongue
because<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.120> get<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.420> feeling<00:02:54.810> for<00:02:54.900> about

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
because you get the feeling for about

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.170 
because you get the feeling for about
ten<00:02:55.350> seconds<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.190> know<00:02:56.340> then<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.910> write<00:02:57.150> the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
ten seconds you know then you write the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.970 
ten seconds you know then you write the
initial<00:02:57.540> inspiration<00:02:58.110> then<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.560> got<00:02:58.710> a<00:02:58.740> kind

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
initial inspiration then you got a kind

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.280 
initial inspiration then you got a kind
of<00:02:59.010> labor<00:02:59.250> at<00:02:59.640> least<00:02:59.880> my<00:03:00.120> process<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:00.989> got<00:03:01.170> to

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
of labor at least my process is I got to

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.930 
of labor at least my process is I got to
kind<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.590> leave<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.190> rest<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.550> tune<00:03:02.790> and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
kind of leave it to the rest of tune and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.440 
kind of leave it to the rest of tune and
keep<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.660> same<00:03:04.020> vibe<00:03:04.730> but<00:03:05.730> it's<00:03:05.850> fine<00:03:06.239> you

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
keep that same vibe but it's fine you

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.180 
keep that same vibe but it's fine you
know<00:03:06.480> it's<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:07.110> challenge<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:07.709> it's<00:03:07.770> really

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
know it's a challenge but it's really

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.210 
know it's a challenge but it's really

Mike<00:03:40.670> Stern<00:03:41.000> guitar<00:03:41.630> that<00:03:42.410> they<00:03:42.650> sent<00:03:43.430> me<00:03:43.550> a

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
Mike Stern guitar that they sent me a

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.520 
Mike Stern guitar that they sent me a
bunch<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:44.030> prototypes<00:03:44.660> they<00:03:44.989> were<00:03:45.080> all<00:03:45.230> good

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
bunch of prototypes they were all good

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.900 
bunch of prototypes they were all good
but<00:03:45.830> they<00:03:45.920> kept<00:03:46.130> getting<00:03:46.340> closer<00:03:46.550> to<00:03:46.819> the

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
but they kept getting closer to the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.460 
but they kept getting closer to the
sound<00:03:47.150> I<00:03:47.330> wanted<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.840> I<00:03:47.900> didn't<00:03:48.110> really<00:03:48.350> know

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
sound I wanted and I didn't really know

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.680 
sound I wanted and I didn't really know
how<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.620> tell<00:03:48.950> him<00:03:49.069> so<00:03:49.340> they<00:03:50.060> built<00:03:50.420> this

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
how to tell him so they built this

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.970 
how to tell him so they built this
guitar<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.319> they<00:03:51.380> had<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.590> bunch<00:03:51.890> of

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
guitar and they had a bunch of

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.830 
guitar and they had a bunch of
prototypes<00:03:52.519> close<00:03:52.880> but<00:03:53.180> this<00:03:53.330> was<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.660> best

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
prototypes close but this was the best

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.530 
prototypes close but this was the best
one<00:03:54.250> but<00:03:55.250> this<00:03:55.400> was<00:03:55.610> a<00:03:55.640> really<00:03:56.180> cool<00:03:56.390> guitar

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
one but this was a really cool guitar

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.860 
one but this was a really cool guitar
it's<00:03:56.930> really<00:03:57.220> warm<00:03:58.220> sounding<00:03:59.060> which<00:03:59.540> is<00:03:59.690> what

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
it's really warm sounding which is what

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.199 
it's really warm sounding which is what
I<00:03:59.900> wanted<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:00.769> especially<00:04:01.280> for<00:04:01.640> other<00:04:01.819> solid

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
I wanted and especially for other solid

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.699 
I wanted and especially for other solid
body<00:04:02.420> guitar<00:04:02.780> I<00:04:02.810> wanted<00:04:03.110> to<00:04:03.230> sound<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:03.650> a

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
body guitar I wanted to sound like a

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.490 
body guitar I wanted to sound like a
hollow<00:04:04.040> body<00:04:04.340> guitar<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.390> also<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:06.170> guess

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
hollow body guitar and I also I guess

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.530 
hollow body guitar and I also I guess
because<00:04:06.830> I<00:04:06.950> used<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.370> sing<00:04:07.730> a<00:04:07.940> lot<00:04:08.090> when<00:04:08.299> I<00:04:08.330> was

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
because I used to sing a lot when I was

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.199 
because I used to sing a lot when I was
little<00:04:08.930> I<00:04:09.110> always<00:04:09.470> wanted<00:04:09.769> a<00:04:10.250> singing<00:04:10.760> kind<00:04:11.120> of

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
little I always wanted a singing kind of

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.199 
little I always wanted a singing kind of
sound<00:04:11.450> on<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:12.019> guitar<00:04:12.319> so<00:04:12.830> this<00:04:13.400> had<00:04:13.760> kind<00:04:14.150> of

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
sound on the guitar so this had kind of

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.719 
sound on the guitar so this had kind of
legato<00:04:14.630> on<00:04:15.109> its<00:04:15.290> own<00:04:15.440> so<00:04:15.799> this<00:04:15.980> kind<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.519> gets

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
legato on its own so this kind of gets

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:23.370 
legato on its own so this kind of gets
it<00:04:17.000> for<00:04:17.239> me<00:04:20.620> anyway<00:04:21.620> thanks<00:04:21.919> for<00:04:22.070> watching<00:04:22.789> and
