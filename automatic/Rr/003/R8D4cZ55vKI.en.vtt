00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.640
 teeth the next tutorial we are going to 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.130
 need two loaves the molds 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.990
 specials but if they do not have modes 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.179
 joint specials are more or less 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.730
 two or three sizes and with a pop case 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:29.880
 big guy with those we have 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.009
 I would be a spice mold half 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.660
 the ball that we have available in my 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.200
 class 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:41.500
 and this one makes them using the conterno mini 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.520
 of a milestone also the two well not to be 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.070
 a wonder a halloween wonder 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.680
 then let's put our our 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.090
 bread 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.309
 we can fill it we can cut them 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.010
 fill it out I did not do it this time 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.200
 that's what I'm going to do and this basis is after 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.700
 the body and this is going to be what is the 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.080
 face of the little farm what I want 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.270
 it is this 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.810
 you can make a good touch 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.000
 chubby 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.430
 and will also serve us I'm going to 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.680
 cut this bit so we are 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.240
 finding 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.909
 so 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.520
 let's put it like that we put a little bit 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.060
 of bitumen that I'm using color 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.770
 orange 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:34.990
 and we are going to use a donation is 233 life 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:39.579
 it's not yours that makes a hair like a 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.170
 paper or also as grass then 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.740
 what we are going to do is that we are going to 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.740
 Fill 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.150
 is what we stick to loans to paste 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.870
 we stick 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.820
 we press stop and jalal-abbot then 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.700
 what we are going to do we are going to pretend 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.689
 that this is the plush hair 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.689
 of the little spider 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.569
 we are going to fill it all all 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.040
 let's do it again stick 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.040
 we squeeze 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.240
 we stop and pull and there is what is 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.130
 the stuffed animal 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.800
 being there is not what I wanted to do black 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.270
 I wanted to make it a more vivid color 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.970
 orange more than anything for children 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.320
 and it's very little is something and the only thing 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.310
 that I 'm making a spider because 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.849
 I fucked the spiders I have a terror 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.489
 the spiders but I said you have to face 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.560
 our fears let's make a spider 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.700
 Felix spider 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.280
 I have here also if we can see eight 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.980
 boats these poles are like type 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.480
 extendable from what is the mouthpiece 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.060
 also that we will to 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.849
 to teach better these pots are going to be 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.750
 As if they were little feet, we need 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.750
 eight boats 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.100
 because the spiders have 8 legs 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.659
 that's why they hear them more when they 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.090
 they lose sight then we go to 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.349
 fill in this and right now we come back because 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.510
 this is a little god because 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:26.420
 let's finish this side let's start 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.430
 also with what is the little head 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.040
 all the head 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.400
 does not have much joke anything else does not have 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.629
 much difficulty we are going to hit press 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.629
 to ar and pull 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.630
 is more to be a pastor to be 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.550
 hair 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.160
 in this case we are doing what is 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.090
 the little body of our cookie your 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.090
 habits we return
