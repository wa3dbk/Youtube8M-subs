00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500 

I've<00:00:00.900> traveled<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.560> many<00:00:01.740> cities<00:00:02.510> the

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
I've traveled to many cities the

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.480 
I've traveled to many cities the
universe<00:00:03.959> has<00:00:04.170> showed<00:00:04.410> me<00:00:04.440> such<00:00:04.859> an<00:00:05.009> expanse

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
universe has showed me such an expanse

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.089 
universe has showed me such an expanse
of<00:00:05.759> urban<00:00:06.180> diversity<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:07.170> exists<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:07.980> the

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
of urban diversity that exists in the

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.610 
of urban diversity that exists in the
world<00:00:08.750> but<00:00:09.750> there's<00:00:09.960> just<00:00:10.019> something<00:00:10.230> about

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
world but there's just something about

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.240 
world but there's just something about
Toronto<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.370> stands<00:00:11.700> out<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:12.090> my<00:00:12.120> mind

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
Toronto that stands out in my mind

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.829 
Toronto that stands out in my mind
perhaps<00:00:14.250> it's<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.670> neutrality<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.599> city

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
perhaps it's the neutrality of the city

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.070 
perhaps it's the neutrality of the city
an<00:00:16.490> essence<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.699> attracts<00:00:18.300> moviemakers<00:00:19.050> to

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
an essence that attracts moviemakers to

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.790 
an essence that attracts moviemakers to

film their major productions downtown

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.320 
film their major productions downtown
maybe<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:23.039> how<00:00:23.220> we've<00:00:23.460> planned<00:00:23.820> our<00:00:24.029> green

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
maybe it's how we've planned our green

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.220 
maybe it's how we've planned our green
space<00:00:24.660> well<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:26.279> urban<00:00:26.580> wildlife<00:00:27.230> from

falcons that soar among the skyscrapers

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.430

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
through the world of abstract like how

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.020 
through the world of abstract like how

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
our city hall is shaped like an eye when

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.590 
our city hall is shaped like an eye when
looking<00:01:12.210> from<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.689> sky<00:01:13.010> or<00:01:14.010> how<00:01:14.939> our<00:01:15.150> two<00:01:15.390> most

well-known monuments are reminiscent of

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.620 
well-known monuments are reminiscent of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the human genitalia symbols of humanity

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.850 
the human genitalia symbols of humanity
and<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.380> creation<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:23.009> life<00:01:23.689> or<00:01:24.689> how<00:01:25.619> our

and the creation of life or how our

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.340

from<00:01:28.500> European<00:01:29.250> influences<00:01:31.009> maybe<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.250> high

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
from European influences maybe it's high

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.780 
from European influences maybe it's high
degree<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.299> order<00:01:33.750> within<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> city<00:01:34.729> or<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
degree of order within the city or the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.380 
degree of order within the city or the
way<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.299> care<00:01:36.540> about<00:01:36.689> core<00:01:37.110> essentials

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
way we care about core essentials

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.380 
way we care about core essentials
perhaps<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.600> our<00:01:39.720> definition<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.380> freedom

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
perhaps it's our definition of freedom

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.609 
perhaps it's our definition of freedom
the<00:01:42.390> fact<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.720> we're<00:01:43.140> not<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> power

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the fact that we're not a power

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.149 
the fact that we're not a power
struggling<00:01:44.220> City<00:01:44.630> but<00:01:45.630> simply<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.350> an<00:01:46.590> urban

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
struggling City but simply like an urban

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.160 
struggling City but simply like an urban
garden<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.030> being<00:01:48.270> allowed<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.960> grow

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
garden that is being allowed to grow

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.910 
garden that is being allowed to grow
organically<00:01:50.780> maybe<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:52.020> how<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.229> tackle<00:01:52.560> our

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920

positive objective stories maybe it's

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.679 
positive objective stories maybe it's
