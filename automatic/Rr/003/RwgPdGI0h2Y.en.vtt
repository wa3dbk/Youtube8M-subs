00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello dear friends with you Artem 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.110
 today we have a review of the power supply on 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.990
 800 watts from the company aerocool strike-x 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 This is how the box looks 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.850
 respectively 800 watts inscription and 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.990
 certificate 80 plus silver 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.779
 does this mean with this power supply 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.730
 fairly high efficiency 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.830
 let's see what the box looks like on 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.289
 back of the box respectively 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.590
 is shown 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.559
 various technical information and here 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.500
 Now we will see how many amps he 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.320
 issues on on various lines first 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.690
 supply according to them the way incoming 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.719
 115 230 volts 15 amps everything here 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.129
 standard output is further plus 3 3 volts 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.949
 plus 5 plus 12 in 1 minus 12 plus in itself 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.520
 this is all standard means by line 3 3 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.030
 volts 24 amps on the line plus 5 volts 2 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.989
 4 amps and the most interesting is on the line 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.630
 plus 12 volts 66 m 1 gives the most 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.909
 interesting probably exactly 12 volts 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.799
 line for powering devices which 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.710
 consumes a lot of it in particular 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.520
 various video card processor and so 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.850
 further along the line -12 volt 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.759
 05 amps and on line plus 53 amps 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.210
 further, respectively, we have the maximum 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:30.540
 quantity issued here if we 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.090
 let's look at plus 3 3 volts plus 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.250
 5 volts and plus 12 then respectively 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.520
 this opinion just gives out 800 watts 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.970
 exactly 792 cotton 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.250
 he can give on the line 12 volts at 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.439
 maximum load 6 6 amps about us 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.939
 This does not report well, and the standard 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:54.180
 line -12 volt 6 watts and on line 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:58.969
 respectively plus 5 15 watts further that 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:03.630
 we have from connectors it's 20 plus 4 pin 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:07.030
 to power the motherboard further 4 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:12.130
 plus 4 pin like this 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:15.220
 4 pin for power and wait for 5 pieces here 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.610
 eat further for nutrition 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.740
 even fdd floppy drive here 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.900
 even provided although in principle they are 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.420
 not used anywhere 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.910
 further 8 pieces of connectors for power 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.400
 sata devices 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.090
 8 pin to connect to the mother 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.370
 we gave one thing to the boards here 4 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.270
 6 plus 2 connectors 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.269
 various letters 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.570
 devices particular video cards now 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:46.269
 let's see how the block looks like it 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.360
 design now let's see how the power supply 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.300
 looks externally 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.420
 box we have already opened the block itself 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:00.280
 the food is massive enough branded 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:04.420
 the symbol of the letter x like this 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:08.350
 looks and now let's see what he is from 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.180
 represents himself up close and so do we 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.110
 complete 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.480
 bundled directly by the unit itself 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:19.930
 power supplies are already attached to it by default. 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.940
 motherboard power cables 20 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.110
 plus 4 respectively four 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:29.140
 disconnect further from us here are such 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.640
 8 pin connector for one 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.329
 motherboard power supply and another 2 4 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.140
 pin 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.640
 that is, everything is standard here 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.560
 Then we still have such a cable and 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.650
 they were packed in a box 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.989
 respectively here now 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.380
 let's see what is the way here still in 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.220
 Here are the screws for 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.150
 connections respectively more precisely for 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.950
 screwing the block to the body 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.239
 wires and the power cord of course here 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.880
 all standard standard power cord 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.410
 so now we start with the extra 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.609
 wiring block is connected 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:13.440
 power supply it is used for us 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:16.830
 power sata devices 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.430
 from two sides on the back then 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:24.050
 There is one and the same 4 pin connector 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:29.100
 write express further 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:33.750
 exactly the same cable another two sata 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:37.290
 2 sata and 4 and all new express roughly 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.410
 saying so we have the next wire 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:45.780
 represents 4 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:47.850
 4 pins on one side 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.250
 one on the other hand is for power 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.150
 respectively, go different devices 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:57.990
 not here we have another 4 pin 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:02.100
 now focus tune 4 pin 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:06.450
 write express further what we still here 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.240
 see for power heidi and devices 4 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.890
 pins on one side on the other 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:17.820
 the sides are exactly the same and one more 4 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:20.040
 pin pysya express and here still 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:24.200
 By the way, this connector is now not 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:28.830
 used to power the flop and 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:31.080
 the last thing we have left is the cables 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.830
 for power supply express devices 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:38.570
 such as video cards respectively their 2 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:42.570
 things like that here they look 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.980
 signature write express 6 plus 2 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.650
 accordingly we can connect 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.450
 several graphics cards are quite powerful and 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.070
 effective to nourish with this 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.270
 power supply on power supply 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:56.460
 139 mm fan installed 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.430
 which has non-standard form factor 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.900
 for power supplies in this case on 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.150
 one of the tanks, respectively, the movie is not 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.540
 specification she repeats the same 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:10.110
 the numbers we saw on the box are very 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:13.590
 good performance on the plus 12 line 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.690
 volt is 66 amps I recall and 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.349
 maximum number of watts for this 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:23.419
 lines 792 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:23.419
 certificate 80 plus silver 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:32.270
 further the sound itself looks like this 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:36.000
 metal steel company logo 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.780
 Well, in principle, all well yet connectors for 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.419
 connect 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.729
 modular connectors 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:44.610
 additional power cables 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:46.650
 devices like this 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.780
 in principle, and then all will show 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:53.310
 system complete like this power supply 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:55.229
 will look in the case now 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.810
 general background of the working system with a block 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:07:03.949
 power here it is installed below and 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.949
 accordingly feeds all devices
