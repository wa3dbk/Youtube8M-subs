00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 pegi 18 some spectators could 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.960
 find the images that will follow 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:18.480
 violent or shocking 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:19.830
 here are warned a lot everyone 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.480
 I hope you are doing well today 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.830
 I have a video to show you everything 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.480
 just to show you that there is 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.619
 objects really overpowering on the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.150
 map observe well while in voice to 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.990
 left there are hidden weapons a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.400
 little bit on the map 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.420
 simply I advise you 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.470
 times why the brandes because 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.660
 it is with these weapons that you go 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.790
 to make a maximum of carnage of frags 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.050
 from time to time agree even time age 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.520
 to simply take a sniper 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.840
 which you know was not bad 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.579
 small combinations of weapons either 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.860
 you have a grenade launcher sniper 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.539
 and believe me it's really everything already 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.520
 that's why I allowed myself to 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.750
 take this sniper there to show that 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.460
 I would laugh it really what 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.270
 so it's a 50 caliber like you have 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.469
 could actually see you have everything 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.390
 it's just the m4 at least 2 to 3 a 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.800
 stuff like that so the subway map 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.690
 be aware that on battlefield 3 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.309
 it was quite sharp on battery cats 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.270
 and extremely straight forward for evidence that is 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.010
 play 64 players 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.040
 you also need to know one thing that if 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.990
 unfortunately you are not precise 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.410
 with a sniper or any weapon 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.460
 simen you simply acquired the 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.840
 most powerful weapon of the game 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.740
 unfortunately the accuracy is a 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.280
 major asset that it will be necessary not 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.110
 take lightly 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.090
 in any case here a lift like 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.640
 I explained so it's a 64 cents either 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.200
 3 cents of cat players so that's enough 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.010
 easy in fact to be able all the time 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.479
 it's hype and guys 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.250
 so you stay a little behind 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.280
 at the same time you observe it's a 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.390
 quite naughty card enough compact and no 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.550
 there are always individuals who 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.970
 may present themselves 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.410
 which side 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.180
 that's why we do not need to trust 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.860
 between lens and towers for the assault here 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.990
 I'm learning the two people who are going 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.180
 get out of hondt to get moving so the guy 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.470
 that balance of small gifts 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.890
 surprises so turn by levon is a 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.120
 little we see there 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.670
 doublettes unfortunately I took a 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.680
 assistance because of the teammates who 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.700
 disgust everything that moves for me 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.590
 I wanted to offer you videos 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.090
 so will be little by little the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.100
 objects that are very interesting to 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.270
 take on the map so the gameplay 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.280
 that I did in question I had to do 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.630
 what diddy who sign up like that 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.910
 because for now I'm in 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.709
 hurting you small 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.090
 episode that I really take for the 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.890
 go out that I prefer to come out some 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.209
 quality thing that to go out stuff 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.790
 purpose for going out it's not necessarily 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.290
 interesting for you as for me in 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.970
 anyway I do not bother a little more in 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.209
 the need in battlefield 2 4 this 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.980
 year 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.440
 habibou does a lot of videos of 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.580
 quality so do not hesitate to tell me 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.750
