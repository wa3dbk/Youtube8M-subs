1080p or actually maybe 720p come from

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.430 
1080p or actually maybe 720p come from
the<00:01:08.370> docking<00:01:08.640> station<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:09.630> there<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.410> the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
the docking station up there to the

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.890 
the docking station up there to the
screen<00:01:10.880> when<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.910> see<00:01:12.120> if<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.300> can<00:01:12.390> get<00:01:12.479> them<00:01:12.720> are

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
screen when I see if we can get them are

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.000 
screen when I see if we can get them are
going<00:01:13.050> of<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.350> guys<00:01:16.500> are<00:01:16.710> trying<00:01:16.800> to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
stop a wide I demo now you can see the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.550 
stop a wide I demo now you can see the
docking<00:01:19.979> station<00:01:20.420> down<00:01:21.420> there<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> wide

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
docking station down there just the wide

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.430 
docking station down there just the wide
I<00:01:22.820> capable<00:01:23.820> device<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.840> that's<00:01:24.960> connected<00:01:25.410> to

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
I capable device and that's connected to

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.820 
I capable device and that's connected to
the<00:01:25.950> netgear<00:01:27.050> receiver<00:01:28.050> which<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.410> connected

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
the netgear receiver which is connected

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.230 
the netgear receiver which is connected
to<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.070> screen<00:01:29.580> that's<00:01:29.790> hope<00:01:29.940> we<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.150> get

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
to the screen that's hope we can get

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:39.080 
to the screen that's hope we can get
this<00:01:30.450> running<00:01:30.900> after<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.380> rebooted<00:01:31.890> it

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.430 

here's<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.240> actual<00:01:40.390> where<00:01:40.750> Android<00:01:41.230> the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
here's the actual where Android the

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.480 
here's the actual where Android the
controller<00:01:42.690> so<00:01:43.690> you<00:01:43.810> can<00:01:43.930> see<00:01:44.170> it's<00:01:45.130> obviously

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
controller so you can see it's obviously

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.160 
controller so you can see it's obviously
running<00:01:45.640> like<00:01:46.180> an<00:01:46.270> android<00:01:46.570> open<00:01:46.930> source

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
running like an android open source

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.920 
running like an android open source
version<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.730> bit<00:01:48.850> difficult<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.330> see<00:01:49.690> what

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
version it's a bit difficult to see what

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.640 
version it's a bit difficult to see what
you<00:01:50.740> can<00:01:50.920> see<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.220> actual<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.840> cheese<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:53.230> the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
you can see the actual the cheese on the

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.530 
you can see the actual the cheese on the
left<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.070> right<00:01:54.150> you<00:01:55.150> see<00:01:55.210> if<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.420> can

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
left and the right you see if I can

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.110 
left and the right you see if I can
bring<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:55.720> into<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.080> light<00:01:56.290> of<00:01:56.320> it<00:01:57.120> there

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
bring that into the light of it there

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.880 
bring that into the light of it there
you<00:01:58.240> see<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.510> there<00:01:59.230> you<00:01:59.320> go<00:01:59.410> you<00:01:59.500> can<00:01:59.650> see<00:01:59.770> the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
you see the there you go you can see the

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.740 
you see the there you go you can see the
keys<00:02:00.100> there<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:02.440> they're<00:02:03.430> so<00:02:03.730> some<00:02:03.970> gaming

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
keys there and they're so some gaming

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.800 
keys there and they're so some gaming
potential<00:02:05.590> on<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.860> there<00:02:09.100> we<00:02:09.280> go<00:02:09.810> full

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
potential on that and there we go full

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.170 
potential on that and there we go full
android<00:02:12.540> there<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:14.710> as<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:14.860> suspected<00:02:15.580> it's<00:02:16.060> an

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
android there and as I suspected it's an

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.930 
android there and as I suspected it's an
android<00:02:16.330> open<00:02:16.690> source

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.010 

build<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.730> very<00:02:21.910> nice<00:02:22.150> there<00:02:22.480> there<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.870> go

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
build so very nice there there you go

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.290 
build so very nice there there you go
there's<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.550> controller<00:02:24.550> there<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.850> I've

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
there's the controller there and I've

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.000 
there's the controller there and I've
really<00:02:28.510> got<00:02:28.630> some<00:02:28.810> nice<00:02:29.110> accessories<00:02:29.800> here

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
really got some nice accessories here

see what they've got is white ain't
waiting<00:02:56.260> into<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.560> base<00:02:56.770> station<00:02:57.220> there<00:02:58.410> no

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
waiting into that base station there no

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.010 
waiting into that base station there no
actually<00:02:59.880> this<00:03:00.880> is<00:03:01.030> not<00:03:01.210> why<00:03:01.420> no<00:03:01.480> this<00:03:01.870> is

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
actually this is not why no this is

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.520 
actually this is not why no this is
basically<00:03:02.500> hdmi<00:03:03.130> out<00:03:03.340> straight<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.060> TV<00:03:04.530> it

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
basically hdmi out straight to the TV it

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.120 
basically hdmi out straight to the TV it
is<00:03:05.650> not<00:03:05.890> wide<00:03:06.160> our<00:03:06.340> demo<00:03:06.670> at<00:03:06.790> all<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.890> there<00:03:09.040> you

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
is not wide our demo at all so there you

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.400 
is not wide our demo at all so there you
go<00:03:09.240> there's<00:03:10.240> a<00:03:10.450> docking<00:03:10.690> station<00:03:10.720> there's<00:03:11.290> the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
go there's a docking station there's the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.710 
go there's a docking station there's the
hdmi<00:03:11.740> port<00:03:12.100> USB<00:03:12.630> mouse

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.690 

when<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.840> go<00:03:18.050> taking<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:18.980> quick<00:03:19.190> look<00:03:19.220> at<00:03:19.550> them

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
when you go taking a quick look at them
