you'll<00:00:05.190> need<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.700> certain<00:00:05.970> point<00:00:06.180> with<00:00:06.480> them

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.250 

the<00:00:10.590> parallel<00:00:11.040> some

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.400 

with<00:00:15.650> this<00:00:15.830> you<00:00:15.890> get<00:00:16.219> his<00:00:16.400> module<00:00:16.790> you<00:00:17.240> know

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
with this you get his module you know

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.000 
with this you get his module you know
you<00:00:18.410> can<00:00:18.590> you<00:00:18.920> know<00:00:19.040> we<00:00:19.220> could<00:00:19.250> run<00:00:19.580> you<00:00:20.240> know

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
you can you know we could run you know

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.560 
you can you know we could run you know
here's<00:00:22.010> a<00:00:22.070> generator<00:00:22.610> or<00:00:22.730> whatever<00:00:23.119> comes<00:00:23.360> on

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
here's a generator or whatever comes on

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.230 
here's a generator or whatever comes on
next<00:00:23.840> thing<00:00:24.320> is<00:00:24.350> there<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:24.740> selection

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
next thing is there a selection

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.420 
next thing is there a selection
but<00:00:26.840> can<00:00:26.960> you<00:00:26.990> uh<00:00:27.110> run<00:00:27.830> the<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.100> through<00:00:28.310> this

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
but can you uh run the you through this

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.710 
but can you uh run the you through this
so<00:00:28.610> what<00:00:28.730> does<00:00:28.820> this<00:00:28.940> box<00:00:29.210> we're<00:00:29.420> looking<00:00:29.630> at

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
so what does this box we're looking at

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.750 
so what does this box we're looking at
here<00:00:29.869> this<00:00:30.199> is<00:00:30.320> this<00:00:30.500> is<00:00:30.680> our<00:00:30.800> controller<00:00:31.189> okay

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
here this is this is our controller okay

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.270 
here this is this is our controller okay
so<00:00:32.300> this<00:00:32.450> this<00:00:32.720> converts<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:33.500> battery<00:00:34.040> power

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
so this this converts the battery power

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.390 
so this this converts the battery power
that<00:00:34.489> comes<00:00:34.610> in<00:00:34.820> here<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:36.140> DC<00:00:36.470> power<00:00:36.650> to<00:00:37.370> a

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
that comes in here the DC power to a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.820 
that comes in here the DC power to a
three-phase<00:00:37.820> AC<00:00:38.000> power<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:38.840> it<00:00:39.290> controls<00:00:39.650> how

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
three-phase AC power and it controls how

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.980 
three-phase AC power and it controls how
much<00:00:39.980> power<00:00:40.160> goes<00:00:40.610> to<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:41.030> boat

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:41.990 
much power goes to the boat

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.530 
much power goes to the boat
this<00:00:42.950> is<00:00:43.130> the<00:00:43.280> negative<00:00:43.760> distribution<00:00:44.420> box

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
this is the negative distribution box

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.260 
this is the negative distribution box
that's<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.500> positive<00:00:45.680> distribution<00:00:46.460> box<00:00:46.610> and

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
that's the positive distribution box and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.960 
that's the positive distribution box and
then<00:00:47.450> this<00:00:47.570> is<00:00:47.750> your<00:00:47.780> freebase<00:00:48.710> motor<00:00:49.010> what

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
then this is your freebase motor what

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.390 
then this is your freebase motor what
are<00:00:50.060> the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
are the

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.520 
are the
that's<00:00:51.970> that's<00:00:52.450> base<00:00:52.630> to<00:00:52.780> your<00:00:52.930> high<00:00:53.110> voltage

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
that's that's base to your high voltage

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.650 
that's that's base to your high voltage
district

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
district

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.720 
district
so

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
so

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.299 
so
that's<00:00:57.630> what<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.470> have<00:00:58.620> your<00:00:58.770> main<00:00:58.920> battery

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that's what you have your main battery

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.670 
that's what you have your main battery
cable<00:00:59.610> to<00:00:59.670> come<00:00:59.850> from<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.260> battery<00:01:01.260> packs<00:01:01.440> per

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
cable to come from the battery packs per

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.280 
cable to come from the battery packs per
back<00:01:01.860> so<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.970> positive<00:01:03.660> cable<00:01:03.840> goes<00:01:04.110> over

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
back so the positive cable goes over

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.109 
back so the positive cable goes over
here<00:01:04.440> in<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.620> negative<00:01:04.920> goes<00:01:05.070> here<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.580> that

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
here in the negative goes here and that

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.790 
here in the negative goes here and that
goes<00:01:06.300> to<00:01:06.479> all<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.630> different<00:01:06.810> points<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.530> got

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
goes to all the different points you got

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.920 
goes to all the different points you got
your<00:01:07.920> main<00:01:08.100> your<00:01:08.460> main<00:01:08.640> power<00:01:08.970> here<00:01:09.300> then<00:01:09.840> we

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
your main your main power here then we

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.170 
your main your main power here then we
have<00:01:10.050> accessory<00:01:10.590> drive<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.070> all<00:01:11.190> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.870 

let<00:01:16.180> your<00:01:16.360> motor<00:01:16.799> yes<00:01:17.799> that's<00:01:18.039> your<00:01:18.250> traction

to battery pack let it go once a mirror

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.350 
to battery pack let it go once a mirror
into<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.250> other

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
into the other

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.660 
into the other
iron<00:02:14.050> phosphate<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.010> key<00:02:15.160> where

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.580 

all<00:02:21.760> these<00:02:21.970> little<00:02:22.209> things<00:02:22.540> here<00:02:23.020> are<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.380> keep

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
all these little things here are to keep

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.980 
all these little things here are to keep
the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.460 
the
batterie<00:02:26.680> people

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
batterie people

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.460 
batterie people
it's<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.560> battery<00:02:29.890> management<00:02:30.130> system<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.480> when

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
it's a battery management system so when

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.910 
it's a battery management system so when
we're<00:02:32.650> driving<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.280> monitors<00:02:33.760> all<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.150> cell

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
we're driving and monitors all the cell

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.309 
we're driving and monitors all the cell
so<00:02:35.640> if<00:02:36.030> there's<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.300> problem<00:02:36.599> with<00:02:36.900> any<00:02:37.080> one<00:02:37.260> of

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
so if there's a problem with any one of

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.199 
so if there's a problem with any one of
the<00:02:37.470> batteries<00:02:37.890> does<00:02:38.400> whether<00:02:38.730> it's<00:02:39.000> full

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
the batteries does whether it's full

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
here tells the controller here what you

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.080 
here tells the controller here what you
know<00:02:46.140> there's<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.590> problem<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.280> then<00:02:47.730> we<00:02:47.880> can

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
know there's a problem and then we can

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.110 
know there's a problem and then we can
cut<00:02:48.360> power<00:02:48.569> back<00:02:48.930> we<00:02:49.440> watch<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.580> we<00:02:50.730> can<00:02:50.910> take

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
cut power back we watch so we can take

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.530 
cut power back we watch so we can take
the<00:02:51.270> load<00:02:51.450> off<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.900> battery<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.830> know<00:02:53.540> you

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
the load off of the battery you know you

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.130 
the load off of the battery you know you
know<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.830> every<00:02:56.010> matter<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.900> monitor<00:02:57.900> for

know and so every matter is monitor for

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.360 
know and so every matter is monitor for

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.039 

we<00:03:03.580> can<00:03:03.730> watch<00:03:03.879> up<00:03:04.090> anything<00:03:04.360> is<00:03:04.629> going<00:03:04.900> wrong

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
we can watch up anything is going wrong

was<00:03:46.480> asking<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.020> driver<00:03:47.200> let<00:03:47.530> things<00:03:47.770> to

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
was asking the driver let things to

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.950 
was asking the driver let things to
worry<00:03:48.130> about

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.330

yeah it's not really about like the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.920 
yeah it's not really about like the
driver<00:03:53.640> having<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.120> worry<00:03:54.300> about<00:03:54.390> it<00:03:54.660> is<00:03:54.750> what

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930
