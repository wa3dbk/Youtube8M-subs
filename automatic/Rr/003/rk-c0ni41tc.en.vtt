just a quick overview to change out your
fuel<00:00:02.550> pump<00:00:02.760> first<00:00:03.120> you're<00:00:03.300> gonna

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
fuel pump first you're gonna

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.710 
fuel pump first you're gonna
troubleshoot<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.350> system<00:00:04.460> you<00:00:05.460> will<00:00:05.720> get

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
troubleshoot the system you will get

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.709 
troubleshoot the system you will get
access<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.259> your<00:00:08.010> test<00:00:08.970> port<00:00:09.269> here<00:00:09.510> on<00:00:09.630> the

high side of the fuel rail edge to the
low<00:00:12.269> fuel<00:00:12.480> rail<00:00:12.719> should<00:00:12.900> be<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.049> same

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
have AB AB pump if it does that in let's

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.009 
have AB AB pump if it does that in let's

are<00:01:10.260> pretty<00:01:10.590> simple<00:01:10.830> I've<00:01:11.189> actually<00:01:11.520> never

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
are pretty simple I've actually never

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.200 
are pretty simple I've actually never
had<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.689> go<00:01:12.869> out<00:01:13.080> before<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.400> chances<00:01:14.820> are<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
had one go out before so chances are to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.390 
had one go out before so chances are to
your<00:01:15.299> pump<00:01:15.600> let's<00:01:16.380> say<00:01:16.650> you've<00:01:16.830> diagnosed

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
your pump let's say you've diagnosed

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.149 
your pump let's say you've diagnosed
that<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.909> order<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.630> start<00:01:19.500> working<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:20.009> it

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that in order to start working on it

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.740 
that in order to start working on it
you're<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.820> remove<00:01:21.119> your<00:01:21.950> pumps<00:01:22.950> fuse
