00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.369
 let's talk exactly first 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.380
 if it is useful or not and above all 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.420

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.550
 the investment of money in this product 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.469

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.760
 we will also see a few options and 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.320
 instead of using this product that you 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.250
 can give exactly the same 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.620
 results without spending half of your 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.950
 life in buying this product in the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.950
 same 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.900
 let's start with the main thing and the most 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.080
 important fat burners 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.180
 they serve or they do not serve really it's difficult 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.040
 for me tell you the answer 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.260
 directly so I'm going to tell you 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.710
 in the same way that companies 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.090
 they tell you on the labels of 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.160
 back these products can serve with 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.760
 these those products maybe this 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.220
 product maybe this product serves you 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.950
 can give results and here comes the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.530
 important phrase if it is in 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.869
 combination with a balanced diet and 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.270
 you have a correct exercise plan 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.040
 now because these companies put these 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.530
 ads or they tell you this in their 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.170
 labels because there really is not 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.660
 magic pill that can make you 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.960
 lose weight simply by taking the 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.360
 there is not a pill that can make you 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.850
 burn so many calories to get a 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.960
 great caloric deficit that you need to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.960
 can lose weight 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.660
 so if you are one of those people 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.990
 who is just starting on this if 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.200
 you receive, you are beginning to see how 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.550
 lose weight or how to lose fat what 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.520
 best I can recommend you is that 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.010
 invest not your money but your time in 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.560

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.340
 then when you're on the road 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.580
 correct to decide if you want 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.070
 implement this type of product or not 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.230
 depending on the results that you 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.420
 they can give or in the way they can 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.130
 help more than what was already 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.260
 doing but please understand that 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.730
 these pills are not magic and 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.980
 it's just not a matter of taking you 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.890

 to see better results the latest 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.739
 days and research about the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.670
 fat burners tell us that they are 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.219
 that will help you between 12 to 5 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.719
 one hundred of your maximum results what 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.040
 does that mean in general terms 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.709
 let's say you enter a 12 plan 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.810
 weeks to lose about 10 pounds to the 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.109
 end of the 10 pounds if you used 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.870
 fat burners the amount of fat 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:29.500
 that you lost thanks to the burners is 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:31.720
 between 0.2 to 0.5 pounds that's 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.079
 really what helped you have taken 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.849
 fat burners for 12 weeks 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.549
 Now they are really worth it 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:43.480
 use them or they are not worth that 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.700
 depends one of your pocket 2 of the 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.900
 do you call why you're losing 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:54.189
 weight and really if you want to take 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.530
 the risk or not of taking them now what is 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.090
 My opinion about this taking 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.129
 fat burners or do not take 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.360
 Fat Burners in my opinion there 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.860
 many other things 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.660
 of doing to lower those that half pound 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.850
 in a much more natural way and without 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.010
 commit to your body now that I 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.390
 I mean in compromising what we have to 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.840
 take into account that these burners 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:20.049
 fat usually have 33 products in 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.690
 generally have caffeine they obviously have 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.120
 green tea and then they have a combined 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.850
 special of each company that decide 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.130
 put the vitamins and minerals for 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.510
 be able to energize topics during the day 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.669
 to make you feel like if you had 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.470
 more energy burner grace now 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.230
 in the problem is that also sometimes 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.810
 they add different chemicals now when 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.060
 you take a fat burner can you 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.700
 body is allergic to one of these 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.770
 components at the time that happens 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.930
 you have too many side effects 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.390
 that can affect you, there have already been 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.250
 people that those chemicals affect so much 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.050
 that end up in the hospital in a room 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.510
 of emergencies now if you ask me to 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.040
 I really worth taking a 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.090
 product that will only help you get off 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.500
 of 10 pounds 0.2 or 0.5 really is not worth 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.650
 it and why I say I do not think 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.330
 worth 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.690
 because different things you can do 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.479
 to implement different things that 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.610
 you can and implement to be able to lose 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:20.270
 that amount of weight in the same time 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.880
 or just keep you one more week 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.190
 in the caloric deficit plan in which 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.880
 you are to be able to lose weight now that 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:32.449
 you can implement you say ok in my mind 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.160
 I 'm not going to take fat burners 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.350
 but I want to have the results 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.919
 results that the burners give you 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.229
 very simple fat when you finish your 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.900
 cardio session you simply increase 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.449
 three more minutes to your session and will have 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.340
 exactly the same results is 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:52.780
 lifting a weight lifting session 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:56.180
 when you're done, everything makes a little 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:58.310
 a small series more than the last 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.620
 exercise of you will give you 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.440
 exactly the same to use these 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.460
 fat cheats now 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.320
 another option more you want to energize you a 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.300
 little during the day but not the 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.060
 I recommend a lot because I'm not very close 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.010
 of this but you can have a cup 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.370
 of coffee during the day to energize you 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:20.020
 and have a little bit of the same effect as 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.150
 they would give you the fat burners now 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.790
 please obviously if you are allergic to 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.620
 caffeine or if you have problems against 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.260
 the caffeine obviously do not take from that 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.640
 advice please be smart and good 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.220
 that was the fat burners 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.200
 being a little bit more thorough so that 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.510
 you know them and you make the decision if 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.340
 really in your position and in your 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.830
 situation, it suits you to take them or not 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:45.070
 take them so good that's been all 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.780
 for this video a huge hug I know 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.970

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.530
 frequently in this season but what 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.690
 I'm sorry, I promise you that's a 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.520
 point to change and we will have more 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.990
 much more frequent videos to be able 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.670
 keep us educating and continue to help 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.740
 lots of people do not forget that 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.570
 we are very close to 20 thousand people 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.090
 in the lower community we have grown 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.289

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:16.710

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.780
 ironies of life if I'm eating a 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.910
 hamburger 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.020
 volume stage in front of the ones in case 

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.020
 perhaps it was without fat
