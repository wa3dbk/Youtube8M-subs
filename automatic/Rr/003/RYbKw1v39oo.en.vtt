00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
peels on there the peels have kind of

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.060 
peels on there the peels have kind of
pectin<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.640> them<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.930> pectin<00:00:19.680> will

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
pectin on them and the pectin will

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.120 
pectin on them and the pectin will
really<00:00:20.789> ruin<00:00:21.240> your<00:00:21.480> applesauce<00:00:22.470> because

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
it'll just sicken it up and it'll be

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.120 
it'll just sicken it up and it'll be
sort<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.340> like<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> jelly<00:00:27.029> ish<00:00:27.680> applesauce<00:00:28.680> it

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
sort of like a jelly ish applesauce it

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.910 
sort of like a jelly ish applesauce it
the<00:00:29.460> texture<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.939> really<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.449> bad<00:00:30.830> so<00:00:31.830> you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the texture is really really bad so you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.080 
the texture is really really bad so you
want<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.130> make<00:00:32.189> sure<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.489> get<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.759> really

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
want to make sure you get it really

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.600 
want to make sure you get it really
nicely<00:00:33.329> peeled<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.829> leave<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
nicely peeled you can leave just a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.040 
nicely peeled you can leave just a
little<00:00:35.640> bit<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.149> not<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> big<00:00:36.510> deal<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:36.690> don't

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
little bit it's not a big deal but don't

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.590 
little bit it's not a big deal but don't
leave<00:00:37.200> too<00:00:37.500> much<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.920> there<00:00:38.180> then<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> want<00:00:39.510> to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
leave too much on there then you want to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.920 
leave too much on there then you want to
cut<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.820> this<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.000> how<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> make<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.719> mean

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
cut it up this is how I make it I mean

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.049 
cut it up this is how I make it I mean
you<00:00:43.079> might<00:00:43.260> make<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.590> different<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.430> cut<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
you might make it different you cut it

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.790 
you might make it different you cut it
up<00:00:45.210> into<00:00:46.460> good<00:00:47.460> sized<00:00:47.820> chunks<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:49.500> doesn't

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
up into good sized chunks it doesn't

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.250 
up into good sized chunks it doesn't
really<00:00:49.920> matter<00:00:50.270> how<00:00:51.270> big<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> chunks<00:00:52.110> are

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
really matter how big the chunks are

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.660 
really matter how big the chunks are
really<00:00:53.090> because<00:00:54.090> you're<00:00:54.300> cooking<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.840> down

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
really because you're cooking it down

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.400 
really because you're cooking it down
you'll<00:00:56.670> notice<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.480> putting<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> chunks

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
you'll notice that I putting the chunks

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.229 
you'll notice that I putting the chunks
in<00:00:58.559> there<00:00:58.680> little<00:00:58.890> by<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.789> have

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
in there little by little and I have

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.119 
in there little by little and I have
just<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:00.629> bit<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.930> water<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.500> there<00:01:01.710> just

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
just a little bit of water in there just

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.899 
just a little bit of water in there just
to<00:01:02.370> make<00:01:02.579> sure<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:03.920> nothing<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.129> happens

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
to make sure that nothing really happens

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.520 
to make sure that nothing really happens
to<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.270> Apple<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.110> they<00:01:07.229> don't<00:01:07.350> just

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
to the Apple so that they don't just

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.039 
to the Apple so that they don't just
cook<00:01:07.740> off<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:07.979> bottom<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.299> most<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
cook off the bottom but most of that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.410 
cook off the bottom but most of that
water<00:01:10.320> will<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.619> evaporate<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.729> later<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.060> if

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
water will just evaporate so later on if

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.050 
water will just evaporate so later on if
you<00:01:12.570> think<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.930> need<00:01:13.110> even<00:01:13.500> more<00:01:13.700> water<00:01:14.700> just

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
you think you need even more water just

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.480 
you think you need even more water just
kind<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.299> keep<00:01:15.509> adding<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
kind of keep adding it I like the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.450 
kind of keep adding it I like the
texture<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.560> continuously<00:01:19.560> adding<00:01:19.920> apples

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
texture of continuously adding apples

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.679 
texture of continuously adding apples
and<00:01:20.759> having<00:01:21.060> them<00:01:21.150> cook<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.659> different<00:01:21.689> times

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
and having them cook at different times

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.060 
and having them cook at different times
because<00:01:24.689> i<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:25.049> my<00:01:25.380> applesauce<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
because i like my applesauce to be a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.890 
because i like my applesauce to be a
little<00:01:26.250> bit<00:01:26.430> chunky<00:01:26.820> if<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.299> don't<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:27.689> your

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
little bit chunky if you don't like your

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.289 
little bit chunky if you don't like your
apples<00:01:28.200> us<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.650> chunky<00:01:28.890> then<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.000> might

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
apples us to be chunky then you might

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.480 
apples us to be chunky then you might
want<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.350> put<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.040> apples<00:01:32.369> in

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
want to just put all of the apples in

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.800 
want to just put all of the apples in
there<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> little<00:01:33.000> bit<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.210> water<00:01:33.420> and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
there with a little bit of water and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.109 
there with a little bit of water and
then<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.560> turn<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.159> water<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.850> then

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
then just turn on the water and then

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.370 
then just turn on the water and then
just<00:01:36.299> let<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> while<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:39.380> it's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
just let it go for a while so it's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.190 
just let it go for a while so it's
really<00:01:41.310> not<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.670> difficult<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.930> don't<00:01:43.110> even

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
really not that difficult you don't even

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.810 
really not that difficult you don't even
have<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.500> Canada<00:01:44.040> if<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.220> don't<00:01:44.399> want<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.700> you

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
have to Canada if you don't want to you

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.390 
have to Canada if you don't want to you
could<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.240> eat<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
could just eat it

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.470 
could just eat it
but<00:01:47.150> i<00:01:47.180> usually<00:01:47.680> do<00:01:48.680> both<00:01:48.890> i'll<00:01:49.670> lead<00:01:49.940> some<00:01:50.210> and

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
but i usually do both i'll lead some and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.710 
but i usually do both i'll lead some and
then<00:01:50.690> i'll<00:01:50.840> cancel<00:01:51.820> you<00:01:52.820> can<00:01:53.030> add<00:01:53.150> sugar<00:01:53.420> and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
then i'll cancel you can add sugar and

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.440 
then i'll cancel you can add sugar and
cinnamon<00:01:53.990> I<00:01:54.380> usually<00:01:55.190> don't<00:01:55.490> add<00:01:55.730> anything<00:01:56.000> I

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
cinnamon I usually don't add anything I

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.660 
cinnamon I usually don't add anything I
don't<00:01:56.570> even<00:01:56.810> have<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.050> sugar<00:01:57.410> until<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:58.130> open

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
don't even have the sugar until I open

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.510 
don't even have the sugar until I open
the<00:01:58.790> jar<00:01:59.030> later<00:01:59.300> on<00:01:59.510> in<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.750> winter<00:02:00.520> here's

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
the jar later on in the winter here's

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.300 
the jar later on in the winter here's
just<00:02:02.090> adding<00:02:02.540> more<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:02.810> more<00:02:03.070> every<00:02:04.070> time<00:02:04.100> I

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
just adding more and more every time I

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.550 
just adding more and more every time I
add<00:02:04.610> apples<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:06.160> usually<00:02:07.160> mix<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.790> a<00:02:07.850> little<00:02:07.880> bit

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
add apples I usually mix it a little bit

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.930 
add apples I usually mix it a little bit
you'll<00:02:09.560> see<00:02:09.770> that<00:02:09.920> some<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.369> bottom<00:02:10.700> there

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
you'll see that some of the bottom there

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.970 
you'll see that some of the bottom there
some<00:02:11.240> of<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.600> sauce<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.170> basically<00:02:12.740> there

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
some of the sauce is basically there

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:22.150 
some of the sauce is basically there
it's<00:02:13.340> nice<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:15.100> beautiful<00:02:16.100> texture<00:02:21.010> this<00:02:22.010> is

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
it's nice and beautiful texture this is

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.340 
it's nice and beautiful texture this is
when<00:02:22.340> it's<00:02:22.490> almost<00:02:22.730> done<00:02:23.060> there's<00:02:23.840> really<00:02:24.080> not

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
when it's almost done there's really not

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.740 
when it's almost done there's really not
much<00:02:24.709> left<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:25.190> do<00:02:25.400> here<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:26.000> guess<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.630> really

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
much left to do here I guess it really

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.220 
much left to do here I guess it really
depends<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.290> how<00:02:27.380> hung<00:02:27.650> kee<00:02:27.740> you<00:02:27.860> like<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:29.230> what

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
depends on how hung kee you like it what

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.740 
depends on how hung kee you like it what
I<00:02:30.260> usually<00:02:30.560> do<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.540> I'll<00:02:32.540> start<00:02:32.840> putting<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
I usually do is I'll start putting the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.930 
I usually do is I'll start putting the
Smasher<00:02:35.750> like<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.709> potato<00:02:37.040> Smasher<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.730> mine

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
Smasher like the potato Smasher to mine

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.150 
Smasher like the potato Smasher to mine
but<00:02:38.780> if<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:38.990> like<00:02:39.140> him<00:02:39.320> even<00:02:39.470> smoother<00:02:40.010> than

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
but if you like him even smoother than

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.980 
but if you like him even smoother than
that<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.910> could<00:02:41.150> always<00:02:41.300> do<00:02:41.660> one<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.840> those

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
that you could always do one of those

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.720 
that you could always do one of those
soup<00:02:42.260> blenders<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.070> bet<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:43.610> would

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
soup blenders and I bet you that would

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.580 
soup blenders and I bet you that would
get<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:44.000> really<00:02:44.300> really<00:02:44.480> smooth<00:02:44.900> or<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.410> could

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
get it really really smooth or you could

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.080 
get it really really smooth or you could
just<00:02:45.620> keep<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:46.130> cooking<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:46.670> for<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.910> really

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
just keep on cooking it for a really

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.760 
just keep on cooking it for a really
long<00:02:47.209> time<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:47.930> guess<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.380> wouldn't<00:02:48.560> take<00:02:48.740> that

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
long time I guess it wouldn't take that

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.770 
long time I guess it wouldn't take that
long<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.820> they<00:02:49.910> will<00:02:50.060> get<00:02:50.180> smoother<00:02:50.630> and

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
long and they will get smoother and

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.050 
long and they will get smoother and
smoother<00:02:51.290> over<00:02:51.590> time<00:02:51.830> but<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.280> like<00:02:52.580> mine<00:02:52.790> about

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
smoother over time but I like mine about

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.360 
smoother over time but I like mine about
like<00:02:53.600> this<00:02:53.900> just<00:02:54.260> because<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.620> like<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:54.920> be<00:02:55.250> able

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
like this just because I like to be able

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.910 
like this just because I like to be able
to<00:02:55.580> fight<00:02:56.239> those<00:02:56.600> apples<00:02:57.050> when<00:02:57.320> I<00:02:57.350> eat<00:02:57.739> my

they're nice and sterile I usually try

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.640 
they're nice and sterile I usually try
to<00:03:25.670> put<00:03:25.910> my<00:03:26.060> jars<00:03:26.420> as<00:03:26.600> close<00:03:26.870> to<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.140> pot<00:03:27.380> as<00:03:27.530> I

to put my jars as close to the pot as I

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.860 
to put my jars as close to the pot as I
can<00:03:27.920> just<00:03:28.400> because<00:03:28.790> then<00:03:29.269> you<00:03:29.390> don't<00:03:29.420> make<00:03:29.720> as

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
can just because then you don't make as

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.090 
can just because then you don't make as
big<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:30.260> mess

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.760 

you<00:03:34.490> put<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.820> funnel<00:03:35.060> on<00:03:35.300> there<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:36.470> spoon

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
you put the funnel on there you spoon

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.730 
you put the funnel on there you spoon
the<00:03:37.040> applesauce<00:03:37.820> in<00:03:38.090> there<00:03:38.360> or<00:03:38.740> whatever

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
the applesauce in there or whatever

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.490 
the applesauce in there or whatever
sauce<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.280> might<00:03:40.610> be<00:03:40.730> making<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:45.110> want<00:03:45.350> to

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
sauce you might be making you want to

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.760 
sauce you might be making you want to
ladle<00:03:46.460> it<00:03:46.640> up<00:03:46.790> in<00:03:47.000> there<00:03:47.180> up<00:03:47.420> until<00:03:47.690> or<00:03:48.380> spoon

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
ladle it up in there up until or spoon

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.200 
ladle it up in there up until or spoon
it<00:03:48.890> in<00:03:49.040> there<00:03:49.250> until<00:03:49.400> there's<00:03:49.880> about<00:03:50.150> a

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
it in there until there's about a

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.300 
it in there until there's about a
quarter<00:03:50.690> of<00:03:50.720> an<00:03:50.960> inch<00:03:51.110> or<00:03:51.380> so<00:03:51.560> half<00:03:51.860> an<00:03:52.070> inch<00:03:52.220> to

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
quarter of an inch or so half an inch to

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.090 
quarter of an inch or so half an inch to
a<00:03:52.460> quarter<00:03:52.640> of<00:03:52.790> an<00:03:53.000> inch<00:03:53.860> this<00:03:54.860> obviously

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
a quarter of an inch this obviously

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.270 
a quarter of an inch this obviously
isn't<00:03:55.580> that<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:56.270> usually<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:56.750> have<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.350> take<00:03:58.250> a

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
isn't that so usually I have to take a

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.270 
isn't that so usually I have to take a
spoon<00:03:58.820> I<00:03:59.240> use<00:03:59.690> one<00:03:59.930> of<00:03:59.960> the<00:04:00.110> larger<00:04:00.620> eating

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
spoon I use one of the larger eating

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.310 
spoon I use one of the larger eating
spoons<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:03.590> makes<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:04.010> pretty<00:04:04.340> easy<00:04:04.490> I

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
spoons and it makes it pretty easy I

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.810 
spoons and it makes it pretty easy I
like<00:04:06.320> applesauce<00:04:06.770> tube<00:04:07.040> because<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.490> doesn't

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
like applesauce tube because it doesn't

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.540 
like applesauce tube because it doesn't
really<00:04:07.970> get<00:04:08.180> on<00:04:08.330> the<00:04:08.480> rim<00:04:08.860> which<00:04:09.860> other<00:04:10.190> things

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
really get on the rim which other things

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.990 
really get on the rim which other things
will<00:04:11.500> they'll<00:04:12.500> drip<00:04:12.860> on<00:04:13.100> things<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.700> this<00:04:13.820> one

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
will they'll drip on things and this one

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000 
will they'll drip on things and this one
doesn't<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:14.900> glass<00:04:15.230> room<00:04:15.260> is<00:04:15.590> pretty<00:04:15.770> nice

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
doesn't the glass room is pretty nice

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.840 
doesn't the glass room is pretty nice
and<00:04:16.250> clean<00:04:20.230> then<00:04:21.230> I<00:04:21.410> take<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.680> chopstick<00:04:22.490> and

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
and clean then I take the chopstick and

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.460 
and clean then I take the chopstick and
I<00:04:23.060> make<00:04:23.270> sure<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:23.600> get<00:04:23.720> all<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.290> bubbles

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
I make sure that I get all the bubbles

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.260 
I make sure that I get all the bubbles
out<00:04:24.800> of<00:04:24.980> there<00:04:25.220> they're<00:04:25.610> still<00:04:25.910> going<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.180> be

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
out of there they're still going to be

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.120 
out of there they're still going to be
bubbles<00:04:26.720> even<00:04:27.230> when<00:04:27.380> you're<00:04:27.500> down<00:04:27.740> there<00:04:27.920> will

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
bubbles even when you're down there will

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.810 
bubbles even when you're down there will
be<00:04:28.250> bubbles<00:04:28.810> but<00:04:30.010> it's<00:04:31.010> nice<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.280> try<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.640> get

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
be bubbles but it's nice to try to get

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.600 
be bubbles but it's nice to try to get
as<00:04:31.970> many<00:04:32.150> of<00:04:32.390> them<00:04:32.600> as<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:32.810> can<00:04:33.290> I've<00:04:34.010> had<00:04:34.310> lots

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
as many of them as you can I've had lots

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.270 
as many of them as you can I've had lots
of<00:04:34.820> bubbles<00:04:35.000> before<00:04:35.420> and<00:04:36.080> it's<00:04:36.320> still<00:04:36.620> fine<00:04:36.950> it

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
of bubbles before and it's still fine it

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.430 
of bubbles before and it's still fine it
doesn't<00:04:37.310> go<00:04:37.730> bad<00:04:37.970> or<00:04:38.150> anything<00:04:38.180> so<00:04:38.960> if<00:04:39.230> you

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
doesn't go bad or anything so if you

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.780 
doesn't go bad or anything so if you
have<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.680> couple<00:04:40.070> bubbles<00:04:40.400> in<00:04:40.580> there

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
have a couple bubbles in there

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.580 
have a couple bubbles in there
especially<00:04:41.390> after<00:04:41.810> you're<00:04:42.110> done<00:04:42.290> if<00:04:42.470> they

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
especially after you're done if they

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.860 
especially after you're done if they
just<00:04:42.800> pop<00:04:42.980> around<00:04:43.190> there<00:04:43.610> don't<00:04:44.360> worry<00:04:44.570> about

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
just pop around there don't worry about

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.560 
just pop around there don't worry about
it<00:04:45.080> it'll<00:04:46.010> be<00:04:46.130> fine<00:04:46.370> you<00:04:46.970> always<00:04:47.240> have<00:04:47.420> to

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
it it'll be fine you always have to

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.030 
it it'll be fine you always have to
clean<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.900> rim<00:04:48.110> just<00:04:48.470> so<00:04:48.620> that<00:04:48.800> there's

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
clean the rim just so that there's

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.820 
clean the rim just so that there's
nothing<00:04:49.250> there<00:04:49.670> that's<00:04:49.940> going<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.500> stop<00:04:51.500> the

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
nothing there that's going to stop the

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.490 
nothing there that's going to stop the
seal<00:04:52.070> from<00:04:52.280> happening<00:04:52.780> my<00:04:53.780> seals<00:04:54.080> are<00:04:54.320> nice

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
seal from happening my seals are nice

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.540 
seal from happening my seals are nice
and<00:04:54.890> hot<00:04:55.130> I<00:04:55.490> usually<00:04:56.030> just<00:04:56.060> keep<00:04:56.390> those<00:04:56.540> on<00:04:56.750> low

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
and hot I usually just keep those on low

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.330 
and hot I usually just keep those on low
get<00:04:58.550> my<00:04:58.670> magnet<00:04:59.180> so<00:04:59.360> I<00:04:59.390> don't<00:04:59.600> burn<00:04:59.750> myself<00:05:00.340> put

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
get my magnet so I don't burn myself put

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.670 
get my magnet so I don't burn myself put
the<00:05:01.460> seal<00:05:01.700> right<00:05:02.030> on<00:05:02.270> there<00:05:02.600> and<00:05:03.170> then<00:05:03.350> i<00:05:03.380> have

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
the seal right on there and then i have

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.640 
the seal right on there and then i have
the<00:05:04.600> screw<00:05:05.600> tops<00:05:05.900> and<00:05:07.360> you<00:05:08.360> don't<00:05:08.660> want<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.140> put

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
the screw tops and you don't want to put

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.830 
the screw tops and you don't want to put
these<00:05:09.830> too<00:05:10.130> tight<00:05:10.400> in<00:05:10.550> there<00:05:10.730> just<00:05:11.330> until<00:05:11.600> you

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
these too tight in there just until you

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.120 
these too tight in there just until you
start<00:05:12.230> to<00:05:12.320> feel<00:05:12.440> a<00:05:12.500> little<00:05:12.560> bit<00:05:12.770> of<00:05:12.890> pressure

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
start to feel a little bit of pressure

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.930 
start to feel a little bit of pressure
then<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.640> little<00:05:14.000> bit<00:05:14.120> more<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.390> that's<00:05:14.840> it

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
then a little bit more and that's it

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.330 
then a little bit more and that's it
this<00:05:16.940> pot<00:05:17.270> is<00:05:17.300> actually<00:05:17.990> not<00:05:18.260> that<00:05:18.320> big<00:05:19.010> I

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
this pot is actually not that big I

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.670 
this pot is actually not that big I
should<00:05:19.820> have<00:05:19.940> a<00:05:20.000> bigger<00:05:20.300> pot<00:05:20.630> I<00:05:20.960> think<00:05:21.410> this<00:05:21.530> is

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
should have a bigger pot I think this is

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.530 
should have a bigger pot I think this is
a<00:05:21.710> seven<00:05:22.100> core<00:05:22.340> I<00:05:22.520> would<00:05:22.730> probably<00:05:23.090> use<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:23.210> ten

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
a seven core I would probably use a ten

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.770 
a seven core I would probably use a ten
core<00:05:23.870> if<00:05:24.500> I<00:05:24.650> could<00:05:24.920> or<00:05:25.160> even<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.490> nine<00:05:25.700> court<00:05:26.030> but

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
core if I could or even a nine court but

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.020 
core if I could or even a nine court but
the<00:05:27.320> reason<00:05:27.500> why<00:05:27.830> it's<00:05:28.010> still<00:05:28.160> okay<00:05:28.670> for<00:05:28.700> me<00:05:29.000> to

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
the reason why it's still okay for me to

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.200 
the reason why it's still okay for me to
use<00:05:29.330> this<00:05:29.360> pot<00:05:29.870> is<00:05:30.110> because<00:05:30.700> it's<00:05:31.700> a<00:05:31.940> pressure

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
use this pot is because it's a pressure

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.570 
use this pot is because it's a pressure
cooker<00:05:32.540> and<00:05:32.930> so<00:05:33.410> I<00:05:33.440> can<00:05:33.710> put<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:33.980> lid<00:05:34.190> on<00:05:34.220> there

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
cooker and so I can put the lid on there

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.390 
cooker and so I can put the lid on there
and<00:05:34.820> the<00:05:35.720> lid<00:05:35.930> holds<00:05:36.290> the<00:05:36.410> steam<00:05:36.710> enough<00:05:37.100> that

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
and the lid holds the steam enough that

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.980 
and the lid holds the steam enough that
it<00:05:37.910> creates<00:05:38.300> a<00:05:38.480> high<00:05:38.660> enough<00:05:38.930> temperature

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
it creates a high enough temperature

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.460 
it creates a high enough temperature
above<00:05:39.950> the<00:05:40.190> jars<00:05:40.490> but<00:05:41.300> normally<00:05:41.810> you<00:05:41.840> want<00:05:42.229> a

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
above the jars but normally you want a

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.500 
above the jars but normally you want a
whole<00:05:42.800> inch<00:05:43.130> of<00:05:43.340> water<00:05:43.550> above<00:05:44.000> the<00:05:44.210> job

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
whole inch of water above the job

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.390 
whole inch of water above the job
if<00:05:44.960> you're<00:05:45.500> trying<00:05:45.710> to<00:05:45.890> do<00:05:46.010> this<00:05:46.190> correctly

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
if you're trying to do this correctly

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.070 
if you're trying to do this correctly
and<00:05:46.940> you<00:05:47.030> don't<00:05:47.210> have<00:05:47.300> a<00:05:47.360> pressure<00:05:47.630> cooker<00:05:47.900> lid

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
and you don't have a pressure cooker lid

00:05:48.080 --> 00:06:01.800 
and you don't have a pressure cooker lid
that<00:05:48.470> you<00:05:48.560> can<00:05:48.740> tighten<00:05:48.950> down

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.200 

so<00:06:02.320> just<00:06:02.770> screw<00:06:03.040> it<00:06:03.190> in<00:06:03.280> there<00:06:03.520> just<00:06:03.730> a<00:06:03.940> little

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
so just screw it in there just a little

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.920 
so just screw it in there just a little
bit<00:06:05.100> and<00:06:06.100> then<00:06:06.370> you<00:06:06.490> seal<00:06:06.730> it<00:06:06.760> up<00:06:06.970> and<00:06:07.270> it<00:06:07.570> takes

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
bit and then you seal it up and it takes

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.850 
bit and then you seal it up and it takes
about<00:06:08.200> 15<00:06:09.070> minutes<00:06:09.100> for<00:06:09.790> these<00:06:09.970> to<00:06:10.180> be<00:06:10.210> done<00:06:10.860> on

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
about 15 minutes for these to be done on

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.520 
about 15 minutes for these to be done on
this<00:06:12.370> and<00:06:12.820> I<00:06:13.000> think<00:06:13.240> it's<00:06:13.389> only<00:06:13.600> about<00:06:13.840> 15<00:06:14.380> to

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
this and I think it's only about 15 to

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.100 
this and I think it's only about 15 to
20<00:06:14.740> minutes<00:06:15.160> for<00:06:15.700> these<00:06:16.000> jars<00:06:16.360> for<00:06:16.690> the<00:06:16.810> course

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
20 minutes for these jars for the course

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
if you were doing the pints it takes a

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.870 
if you were doing the pints it takes a
little<00:06:20.740> bit<00:06:20.889> longer<00:06:21.100> than<00:06:21.400> that<00:06:21.550> it<00:06:21.730> might

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
little bit longer than that it might

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.280 
little bit longer than that it might
take<00:06:22.090> more<00:06:22.270> like<00:06:22.480> 25<00:06:23.020> minutes<00:06:23.320> and<00:06:25.290> it's

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
take more like 25 minutes and it's

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.100 
take more like 25 minutes and it's
pretty<00:06:26.560> quick<00:06:26.950> I<00:06:27.340> would<00:06:28.270> just<00:06:28.540> look<00:06:28.690> at<00:06:28.870> the
