00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:12.750
 carlos filipe camelo and galeno mal beauty 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.179
 I am that and today I came to talk about the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.330
 last book of the chronicles of whom I 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.160
 called haunts the serpent spirit 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.779
 by wigan 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.390
 this is the third book in the series that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.210
 also counted on the first books 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.050
 book the red pyramid the second 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.690
 book the throne of fire and the third book 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.760
 then the shadow of the serpent these two 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.649
 The first ones already have a review here on the blog. 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.260
 here in blog and blog 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.879
 if you want just take a look there 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.250
 remembering that this video may have 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.500
 spoiler of these first two books 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.350
 before talking about the history of the book 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.629
 I wanted to emphasize the finishing of this 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.460
 book here that has kept the same pattern 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.860
 of the first two books 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.399
 professional is excellent he has the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.010
 title of both the cover and the spine a 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.129
 as well as some parts of the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.990
 cover are varnished this last book 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.100
 also has fewer pages than the two 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.310
 with 350 pages in total 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.759
 counting the glossary with the terms with 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.680
 the gods and with the Egyptian terms in this 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.799
 The last book is the one that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.580
 snake of evil is loosed at once and 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.159
 The purpose of the crankcase and the sad is to find 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.189
 some way to destroy the 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.430
 possession since he is promising that will 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.369
 swallow the sun and spread the greater evil 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.400
 of chaos for the whole earth for that they 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.710
 make several theories plus one of them is 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.439
 something involved that was not the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.700
 which is related to the shadow of the 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.979
 snake 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.470
 in the shadow of the apostles that you go 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.479
 end up discovering that you want to read this 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.009
 I really do not have much book here. 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.619
 What to talk about the shadow book. 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.560
 snake because to me at least he 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.040
 kept the same level of 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.110
 good reading that I consider of the two 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.110
 first books I will compensate that 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.700
 of the three is what I least liked was the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.170
 shadow of the serpent but 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.629
 even so he's very good because I 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.269
 I liked it because practically the whole 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:22.480
 mythology has already been explained in the 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:25.030
 two first books thinking only the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.129
 So zealous action and adventure 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.340
 last book and this ended up leaving 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.080
 a little less interesting to 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.800
 people end up discovering a little more 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.580
 about how the Egyptians faced the soul 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.830
 how they faced the shadow part of the 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.799
 soul they talk about in this book 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.610
 but the same mythology part 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:51.670
 to the gods and to the monsters so to speak 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.709
 was not as exploited as it was in the 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.690
 two first books in the book to 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.910
 pyramid that the first agent 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.250
 was introduced to Egyptian mythology 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.530
 new program everything was cool 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.110
 in the second book he continued the 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.989
 introduction showing how the path was 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.420
 to go wrong all over Haiti and in the third 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.790
 we do not have much of anything like that 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.090
 our fault and this is a legal point of 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.489
 Egyptian culture but that does not 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.040
 merit of the book because it is very good 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.950
 I do not know iran after having it. 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.810
 read these three books and thus became 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.500
 one of the new favorite authors because 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.980
 he does not let the excitement and adventure and 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.500
 desire to continue reading the book and peace 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.239
 no so for every free man was 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.639
 interestingly I had a part that I said 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.489
 so ours does not really like that part 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.709
 not from beginning to end he 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.470
 maintained a very continuous narrative and 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:51.400
 very delicious gave me the least I liked 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.799
 much this way more adventurous 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.540
 So let's say the RIC keep because it's 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.750
 very interesting so much that I 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.810
 practically neither feels these 350 pages 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.750
 pass and at the end with certainty of a 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.599
 This sucks 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.940
 A lot, but it should not be over so soon. 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.160
 To tell the truth, it was nice to have done three 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.859
 books to be a more compact thing 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.799
 but I was very happy that I had 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:20.919
 a fourth book to have more 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.200
 really contact the gods of the world 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.690
 of Egyptian mythology 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.230
 cool thing irb does in that 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.170
 book 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.680
 to explain in a very nice way here is 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.360
 fundamental of non-religion mythology 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.340
 between the various peoples 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.070
 he explains for example that each person 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.890
 will follow your destiny after death 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.930
 according to the belief that I believe this is 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.230
 very cool for him especially 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.600
 mess with various other types of gods 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.450
 I, for example, here with pleasure and 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.360
 gypsy in the heroes of olimpo and prince 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.470
 jackson with Greek mythology seems to 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.390
 It is willing to release a book of 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.000
 Norse mythology now also he 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.650
 explains that although there are several 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.680
 supernatural worlds 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.020
 the person goes to the world that she 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.840
 believe and this is a very nice and 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.330
 give more than one esp 9 than with 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.370
 The end of this book was quite understandable. 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.100
 which button said something like that 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.830
 I do not know, maybe an intersection between 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.840
 tonic of the game and prince jackson not 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.610
 I know because it gives you a tone like that 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.040
 after what happens at the end of this 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.490
 book that there are several other gods 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.320
 several other cultures than those who are good 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.020
 have to find out they will have to know 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.730
 To handle this, I thought it was cool, and I was 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.570
 I'm really looking forward to it if you really have 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:43.750
 continuation or intersection of the 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:46.630
 Chronicles of the Can with Prince Jackson 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.210
 studying some of the Egyptian culture of the 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.910
 Greek culture and this is very 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.420
 seeing the two types of god we work 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.700
 together forcing and being very cool I 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.010
 I'm very anxious even precarious 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.900
 of a bd so great after I 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.730
 I finished writing about the snakes. 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.200
 not because it's not for the book to be bad 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.670
 more putin type 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.680
 You know when you must have been the same. 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.810
 feel the guys that he 's harry 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.770
 potter had as his last theme 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:17.350
 poxa book is already over 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.170
 Good, this does not have much to talk about. 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.180
 I'm suspect to talk about books. 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.970
 Chronicles of the Games 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.250
 because seriously it became one of mine 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.350
 favorite book series and is 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.270
 basically this is what i have to say 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.340
 about the book did not like it and has 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.220
 a lot more to say but like me 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.900
 I liked a date is something that I 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.310
 I did not really like it or did not like it very much. 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.430
 this part of 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:45.070
 more action and less methodology but still 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.080
 so the book is very good and only from 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.270
 have contact with the Egyptian gods who 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.600
 in my opinion the most 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.970
 interesting that it requires 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.150
 Greco-Roman Egyptian night all 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:02.560
 It's cooler then shut up, this book is 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:05.770
 Fuck this series of books, it 's really fucking 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:09.190
 Here's the tip for you who have read the 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.800
 the first two have read the two 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:14.920
 first reads the shadows suddenly how much 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:18.400
 before if you do not know the three 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.680
 books of the series low and that the pyramid 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.570
 red is the best of the three books is the 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.610
 What I liked the most is what 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.460
 show shows us how much you want 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.350
 the Egyptian Throne of Fire was the 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.140
 sonnyboy was very good he gives 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:35.650
 continuity to the red beach showing 

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.570
 the story of ray and these things and this 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.780
 is a snake closes with a golden key 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:43.540
 this technology that I like too much 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.910
 are three very beautiful books that are worth 

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:48.150
 very worth reading 

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:52.330
 This is it. I hope you liked it. 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:54.280
 in these three videos of who's 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.140
 I'll try to see the price of Edson the 

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.590
 sooner because I actually stayed 

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:02.320
 very fascinated with the writing of the uncle 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.930
 with this legal way of dealing with 

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.700
 praises that he treats is one more thing 

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.740
 feel for example that's how we see 

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.830
 in college but I hope you have 

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:14.100
 liked the videos and even close to 

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.100
 guys
