and<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.140> other<00:00:22.289> end<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.769> put<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> cotter<00:00:23.939> pin

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
and the other end to put a cotter pin

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.230 
and the other end to put a cotter pin
that<00:00:26.449> sits<00:00:27.449> right<00:00:27.630> down<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> groove<00:00:29.240> and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.580 
that sits right down to the groove and
this<00:00:30.539> board<00:00:30.869> goes<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.470> top<00:00:32.630> if<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.899> screws<00:00:34.200> down

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
this board goes on top if it screws down

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.190 
this board goes on top if it screws down
and<00:00:34.829> holds<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> axle<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:35.670> place

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
and holds the axle in place

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.389 
and holds the axle in place
I'm<00:00:37.200> only<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> put<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.920> couple<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.280> screws

flat washer and then I have a cotter pin

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.180 
flat washer and then I have a cotter pin
here<00:02:05.960> squeeze<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.170> together<00:02:07.380> too<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.009> get

it in and there and the other side goes

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.840 
it in and there and the other side goes
in<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.860> same<00:02:17.100> way<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.080> can<00:02:19.769> see<00:02:20.550> how<00:02:20.790> the

in the same way and you can see how the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.080 
in the same way and you can see how the
axle<00:02:21.450> assembly<00:02:21.930> fits<00:02:22.170> together<00:02:22.790> next<00:02:23.790> we'll

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
axle assembly fits together next we'll

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.630 
axle assembly fits together next we'll
build<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.980> I'm<00:02:25.980> going<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.220> take<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> wheel

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
build the I'm going to take the wheel

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.130 
build the I'm going to take the wheel
off<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.150> next<00:02:27.450> thing<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.660> want<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.900> do<00:02:28.019> is
