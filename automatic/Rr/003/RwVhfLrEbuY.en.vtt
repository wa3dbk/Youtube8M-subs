of<00:01:49.649> course<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:50.009> base<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:51.479> seemed<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.810> be

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
of course a base that it seemed to be

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.630 
of course a base that it seemed to be
what<00:01:52.740> they're<00:01:52.920> all<00:01:53.070> going<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.280> come<00:01:53.430> with

what they're all going to come with

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.120 
what they're all going to come with
eventually<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:55.290> always<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.619> nice<00:01:55.829> touch

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
eventually so that's always a nice touch

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.340 
eventually so that's always a nice touch
right<00:01:56.159> there<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.939> she<00:01:57.899> also<00:01:58.049> comes
