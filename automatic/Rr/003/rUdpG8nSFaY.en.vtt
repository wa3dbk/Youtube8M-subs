00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 something like that is welcome 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.000
 Battlefield small and today I show 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.250
 you the best weapons the top weapons 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.990
 from the enforcer class 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.969
 That's the type of shotguns and 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.940
 can take fast fire guns and 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.440
 also the type I yesterday last 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.940
 video about the worst weapons in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.750
 hardliner made a bit down 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.980
 have or 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.680
 made weapons a bit down 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.199
 I just have to say again 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.599
 the weapons are by no means bad 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.580
 they have relatively high recoil for 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.890
 both are missing they have little bullets in them 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.559
 magazine and do a lot of harm thats 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.090
 weapons with which many people simply 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.820
 can not handle and accordingly 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.920
 for the mass of players simply 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.440
 are unsuitable because they are with these the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.930
 Most talk about it yes and have 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.850
 not so the perfect endpoint and the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.010
 we call control of doom from counter 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.989
 strike or something they usually do not have 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.329
 and that's why these weapons are for many 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.160
 not suitable if you play the clear 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.690
 then it can also be bitter otherwise 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.370
 I would not have always pointed out that way 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.440
 clips in the background with the weapons if 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.489
 they totally shit they are clear 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.680
 do not shit anymore 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.090
 they are even relatively good but only 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.510
 when one has really in it with the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.830
 weapons 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.420
 I watch you in game just like that one 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.610
 little bit about what people play and so 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.369
 you will be only 16m 416 all the time 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.810
 k10 p90 win the whole sniper 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.640
 Of course , sometimes people read from time to time 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.070
 Try something from the weapons 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.960
 but how often do you see it so regularly? 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.280
 fast-firing rifles very rarely completely 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.130
 simply because the mass just stops that 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.829
 simple stuff plays because he just 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.810
 because simply is easy 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.970
 anyway, if you can do it and if 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.280
 If you like such weapons then they are real 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.049
 mega strong then we come to the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.369
 two weapons I introduce you 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.020
 I only want two, I know 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.390
 usually it's more 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.100
 but here is easy on one 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.290
 the criminal side and one on the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.869
 Heads are both the strongest 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.130
 weapons and why should you choose the others 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.290
 two are playing, they are really both 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.280
 just a lot worse than that 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.780
 respective others 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.170
 That's why I'm going to put you the two 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.119
 strongest before it starts with the as a 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.729
 58 usd 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.130
 which one can take along as cop has one 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.200
 maximum match of 43 minimum with 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.580
 24 to 50 meters or from 50 meters 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.290
 fire rate of 650 that it 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.200
 It is very small but is full here 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.840
 clear to a magazine size of 21 and 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.880
 right there is the problem then many 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.800
 especially for the reason that one 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.130
 have a slightly stronger recall than others 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.950
 weapons as well as call plus little magazine 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.240
 size normal players or the people the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.280
 like to jump around and so on and 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.320
 will not be as precise, the mega 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.670
 with such weapons not very good 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.100
 they will get along very fast 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.250
 put away again because when she shoots 21 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.080
 need for an opponent or 15 shot 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.610
 yes, there is still another enemy what 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.430
 actually it can happen 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.260
 all the time so you have to deal with it 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.020
 really easy to be extremely precise 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.120
 for the reason only 21 shot so five 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.680
 shot for the opponent are six shot 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.930
 good average so you can then 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.709
 get three to four people and see that 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.690
 I think so, too 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.540
 background gameplays that's great 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.180
 works despite the low fire rate 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.700
 from 650, the thing is in close combat 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.640
 strong one could say yes now a k10 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.410
 had firing rate of 1200 less 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.300
 Damage is therefore better in close combat 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.040
 but that again the point is coming 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.860
 just on the player 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.570
 what brings a k10 sprayer you there 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.040
 on the chest money if I'm with 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.570
 my as a or one 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.640
 quick fire rifle simple shot in the 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.800
 head set there I am because clearly 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.989
 better off even if there are weapons here and 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.880
 yes it would be better if it comes to everyone 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.530
 player on when I'm there the whole perfect 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.150
 time then I'm just with you 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.610
 a worse weapon so better 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.170
 melee are the things super strong 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.400
 middle distance is still 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.280
 wonderfully clear 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.519
 now you might think because of the recall 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.739
 and the little shot and the small one 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.970
 Feuerrad on distance not so mega hot 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.140
 but I'll just stay with you 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.720
 two games 1 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.489
 it also works on distance you have to 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.620
 Just have a little bit in there and 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.989
 so that's an allrounder 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.269
 Although not so all-around dervish swans 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.530
 in the 16 or in the 416 the mega everywhere 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.750
 are easy to play 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.730
 but it is allround the man is 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.640
 so that it is good everywhere in contrast 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.340
 to other weapons such as pds on the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.140
 distance Although there is already purely yes 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.120
 but they are just on distance not so 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.459
 mega nice but they are everywhere 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.440
 Well then we come to the second weapon 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.389
 I want to show you on the 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.099
 Police side on the head page 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.569
 you probably already have the skate 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.340
 all expected or all 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.340
 Rapid fire rifle fans have that 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.020
 expected because the thing is also a 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.719
 really horny part and if so 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.289
 I put the first place on them 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:42.400
 Although has a lower fire rate of 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.009
 625 only, but somehow it is 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.659
 feel and sound when shooting 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.949
 is a bit quieter I think so 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:51.999
 gameplay is somehow cooler 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:53.680
 damages equal to 43 24 from 50 meters 

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:55.509
 I can only do exactly that 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.939
 same say na just fine with distance 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.469
 good even at a mega distance this is when 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:01.240
 you have it in there and that's what I want you to do 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.680
 also with on the way 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.990
 I know I already said it but 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.060
 again if you can if you can 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.960
 precise same has clear with the weapons 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.909
 then come the damn strong point 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.509
 and now again to the video of 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:14.710
 yesterday 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.539
 that's just a little bit wrong 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.039
 came over because I have said I know 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.020
 not which weapon of that now 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.189
 worst is that has nothing to do with it 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.810
 I will not do that with the weapons 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:24.310
 You can work around there too 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.900
 background gameplay I saw that there 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.919
 even with the worst year with 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.080
 the khd brand new in the very latest clip 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.879
 I've got to come here so we said 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.439
 super clear but I think many 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:36.639
 not and that's why I have them now 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.009
 not necessarily recommended 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.270
 I'll do that again now 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.129
 this video i apologize 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.139
 again for the video yesterday that is there 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.399
 I have the sum taken down 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.800
 yes it should not be like that said 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:49.779
 come over and then I wish you 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.569
 have fun with the try of 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:54.460
 these weapons is I give you I give 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.979
 do not give you the tip on the way 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.659
 Immediately plays with it a while and 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.460
 then have fun with it 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:01.870
 if you liked the video 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.569
 I am very happy with the reviews 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.289
 See you tomorrow in the next 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:06.849
 Video 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:10.560
 I say goodbye to the next one 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.560
 until then and bye
