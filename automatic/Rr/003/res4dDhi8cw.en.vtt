kind of cool over here I don't know if

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.410 
kind of cool over here I don't know if
we<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:48.930> see<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.349> but<00:02:50.250> here<00:02:50.489> is<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.849> Kaltag

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
we can see this but here is the Kaltag

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.119 
we can see this but here is the Kaltag
and<00:02:51.660> I've<00:02:52.170> highlighted<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:52.799> little<00:02:52.950> bit

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
and I've highlighted it a little bit

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.770 
and I've highlighted it a little bit
just<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.579> see<00:02:53.790> original<00:02:54.299> paint<00:02:54.540> code

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
just so you can see original paint code

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.599 
just so you can see original paint code
900<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.680> means<00:02:55.859> there's<00:02:56.040> original<00:02:56.400> black

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
900 so it means there's original black

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.990 
900 so it means there's original black
car<00:02:56.879> it's<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.390> original<00:02:57.739> 327<00:02:58.739> 250<00:02:59.370> horse<00:02:59.609> v8

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
car it's the original 327 250 horse v8

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.970 
car it's the original 327 250 horse v8
it<00:03:00.299> is<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.420> matching<00:03:00.720> numbers<00:03:01.170> engine<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.709> have

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
it is a matching numbers engine I have

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.680 
it is a matching numbers engine I have
the<00:03:02.099> original<00:03:02.190> intake<00:03:02.849> manifold<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.420> go<00:03:03.510> with

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
the original intake manifold to go with

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.509 
the original intake manifold to go with
it<00:03:03.780> also<00:03:03.930> got<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.500> upgraded<00:03:04.920> four-barrel<00:03:05.400> on

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
it also got the upgraded four-barrel on

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.280 
it also got the upgraded four-barrel on
it<00:03:05.640> probably<00:03:05.790> picked<00:03:06.120> up<00:03:06.239> 35<00:03:06.720> horsepower<00:03:07.170> by

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
it probably picked up 35 horsepower by

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.979 
it probably picked up 35 horsepower by
going<00:03:07.560> their<00:03:07.739> stock<00:03:08.250> manifolds<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.510> many<00:03:09.690> cars

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
going their stock manifolds so many cars

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.080 
going their stock manifolds so many cars
are<00:03:10.319> converted<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.129> changed<00:03:11.549> this<00:03:11.640> car<00:03:11.879> is

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
are converted and changed this car is
