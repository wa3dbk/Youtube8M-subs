00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
amount of hair the looser the curl

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.259 
amount of hair the looser the curl
you'll<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.890> more<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> beach<00:00:41.700> wave<00:00:41.970> I

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.229 
why it's important to brush the hair
because<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.150> want<00:03:02.390> this<00:03:02.930> time<00:03:03.230> instead<00:03:03.560> of

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
because you want this time instead of

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.160 
because you want this time instead of
twisting<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.360> hair<00:03:05.540> you<00:03:05.720> want<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.989> wrap<00:03:06.140> it

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
twisting the hair you want to wrap it

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.309 
twisting the hair you want to wrap it
around<00:03:06.380> flat<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.660> if<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.750> watch<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:09.110> video
