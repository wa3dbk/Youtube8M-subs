00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.230
 we are going to interview the creator of mac higuaÃ­n dous but not before giving a 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.210
 applause to the creator of linux that is camouflaged by the public 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.090
 where the fuck has gotten 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.150
 I see it is there and 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
 p 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.320
 they tell me by the little penguin that their father exists and that he is here 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.070

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.740
 p 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.590
 fuck they have me up to my nose 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.689
 now they confirm me that my neighbor of the fifth has also come I have nothing 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.689
 against him so tito bild have if you can find us with your glasses 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.740
 anti reflective 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.450
 I know you're half cross-eyed but please look for melo 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.060
 p 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.140
 good 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.250
 I would like you to answer me asked a few questions about the two 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.570
 operating systems because I want to buy a computer and I do not know by which 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.570
 operating system decantme answer me you 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.200
 that those more expensive to tell the truth than the other 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.340
 I would personally recommend that I will buy you to add 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.990
 not only for its comfort of use but because it does not have drinking at all it does not have 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.060
 virus is all firsthand without having hit it from anyone and I do not look at 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.769
 nobody lol up the valley that I've done 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.030
 and on the other hand I also recommend it to you because as your creator you 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.399
 I'm assuring you that you will enjoy much more 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:17.889
 forgive me interrupting 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.309
 this son of a bitch left mentally because even though I copied all that slop 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.019
 of mucus and all 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.199
 of machine everyone doing kuin dous I personally took care of it 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:32.680
 it seemed as little as possible that was the reason for the screenshots I made for 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.610
 that it was not so heavy mackintosh and that in each zoo screen you could give a 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:37.459
 respite 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.389
 worth enough and enough of my fight so my friend and I are going to linux since it is 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.379
 an operating system that still has a lot to grow and that goes by its own 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.609
 side with no need to copy of intoxicated mac possibly exterminate 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:51.750
 these two operating systems
