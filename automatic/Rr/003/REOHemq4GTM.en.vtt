00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.910
 Hello dear lovers of power 3 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.889
 within this video and wanted 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.960
 consider one of your workouts 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.690
 bench press is development oriented 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.880
 speed speed qualities best 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.100
 develop without prior fatigue 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.960
 that's why training should 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.420
 start with the most dynamic 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.119
 movements in this complex are 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.609
 movement are centers of pushups and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.800
 I bring video not all campaigns given 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.890
 Exercises not to delay the roller 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.450
 however, existing approaches should clearly 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.250
 demonstrates the specifics of this 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.570
 exercises 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.040
 the main goal here is explosive development 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.190
 hand and chest strength 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.390
 as well as improved coordination 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.820
 it is necessary to focus not only on 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.850
 fixing the rub on the balcony and on or 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.590
 subsequent dynamic board is not 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.039
 this repetition is clearly visible technical 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.980
 mistake 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.930
 and variable lowering is necessary 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.390
 try to simultaneously question what 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.910
 gender due to what 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.060
 sharp drops are additionally 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.950
 bundles explosive pushups not only 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.930
 train an athlete to press 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.060
 holder by us that but also 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.640
 accordingly prepares 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.830
 his cosmos is a different apparatus in contrast 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 from mage repeated solitary attention 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.040
 recognized to perfect only 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.100
 athlete speed 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.590
 besides that opinion a powerful look lift 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.659
 but it should be better to concentrate 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.780
 note that unnecessary emphasis on single 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.780
 they bring significant results and 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.970
 athletes must be turned off 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.490
 of education 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.680
 after pushing up the ligaments and muscles strongly 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.900
 vacuum so the best solution 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.810
 there will be quite a few different presses a little 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.240
 ibiza married bathroom workout 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.800
 performed the same with chains to more thoroughly 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.070
 work out my speed speaking 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.030
 and learn the power bench press should 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.430
 try to fulfill 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.870
 can things start and keep everything 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.280
 technical requirements 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.500
 including the required stop at 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.310
 this without disrupting shoulder fixation 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.310
 are induced 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.709
 using staff even need a hike 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.700
 force of movement defrag shoulders as much as possible 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.350
 eden azar and back tight question 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.100
 the main effort needs to be understood only 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.040
 at the expense of he 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.950
 performing a powerful explosion acceleration a nadya 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.520
 end position fixation 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.370
 use of oncoming traffic 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.120
 allows you to further increase power and 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.670
 vanity 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.530
 its essence is that on lowering 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.790
 necessary as much as possible from the dungeon 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.490
 towards the bar 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.690
 filed forward and forward as much as possible 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.040
 pulling the brain keeping the buttocks pressed 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.540
 leg strain allows tough 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.970
 fix the rods 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.650
 that is, just tearing off the start of acceleration 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.800
 there is no need to support 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.080
 tight connection with the support in this situation 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.769
 chest fed forward is only 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.320
 hindrance 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.550
 so in my opinion a sharp decrease 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.610
 to get 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.950
 allows boom extra topics 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.620
 most increase the power of his movement 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.660
 after the press with chains it is advisable 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.190
 perform bench press of medium intensity 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.040
 in order to give extra 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.320
 push to growth also from power qualities 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.630
 as in previous exercises it was 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.640
 severe fatigue received then not followed 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.940
 especially on rice in this exercise 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.640
 and how to emphasize the previous 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.799
 hate burden she speed 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.660
 phones and movements often have to 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.940
 see as athletes on the last 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.790
 repetitions accompany pants feet 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.220
 even more tense and the curve of the buttocks 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.460
 and with a stone it not only does not help 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.220
 complete the movement 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.140
 but also creates additional difficulties 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.300
 so instead of postponing the strain 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.410
 there were other athlete extra 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.660
 reaching for the projectile 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:50.450
 thus taking away already passed 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.580
 centimeter as the final 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.880
 residential complex exercises can 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.830
 perform strong low activity 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.900
 Of course, too, follow to make the maximum 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.790
 price speed and excellence technology 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.530
 which should enable 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.180
 athletes as efficiently as possible 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.870
 realize speed on power 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.360
 potential 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.490
 if training is intended to develop 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.140
 speed of movement should forget about 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.180
 large forests to the maximum 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.250
 focus on quality 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.110
 characteristics of his movements as 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.940
 final exercises of the complex can 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.880
 additionally load the muscles that 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.560
 take part in the bench press in this 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.350
 case exercises are used for 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.390
 increase the tone of the triceps as given 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.460
 period is designed to improve speed 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.700
 on strength qualities then in one approach 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.110
 no more than 6 repetitions 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.390
 more repetitions on my 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.940
 a look created further enslavement 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.700
 that will serve as a hindrance in the development of power and 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.680
 speed so as goal skill pump up 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.350
 muscles i never used my own 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.180
 bank training 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.580
 is the most functional 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.920
 muscle mass which is already impossible 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.630
 carry a lot of stackable with 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.640
 folders 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.449
 Thank you for your attention and I wish you success in the 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.479
 platform 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.479
 but 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.830
 but
