 later sit on the server now I just 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.180
 the movie that the server released 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.560
 is online and we thought why open do it 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.510
 not with the bang 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.750

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.310
 with making the ven de castle one 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.950

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.750
 have tried it and now that we also have the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.010
 I think the help of 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.150
 more acidic think it's even better 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.310
 is becoming 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.070
 and we are going to play this we start to 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.520
 eight hours you can also earn an income later 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.440
 of course if you want it is not on 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.780
 registration it's just online 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.550
 if you feel like it you can participate is whole 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.250
 simply you protect the castle from all 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.440
 mops in minecraft a few admin's 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.730

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.060
 send off 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.710
 and you can have to survive a few orphans 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.600
 and then you get a whole lot of shirt and then 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.070
 I must quietly rebuild again 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.650
 And so it goes on until we don't feel like it 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.720
 have more and yes it's just one 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.240

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.430
