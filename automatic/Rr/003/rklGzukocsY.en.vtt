 technology news published in the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:17.699
 adrenaline but first I will disappear

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.550
 the black berry this week 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.740
 the c30 is a smartphone with a five screen 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.380
 inches of the amoled type comes with a 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.849
 battery of 2,800 thousand inverse and autonomy 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.679
 up to 25 hours 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.620
 the new device brings the latest version of the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.780
 10.2 system that brings news as 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.309
 beach of branches the evolution of the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.930
 system notifications 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.940
 over time he can make the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.980
 separation of posts and more emails 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.260
 received this new version 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.329
 system will also reach the 10 and 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.550
 that 10 in mid-October 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.070
 another novelty of the smartphone area 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.870
 Arrival of the fire at 625 to Brazil 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.570
 the handset is the largest in the family rents 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.699
 with 4.7 inches of screen and the first to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.500
 with the update is installed 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.690
 another highlight of this device is its 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.369
 support for Brazilian 4g with price 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.900
 suggested at the age of one thousand forty 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.000
 nine reais and one of the smartest 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.380
 Cheap having support our connection 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.840
 fast moving 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.700
 This is if you believe that connection brazil 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.009
 and the same phrase can coexist quickly 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.479
 for who was interested in this model 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.979
 keep an eye on the adrenaline because we already 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.360
 we received a model for analysis in 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.869
 soon we will do the full review to 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.180
 you 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.340
 the big highlight of apple at launch 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.320
 of new iphones does not seem to have 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.450
 excited consumers according to the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.640
 guardian pre buy iphone 5 c 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.890
 was well below expectations 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.200
 an unidentified source owning a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.450
 phone shop in england has 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.009
 that purchases are between 60 and 70 per 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.270
 percent below expected 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.860
 this is a very bad result 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.659
 considering that the initial expectation 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.220
 Nor was he very optimistic. 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.100
 unfortunately we also have a model 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.680
 iphone 5 c for not student 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.240
 and for those who like the iphone 5 c but not 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.140
 liked to know that he will not be a 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.850
 cheap handset 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.150
 we have a much better alternative in 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.619
 account and look like the phone and 5 c 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.659
 the Chinese device has an appearance 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.030
 very similar to Apple's device 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.550
 including in the system that despite 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.340
 to look very much like the s7 is actually a 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.160
 modifying android 4.2 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.390
 despite being at a disadvantage 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.050
 googlephone specs wins 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.690
 Quite in price it costs $ 259 as well 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.360
 below $ 649 on the device that 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.880
 mimics both google and me 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.010
 received news in the next days 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.140
 microsoft prepares a new logo and 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.060
 interface for your search service that 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.100
 will now display results as you 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.050
 the user fulfills what the system is looking for 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.340
 Microsoft will also include more data 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.989
 on the sidebar 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.090
 as well as a feature called pole 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.799
 position that brings outstanding information 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.959
 by the Sunday algorithm 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.360
 already google that already implemented these 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.040
 long ago is concerned about the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.700
 improve the design of their 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.560
 search 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.540
 she will shoot the black bar at the top of the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.160
 page replace with a grid of 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.820
 applications just as it happens in the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.310
 android 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.530
 soon will also receive changes but far 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.030
 to be a repaginada the company only 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.130
 leave the image flat 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.190
 proving once again that soon plated 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.320
 It's the new black, no surprise to 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.239
 nobody but almost 90 percent of the 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.100
 searches in brazil use the 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.140
 google service as a premium 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.329
 consolation for microsoft bing is the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.920
 which has the highest success rate that is 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.940
 when a search results in a click 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.340
 some website 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.859
 bing has almost 85 percent success 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.079
 against 75% of google 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.940
 intel made a curious demonstration 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.650
 during idf 2013 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.840
 the company displays a processor and a 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.190
 accelerometer working nothing more than 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.570
 a glass of wine 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.340
 the energy that kept the two 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.260
 active components by means 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.489
 reaction of two electrodes with 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.769
 acetic acid 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.910
 this chip is just a prototype but already 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.069
 shows the potential that these 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.140
 low consumption processors has 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.730
 devices such as smartphones that can 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.920
 keep your sensors always active 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.170
 without spending virtually no energy 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.569
 as the staff joked in the comments 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.110
 we only need to know if we replace the wine 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.240
 for something like overclock cola cachaÃ§a 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.310
 so do not over 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.930
 comment or share this video, and 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.180
 part of our business plan. 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.690
 global domination and see you in the next 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.440
 week 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.440
 a hug
