guys<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.170> guess<00:00:19.590> when<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.890> had<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.340> VC<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.150> a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
guys to guess when I had a VC on and a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.450 
guys to guess when I had a VC on and a
VC<00:00:21.960> off<00:00:22.109> today<00:00:22.769> I'm<00:00:22.890> actually<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.340> let

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
VC off today I'm actually going to let

VC off today I'm actually going to let
you<00:00:23.640> know<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.359> guys<00:00:24.539> can<00:00:24.750> actually<00:00:24.810> pick

you know so you guys can actually pick

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.710 
you know so you guys can actually pick
out<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.470> differences<00:00:25.920> if<00:00:26.250> possible<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.970> didn't

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
out the differences if possible I didn't

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.450 
out the differences if possible I didn't
realize<00:00:28.140> how<00:00:28.439> difficult<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.980> was<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.160> actually

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460

pick<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.349> so<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.800> decided<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:32.520> another

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
pick up on it so I decided to do another

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.830 
pick up on it so I decided to do another
running<00:00:33.030> video<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> little<00:00:33.600> bit<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.780> an

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
running video and do a little bit of an

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.870 
running video and do a little bit of an
intro<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.290> let<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> guys<00:00:34.590> know<00:00:34.649> when<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> VC<00:00:35.820> is

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
intro and let you guys know when a VC is

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.060 
intro and let you guys know when a VC is
on<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> when<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> VC<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:36.960> off<00:00:37.489> now<00:00:39.260> what<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.469> VC<00:00:40.860> is

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
on and when a VC is off now what a VC is

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.170 
on and when a VC is off now what a VC is
if<00:00:41.280> you're<00:00:41.399> watching<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> first

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
if you're watching this for the first

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.790 
if you're watching this for the first
time<00:00:42.270> you've<00:00:42.540> got<00:00:42.629> no<00:00:42.809> idea<00:00:43.140> what's<00:00:43.350> going<00:00:43.649> on

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
time you've got no idea what's going on

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.430 
time you've got no idea what's going on
a<00:00:43.980> VC<00:00:44.730> stands<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.270> active<00:00:45.510> vehicle<00:00:46.050> control

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
a VC stands for active vehicle control

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.340 
a VC stands for active vehicle control
it's<00:00:47.430> kind<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> little<00:00:48.030> jar<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.570> built<00:00:49.140> into

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
it's kind of a little jar be built into

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.709 
it's kind of a little jar be built into
the<00:00:49.530> receiver<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.730> spectrum<00:00:51.390> right<00:00:51.420> that

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the receiver of the spectrum right that

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.290 
the receiver of the spectrum right that
you<00:00:51.780> see<00:00:52.020> here<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.949> helps<00:00:53.399> help<00:00:53.760> steer<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
you see here and it helps help steer the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.760 
you see here and it helps help steer the
truck<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.719> direction<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.260> want<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.620> go

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
truck in the direction you want it to go

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.220 
truck in the direction you want it to go
so<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.550> driver<00:00:56.789> has<00:00:57.059> less<00:00:57.300> input<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
so the driver has less input into the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.650 
so the driver has less input into the
steering<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.070> little<00:00:59.579> steering<00:01:00.149> dual<00:01:00.480> rate

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
steering the little steering dual rate

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.020 
steering the little steering dual rate
knob<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.170> see<00:01:01.410> here<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> remote<00:01:02.030> by

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
knob that you see here on the remote by

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.579 
knob that you see here on the remote by
adjusting<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.170> actually<00:01:04.290> adjust

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
adjusting that you can actually adjust

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.359 
adjusting that you can actually adjust
the<00:01:04.920> sensitivity<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.119> AVC<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:08.280> know

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the sensitivity of the AVC and you know

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.770 
the sensitivity of the AVC and you know
by<00:01:08.549> turning<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:08.970> up<00:01:09.090> you'll<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
by turning it up you'll have it up to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.960 
by turning it up you'll have it up to
full<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.830> reduce<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.520> all<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> way

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
full and you can reduce it all the way

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.280 
full and you can reduce it all the way
down<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.450> want<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.049> will

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
down if you want to and that will

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.810 
down if you want to and that will
completely<00:01:13.650> cut<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> off<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.490> actually<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
completely cut it off so it's actually a

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.560 
completely cut it off so it's actually a
great<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.330> idea<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.659> beginners<00:01:17.150> now<00:01:18.150> I

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
great little idea for beginners now I

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.749 
great little idea for beginners now I
will<00:01:19.049> cover<00:01:19.229> off<00:01:19.439> very<00:01:19.650> quickly<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.070> plastic

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
will cover off very quickly the plastic

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.870 
will cover off very quickly the plastic
drive<00:01:21.000> shaft<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.600> fixed<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.189> previous

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
drive shaft that I fixed in a previous

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.710 
drive shaft that I fixed in a previous
RC<00:01:24.450> pitstop<00:01:25.020> video<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.159> did<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:27.210> did<00:01:27.570> get

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
RC pitstop video that I did I did get

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.289 
RC pitstop video that I did I did get
the<00:01:27.930> plastic<00:01:28.710> drive<00:01:28.890> shaft<00:01:29.159> all<00:01:29.579> fixed<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the plastic drive shaft all fixed up and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.060 
the plastic drive shaft all fixed up and
the<00:01:30.390> truck<00:01:30.570> was<00:01:30.720> working<00:01:31.110> fine<00:01:31.350> until<00:01:31.560> I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the truck was working fine until I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.679 
the truck was working fine until I
whacked<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> three<00:01:32.700> years<00:01:32.850> back<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
whacked the three years back in here and

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.260 
whacked the three years back in here and
just<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> torque<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.950> power<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.640> has<00:01:35.850> it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
just the torque and power that it has it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.940 
just the torque and power that it has it
just<00:01:36.390> ripped<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> drive<00:01:37.170> shaft<00:01:37.439> apart<00:01:37.799> again

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
just ripped the drive shaft apart again

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.530 
just ripped the drive shaft apart again
and<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.670> broke

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
and it broke

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.050 
and it broke
within<00:01:39.990> minutes<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.950> no<00:01:41.400> big<00:01:41.610> jumps<00:01:41.939> no

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
within minutes so no big jumps no

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.340 
within minutes so no big jumps no
accidents<00:01:42.600> or<00:01:42.659> anything<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.170> was

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
just running and testing the truck but

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.510 
just running and testing the truck but
yeah<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.049> couldn't<00:01:46.350> hang<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> ended

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
