yeah<00:01:23.159> Formula<00:01:23.610> One<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.090> big<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.479> Roland

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
yeah Formula One is as big as Roland

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.510 
yeah Formula One is as big as Roland
there<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> race<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:25.979> no<00:01:26.159> famila

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
one riders or anything like that so even

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.210 
one riders or anything like that so even
car<00:01:29.189> racing<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.729> not<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.590> less<00:01:31.590> known<00:01:31.920> as

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
car racing is not this is less known as

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.700 
car racing is not this is less known as
as<00:01:33.060> motocross<00:01:33.630> actually<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.229> that's<00:01:34.470> that's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
as motocross actually so that's that's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.230 
as motocross actually so that's that's
really<00:01:34.920> good<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.340> us<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.210> of

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
really good for us and I think one of

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.960 
really good for us and I think one of
the<00:01:36.420> reasons<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.380> are<00:01:37.860> really<00:01:38.369> really

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the reasons is that we are really really

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.390 
the reasons is that we are really really
central<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.450> Europe<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.590> lot<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.070> teams

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
central in Europe and a lot of the teams

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.460 
central in Europe and a lot of the teams
that<00:01:41.759> compete<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> World<00:01:42.899> Championship

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
that compete in the World Championship

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.800 
that compete in the World Championship
are<00:01:43.680> based<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.490> Belgium<00:01:44.759> what's<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> typical

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
are based in Belgium what's the typical

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.840 
are based in Belgium what's the typical
track<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.320> Belgium<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> st.<00:01:47.250> hard-packed

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
track in Belgium is a st. hard-packed

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.969 
track in Belgium is a st. hard-packed
yeah<00:01:48.299> well<00:01:48.720> I'm<00:01:49.079> happy<00:01:49.380> with<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.590> question

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
yeah well I'm happy with the question

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.230 
yeah well I'm happy with the question
because<00:01:50.280> that's<00:01:50.430> also<00:01:50.820> another<00:01:51.030> advantage

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
because that's also another advantage

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.270 
because that's also another advantage
what<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.229> Belgium<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.860> are<00:01:52.979> actually

in<00:02:30.760> motocross<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.239> was<00:02:31.360> used<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.720> focus<00:02:32.170> for<00:02:32.440> for

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
in motocross I was used to focus for for

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.280 
in motocross I was used to focus for for
under<00:02:33.220> them<00:02:33.489> ten<00:02:33.670> percent<00:02:34.060> for<00:02:34.870> two<00:02:35.050> times

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.530 
forty five minutes while in the Euro
it's<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.980> can't<00:02:39.280> just<00:02:39.519> lose<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.880> focus<00:02:40.090> all

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
it's you can't just lose the focus all

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.360 
it's you can't just lose the focus all
the<00:02:40.720> way<00:02:40.810> even<00:02:41.140> on<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.320> transport<00:02:41.830> stages<00:02:42.250> you

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
the way even on the transport stages you

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.310 
the way even on the transport stages you
can't<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:43.180> can't<00:02:43.390> lose<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.720> focus<00:02:43.900> because

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
can't you can't lose the focus because

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.830 
can't you can't lose the focus because
often<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.980> trails<00:02:45.250> are<00:02:45.519> I'm<00:02:45.790> not<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:46.540> easy

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
often the trails are I'm not that easy

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.270 
often the trails are I'm not that easy
it's<00:02:47.110> not<00:02:47.260> like<00:02:47.410> they're<00:02:47.560> going<00:02:47.709> flat<00:02:48.040> out<00:02:48.250> all

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
it's not like they're going flat out all

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.650 
it's not like they're going flat out all
the<00:02:48.519> time<00:02:48.670> but<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.910> fact<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:49.450> are<00:02:49.510> not

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
the time but the fact that you are not

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.900 
the time but the fact that you are not
going<00:02:49.930> flat<00:02:50.290> out<00:02:50.320> all<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.800> time<00:02:51.010> makes<00:02:51.760> it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
going flat out all the time makes it

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.479 
going flat out all the time makes it
easy<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.360> lose<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.720> focus<00:02:52.930> I'm<00:02:53.320> having<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.310> lot

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
easy to lose the focus I'm having a lot

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.680 
easy to lose the focus I'm having a lot
of<00:02:54.519> fun<00:02:54.790> out<00:02:55.060> there

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
of fun out there

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.400 
of fun out there
the<00:02:55.810> only<00:02:56.019> thing<00:02:56.440> what<00:02:56.590> I'm<00:02:56.739> missing<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.400> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
the only thing what I'm missing is the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.759 
the only thing what I'm missing is the
the<00:02:59.410> bar<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.830> bar<00:03:00.040> girls<00:03:01.000> pass<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.560> and

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
the bar to bar girls pass and and and

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.070 
the bar to bar girls pass and and and
the<00:03:02.860> start<00:03:03.190> with<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.400> gate<00:03:03.730> but<00:03:04.300> really<00:03:04.660> yeah

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
the start with the gate but really yeah

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.440 
the start with the gate but really yeah
that<00:03:05.860> adrenalin<00:03:06.489> from<00:03:06.760> from<00:03:06.970> taking<00:03:07.360> the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
that adrenalin from from taking the

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.630 
that adrenalin from from taking the
start<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:08.140> different<00:03:08.650> from<00:03:08.800> if<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.310> take<00:03:09.519> the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
start is different from if you take the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.420 
start is different from if you take the
start<00:03:09.910> in<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.090> special<00:03:10.480> test<00:03:10.690> it's<00:03:11.410> just<00:03:11.709> you<00:03:12.220> by

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
start in a special test it's just you by

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.670 
start in a special test it's just you by
yourself<00:03:12.600> that's<00:03:13.600> definite<00:03:14.049> so<00:03:14.230> then<00:03:14.380> I<00:03:14.410> miss

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
yourself that's definite so then I miss

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.289 
yourself that's definite so then I miss
