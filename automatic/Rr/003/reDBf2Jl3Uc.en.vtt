00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 me 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.450
 dj 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:26.940
 It is a vibration of the rare lease series to be released from Ms. Oo. 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:32.660
 I think you can use a small silhouette of the pond well enough 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.660
 I would like to swim to try this for a while now 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:42.520
 The characteristic of this vibration is that 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:47.250
 The swing is so small 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.250
 It 's a movement that feels like that, right? 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.559
 Not so boldly good appeal 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.230
 Why this 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.329
 Go and of his 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.329
 You can use it enough at last 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.510
 What is the vibration of a high appeal so much? 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.210
 I'd not it so much, such is something field pond 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.770
 Hike 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.770
 Tiny It is this action 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.329
 I think this may be very good 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.620
 And what are you saying ? 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.610
 A fan 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.610
 High speed and the other party 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.160
 It's beautifully done without breaking the posture at all 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.130
 And this can be heard from the microphone 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.590
 This of vibration 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.590
 It is a thing, but this is also quite 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.850
 The owner takes in 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.310
 Well this metallic sound is this sound 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.180
 Ummm 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.180
 Of the slope 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.440
 Let's reflect on this cleat 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.440
 I think I can hear you 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.690
 Even if this fast retrieval of numbers is not lost in balance at all 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:33.470
 4 is an edge where my length is super head vibrate 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.590
 Nde does not mean that is received by Hey surface'm sharp 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:41.820
 What 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:46.180
 I have this vibration becomes really that little by little movement 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:52.230
 It is not a flat body, so there is no flat surface. 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.230
 As it is hard to receive resistance of water, it is small movement 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.160
 Why I feel very comfortable winding 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.160
 That's stress free, isn't it 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.680
 It's so light and comfortable 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.680
 I think you can enjoy it 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:19.530
 And one more feature is that yesterday I tested it and that was what I thought but that 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.990
 I felt that when I got this guy in the lotus field 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.110
 When there is the first stem 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.620
 that 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:30.459
 It's so sharp that my hair is too 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:35.730
 This it is receiving this sometimes hit the stalk 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:38.970
 I noticed that ability to the avoidance of that lure Tteyuu very high 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.630
 When you hit a monster at that time, it's like a lure 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:48.720
 I'd hit the Gila when the row inversion caught 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:52.160
 If you use it as an advantage of Rina, that performance of this vibration will be 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.160
 I think that I can fully demonstrate
