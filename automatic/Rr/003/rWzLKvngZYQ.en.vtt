00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello and welcome to gamer express 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.860
 the major news of the day comes from 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.530
 famous bobby kotick the CEO of activision 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.540
 who dropped a monstrous figure during 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.950
 a conference in los angeles the giant of 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.180
 video game would have invested no less than 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.190
 500 million dollars 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.020
 so of asthenia this new mmo shooter 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.130
 it's simply the most 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.360
 dear of history 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.740
 the new falls while the first 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.060
 episode of the developer's diary 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.860
 bungie studio focuses on 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.180
 equipment loot and weapons in 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.380
 this new franchise of activision 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.550
 the figure is even more 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.810
 impressive when put in 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.850
 perspective with the cost of 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.500
 development gta 5 who were two 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.739
 times less than 250 million 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.660
 dollars 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.829
 it was felt that destiny will have to 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.360
 sell around 15 million 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.920
 of copies to hope to reach 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.420
 the financial equilibrium while the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.220
 optimistic forecasts rather rely on 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.630
 8 million games sold for 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.920
 back a little on the content of the title 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.510
 the video the developers we 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.070
 explain that we will find three 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.020
 major categories of weapons intended 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.640
 tears main special weapons 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.530
 like the sniper rifles or the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.000
 sawed cannon and finally the heavy weapons 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.949
 like rocket launchers or others 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.119
 delicate cherry assault machine gun 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.649
 on the cake it must be added that 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.179
 each of the three classes will be able 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.509
 to use any of these 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.009
 arms 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.450
 and to come back to the financial stakes 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.189
 we were saying recently that bungie 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.779
 activision-blizzard very big and cdh on 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.639
 can say hopefully that by here the 

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:19.469
 release of the title on September 9th 

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:21.029
 the excitement shows a little more the 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.529
 players who is rather skeptical 

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:24.299
 for moment finally me I'm excited 

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:26.310
 like a flea and you tell us a little 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.350
 if destiny and the game you expect 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.819
 looking forward to this year the studio 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.229
 french spyder it's far from being in 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.880
 giant but he already has to his credit 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.679
 games like of orcs and men or 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.599
 marc soir logs it's with the publisher 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.819
 interactive focus that the studio comes out 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:40.259
 this week band bike flames rpg 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.849
 of action located in a universe rather 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.499
 original and we really want to see 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:44.999
 a very good potential title in this game 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:46.319
 role that puts as much emphasis on 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:48.090
 dialogues the moral choices and the 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.020
 relationships with your mates that the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.029
 dynamism of the fighting 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.649
 we could quickly summarize the concept 

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:54.479
 like a cross between dragon age i'm 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.429
 famous the character you play 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.659
 finds himself possessed by a fire demon 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.619
 in intentions are not 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.509
 inevitably evil 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.649
 but who will make you lose your humanity 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.509
 if you use his powers 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.950
 destructive to get to your ends 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.539
 it's up to you to choose 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.310
 how would you stand up to the army of 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.910
 morbihan who threatens the world according 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.740
 of your actions the behavior 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.690
 companion and pnj for a greatly 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.400
 vary about the combat system 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.020
 it's real time and show a 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.620
 some tactical sense to defeat your 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.900
 opponents 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.160
 the radius of originality we note the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.500
 possibility of counting a dead person 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.730
 place of 3000 years among your following he 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.470
 would be old enough to remember 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.030
 from the time when the tweaks was called raider 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.460
 or the time of the first 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.600
 micro kids shows the game comes out the 9th 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.160
 may on pc ps3 ps4 xbox 360 but not on 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.660
 xbox one since the team could not 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.370
 access the development kit on time 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.500
 console is a shame 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.970
 it starts as a gamer on purpose but that 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.440
 ends up by blog so it's 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.910
 gameblog and our friends announce having 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.560
 obtained information in preview 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.280
 is this one relates to the sale 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.210
 a pack ps4 and ps vita in France 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.250
 let's take a closer look at the detail 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.330
 of this info according to their sources this 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.560
 pack would be scheduled for the second 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.280
 fortnight of June it would be proposed 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.270
 at the price of 579 euros 90 strangely this 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.530
 prices represent only a small 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.390
 economy into account for example of 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.590
 separate purchase of both consoles but one 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.630
 do not know yet what it will contain 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.100
 exactly we could indeed imagine 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.600
 that games or a free subscription to 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.550
 more playstation would be included 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.770
 still according to gameblog the vital more 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.660
 in this bundle ps4 would be a ps vita 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.700
 2000 according to a pre-order already 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.260
 available on amazon this bundle will be 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.150
 available from June 27 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.590
 maybe it will be necessary to wait until the 3 for 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.910
 have more details about the content of 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.830
 the set whose price seems to us 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.820
 decidedly too high if he does not understand 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.980
 that the consoles 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.660
 it's clear that sony is still trying and 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.700
 always to support ps vita since 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.320
 his portable console never really 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.160
 taken off and this despite its undeniable 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.050
 qualities 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.250
 and what price would you think 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.989
 interesting to convince you 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.220
 to buy such a boss is waiting for your 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.930
 comments under the video as 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.040
 usually the question of the day we 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.510
 comes from kim blood who are asking us 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.800
 if it makes sense to buy the second 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.959
 version of the development kit of the 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.430
 virtual reality helmet oculus rift 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.530
 to their dear kim blood this is a 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.060
 very complex question that here if you 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.860
 read english in urgent advise you 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.540
 to read the very detailed article that 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.010
 kotaku had devoted to this new kit 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.510
 last March and which one 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.020
 will obviously put you in touch in the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.030
 description 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.470
 it is clear that this new oculus has made 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.300
 important progress and that it proposes 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.020
 already an experience that really seems 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.520
 compelling 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.930
 however as indicated in all 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.239
 letters on the pre - order page on 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.770
 the ocular site that needs to be clear 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.090
 that this product is not yet thought 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.480
 as being intended for consumers 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.650
 therefore it is a matter of paying 300 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.180
 a tale dollars for a helmet on 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.830
 development and in the delivery is 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.540
 possible next August 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.920
 also remember that we must not 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.690
 expect a commercial version the 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.120
 the oculus trift or the morpheus helmet of 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.410
 sony before 2015 and if this expectation does not 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.090
 you seem insurmountable 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.550
 you can crack but knowing that there 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.990
 certainly has a good chance that 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.310
 improvements between this version is 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.970
 the one that will ultimately be destined to 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.890
 General public 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.630
 come in catches to conclude that 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.800
 since his takeover by facebook to worship 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.010
 towards no lack of continuation in the 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.200
 ideas 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.850
 since his CEO has just recently mentioned 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.860
 the ambition to turn a mmo 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.610
 able to accommodate up to a billion 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.470
 people 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.330
 we just hope that the guy does not have 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.280
 been struck by the madness of grandeur or 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.720
 by lightning you know it if you 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.640
 follow 2 broadcasts the big contest x 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.110

 win again today for the front 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.800

 everything is explained in the fresh you're

 this morning introduced by look at the 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.790
 blizzard on which I will abstain from 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.060
 make comments we end up 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.410
 tomorrow 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.460
 and by then have a good day and 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.460
