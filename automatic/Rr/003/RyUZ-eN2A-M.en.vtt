part<00:02:38.450> comes<00:02:38.750> off<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:49.010> tape<00:02:49.310> gifts<00:03:05.260> more<00:03:06.260> tape

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
part comes off so tape gifts more tape

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.240 
part comes off so tape gifts more tape
every<00:03:08.239> time<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:08.569> think<00:03:08.720> you're<00:03:08.900> done<00:03:09.250> there's

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
everything out so here's the base itself

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.000 
everything out so here's the base itself

there and charge like that then this

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.020 
there and charge like that then this
part<00:04:20.049> is<00:04:20.290> the<00:04:20.470> actual<00:04:20.889> part<00:04:21.100> that<00:04:21.310> aligns<00:04:21.790> with

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.360 

ok<00:04:49.370> there's<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.150> pack<00:04:50.540> on<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:51.250> pretty<00:04:52.250> good

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
ok there's the pack on it pretty good

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.320 
ok there's the pack on it pretty good
it's<00:04:52.790> not<00:04:53.030> bulky<00:04:53.600> or<00:04:53.800> anything<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:55.010> then<00:04:55.880> to

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
it's not bulky or anything and then to

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.370 
it's not bulky or anything and then to
60<00:04:57.880> so<00:04:58.880> it's<00:04:58.910> just<00:04:59.240> like<00:04:59.390> that<00:04:59.690> i'm<00:04:59.840> guessing<00:05:00.230> i

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
60 so it's just like that i'm guessing i

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.770 
60 so it's just like that i'm guessing i
can<00:05:00.620> plug<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:00.920> in<00:05:01.040> actually<00:05:01.430> really<00:05:01.610> quick<00:05:01.820> i

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.630 

can<00:05:05.780> get<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.200> twisty<00:05:06.620> tie<00:05:06.890> off<00:05:07.160> I<00:05:08.320> have<00:05:09.320> an

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
can get the twisty tie off I have an

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:19.330 
can get the twisty tie off I have an
extension<00:05:10.640> cord<00:05:10.670> i<00:05:11.000> think<00:05:11.270> here<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:18.470> there<00:05:19.190> it

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
extension cord i think here and there it

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.910 
extension cord i think here and there it
is<00:05:19.430> see<00:05:19.730> the<00:05:19.850> lights<00:05:20.470> then<00:05:21.470> this<00:05:21.680> one<00:05:21.890> is

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
is see the lights then this one is

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.910 
is see the lights then this one is
charging<00:05:22.430> so<00:05:23.110> i<00:05:24.110> don't<00:05:24.410> know<00:05:24.500> how<00:05:24.620> long<00:05:24.770> it

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
charging so i don't know how long it

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.260 
charging so i don't know how long it
takes<00:05:25.100> to<00:05:25.160> charge<00:05:25.430> but<00:05:25.760> I'll<00:05:25.880> probably<00:05:26.030> charge

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
takes to charge but I'll probably charge

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.210 
takes to charge but I'll probably charge
them<00:05:26.990> both<00:05:27.170> all<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.440> way<00:05:27.650> up<00:05:27.800> because<00:05:28.070> that's

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
them both all the way up because that's

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
them both all the way up because that's
what<00:05:28.340> you<00:05:28.370> should<00:05:28.520> do<00:05:28.610> with<00:05:28.640> your<00:05:28.760> batteries

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240
