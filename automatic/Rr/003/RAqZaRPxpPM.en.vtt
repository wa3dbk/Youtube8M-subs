00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.190 
has a fixed side open you take one of
the<00:02:59.580> bottle<00:02:59.820> caps<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.920> all<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.580> way<00:03:02.700> up<00:03:03.200> to

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
the bottle caps and all the way up to

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.000 
the bottle caps and all the way up to
the<00:03:04.320> top<00:03:04.850> so<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:06.330> looks<00:03:06.570> like<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.320> then

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
the top so it looks like that and then

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:15.950 
the top so it looks like that and then
you<00:03:08.520> take<00:03:08.760> another<00:03:09.030> one

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.990 

so<00:03:16.960> it<00:03:17.140> looks<00:03:17.320> like<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.370> then<00:03:18.700> you

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
so it looks like that and then you

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:33.650 
so it looks like that and then you
doesn't<00:03:19.360> do<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.660> for<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.230> other<00:03:20.740> two

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.220 

-<00:03:36.740> all<00:03:37.740> right<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:37.980> then<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.550> have<00:03:38.760> part<00:03:39.450> two<00:03:39.960> a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
- all right and then you have part two a

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.650 
- all right and then you have part two a
chain<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:41.610> what<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.880> keep<00:03:42.030> doing<00:03:42.390> is<00:03:42.540> you

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
chain and so what you keep doing is you

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.590 
chain and so what you keep doing is you
keep<00:03:42.870> getting<00:03:43.220> four<00:03:44.220> more<00:03:44.700> bottle<00:03:45.120> caps<00:03:45.360> and

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
keep getting four more bottle caps and

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.970 
keep getting four more bottle caps and
then<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:45.930> keep<00:03:46.140> cutting<00:03:46.350> them<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.680> then<00:03:46.890> you

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
then you keep cutting them and then you

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.090 
then you keep cutting them and then you
keep<00:03:47.190> adding<00:03:47.400> on<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.540> will<00:03:48.690> eventually

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
keep adding on and it will eventually

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.970 
keep adding on and it will eventually
get<00:03:50.100> really<00:03:50.940> super<00:03:51.210> long<00:03:52.520> that's<00:03:53.520> about<00:03:53.760> it
