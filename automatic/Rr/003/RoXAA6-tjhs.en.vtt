 It's now I've opened the package 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.690
 without filming because I thought it was a 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.929
 order a product that I have 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.939

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.169
 as the order of the gurguÃ©ia that arrived a 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.189
 bit faster than I thought 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:27.550
 come to purchase a device or more 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.189
 less than day 12 of the name and I had a 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.250
 problem because samsung unfortunately 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.410
 for lack of apparatuses one vote for one 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.810

 waiting for him 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.290

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.560
 well spoken talking plastic bubble 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.360
 he sees it pleases the looting of the situation 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.960
 functional apparatus apparently seems 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.220
 Be young and they sent me for the delay. 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.700

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:05.740
 this little chap and sent the gel 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.810
 the galaxy s 4g or open the device and 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.060
 the check of how the device is 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.060
 inside was on and said 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.830
 I caught 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.900
 I hope the barrel can 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.829
 Why did not you do so well? 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.020
 I learned came sealed is thus a 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.149
 problem here everything so far so good 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.409
 good for what I see I said 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.200
 It is what appears to be a new device 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.179
 no problem 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:58.039
 I had bought the galaxy s 4 next to 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:02:03.979
 it came with no problems whatsoever reason 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:05.599
 disorder comes with the store until the day 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.420
 with the people it was that they were with 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:12.380
 doubt there that buy shop 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.769
 in danger only I was left with a 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.910
 boredom is this purchase I made now 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.250
 because the staff worked hard to 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.120
 me or cell phone 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.140
 they barely took an average of 25 days 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.140
 let me download it 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.210

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.890
 good very beautiful came without risk it in 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.660
 nothing any harm nothing that could 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.850
 making me upset 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.760
 all components came from another 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.320
 data transfer cable 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.100
 charger headphone a new 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.750
 and the hood we'll see the 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.060
 that we are going to test the device is 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.290
 everything ok apparently i'll do the 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.300
 Russians in his first tests and already 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.760
 pass a personal positioning of the 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.710
 the universe and for the staff that has 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.600
 to buy on the site or I assure you 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.480
 they will not have any problems 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.760
 It's one thing I saw that I saw that I 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.620
 I came to feel there that the staff did not 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.650
 know how it works to send 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.400
 phones in the form of pre-sales with 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.940
 many questions with this question and end up 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.880
 requesting the purchase of the 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.400
 pre-sale changes because it is and by what 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.220
 I understood that Pedro explained to me. 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.640

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.820

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.550

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.070
 other 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.560
 other pre sales there the staff thinks not 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.750
 but I went to the site and saw that the 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.760
 forecast changed the date is to be expected 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.390

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.550
 there is no need I am the one to pre 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.010
 that you bought the 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.840
