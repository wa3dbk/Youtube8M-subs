so<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:10.950> sounds<00:03:11.310> way<00:03:11.700> different<00:03:12.209> but<00:03:12.480> that's

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
so it sounds way different but that's

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.780 
so it sounds way different but that's
something<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.530> scott<00:03:13.950> henderson<00:03:14.220> would<00:03:14.610> do

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
something that scott henderson would do

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.870 
something that scott henderson would do
in<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.110> style<00:03:16.110> he<00:03:17.010> would<00:03:17.160> definitely<00:03:17.640> play

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
in that style he would definitely play

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.180 
in that style he would definitely play
syncopated<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:18.959> he<00:03:19.140> would<00:03:19.290> play<00:03:19.500> licks<00:03:19.980> like

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
syncopated and he would play licks like

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.000 
syncopated and he would play licks like
that<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.910> makes<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.360> big<00:03:21.750> difference<00:03:22.010> so

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
that and it makes a big difference so

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:31.810 
that and it makes a big difference so
let<00:03:23.160> me<00:03:23.250> do<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.400> again

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:43.040 

and<00:03:32.820> let<00:03:33.660> me<00:03:33.750> try<00:03:33.960> different<00:03:34.290> rhythm<00:03:41.990> okay<00:03:42.990> so

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
and let me try different rhythm okay so

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.260 
and let me try different rhythm okay so
that's<00:03:43.860> another<00:03:44.220> little<00:03:44.430> thing<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.910> can<00:03:45.090> do

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
that's another little thing you can do

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.000 
that's another little thing you can do
whenever<00:03:45.570> you're<00:03:45.960> working<00:03:46.200> on<00:03:46.620> let's<00:03:46.830> say

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
whenever you're working on let's say

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.640 
whenever you're working on let's say
patterns<00:03:47.660> try<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.720> do<00:03:48.900> different<00:03:48.930> rhythms

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
patterns try to do different rhythms

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.730 
patterns try to do different rhythms
with<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:51.000> know<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.780> try<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.170> experiment

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
with it you know and try to experiment

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.630 
with it you know and try to experiment
that<00:03:53.730> way<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.390> build<00:03:55.080> from<00:03:55.350> that<00:03:55.620> that<00:03:56.280> way<00:03:56.490> as

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
that way and build from that that way as

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:16.880 
that way and build from that that way as
well<00:03:56.670> ok<00:03:57.680> I<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:59.160> add<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.400> note<00:03:59.820> to<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:15.230> okay<00:04:16.230> so

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
well ok I can add a note to it okay so

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.310 
well ok I can add a note to it okay so
as<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.370> see<00:04:17.670> by<00:04:17.910> adding<00:04:18.420> a<00:04:18.540> note<00:04:18.750> or<00:04:18.930> adding

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
as you see by adding a note or adding

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.650 
as you see by adding a note or adding
two<00:04:19.530> notes<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:20.100> it<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:21.030> can<00:04:21.180> do<00:04:21.360> a<00:04:21.390> lot<00:04:21.630> of

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
two notes to it you can do a lot of

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.050 
two notes to it you can do a lot of
different<00:04:22.080> other<00:04:22.430> juxtapositions<00:04:23.430> as<00:04:23.700> well

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
different other juxtapositions as well

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.530 
different other juxtapositions as well
with<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.510> scale<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.170> the<00:04:25.710> pattern<00:04:26.160> and

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
with the scale and the pattern and

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.330 
with the scale and the pattern and
rhythm<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:28.620> come<00:04:28.830> up<00:04:28.860> with<00:04:29.190> different

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
rhythm and you come up with different

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.670 
rhythm and you come up with different
licks<00:04:29.790> even<00:04:30.570> though<00:04:30.690> you've<00:04:30.900> worked<00:04:31.170> on<00:04:31.320> one

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
licks even though you've worked on one

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.940 
licks even though you've worked on one
pattern<00:04:31.980> I<00:04:32.340> like<00:04:33.210> smart<00:04:33.750> practice<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.530> this

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
pattern I like smart practice and this

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.820 
pattern I like smart practice and this
is<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.160> really<00:04:35.490> good<00:04:35.610> way<00:04:35.670> of<00:04:35.820> doing<00:04:36.090> that

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
is a really good way of doing that

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.940 
is a really good way of doing that
another<00:04:37.830> one<00:04:38.040> of<00:04:38.100> my<00:04:38.280> heroes<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:39.320> I<00:04:40.320> got<00:04:40.830> to

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
one of the things that I like about John

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.290 
one of the things that I like about John
Scofield<00:05:07.640> that<00:05:08.640> I'm<00:05:08.730> going<00:05:08.880> to<00:05:08.940> share<00:05:09.120> with

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
Scofield that I'm going to share with

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.580 
Scofield that I'm going to share with
you<00:05:09.360> today<00:05:09.630> is<00:05:10.880> skipping<00:05:11.880> strings<00:05:12.600> and<00:05:13.080> wide

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
you today is skipping strings and wide

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.890 
you today is skipping strings and wide
intervals<00:05:14.120> now<00:05:15.120> he<00:05:15.300> doesn't<00:05:15.480> do<00:05:15.690> wide

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
intervals now he doesn't do wide

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.840 
intervals now he doesn't do wide
intervals<00:05:16.200> like<00:05:16.410> holzworth<00:05:17.040> where<00:05:17.430> holzworth

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
intervals like holzworth where holzworth

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.180 
intervals like holzworth where holzworth
would<00:05:18.120> stretch<00:05:18.510> pretty<00:05:19.050> you<00:05:19.410> know<00:05:19.440> pretty<00:05:19.710> big

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
would stretch pretty you know pretty big

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.100 
would stretch pretty you know pretty big
and<00:05:20.490> you<00:05:20.850> know<00:05:20.970> do<00:05:21.120> legato<00:05:21.480> and<00:05:21.660> all<00:05:21.930> this

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
and you know do legato and all this

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.100 
and you know do legato and all this
stuff<00:05:22.910> Scofield<00:05:23.910> found<00:05:24.480> a<00:05:24.600> different<00:05:24.750> way<00:05:24.990> of

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
stuff Scofield found a different way of

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.050 
stuff Scofield found a different way of
doing<00:05:25.260> it<00:05:25.680> and<00:05:25.950> what<00:05:26.310> he<00:05:26.430> would<00:05:26.580> do<00:05:26.730> is<00:05:26.880> just

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
doing it and what he would do is just

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.870 
doing it and what he would do is just
skip<00:05:27.390> strings<00:05:27.840> once<00:05:28.800> again<00:05:28.980> you<00:05:29.370> take<00:05:29.580> a<00:05:29.610> pan

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
skip strings once again you take a pan

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:38.400 
skip strings once again you take a pan
tonic<00:05:30.300> scale

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:06:02.080 

and<00:05:39.410> you<00:05:39.500> do<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:39.800> good<00:05:39.979> ol<00:05:40.130> lick<00:06:00.220> so<00:06:01.220> by<00:06:02.030> doing

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
and you do the good ol lick so by doing

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:18.810 
and you do the good ol lick so by doing
things<00:06:02.600> like<00:06:02.780> that<00:06:03.139> it<00:06:03.530> changes<00:06:04.040> things<00:06:04.580> up

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.400 

okay<00:06:19.820> that's<00:06:20.570> something<00:06:21.020> else<00:06:21.169> you<00:06:21.320> can

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
okay that's something else you can

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.409 
okay that's something else you can
experiment<00:06:21.979> now<00:06:22.460> it<00:06:22.669> doesn't<00:06:23.030> sound<00:06:23.240> like

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
experiment now it doesn't sound like

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.840 
experiment now it doesn't sound like
blues<00:06:23.810> anymore<00:06:24.380> and<00:06:24.590> let's<00:06:25.010> try<00:06:25.310> one<00:06:25.580> more

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
blues anymore and let's try one more
