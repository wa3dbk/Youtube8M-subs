a<00:04:23.210> bullet<00:04:23.419> actually<00:04:23.600> but<00:04:24.440> we<00:04:25.190> have<00:04:25.280> to

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
a bullet actually but we have to

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.249 
a bullet actually but we have to
conserve<00:04:25.759> a<00:04:26.060> lot<00:04:26.360> of<00:04:26.479> water<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:26.990> be<00:04:27.139> very

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
conserve a lot of water and be very

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
fresh water and we use it rather rather
