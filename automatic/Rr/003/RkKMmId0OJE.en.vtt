00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.319

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.680

 now I know the note to learn to make cable 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.660
 USB cables are large 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:05.080
 different from the first few devices 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.810
 in the age yes I came with a microcar 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:15.240

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:22.990

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:36.669
 it would be good for wireless charging 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:38.590
 So you got the gas are for 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.860
 buying the base is something that nokia 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:48.030
 in does not do much marketing as the 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.030
 But this is a sensational device . 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.870
 it's very worth it 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:59.380
 who has 920 to make this exchange the staff 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:02.560
 so this is another boxing 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:06.110
 I hope you have enjoyed our 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:10.270
