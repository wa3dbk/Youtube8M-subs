00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
little bit otherwise during the baking

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.140 
little bit otherwise during the baking
process<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.799> could<00:02:04.890> fall<00:02:05.159> off<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.610> bread<00:02:05.850> I

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
process it could fall off the bread I

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.850 
process it could fall off the bread I
take<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> real<00:02:07.590> fine<00:02:08.040> mesh<00:02:08.549> sieve<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.570> I<00:02:10.200> gently

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
take a real fine mesh sieve and I gently

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.699 
take a real fine mesh sieve and I gently
brush<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:12.630> entire<00:02:13.310> bread<00:02:14.510> lightly<00:02:15.709> multiple

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
brush the entire bread lightly multiple

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:31.559 
brush the entire bread lightly multiple
applications

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.809 

so<00:02:32.569> after<00:02:32.930> you've<00:02:33.049> dusted<00:02:33.349> given<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:34.010> nice<00:02:34.249> even

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
so after you've dusted given a nice even

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.740 
so after you've dusted given a nice even
coating<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.900> should<00:02:36.079> use<00:02:36.200> an<00:02:36.379> exacto<00:02:37.750> cutter

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
coating you should use an exacto cutter

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:47.089 
coating you should use an exacto cutter
and<00:02:39.049> just<00:02:39.709> cut<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.219> veins<00:02:40.519> into<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.510> leaves

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.520 

that<00:02:47.670> will<00:02:47.969> allow<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.390> incision<00:02:49.109> to<00:02:49.140> us<00:02:49.349> to

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
that will allow the incision to us to

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.470 
that will allow the incision to us to
expand<00:02:50.159> slightly<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.879> give<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.180> little<00:02:51.389> bit

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
expand slightly and give it a little bit

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.459 
expand slightly and give it a little bit
of<00:02:51.569> depth<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:53.730> do<00:02:53.790> find<00:02:54.269> it's<00:02:54.510> important<00:02:55.079> to

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:55.469 
of depth and I do find it's important to

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.339 
of depth and I do find it's important to
give<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:55.799> nice<00:02:56.450> dusting<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.719> don't<00:02:58.019> think

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
give it a nice dusting I don't think

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.059 
give it a nice dusting I don't think
that<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.739> contrast<00:02:59.749> for<00:03:00.749> the<00:03:00.900> bread<00:03:01.170> looks

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
that the contrast for the bread looks

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.190 
that the contrast for the bread looks
good<00:03:02.430> if<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:03.060> don't<00:03:03.239> apply<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.569> little<00:03:03.930> bit<00:03:04.049> of

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
good if you don't apply a little bit of

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:18.059 
good if you don't apply a little bit of
that<00:03:04.349> white<00:03:04.590> mass

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.030 

next<00:03:18.730> thing<00:03:18.849> I<00:03:18.909> do<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.269> on<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.810> leaves<00:03:20.500> for<00:03:20.950> the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
next thing I do is on the leaves for the

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.030 
next thing I do is on the leaves for the
roses<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:21.730> make<00:03:22.689> a<00:03:22.720> straight<00:03:23.470> cut<00:03:23.680> down<00:03:23.860> the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
roses I make a straight cut down the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.789 
roses I make a straight cut down the
center<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.400> then<00:03:24.819> two<00:03:26.250> vertical<00:03:27.250> lines<00:03:28.799> along

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
center and then two vertical lines along

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.300 
center and then two vertical lines along
that<00:03:30.010> center<00:03:30.280> axis<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.799> looks<00:03:33.099> like

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
that center axis so that it looks like

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:50.370 
that center axis so that it looks like
it's<00:03:33.459> got<00:03:33.640> some<00:03:33.670> texture<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:36.250> leaf

want<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.620> make<00:04:03.710> three<00:04:05.650> incisions<00:04:07.870> one

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
want to make three incisions one

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
incision is going to go the entire

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.450 
incision is going to go the entire
length<00:04:11.330> of<00:04:11.510> that<00:04:11.690> wheat<00:04:11.960> berry<00:04:12.320> on<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.680> outer

I'm<00:04:19.450> going<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.660> go<00:04:19.750> opposite<00:04:20.440> of<00:04:20.650> where<00:04:21.130> that

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
I'm going to go opposite of where that

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.630 
I'm going to go opposite of where that
incision<00:04:21.640> was<00:04:21.910> made<00:04:21.970> at<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.230> same<00:04:23.440> angle<00:04:26.640> then

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
incision was made at the same angle then

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.980 
incision was made at the same angle then
I<00:04:27.730> go<00:04:27.970> down<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.540> center<00:04:30.210> as<00:04:31.210> well

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:47.580 

and<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.590> repeat<00:04:35.979> that<00:04:36.039> on<00:04:36.520> all<00:04:37.030> of<00:04:37.060> them<00:04:46.590> have

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
incisions you put it into an oven about

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.370 
incisions you put it into an oven about
450<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.110> 480<00:04:54.099> degrees<00:04:54.250> Fahrenheit<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:56.020> I<00:04:56.110> bake

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
it with some steam and then the trick is

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.379 
it with some steam and then the trick is
just<00:04:59.259> bake<00:04:59.800> it<00:04:59.830> to<00:05:00.460> as<00:05:00.610> dark<00:05:01.000> as<00:05:01.180> you<00:05:01.270> can
