00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
around you in terms of like rain and Sun

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.789 
around you in terms of like rain and Sun
and<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.509> know<00:01:48.600> wind<00:01:48.899> energy<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.409> things<00:01:49.649> like

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and you know wind energy and things like

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.190 
and you know wind energy and things like
that<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.250> it's<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.200> intersection

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
that so it's just the intersection

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.789 
that so it's just the intersection
really<00:01:52.500> between<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.920> lot<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:54.590> things<00:01:55.590> related

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
really between a lot of things related

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.740 
really between a lot of things related
to<00:01:56.280> your<00:01:56.490> ability<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.360> self-sufficient

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
to your ability to be self-sufficient

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.030 
to your ability to be self-sufficient
and<00:01:58.229> free<00:01:58.770> really<00:01:59.340> um<00:01:59.659> but<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.469> one<00:02:01.649> downside

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
and free really um but the one downside
