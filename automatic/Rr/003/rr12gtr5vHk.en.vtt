this toy but since unboxing it took me

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.500 
this toy but since unboxing it took me
the<00:00:39.480> better<00:00:39.690> part<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.170> an<00:00:40.290> hour<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:41.329> wasn't<00:00:42.329> so

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the better part of an hour it wasn't so

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.229 
the better part of an hour it wasn't so
impressive<00:00:43.140> afterwards<00:00:43.850> it's<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.000> great

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
impressive afterwards it's a great

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.450 
impressive afterwards it's a great
looking<00:00:45.629> box<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.320> cool<00:00:46.620> artwork<00:00:47.190> and

looking box with cool artwork and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.090 
looking box with cool artwork and
windows<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.899> would<00:00:49.230> take<00:00:49.500> quite<00:00:49.770> an

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
windows but it would take quite an

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.189 
windows but it would take quite an
effort<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.760> put<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> x-wing<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.780> figures

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.540 

probably<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.440> most<00:01:04.680> impressive<00:01:05.190> thing<00:01:05.519> about

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
probably the most impressive thing about

probably the most impressive thing about
this<00:01:05.940> x-wing<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.690> that<00:01:07.230> it's<00:01:07.410> actually<00:01:08.040> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
this x-wing is that it's actually to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.670 
this x-wing is that it's actually to
scale<00:01:08.820> with<00:01:09.210> standard<00:01:09.690> Star<00:01:09.990> Wars<00:01:10.230> figures
