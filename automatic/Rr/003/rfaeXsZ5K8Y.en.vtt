00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.200
 Tell me, folks, what are you talking about? 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.380
 and welcome everyone to the first 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.750
 video of beautiful rare movie from laine do 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.190
 channel to galera this is the beta version with 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.859
 you can see in the top corner 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.970
 left is not the definitive version in 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.250
 I'll believe the version 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.910
 definitive but for now is not only the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.599
 beta version lets us play a lot 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.859
 try it out there to see this game 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.050
 really worth the investment of 229 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.610
 that it has now increased its 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.239
 finished the national game price 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.879
 increasing by 29 reais in relation to the year 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.950
 Let's just say so, and that's for sure. 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.719
 Way it gets a bit saltier value 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.520
 of games we can play more games 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.820
 but the official resellers of 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.250
 1929 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.320
 but finally let's talk a little bit here 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.730
 in this online radio beta that I 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.910
 I confess to you that I found it well 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.980
 interesting she has two hot maps 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.619
 here is more open and has another that was 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.930
 city ​​on that bank where you steal it 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.930
 not even that modality of the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.000
 another map background is the assault on 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.369
 bank and here it has a kind of 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.590
 car chase but in case it was 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.189
 living here the great achievement that I 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.560
 Of course it is 64 players putaria 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.270
 frantic for everything that is on the side and here 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.220
 I started playing cool until I came in. 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.920
 in the beginning here in this corner here 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.100
 I was dominating its central part and 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.840
 many people stay in this part of the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.729
 bomb not the flag trying to capture 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.189
 so with this you can always have 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.350
 contact with the opponent so I ended up 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.090
 moving in that situation 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.920
 here I'm using a car in 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.899
 rear of the car has a light machine 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.880
 gun here in the back of the car crash 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.170
 a lot of people and even went well 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.790
 interesting I had never entered the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.740
 car the first time i walked in it falls 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.840
 straight into the machine gun and started 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.610
 Squeeze the guy and it was really cool. 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.500
 There's even going to be a guy who's going to try 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.840
 kill me here you will not be able to kill 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.659
 I'll get out of the car and I'll go. 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.149
 Shoot him if he fucked right 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.710
 finally come to talk about the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.489
 my first impressions of the radio 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.770
 online 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.150
 I really liked the move 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.549
 Very soft, I remember well. 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.620
 who has the child from 3 to 1 today is more 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.930
 easy to move around and play more 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.439
 loose it is not as truncated as in 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.450
 bs-4 here you can move 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.519
 move much easier 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.530
 there the windows the walls finally you 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.269
 get screwed know the technician is very 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.430
 disgusting said he's been looking for a lot 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.530
 thing the guy does not jump is a pain 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.180
 to do such a simple thing 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.129
 here it is not working properly if 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.099
 can move around very easily there. 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.319
 obstacles there a window is at last jump 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.060
 one short wall alright quiet is well 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.159
 nice that in lawsuits moves a lot 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.760
 better than in bs-4 this is a point 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:52.560
 well positive in my opinion another 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.750
 thing that I found cool is that the guns she 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.280
 has a much greater setback than bs-4 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.980
 to get harder on you 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.599
 I can control the aim and I do not 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.760
 I played with all the users I played only 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.470
 trade some areas but I already played with 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.859
 this weapon spoke again well that the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:12.750
 first is at 0 93 something, yes one 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:14.280
 gun is the first weapon is and there is 933 and she 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.680
 It's really cool just that she has a good retreat. 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.150
 high but it's a matter of getting used to it 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.340
 playing with it is a touch on the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.169
 Trigger on the new mouse you can is 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.849
 position the shot in the very easy case in 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.799
 your opponent and you can 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.409
 leave her looking more stable 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.449
 ah I think it's cool that they ended up as 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.310
 I already told you is leaving a 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.590
 little more difficult the aim of the game 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.239
 that to me was really cool is one of 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.370
 things that also that I ended up enjoying 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.849
 enough on the online radio now you do not 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.400
 says lock arms the attacks by hare 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.199
 you basically unlock these things 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.209
 buying with the money as you 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:53.489
 going to play will score opponents 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.139
 You're going to make it and that's it. 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.389
 Can you buy some things? 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.000
 cockroaches have things are expensive as hell 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.650
 and there is money to buy to buy 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.370
 they even now that you buy 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.930
 also camouflage and I think it's the 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.699
 first game in the battlefield series 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.409
 have gold camouflage correct if 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:12.659
 I'm wrong but I think the first one 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:15.389
 game of the series that has camouflage of gold 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:18.930
 for you to be able to customize the 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:20.820
 your weapon is another positive factor 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.340
 in my opinion, I was playing 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.250
 here in xbox the year and the server was 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.320
 gringo to veto with 160 more pink or 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.260
 less and how you can see the gameplay 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.039
 It was quiet also easy to play the 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.810
 game 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.580
 despite having lots of people who are new 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.340
 so the guys are learning to play 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.800
 as I was learning then too 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.110
 Whoever pulls the fastest is 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.729
 managing to kill easier but 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.930
 you run into a gringo who already has a 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.340
 ability as it is the same to you 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.010
 times pulling faster you're done. 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.669
 dying because of little dna 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.560
 delay 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.150
 but you can still play well anyway 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.669
 quiet connection is better than 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.889
 feef four notebooks in brazil 4 too 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.900
 in reflection at least for me and the hard 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.419
 landing behaved very well 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.110
 but it's not all flowers, let's say so 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:12.180
 and my point is that more critical say 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.300
 so in relation to online web radio is 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.940
 that his graphic is simple guys he 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.000
 becomes weaker than the graph 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.710
 do f4000 review this map even here 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.960
 his chart is very simple in this part 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.270
 the city is cuter it has a few 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.130
 cooler textures are more in the part 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.990
 more open desert 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.289
 his chart is very simple you see the 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.150
 Visitation is well quadric checked if 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.580
 well in the Christmas season so I thought 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.469
 a bit ugly the graphic part of the 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.760
 game series that is a beta can be 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:44.250
 that the final version is a bit better 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.590
 but if it is better it will be much better 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.580
 also in the game it will be released soon 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.310
 in March 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.139
 Then there's a month a month and a little bit there two 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.960
 months, let's say at most three 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:57.510
 can correct the bad and improve and 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.849
 the police in the game on this graph that 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.580
 It's all wonder, but taking it away 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.229
 I even found the game cool I do not know if 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.479
 it will be worth making this investment 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:09.029
 face may buy more forward 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:12.270
 will be a game actually being released see the 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:13.860
 Feedback from the crowd so I can see 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.210
 whether it's really worth it or not 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.089
 This game for now I found 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.080
 interesting is a beautiful film of 4 is with 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:21.449
 better things 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.569
 some worse the theme police 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:26.460
 thief is cool but this is not what goes 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.080
 to buy the right game 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.849
 I want to see this game, but I want to see if 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.979
 I have the possibility to play the others 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.599
 modes of play with this maybe having a 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:35.610
 a slightly better opinion of the 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:37.080
 online radio but for now I like the 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.620
 I found it interesting, I think. 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:44.039
 that it is too expensive is to bring little 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.750
 Innovation is basically caught up in the beautiful 24 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:48.469
 set some thing here 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:51.000
 little thing there vote other maps weapons tal 

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:52.949
 itaurb ready here so we can play 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.069
 although I would do the same thing almost 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:58.889
 But the online radio is I do not know, man. 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:00.060
 I think for now I'm going to give a 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:02.370
 insured to see 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.020
 although I liked the game finally here 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.750
 I have to play, but I have to train. 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.629
 But then to really see if I go 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.340
 really like the game or not 

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:14.639
 while I think it's cool 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:17.550
 interesting though it could be very 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:19.529
 better than he is being he is not me 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.139
 surprising this is the reality the game 

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:23.099
 It's cool, it's a nice connection. 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.659
 it's good 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:26.759
 only it is not surprising it is not 

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:29.039
 Nothing new and I was expecting a 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:30.870
 jumping graphic over br4 thing 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:32.819
 what is not happening he is 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.250
 making a game with the chart even with 

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:36.810
 a little lower than the pec4 anyway guys 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.669
 I want to see if I bring some more type of 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.319
 gameplay talking about something else 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:41.969
 online radio profile for you 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:43.979
 liked the video of today because it is
