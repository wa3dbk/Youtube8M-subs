00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.360
 Hello, and today I will tell you 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.849
 about such a style as stroking stroking 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.130
 went from the word smug in the club there is 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.750
 such an installation that constantly makes 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.960
 bright flashes through certain 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.240
 intervals and by itself people 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.650
 who look at these countries seems 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.099
 what man who dances 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.930
 appears in different positions dark 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.019
 light he poured out in this position is dark 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.160
 again flash on the same here and it turns out 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.970
 that he appears every time in different 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.820
 positions 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.390
 from this and it went from this one went 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.200
 style sling on how to dance it in 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.739
 principle very simple principle is similar to 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.350
 the robot 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.190
 that is, we are against movement in the robot 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.820
 defined and smashed them at the point of memory 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.370
 memory memory memory memory memory memory 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.339
 memory memory memory memory 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.700
 but in the robot they are all lines of movement here 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.009
 here here the wire can't 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.289
 move nonlinear like a man person 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.750
 already joints do not bend so much so that 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.959
 so you can play like that 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.270
 so so inge more variation for 

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:23.369
 movements so take any movement 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.970
 how do you want let's just lift 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.970
 hands up 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.480
 just take movement and develop it 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.790
 on point but let's say 100 bengi 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.400
 no points you do at the k-pop point 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.450
 puma puma puma puma pu-puma puma puma you 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.450
 make a stop 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.229
 that is, you do not need to strain your arms to do 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.730
 make easy installation but hands everything 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.730
 equals no tension 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.890
 easy planed could not be he should 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.410
 look easy do you have it with 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.860
 the tension of the arm is initially strained and 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:37.330
 how would you like a hand holding and you 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:42.340
 tearing out the memory 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.610
 memory memory memory memory memory memory 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.610
 pam 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.069
 it is clear you need to train this one 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.470
 lightness no dad says again 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.459
 do not need to because many do 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.560
 strobe pumas pumas pumas pumas and this is already 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.620
 completely different movement therefore 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.410
 train to do more points that is 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.810
 not the points themselves like dad 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.650
 stop go to any convenient for you 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.379
 movement i say raising hands 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.760
 stretching in the head any movement 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:32.099
 break it on point first do 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.099
 it's slow and stressless you 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.720
 does not strain after a little bit stronger 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.720
 strain your hands 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.190
 clearly it was embedded everyone asked and 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.190
 train and you will succeed
