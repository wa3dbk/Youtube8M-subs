trying to make sense out of it we've

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.950 
trying to make sense out of it we've
learned<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.420> volatility<00:00:43.109> yields<00:00:43.980> division

it's<00:00:53.460> wrong<00:00:54.649> ambiguity<00:00:55.649> yields<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.489> agility

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
it's wrong ambiguity yields to agility

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000 
it's wrong ambiguity yields to agility
so<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.600> leaders<00:00:57.929> of<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.260> future<00:00:58.409> need<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
so the leaders of the future need to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.090 
so the leaders of the future need to
have<00:00:59.249> that<00:00:59.699> kind<00:01:00.089> of<00:01:00.149> vision<00:01:01.100> understanding

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
have that kind of vision understanding

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.200 
have that kind of vision understanding
clarity<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.879> agility<00:01:03.269> and<00:01:03.980> forecasting

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
foresight was the importance of biotech

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.250 
foresight was the importance of biotech
the<00:02:54.460> insight<00:02:54.880> was<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.390> senior<00:02:55.690> executives

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
the insight was the senior executives

needed to learn more about it and the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.420 
needed to learn more about it and the
action<00:02:58.630> was<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:59.140> biotech<00:02:59.770> reverse<00:03:00.130> mentoring

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
action was a biotech reverse mentoring

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.800 
action was a biotech reverse mentoring
program
