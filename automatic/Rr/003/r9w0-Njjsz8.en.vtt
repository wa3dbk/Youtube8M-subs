 edmund hungry for 1 1 point 3 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.950
 or from the 1 1 points to the version 1 point one for later steel of powers 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.789

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:16.470
 This good 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.669
 first of all 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:22.609
 here they buy notice I have not yet unstable the state is completely 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.279
 I was completely empty very high 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.460
 it can be said that literally new 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.300
 so now I'm going to what we have taken advantage of aside from him 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.520
 the arc 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.320
 they're going to have to open the ad council 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.100
 Already today I have already told you 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 three leagues 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.770
 good lists them the first since the first lynx 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.179
 that is going to be a long file that is the world next to 1 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.750
 to access the network 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.690
 and then downloaded to my computer 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.810
 so next time it's 160 miles 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.240
 we do not have a band-to-band connection 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.270
 bamako to mature 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.800
 Once you have downloaded it, I recommend you make a folder 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.500
 especially for break not to say 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.830

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.240

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.730
 they are going to press the key 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.590
 later without releasing it they will press update to the key 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.290
 chile give me update 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.370
 later 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.200

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.440
 the same point 1 august 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.440
 the lie 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.420
 here it will last approximately five minutes 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.910
 there is only as the wheel there will be no movement leave it there I could 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.810
 in this way there are five minutes won street finished all good and let's hope 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.350
 a little bit in what determines I go back volume moment 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.170
 good because the version 1 point 1 came out as you can see 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.020

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.430

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.060

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.820
 abc explorer 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.250

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.580

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.580

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.719
 they will look like a link that says nothing installed 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:19.249
 they give you a click 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:22.249
 they were going to look good depending on the speed of their 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.299
 They are going to be able to go Pablo Baez boast respectively as they saw the light 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.629

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.099
