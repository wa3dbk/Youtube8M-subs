plate and go ahead and sit down a little
good

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.670 

thirty<00:00:43.850> seconds<00:00:44.480> is<00:00:44.600> all<00:00:44.870> this<00:00:45.050> really<00:00:45.260> takes

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
thirty seconds is all this really takes

thirty seconds is all this really takes
I<00:00:47.260> mean<00:00:48.260> waiting<00:00:48.590> that's<00:00:48.920> ten

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.390 

once<00:00:58.990> it's<00:00:59.200> gone<00:00:59.350> it's<00:00:59.530> 30<00:00:59.740> seconds<00:01:00.220> for

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
once it's gone it's 30 seconds for

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.140 
once it's gone it's 30 seconds for
Lorentz<00:01:00.760> it<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:03.070> when<00:01:03.370> you're<00:01:03.520> doing<00:01:03.730> small

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
Lorentz it now when you're doing small

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.840 
Lorentz it now when you're doing small
projects<00:01:04.720> like<00:01:04.750> this<00:01:05.020> sometimes<00:01:05.490> you<00:01:06.490> can<00:01:06.640> see

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
projects like this sometimes you can see

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.650 
projects like this sometimes you can see
the<00:01:07.030> small<00:01:07.360> letters<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:08.890> come<00:01:09.100> off<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:10.510> no

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
the small letters they come off it's no

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.910 
the small letters they come off it's no
big<00:01:10.870> deal<00:01:10.900> because<00:01:11.230> the<00:01:11.440> whole<00:01:11.590> thing<00:01:11.800> I'm

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
big deal because the whole thing I'm

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.230 
big deal because the whole thing I'm
mirroring<00:01:12.190> away<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.790> then<00:01:15.910> I've<00:01:16.000> got<00:01:16.210> a

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
mirroring away and then I've got a

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.870 
mirroring away and then I've got a
process<00:01:16.840> of<00:01:17.050> I<00:01:17.170> do<00:01:17.230> this<00:01:19.830> fixes<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.890> issue<00:01:23.880> now

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
process of I do this fixes the issue now

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
process of I do this fixes the issue now
I<00:01:24.910> got<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.240> bring<00:01:25.420> stuff<00:01:25.720> with<00:01:26.460> still<00:01:27.460> water

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
I got to bring stuff with still water

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:50.610 
I got to bring stuff with still water
and<00:01:29.920> mix<00:01:30.130> my<00:01:30.340> chemicals

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:02:02.160 

where<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.610> chemicals<00:01:52.060> are<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:01.660> reaction

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
where the chemicals are the reaction

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.260 
where the chemicals are the reaction
usually<00:02:02.560> takes<00:02:02.830> less<00:02:03.130> than<00:02:05.490> less<00:02:06.490> than<00:02:06.520> a

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
usually takes less than less than a

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.860 
usually takes less than less than a
minute<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.800> really<00:02:09.070> start<00:02:09.550> going<00:02:10.450> in<00:02:12.870> you'll

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
minute to really start going in you'll

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.570 
minute to really start going in you'll
start<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.320> see<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.530> turning<00:02:14.860> black<00:02:15.160> which<00:02:15.430> is

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
start to see it turning black which is

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:30.930 
start to see it turning black which is
doing<00:02:15.910> now

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.530 

it's<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.450> little<00:02:31.720> cold<00:02:32.020> down<00:02:32.260> here<00:02:32.320> in<00:02:32.860> my

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
it's a little cold down here in my

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.270 
it's a little cold down here in my
basement<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.350> might<00:02:35.560> take<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> little<00:02:36.130> bit

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
basement so it might take a little bit

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.850 
basement so it might take a little bit
longer<00:02:36.520> than<00:02:36.940> normal<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:38.250> really<00:02:39.250> start<00:02:39.610> to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
longer than normal to really start to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.730 
longer than normal to really start to
activate<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.190> silver<00:02:43.140> but<00:02:44.140> it's<00:02:44.290> taken<00:02:44.650> out

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
activate the silver but it's taken out

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.590 
activate the silver but it's taken out
and<00:02:44.890> really<00:02:45.040> nicely<00:02:45.460> right<00:02:45.640> now<00:02:48.480> do<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> little

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
and really nicely right now do a little

00:02:49.600 --> 00:03:02.449 
and really nicely right now do a little
bit<00:02:49.960> of<00:02:51.720> antiquing<00:02:52.720> in<00:02:52.840> this

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.649 

and<00:03:03.459> I'll<00:03:03.579> just<00:03:03.849> let<00:03:03.999> it<00:03:04.150> go

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
and I'll just let it go

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.679 
and I'll just let it go
about<00:03:05.469> another<00:03:05.650> three<00:03:06.010> minutes<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.639> it<00:03:07.569> will

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
about another three minutes and it will

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:35.860 
about another three minutes and it will
take<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:10.480> be<00:03:10.900> done

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.309 

I<00:03:35.900> don't<00:03:36.560> know<00:03:36.650> if<00:03:36.709> you<00:03:36.800> can<00:03:36.920> see<00:03:37.190> it<00:03:37.310> in<00:03:37.459> the

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
I don't know if you can see it in the

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:47.520 
I don't know if you can see it in the
ship<00:03:39.319> you'll<00:03:39.530> see<00:03:39.769> my<00:03:39.920> hand<00:03:40.220> in<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.580> mirror

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.140 

take<00:03:48.530> this<00:03:48.769> up<00:03:49.129> and<00:03:51.250> onto<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.700> what<00:03:52.940> you

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
take this up and onto it what you

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:16.920 
take this up and onto it what you
actually<00:03:53.330> see

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.530 

now<00:04:17.560> this<00:04:17.799> came<00:04:18.040> out<00:04:18.220> really<00:04:18.280> nice<00:04:18.759> all<00:04:19.419> my

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
now this came out really nice all my

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.850 
now this came out really nice all my
edges<00:04:19.930> are<00:04:19.959> really<00:04:20.229> good<00:04:20.620> I<00:04:22.470> mean<00:04:23.470> pretty<00:04:23.770> much

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
edges are really good I mean pretty much

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.279 
edges are really good I mean pretty much
just<00:04:24.250> letting<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.729> distressing<00:04:25.240> be<00:04:26.050> the

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
just letting the distressing be the

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.730 
just letting the distressing be the
stuff<00:04:27.250> that<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.490> added<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.270> finish<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:28.900> not

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
stuff that I added to the finish and not

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.260 
stuff that I added to the finish and not
so<00:04:30.009> much<00:04:31.770> around<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:33.039> edges<00:04:33.460> there's<00:04:34.120> going

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
so much around the edges there's going

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.659 
so much around the edges there's going
to<00:04:34.330> be<00:04:34.389> a<00:04:34.449> little<00:04:34.690> bit<00:04:37.860> hand<00:04:38.860> oil<00:04:39.130> stuff<00:04:39.430> like

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
to be a little bit hand oil stuff like

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.850 
to be a little bit hand oil stuff like
that<00:04:39.910> they<00:04:40.600> usually<00:04:40.630> are<00:04:41.110> gone<00:04:41.380> whenever<00:04:41.740> I

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
that they usually are gone whenever I

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.100 
that they usually are gone whenever I
clean<00:04:42.220> someone<00:04:42.759> Riesling<00:04:43.389> something<00:04:43.840> there's

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
clean someone Riesling something there's

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.499 
clean someone Riesling something there's
nothing<00:04:44.259> wrong

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
nothing wrong

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.379 
nothing wrong
now<00:04:46.509> the<00:04:46.570> edges<00:04:46.960> are<00:04:47.110> perfect<00:04:47.620> but<00:04:48.120> in<00:04:49.120> some

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
now the edges are perfect but in some

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.810 
now the edges are perfect but in some
cases<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:50.110> know<00:04:50.400> when<00:04:51.400> you're<00:04:51.550> doing

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
cases you know when you're doing

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.810 
cases you know when you're doing
antiquing<00:04:52.510> like<00:04:52.660> this<00:04:52.900> you<00:04:53.260> end<00:04:53.410> up<00:04:53.560> with

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
antiquing like this you end up with

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.420 
antiquing like this you end up with
minor<00:04:54.820> imperfections<00:04:55.180> around<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:55.990> edges

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
minor imperfections around the edges

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.790 
minor imperfections around the edges
which<00:04:57.430> is<00:04:57.900> appealing<00:04:58.900> when<00:04:59.169> it<00:04:59.320> comes<00:04:59.530> down<00:04:59.740> to

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
which is appealing when it comes down to

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:26.390 
which is appealing when it comes down to
you

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.930 

kind<00:05:27.300> of<00:05:27.360> looking<00:05:27.720> on<00:05:27.780> this<00:05:28.460> as<00:05:29.460> you<00:05:29.520> can<00:05:29.699> see

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
kind of looking on this as you can see

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.650 
kind of looking on this as you can see
in<00:05:30.360> here<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.680> parts<00:05:32.490> that<00:05:32.580> are<00:05:32.790> really<00:05:33.120> white

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
in here the parts that are really white

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.710 
in here the parts that are really white
more<00:05:34.350> than<00:05:34.440> likely<00:05:34.650> lifted<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.280> little<00:05:35.490> bit

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
more than likely lifted a little bit

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.870 
more than likely lifted a little bit
which<00:05:36.720> just<00:05:37.020> means<00:05:37.260> that<00:05:37.410> I've<00:05:37.530> gotta<00:05:37.850> do<00:05:38.850> a

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
which just means that I've gotta do a

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.260 
which just means that I've gotta do a
little<00:05:39.060> bit<00:05:39.270> of<00:05:39.360> tweaking<00:05:39.570> at<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.050> end<00:05:41.270> but

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
little bit of tweaking at the end but

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.350 
little bit of tweaking at the end but
all<00:05:42.479> my<00:05:42.630> small<00:05:42.690> letters<00:05:43.410> which<00:05:43.650> is<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:43.949> worst

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
all my small letters which is the worst

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.810 
all my small letters which is the worst
are<00:05:45.360> fine<00:05:48.710> let<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.800> other<00:05:49.919> ten<00:05:50.250> seconds

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
are fine let the other ten seconds

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.040 
are fine let the other ten seconds
hearing<00:05:51.120> I'm<00:05:51.210> going<00:05:51.330> to<00:05:51.389> go<00:05:51.479> ahead<00:05:51.540> and<00:05:51.870> clean

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
hearing I'm going to go ahead and clean

hearing I'm going to go ahead and clean
it<00:05:52.080> off

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.499 

now<00:06:29.650> you<00:06:30.650> can<00:06:30.800> see<00:06:31.070> some<00:06:31.610> soldiering<00:06:32.270> on<00:06:32.360> the

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509

the most part you can see the antiquing
it's<00:06:52.310> really<00:06:52.820> evident<00:06:53.000> right<00:06:53.360> there<00:06:56.349> see
