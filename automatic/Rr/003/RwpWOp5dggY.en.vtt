 municipal secretary of agriculture luciane copeti 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.759
 the estimate of obtaining average productivity over 75 bags for editing it

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.860
 165 thousand tons working for the reports of the secretariat we have there 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.330
 of 177 techniques of planted maize 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.800
 the secretariat's estimate is to harvest on average 75 sacks per hectare 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.490
 but with the probability of increasing this productivity due to the rains that 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.240
 were 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.930
 until the period when the militiaman flourished with the arrival of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.940
 extirpated community green field 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.409

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.160
 for this Saturday and expects productivity of over 80 bags per 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.730
 fair today I think it's average 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.710
 I reached 90 + 2 sac per hectare itabom and the whole crop the price of 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.410
 commodity is attractive in the market 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.640
 but the producer has a concern the increase of the prices of the inputs 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.109
 by wave was the difference between

 roberta sa frei 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.150
 It's okay, we need to have people strolling through the group 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.810
 worrying silver approach 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.810
 because the very brutal act forrÃ³ this changes very expensive 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.570

 only that without making a comparison of 12 months goes beyond the next harvest ' 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.050
 I think he is worried 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.940
 Another concern of the rural producer is 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.749
 drought 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:03.179
 the tram the request for imminent fire during the harvest is the largest 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.789
 that's our concern 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.580
 is to prevent the fires
