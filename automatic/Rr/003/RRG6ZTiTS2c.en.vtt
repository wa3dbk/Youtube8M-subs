00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.710
 it's a pleasure to direct census data 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.560
 Obviously it's a problem. 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.310

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.730
 prestige of the project involves the 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.800
 to be able to discount more things and others 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.040
 sectors concerned will be able to agree more 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.110
