units over here down the 23 as unist 68

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.200 
units over here down the 23 as unist 68
and<00:01:53.229> his<00:01:54.229> fire<00:01:54.440> units<00:01:54.770> down<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.040> 37<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.149> I'm

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
and his fire units down the 37 so I'm

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.820 
and his fire units down the 37 so I'm
going<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.420> quickly<00:01:56.570> move<00:01:56.869> my<00:01:57.140> slingers<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.710> his

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
going to quickly move my slingers to his

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.950 
going to quickly move my slingers to his
flanks<00:01:58.280> fire<00:01:58.700> flank<00:01:59.060> shots<00:01:59.360> on<00:01:59.540> his<00:01:59.660> silver

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
flanks fire flank shots on his silver

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.960 
flanks fire flank shots on his silver
shields<00:02:00.350> silver<00:02:01.190> shields<00:02:01.520> don't<00:02:01.700> have<00:02:01.850> very

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
shields silver shields don't have very

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.639

good<00:02:02.090> missile<00:02:02.570> protection<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.290> so<00:02:03.530> that's

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
good missile protection and so that's

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.620 
good missile protection and so that's
one<00:02:03.830> way<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.009> weaken<00:02:04.429> them<00:02:04.580> notice<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:05.509> I'm

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
one way to weaken them notice that I'm

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.240 
one way to weaken them notice that I'm
not<00:02:05.780> engaging<00:02:06.229> his<00:02:06.500> infantry<00:02:06.890> yet<00:02:07.100> either

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
not engaging his infantry yet either

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.919 
not engaging his infantry yet either
because<00:02:07.610> his<00:02:07.759> cataracts<00:02:08.090> are<00:02:08.450> on<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.630> way<00:02:08.720> in

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
because his cataracts are on the way in

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.980 
because his cataracts are on the way in
and<00:02:08.960> I<00:02:09.140> need<00:02:09.350> my<00:02:09.530> infantry<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.039> support

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
and I need my infantry to support

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.600 
and I need my infantry to support

had I been Bismarck I'm not gonna tell
him<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.880> boy<00:02:15.120> because<00:02:15.570> he's<00:02:15.810> good<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.320> he

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
him that a boy because he's good and he

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.470 
him that a boy because he's good and he
can<00:02:16.650> figure<00:02:16.800> how<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> play<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.310> his<00:02:17.430> own<00:02:17.580> had<00:02:18.450> I

can figure how to play on his own had I
been<00:02:18.720> him<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.050> would<00:02:19.200> have<00:02:19.290> come<00:02:19.470> up<00:02:19.620> and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
been him I would have come up and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.500 
been him I would have come up and
engaged<00:02:20.040> my<00:02:20.250> infantry<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.880> then<00:02:21.060> brought<00:02:21.330> in

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
engaged my infantry and then brought in

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.110 
engaged my infantry and then brought in
my<00:02:21.960> cataphract<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.830> probably<00:02:23.610> wouldn't<00:02:24.090> have

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
my cataphract I probably wouldn't have

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.960 
my cataphract I probably wouldn't have
had<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> way<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.540> stop<00:02:24.870> him<00:02:25.050> then<00:02:25.850> because<00:02:26.850> he's

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
had a way to stop him then because he's

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.130 
had a way to stop him then because he's
done<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.480> can<00:02:27.630> support<00:02:27.990> my<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.840> support

I<00:02:33.590> was<00:02:34.590> still<00:02:34.800> lucky<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.160> take<00:02:35.370> out<00:02:35.520> as

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
I was still lucky to take out as

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.490 
I was still lucky to take out as
cataphract<00:02:36.150> because<00:02:36.540> they<00:02:36.690> are<00:02:36.780> quite<00:02:37.020> strong

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.510 

but<00:02:40.500> um<00:02:41.370> Bismarck<00:02:41.880> chose<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> smart<00:02:42.540> army<00:02:42.930> here

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
but um Bismarck chose a smart army here

if you take an army like this and you

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.160 
if you take an army like this and you
can<00:02:46.260> get<00:02:46.560> their<00:02:46.860> infantry<00:02:47.400> fixed<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:49.140> you

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
that it would have worked but it kept

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.570 
that it would have worked but it kept
crashing<00:05:50.630> but<00:05:51.410> in<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.590> tubers<00:05:51.889> to<00:05:52.130> battle<00:05:52.490> it

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
crashing but in the tubers to battle it

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.700 
crashing but in the tubers to battle it
was<00:05:53.290> it<00:05:54.290> was<00:05:54.530> myself<00:05:55.900> Angelo's<00:05:56.900> and<00:05:57.230> risk<00:05:57.560> is

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
was it was myself Angelo's and risk is

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.800

the<00:05:57.860> Macedonian<00:05:58.610> and<00:05:58.790> Bismarck<00:05:59.330> and<00:05:59.570> would

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
the Macedonian and Bismarck and would

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.129 
the Macedonian and Bismarck and would
have<00:05:59.900> loved<00:06:00.110> to<00:06:00.200> have<00:06:00.290> had<00:06:00.470> that<00:06:00.530> game<00:06:02.139> great

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
have loved to have had that game great

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.470 
have loved to have had that game great
what<00:06:03.380> a<00:06:03.410> great<00:06:04.250> group<00:06:04.520> of<00:06:04.669> honorable<00:06:05.240> players

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
what a great group of honorable players

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.200 
what a great group of honorable players
their<00:06:06.220> course<00:06:07.220> and<00:06:07.340> risk<00:06:07.639> is<00:06:07.790> I've<00:06:07.970> played

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
their course and risk is I've played

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.070 
their course and risk is I've played
before<00:06:08.389> and<00:06:08.810> he<00:06:09.580> thoroughly<00:06:10.580> defeated<00:06:10.910> me<00:06:11.389> so

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
before and he thoroughly defeated me so

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.570 
before and he thoroughly defeated me so
it<00:06:12.320> would<00:06:12.440> have<00:06:12.470> been<00:06:12.590> a<00:06:12.680> tough<00:06:12.889> battle<00:06:13.160> for<00:06:13.460> me

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
it would have been a tough battle for me

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.730 
it would have been a tough battle for me
one<00:06:13.790> can<00:06:13.940> argue<00:06:14.090> that<00:06:14.570> it<00:06:14.750> is<00:06:14.780> not<00:06:15.080> both<00:06:15.380> well

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
one can argue that it is not both well

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.440 
one can argue that it is not both well
so<00:06:15.979> that's<00:06:16.100> the<00:06:16.250> end<00:06:16.370> of<00:06:16.460> the<00:06:16.550> battle<00:06:16.729> burhan

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
so that's the end of the battle burhan

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.410 
so that's the end of the battle burhan
let's<00:06:17.840> take<00:06:18.169> a<00:06:18.200> look<00:06:18.410> at<00:06:18.500> the<00:06:18.590> results

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.230 

you<00:06:21.690> can<00:06:21.810> see<00:06:21.990> I<00:06:22.020> had<00:06:22.550> 1375<00:06:23.550> kills<00:06:23.880> and<00:06:24.150> my

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.370 
you can see I had 1375 kills and my
opponent<00:06:24.690> Napoleon<00:06:25.290> for<00:06:25.560> had<00:06:25.940> 488<00:06:26.940> killed

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380
