00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
back on the attack but when it comes to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.640 
back on the attack but when it comes to
as<00:01:36.329> defending<00:01:36.810> he<00:01:36.840> has<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> decent<00:01:37.290> slide

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
as defending he has a decent slide

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.620 
as defending he has a decent slide
tackle<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> standard<00:01:38.759> apple<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.240> alright

tackle and the standard apple is alright

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.960 
tackle and the standard apple is alright
as<00:01:39.780> well<00:01:40.020> with<00:01:40.170> figures<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.619> 76<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.549> 78

as well with figures of 76 and 78

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.539 
as well with figures of 76 and 78
respectively<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.380> potentially<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.340> a

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
respectively so we potentially have a

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.789 
respectively so we potentially have a
very<00:01:44.939> solid<00:01:45.180> center<00:01:45.600> back<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.780> him<00:01:46.079> or<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> one

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
very solid center back in him or the one

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.010 
very solid center back in him or the one
down<00:01:47.040> form<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.729> might<00:01:48.030> come<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.450> against

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
down form that you might come up against

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.990 
down form that you might come up against
is<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.200> fact<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.649> he's<00:01:49.860> from<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> mexican

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
is the fact that he's from the mexican

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.960 
is the fact that he's from the mexican
league<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.500> basically<00:01:52.500> unless<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.759> build

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
league so basically unless you can build

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.690 
league so basically unless you can build
a<00:01:54.060> decent<00:01:54.270> hybrid<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.290> you're<00:01:55.890> mainly<00:01:56.399> gonna

he's<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> doll<00:03:02.310> for<00:03:02.489> me<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.970> he's<00:03:03.540> got<00:03:03.689> a<00:03:03.750> decent

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
he's a doll for me and he's got a decent

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.140 
he's a doll for me and he's got a decent

pace and boys defending the kind of

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.479 
pace and boys defending the kind of
average<00:03:06.389> his<00:03:07.109> slide<00:03:07.409> tackle<00:03:07.829> does<00:03:08.040> bring<00:03:08.340> that

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
average his slide tackle does bring that

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.849 
average his slide tackle does bring that
figure<00:03:08.819> down<00:03:09.030> by<00:03:09.269> a<00:03:09.299> lot<00:03:09.659> though<00:03:09.900> if<00:03:10.169> you<00:03:10.379> boy

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
figure down by a lot though if you boy

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.440 
figure down by a lot though if you boy
if<00:03:10.919> you're<00:03:11.099> a<00:03:11.129> player<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:11.459> me<00:03:11.909> then<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.329> won't

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
if you're a player like me then I won't

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.449 
if you're a player like me then I won't
matter<00:03:12.689> too<00:03:12.959> much<00:03:12.989> because<00:03:13.409> I<00:03:13.829> used<00:03:14.340> a

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
matter too much because I used a

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.949 
matter too much because I used a
standing<00:03:14.819> tackle<00:03:14.970> ninety<00:03:15.449> percent<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.840> the

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
standing tackle ninety percent of the

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.379 
standing tackle ninety percent of the
time<00:03:16.169> so<00:03:16.620> his<00:03:17.280> sliding<00:03:17.699> tackle<00:03:18.030> won't<00:03:18.180> really

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
time so his sliding tackle won't really

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.360 
time so his sliding tackle won't really
be<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.930> much<00:03:19.109> of<00:03:19.169> a<00:03:19.379> problem<00:03:19.650> for<00:03:20.010> me<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
be that much of a problem for me and

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.069 
be that much of a problem for me and
that's<00:03:20.669> why<00:03:20.879> I<00:03:20.909> think<00:03:21.000> he<00:03:21.269> will<00:03:21.389> be<00:03:21.479> okay<00:03:21.810> also

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
that's why I think he will be okay also

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.740 
that's why I think he will be okay also
he<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.590> six<00:03:22.889> foot<00:03:23.069> three<00:03:23.129> and<00:03:23.549> has<00:03:23.970> 90<00:03:24.419> strength

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
he is six foot three and has 90 strength

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.270 
he is six foot three and has 90 strength
so<00:03:24.930> we<00:03:25.019> should<00:03:25.229> be<00:03:25.379> like<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.560> brick<00:03:25.889> wall<00:03:26.069> in

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
so we should be like a brick wall in

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.699 
so we should be like a brick wall in
theory<00:03:26.549> boys<00:03:26.879> be<00:03:27.239> four<00:03:27.449> so<00:03:27.599> who<00:03:27.840> knows<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.379> have

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
theory boys be four so who knows I have

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.469 
theory boys be four so who knows I have
to<00:03:28.829> try<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.099> win<00:03:29.190> game<00:03:29.459> releases<00:03:29.879> and<00:03:30.209> see<00:03:30.389> if

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
to try and win game releases and see if

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.330 
to try and win game releases and see if
my<00:03:30.629> halter<00:03:30.959> fulfilled<00:03:31.379> and<00:03:31.590> if<00:03:31.979> not<00:03:32.159> I'll<00:03:32.310> be

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
my halter fulfilled and if not I'll be

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.830 
my halter fulfilled and if not I'll be
pretty<00:03:32.579> pissed<00:03:32.819> because<00:03:33.060> he<00:03:33.269> was<00:03:33.389> an<00:03:33.449> absolute

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
pretty pissed because he was an absolute

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.319 
pretty pissed because he was an absolute

think you'll be a real solid CDM to be
honest<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.520> both<00:05:09.390> from<00:05:09.570> fifa<00:05:10.200> 13<00:05:10.229> to<00:05:10.919> fifa<00:05:11.250> 14

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
honest and both from fifa 13 to fifa 14

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.159 
honest and both from fifa 13 to fifa 14
he's<00:05:11.790> had<00:05:11.940> an<00:05:12.060> increase<00:05:12.450> of<00:05:12.479> one<00:05:12.810> in<00:05:12.960> peace

he's had an increase of one in peace

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.890 
he's had an increase of one in peace
plus<00:05:13.889> five<00:05:14.160> in<00:05:14.340> terms<00:05:14.550> of<00:05:14.700> shooting<00:05:15.090> his

passengers<00:05:16.410> remain<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.890> same<00:05:17.070> his<00:05:17.310> dribbling

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
passengers remain the same his dribbling

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.210 
passengers remain the same his dribbling
has<00:05:17.940> gone<00:05:18.120> off<00:05:18.240> massively<00:05:18.900> by<00:05:19.169> 15<00:05:19.710> his

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
has gone off massively by 15 his

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.980 
has gone off massively by 15 his
defendant<00:05:20.729> has<00:05:20.850> gone<00:05:21.030> down<00:05:21.240> by<00:05:21.419> one<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:21.870> his

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
defendant has gone down by one and his

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.560 
defendant has gone down by one and his
head<00:05:22.200> in<00:05:22.320> his<00:05:22.350> decrease<00:05:22.979> by<00:05:23.190> two<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:23.880> to<00:05:24.479> be

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
head in his decrease by two and to be

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.300 
head in his decrease by two and to be
honest<00:05:24.810> I<00:05:25.050> think<00:05:25.290> the<00:05:25.380> massive<00:05:25.710> decreasing<00:05:26.220> is

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
honest I think the massive decreasing is

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.010 
honest I think the massive decreasing is
written<00:05:26.610> is<00:05:26.820> due<00:05:27.030> to<00:05:27.180> his<00:05:27.300> position<00:05:27.479> change

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
written is due to his position change

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.440 
written is due to his position change
and<00:05:28.289> because<00:05:29.190> he's<00:05:29.370> still<00:05:29.640> got<00:05:29.789> a<00:05:29.820> defendant

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
and because he's still got a defendant

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.750 
and because he's still got a defendant
in<00:05:30.630> terms<00:05:30.900> of<00:05:31.020> his<00:05:31.140> stats<00:05:31.440> but<00:05:32.220> it<00:05:32.370> isn't

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
in terms of his stats but it isn't

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.430 
in terms of his stats but it isn't
really<00:05:32.789> that<00:05:33.419> great<00:05:33.690> in<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:33.900> key<00:05:34.110> areas<00:05:34.410> that

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
really that great in the key areas that

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.740 
really that great in the key areas that
you<00:05:34.620> need<00:05:34.770> for<00:05:35.010> it<00:05:35.160> for<00:05:35.490> a<00:05:35.550> seat<00:05:35.820> per<00:05:36.180> centum<00:05:36.570> it

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
you need for it for a seat per centum it

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.719 
you need for it for a seat per centum it
to<00:05:36.900> be<00:05:37.020> honest<00:05:37.320> and<00:05:37.530> because<00:05:38.310> looking<00:05:38.640> a

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
to be honest and because looking a

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.400 
to be honest and because looking a
started<00:05:39.240> sliding<00:05:39.690> tackle<00:05:39.960> and<00:05:40.080> standing

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
started sliding tackle and standing

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.230 
started sliding tackle and standing
tackle<00:05:40.560> was<00:05:40.800> still<00:05:41.010> decent<00:05:41.280> and<00:05:41.640> he's<00:05:42.060> got<00:05:42.210> a

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
tackle was still decent and he's got a

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.730 
tackle was still decent and he's got a
great<00:05:42.450> strength<00:05:42.810> and<00:05:42.930> pace<00:05:43.169> so<00:05:43.410> I<00:05:43.440> think

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
great strength and pace so I think

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.290 
great strength and pace so I think
you'll<00:05:43.890> do<00:05:44.070> well<00:05:44.310> in<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:44.580> holding<00:05:44.850> midfield

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
you'll do well in the holding midfield

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.860 
you'll do well in the holding midfield
road<00:05:45.539> go<00:05:46.250> and<00:05:47.250> he's<00:05:47.520> six<00:05:47.910> foot<00:05:48.150> two<00:05:48.450> as<00:05:48.630> well

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
road go and he's six foot two as well

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.330 
road go and he's six foot two as well
with<00:05:49.080> these<00:05:49.289> in<00:05:49.470> jumping<00:05:49.830> so<00:05:49.979> we<00:05:50.039> should<00:05:50.190> be

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
with these in jumping so we should be

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.279 
with these in jumping so we should be
able<00:05:50.370> to<00:05:50.729> win<00:05:50.850> most<00:05:51.090> battles<00:05:51.450> in<00:05:51.539> the<00:05:51.570> air<00:05:51.810> but
