00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 and nice guys I'm the gunner a 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.870
 fast video to see what it is 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.960
 changed in the day at least see 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.080
 all new update vehicles 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.299
 robberies and let's see what together 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.010
 it's new 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.289
 then we are here to look first 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.170
 legendary motor sport that I don't have 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:27.380
 looked good at the new cars they were 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:31.949
 maybe ready for the update 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.320
 no I do n't remember this cameron 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.370
 maybe it's part of the update 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.010
 honestly I don't remember for strange 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.989
 because it should appear above written 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.870
 part of the update so i guess 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:50.059
 that there is no supercar here 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.059
 new no it doesn't seem like anything new 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.079
 OK nothing 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.590
 instead with regard to vehicles from 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.120
 war beyond the various trucks and maybe even 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.399
 there was a war helicopter 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.500
 even the fighter I saw the picture of 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.490
 hunting, so maybe we have it 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.360
 layout 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.320
 here I see something new not there is not 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.330
 the football here maybe and in the air zone 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.799
 let's see if there's anything in the bar area 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.400
 that then the kraken only changed a little 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.400
 the order 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.630
 no no even here nothing we see in 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.700
 planes 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.079
 let's see if there's a helicopter hunt 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:42.899
 from war but this was already there was 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.850
 already this we arrange ourselves perhaps 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.009
 I don't remember if they were there too 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.880
 why not there is no trace yet 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.880
 there is no hunting 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.080
 a great pity unless it has yet to 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.390
 the bancor arrive but I don't think we see 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.920
 here there should be here in fact part 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.400
 from updating new vehicle shots 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.229
 I think they will be most here with 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.229
 a beast at $ 375,000 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:19.840

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.560
 bought on purpose to make shots 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.959
 a very fast car among other things 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.959
 it costs 200 thousand in the legendary motor sports 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.269

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.769
