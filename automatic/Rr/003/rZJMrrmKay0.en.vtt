 [Music] 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:42.570
 and 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:43.600
 [Music] 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:58.100
 [Applause] 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:58.100
 [Music] 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.820
 for what do you think we make a 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.590
 operation a little more complicated how about 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.780
 a multiplication you want to help me with 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.939
 some numbers to be able to do the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.939
 operation a difficult number I love 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:20.950
 32 by 32 by 14 excellent let's see 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.540
 this operation and look at the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.310
 carpet let's use it as I came 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.340
 using the but a little differently so 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:40.530
 that attentive guys 32 very attentive 32 62 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:40.530
 by any other number 14 we have 12 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.890
 they watch guys and 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:54.730
 44 we are putting the pieces together 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:56.830
 14 32 x 14 and remember what are the 32 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.920
 and 14 is that they are in multiplication 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.430
 are the vectors and the result is 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.380
 product that well the factors are 32 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.450
 and 4 and 14 and the result of 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.540
 product will be the product well this is going to 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.070
 be the product or the result now 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.070
 important guys who realize and 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.680
 look here that this unit that is in 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.830
 the corner if we live them that unit goes 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.670
 to be shared by both factor 32 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:32.410
 by factor 14 and is shared by both 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.630
 let's see if this 32 is very important 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.060
 and on the 14th have this unit that 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.010
 share for both factors now 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.180
 they want to start multiplying 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.769
 an excellent multiply look we have 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.769
 1 for 1 1 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:57.680
 we follow 1 for 1 1 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.170
 one by one 1 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.520
 one for ten 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.520
 1 for 10 days 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.409
 10 x 1 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:19.090
 ten for one or another bills 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:24.519
 we continue to build 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.519
 10 x 16 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.800
 10 x 10 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.270
 look guys 10 for 10 to 100 and we're going to 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.420
 use this hundred in this space 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.610
 a piece of one that is true of the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.580
 colors that you like now we continue with 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.580
 the multiplication we made 10 x 1 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:58.150
 ten for one or another 10 we are putting together 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.150
 multiplication 10 by 1 10 by 1 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.640
 10 for 10 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:17.770
 we have 110 for one or another 10 very 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:17.770
 good 10 for 12 10 for 1 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:27.410
 and finally 10 x 10 x 10 well very well 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.410
 hans you are learning broad good you 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:35.150
 yes and look at this is the result of all 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.100
 the operation of 32 by 14 we have this 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.160
 kind of rectangle that together with all 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.940
 the units that are the result of that 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.430
 multiplication 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.570
 now we have hans that separate these 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.990
 records 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.290
 as we have done before in units 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.910
 tens and hundreds and we place them 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.160
 exactly as we did from the 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:00.770
 we start separating on our carpet 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:04.310
 positional units tens and hundreds 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.860
 let's locate them come guys the 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.759
 we have separated the hundreds the tens 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.780
 and the units and we start with the 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:24.300
 units 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:27.540
 we add hans 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 8 8 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.850
 units like the cake and we have the 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.850
 tens 1 2 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:43.110
 Four. Five 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:47.400
 7 8 9 and 10 these ten we converted 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.700
 hans in one and that this piece as 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.700
 call 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.199
 this piece is the hundred could dozens 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.439
 the color edition is one hundred 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:07.520
 green then the result of our 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:18.879
 operation is added here 1 2 3 4 400 200 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:22.639
 10 20 30 40 how much and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 48 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:26.780
 448 then what were the two numbers 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:34.280
 that we had multiplied hans 32 by 14 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:35.690
 very good guys 32 by 14 is 448 88 and 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.260
 we are learning to multiply 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:42.209
 very simple very well 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.209
