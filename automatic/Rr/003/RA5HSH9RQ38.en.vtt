00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
the dawn guard castle afterwards and you

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.870 
the dawn guard castle afterwards and you
can<00:02:46.090> actually<00:02:46.269> bring<00:02:46.840> her<00:02:47.049> to<00:02:47.200> phalion<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.790> she

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
can stop being a vampire and she'll

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.170 
can stop being a vampire and she'll
still<00:02:50.950> be<00:02:50.980> your<00:02:51.190> follower<00:02:51.519> but<00:02:51.790> she<00:02:51.940> won't<00:02:52.090> be

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180

a vampire anymore and I think that if
you<00:02:56.139> don't<00:02:56.560> have<00:02:56.799> her<00:02:56.920> as<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.069> follower<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.760> you

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
you don't have her as a follower and you

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.449 
you don't have her as a follower and you
did<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:59.709> didn't<00:03:00.010> go<00:03:00.100> with<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.280> dawn
