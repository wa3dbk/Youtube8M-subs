 decorate coarsely chop the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.809

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.809
 bain-marie the butter and chocolate 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.780
 while the chocolate melts 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:05.180
 we work the whole eggs with sugar 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.180
 until you get a compound habens pur 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.700
 now let's add the sifted cocoa 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.540
 we continue to work with the blender 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.540
 electric 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.880
 we have incorporated all the cocoa 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.880
 now we add the melted chocolate 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.590
 with a wooden spoon we do 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.590
 absorb the chocolate to the mixture 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.240
 always making a movement that goes 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.240
 from top to bottom 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.240
 cover a 22 cm pan 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.060
 with baking paper 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.729
 if you have a zipper cake pan instead 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.060
 all the better, of course, buttered 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.370
 without adding flour this cake 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.250
 typical of paris in fact it is called 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:21.050
 also as a Parisian and in fact cake 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.050
 suitable for those who are intolerant to gluten 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.850
 pour the mixture into the cake pan 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.780
 now let's bake in a hot oven 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:42.000
 preheated to 180 degrees for about 25 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.190
 minutes after 25 minutes of cooking 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.300
 the chocolate cake without flour is 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.310
 ready 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.100
 obviously we wait for it to be cold 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.080
 before you can take it out of the pan 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.690
 then with the cream we mentioned in 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.960
