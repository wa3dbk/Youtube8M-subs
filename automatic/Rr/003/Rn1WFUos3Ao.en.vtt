00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.969
 a two kids today I bring you as I have 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:11.930
 could see in the title a theme of 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.830
 windows com 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.700
 8 for android anyone who sees this to 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.160
 simple view can think that it is 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.160
 that this mobile has a windows system 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.390
 phone instead of network but good as 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.230
 said is not like that 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.230
 This application 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.470
 it's called launcher 8 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.890
 and what should we download here is 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.890
 gratuitous 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.480
 from the market 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:53.000
 emulates pretty well that a subject 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.089
 of windows phone as we can see no 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.220
 only the menu but also the 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.740
 unlocking 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.670
 here we have it and the top part 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.670
 exactly the same 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.310
 I will explain more or less on how 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.490
 base 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.619
 Not only 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.570
 you can have these icons you can also 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.810
 edit them where the menu 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.810
 edit 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.920
 holding down 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.820
 can 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.820
 and change it 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.930
 or someone can remove it 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.930
 as we like 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.020
 for example here as it is folders 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.659
 and several applications 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.909
 as well 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.640
 here is not in all applications 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.549
 is the option if you click here 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.960
 example and the letter to 6 a keyboard with 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.960
 all the cons the alphabet 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.860
 the jota of here the x and the z are not 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.060
 marked because I do not have any 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.630
 indication that begins with that letter 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.049
 but if for example you use the m that will go to 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.049
 The m 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.280
 we also put you 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:26.640
 give him friend 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.640
 and here we can put it in 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:36.380
 liz by gri and put it this way 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.210
 and not down all obligations 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.040
 and up here 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.969
 we have a search engine 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.969
 to search 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.530
 I think we have a search engine 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.530
 to search 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.630
 we have 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.570
 so nothing this is the subject 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.590
 windows 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.629
 They are 8 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.430
 it's pretty good indeed I have 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.159
 left and good 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.659
 see you in the next one and upload more 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.659
 topics until then
