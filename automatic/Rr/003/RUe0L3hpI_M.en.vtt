in<00:01:34.090> this<00:01:34.270> game<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.630> we<00:01:34.720> solve<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.320> Eiffel

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
in this game and we solve the Eiffel

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.070 
in this game and we solve the Eiffel
Tower<00:01:35.890> but<00:01:36.429> there<00:01:36.550> was<00:01:36.670> something<00:01:37.080> really

with<00:02:32.079> swords<00:02:32.380> with<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:32.799> time<00:02:33.010> you'd<00:02:33.190> be<00:02:33.280> able

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
with swords with this time you'd be able

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.180 
with swords with this time you'd be able
to<00:02:33.459> hear<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.790> rumbling<00:02:34.239> of<00:02:34.329> a<00:02:34.420> tank<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:36.070> would

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
to hear the rumbling of a tank you would

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.920 
to hear the rumbling of a tank you would
see<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.579> debris<00:02:36.730> shuffling<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.630> then<00:02:37.780> you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
see the debris shuffling and then you

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.110 
see the debris shuffling and then you
would<00:02:38.079> have<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.290> take<00:02:38.680> cover<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.090> just

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
would have to take cover and I just

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.310 
would have to take cover and I just
think<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:40.570> would<00:02:40.720> be<00:02:40.840> asked<00:02:40.989> me<00:02:41.170> would<00:02:41.260> be

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
think that would be asked me would be

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.229 
think that would be asked me would be
reminiscent<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.010> saving<00:02:42.549> private<00:02:42.700> ryan<00:02:43.060> you

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
reminiscent of saving private ryan you

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.020 
reminiscent of saving private ryan you
really<00:02:43.269> couldn't<00:02:44.079> go<00:02:44.829> up<00:02:44.950> against<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.609> tank<00:02:45.880> you

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
really couldn't go up against a tank you

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.000 
really couldn't go up against a tank you
