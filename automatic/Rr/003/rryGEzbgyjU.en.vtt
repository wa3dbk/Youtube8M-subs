a chin then rolling across the road roll
it<00:00:09.179> up<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.480> way<00:00:09.690> here<00:00:09.990> where<00:00:10.620> we've<00:00:10.740> got<00:00:10.769> a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
it up this way here where we've got a

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.009 
it up this way here where we've got a
platform<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.030> platform<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.690> actually<00:00:12.809> a

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
platform and that platform is actually a

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.860 
platform and that platform is actually a
lift<00:00:13.320> it's<00:00:13.860> operated<00:00:14.400> by<00:00:14.549> water<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.480> then<00:00:15.690> they

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
lift it's operated by water so then they

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.599 
lift it's operated by water so then they
just<00:00:16.170> use<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.470> open<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.890> handle<00:00:17.160> at<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.369> top

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
just use the open the handle at the top

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.310 
just use the open the handle at the top
where<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> pump<00:00:18.180> water<00:00:18.330> up<00:00:18.630> pump<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.960> lift<00:00:19.140> up

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
where the pump water up pump the lift up

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.929 
where the pump water up pump the lift up
and<00:00:19.710> roll<00:00:20.010> them<00:00:20.189> into<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> steel<00:00:20.609> house<00:00:20.789> to

it<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> sampling<00:00:59.309> point<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.699> enables<00:01:00.210> us<00:01:00.300> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
it is a sampling point it enables us to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.520 
it is a sampling point it enables us to
check<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.930> we're<00:01:01.050> doing<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.350> correct

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
check that what we're doing is correct

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.770 
check that what we're doing is correct
when<00:01:01.890> you're<00:01:02.039> testing<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> sample<00:01:03.090> what

you're looking for the building blocks
of<00:01:05.129> magnitude<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.850> you're<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> citrus<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
of magnitude so you're the citrus of

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.600 
of magnitude so you're the citrus of

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.740 
actually light of the water so in the
initial<00:01:32.460> part<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> process<00:01:33.090> they<00:01:33.509> suck<00:01:33.720> in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
initial part the process they suck in

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.630 
initial part the process they suck in
alcohol<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.130> when<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.430> add<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
alcohol so that all when we add the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.520 
alcohol so that all when we add the
water<00:01:35.790> they<00:01:36.060> float<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.869> then<00:01:37.200> basically

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
water they float and then basically

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.050 
water they float and then basically
whence<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> water<00:01:38.130> replaces<00:01:38.610> some<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
whence the water replaces some of the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.780 
whence the water replaces some of the
alcohol<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:39.659> sink<00:01:39.900> down<00:01:39.960> at<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> bottom<00:01:40.790> no

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
alcohol they sink down at the bottom no

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.609 
alcohol they sink down at the bottom no

keeps going for another two hundred

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.020 
keeps going for another two hundred
years<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.280> only<00:01:59.340> way<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> achieve<00:02:00.000> that

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
