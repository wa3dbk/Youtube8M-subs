00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 the wind 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.650
 or not 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.389
 pay close attention to number 3 because 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.250
 we have this guy with the trolls that 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.200
 so much do sad rc colors that so much 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.019
 I like them here, see how you try to launch it 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.920
 and then it gets in the middle and does not let it 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.110
 Obviously when he spends time with 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.939
 he rcx then they end up exploding and 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.840
 as you can not end up with a big 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.840
 explosion and killing the ally himself 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.840
 let's have 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.690
 and in number 2 we have this guy 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.340
 that is going to make a ninja but they are already a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.960
 little curious you will see now how it goes up 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.300
 on top of the bomb and it's going to be 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.860
 plant it and you see how the one who shoots it 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.629
 gives you a couple of gil marquez but no 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.070
 comes to kill him and I thought 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.020
 because it was this and you're going now 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.430
 end is because I'm in football and here 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.260
 you see how you can give a lot of 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.699
 turns and the bullets do not reach him and miss 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.699
 find the game and deactivate the bomb 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.510
 and live 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.490
 and point 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.970
 this is one more 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.959
