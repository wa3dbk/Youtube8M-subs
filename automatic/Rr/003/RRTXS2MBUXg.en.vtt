00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.090
 the earth the cradle of the human race 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:14.630
 a species very similar to ours 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.630
 capable of great compassion 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.080
 and of great violence 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.360
 in our eagerness to protect the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.410
 humans emerged a further revelation 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.020
 deep our worlds had already 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.480
 found 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.730
 during the last two years a team 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.270
 Advanced of new autobots has been 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.510
 sheltered under my orders a team of 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.300
 secret attack called nest seeks what 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.280
 it remains of our enemies the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.030
 decepticons that are hidden in different 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.670
 countries of the world 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.609
 you did not give me a day 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.460
 not a day in college I'm sorry 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.589
 but they stole the last fragment of the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.170
 supreme spark would be stolen by 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.590
 decepticons we leave it under protection 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.630
 human at the request of your government 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.490
 I have come port helped sham 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.530
 because your leaders believe that we brought 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.659
 revenge on your planet maybe so be it 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.049
 that's why another human should remind them of the 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.770
 trust that we share this is not my 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.920
 war to one 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.079
 but I fear that very soon it will be your 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.020
 world must not have the same destiny that 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.680
 sainz strong 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.770
 generations were lost 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.010
 our races united by a history 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.440
 long forgotten and a future that 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.740
 we will face together 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.530
 I am optimus prime and sent this 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.430
 message so that our pasts are 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:59.900
 remembered since in those memories 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.900
 we will continue living autobots advances
