all the supports in the middle to weld
it<00:00:53.019> together<00:00:53.110> and<00:00:53.470> then<00:00:53.559> I<00:00:53.589> put<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.739> next<00:00:53.979> part

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
it together and then I put the next part

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.579 
it together and then I put the next part
of<00:00:54.190> G<00:00:54.369> go<00:00:54.489> on<00:00:54.549> and<00:00:54.670> went<00:00:54.850> up<00:00:54.940> again<00:00:55.409> from<00:00:56.409> that
