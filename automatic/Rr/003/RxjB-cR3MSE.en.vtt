talking about the rules of composition
let's<00:01:26.490> talk<00:01:26.670> about<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.030> first<00:01:27.180> rule<00:01:27.479> of

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
let's talk about the first rule of

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.210 
let's talk about the first rule of
composition<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.410> rule<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.710> thirds

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
composition the rule of thirds

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.700 
composition the rule of thirds
the<00:01:29.729> rule<00:01:29.940> of<00:01:29.970> thirds<00:01:30.270> states<00:01:30.660> that<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.170> you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the rule of thirds states that if you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.320 
the rule of thirds states that if you
were<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.010> divide<00:01:32.190> your<00:01:32.460> frame<00:01:32.790> with<00:01:33.300> two

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
were to divide your frame with two

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.840 
were to divide your frame with two
horizontal<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.290> two<00:01:34.320> vertical<00:01:34.619> lines<00:01:35.310> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
horizontal and two vertical lines and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.120 
horizontal and two vertical lines and
place<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.690> most<00:01:36.869> interesting<00:01:37.560> component<00:01:38.040> of

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
place the most interesting component of

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.070 
place the most interesting component of
your<00:01:38.280> image<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.210> intersection<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.930> these

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
your image at the intersection of these

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.050 
your image at the intersection of these
lines<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:41.040> would<00:01:41.190> have<00:01:41.369> achieved<00:01:41.490> rule<00:01:41.910> of

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
lines you would have achieved rule of

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.030 
lines you would have achieved rule of
thirds<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:43.020> understand<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> rule<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.890> thirds

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
thirds to understand the rule of thirds

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.070 
thirds to understand the rule of thirds
better<00:01:44.340> let's<00:01:44.910> look<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.240> these<00:01:45.360> images<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
better let's look at these images on the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.380 
better let's look at these images on the
screen<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.979> will<00:01:47.100> see<00:01:47.160> that<00:01:47.550> both<00:01:48.149> these

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
screen you will see that both these

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.230 
screen you will see that both these
images<00:01:48.780> fulfill<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> rule<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.590> thirds

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
images fulfill the rule of thirds

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.999 
images fulfill the rule of thirds
another<00:01:51.240> rule<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.479> composition<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.320> balancing

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
another rule of composition is balancing

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.460 
another rule of composition is balancing
elements<00:01:53.479> balancing<00:01:54.479> elements<00:01:54.990> deals<00:01:55.229> with

elements balancing elements deals with

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.710 
elements balancing elements deals with
the<00:01:55.649> visual<00:01:56.580> weight<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.090> image<00:01:57.420> to

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
the visual weight of the image to

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.420 
the visual weight of the image to
understand<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.259> rule<00:01:58.470> better<00:01:58.710> let's<00:01:59.250> look

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
understand this rule better let's look

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.150 
understand this rule better let's look
at<00:01:59.550> a<00:01:59.580> few<00:01:59.759> examples<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.200> first<00:02:01.500> image<00:02:01.710> you

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
at a few examples in the first image you

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.650 
at a few examples in the first image you
see<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> camel<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:02.940> foreground<00:02:03.420> is

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
see the camel in the foreground is

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.870 
see the camel in the foreground is
balanced<00:02:04.530> by<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:04.979> group<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.369> people<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
balanced by the group of people in the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.940 
balanced by the group of people in the
background<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.899> does<00:02:07.110> not<00:02:07.259> make<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.649> image

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
background this does not make the image

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.800 
background this does not make the image
look<00:02:08.130> tilted<00:02:08.580> towards<00:02:08.850> one<00:02:09.060> side<00:02:09.299> in<00:02:09.510> the

understand this better in the first
image<00:02:37.110> we<00:02:37.320> see<00:02:37.530> how<00:02:37.799> we<00:02:37.860> have<00:02:38.130> used<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:39.030> arch

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
image we see how we have used the arch

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.050 
image we see how we have used the arch
of<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.630> doorway<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.230> encapsulate<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.580> frame<00:02:42.030> a

monument in the second image you will
see<00:02:43.920> how<00:02:44.220> we've<00:02:44.400> used<00:02:44.430> different<00:02:44.880> elements<00:02:45.480> to

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
see how we've used different elements to

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.810

change the perspective of an image like

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.210 
change the perspective of an image like
if<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.690> were<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.990> take<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.230> picture<00:03:31.710> of<00:03:31.830> a<00:03:31.950> child

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
if you were to take a picture of a child

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.760 
if you were to take a picture of a child
playing<00:03:32.550> from<00:03:33.120> up<00:03:33.300> here<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:34.170> will<00:03:34.320> probably

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
playing from up here you will probably

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.370 
playing from up here you will probably
draw<00:03:35.010> off<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.130> child<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.660> was<00:03:36.780> advisable

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
draw off the child so it was advisable

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.110 
draw off the child so it was advisable
to<00:03:37.590> go<00:03:37.740> down<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.280> eye<00:03:38.310> level<00:03:38.610> of<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.940> child

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
to go down to the eye level of the child

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.450 
to go down to the eye level of the child
and<00:03:39.360> then<00:03:39.480> take<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.720> picture<00:03:40.140> in<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:41.220> first

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
and then take a picture in the first

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.340 
and then take a picture in the first
image<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.820> see<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.270> we've<00:03:42.450> chosen<00:03:42.690> to

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
image you see that we've chosen to

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.200 
image you see that we've chosen to
actually<00:03:43.800> go<00:03:43.950> sit<00:03:44.220> down<00:03:44.460> on<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.760> ground<00:03:44.970> and

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
actually go sit down on the ground and

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.880 
actually go sit down on the ground and
take<00:03:45.630> this<00:03:45.780> image<00:03:46.020> from<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.440> very<00:03:46.680> low

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
take this image from a very low

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.660 
take this image from a very low
perspective

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
perspective

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.310

this<00:03:48.120> gives<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.600> Monument<00:03:49.110> a

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
this gives the Monument a

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.590 
this gives the Monument a
larger-than-life<00:03:49.980> feel<00:03:50.550> talking<00:03:51.390> about

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
larger-than-life feel talking about

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.390 
larger-than-life feel talking about
another<00:03:51.810> rule<00:03:52.050> of<00:03:52.200> composition<00:03:52.830> into<00:03:53.310> the

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
frame into the frame talks about leaving

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.670 
frame into the frame talks about leaving

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
positive space in the direction in which

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.070 
positive space in the direction in which
your<00:03:59.310> subject<00:03:59.700> is<00:03:59.820> either<00:04:00.060> looking<00:04:00.390> or<00:04:00.600> moving

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
your subject is either looking or moving

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.920 
your subject is either looking or moving
if<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:02.400> look<00:04:02.550> at<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.760> first<00:04:03.000> image<00:04:03.390> we<00:04:03.750> have<00:04:03.900> a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
if you look at the first image we have a

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.660 
if you look at the first image we have a
man<00:04:04.200> which<00:04:04.530> is<00:04:04.680> looking<00:04:05.010> towards<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.400> right

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
man which is looking towards the right

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.720 
man which is looking towards the right
and<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.570> we<00:04:07.020> have<00:04:07.230> left<00:04:07.500> positive<00:04:08.250> spades<00:04:08.520> on

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
and so we have left positive spades on

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.390 
and so we have left positive spades on
the<00:04:09.030> right<00:04:09.240> side<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.720> image<00:04:09.840> if<00:04:10.200> we<00:04:11.190> go<00:04:11.340> to

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
the right side of the image if we go to
