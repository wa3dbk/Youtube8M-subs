00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
much what we're gonna do is we're going

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.850 
much what we're gonna do is we're going
to<00:04:32.280> put<00:04:32.460> some<00:04:32.669> of<00:04:32.700> these<00:04:32.850> little<00:04:33.090> disks<00:04:33.900> into

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
to put some of these little disks into

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.400 
to put some of these little disks into
this<00:04:35.160> container<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.970> then<00:04:36.810> these<00:04:37.200> are

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
this container and then these are

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.230 
this container and then these are
paramount<00:04:37.890> crystals<00:04:38.430> we'll<00:04:38.760> put<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.000> little

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
paramount crystals we'll put a little

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.570 
paramount crystals we'll put a little
bit<00:04:39.419> of<00:04:39.570> these<00:04:39.720> in<00:04:39.930> there<00:04:40.430> basically<00:04:41.430> what

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
bit of these in there basically what

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.279 
bit of these in there basically what
that<00:04:41.610> does<00:04:41.910> is<00:04:42.090> it<00:04:42.210> makes<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:42.539> so<00:04:42.720> that<00:04:42.750> when<00:04:43.110> it

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
that does is it makes it so that when it

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.279 
that does is it makes it so that when it
melts<00:04:43.530> together<00:04:43.800> it<00:04:44.450> forms<00:04:45.450> back<00:04:45.990> together

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
melts together it forms back together

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.750 
melts together it forms back together
when<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:46.710> hardens<00:04:47.130> instead<00:04:47.460> of<00:04:47.550> becoming

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
when it hardens instead of becoming

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.550 
when it hardens instead of becoming
chunky<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.330> actually<00:04:48.630> stays<00:04:48.870> nice<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.320> smooth

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
chunky it actually stays nice and smooth

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.620 
chunky it actually stays nice and smooth
so<00:04:50.010> that's<00:04:50.729> what<00:04:50.850> we're<00:04:50.940> going<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.090> do<00:04:51.210> you
