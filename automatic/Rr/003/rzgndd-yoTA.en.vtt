player you just need to pick up the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.150 
player you just need to pick up the
controller<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.960> play<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.009> that's

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
controller and play it so and that's

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.339 
controller and play it so and that's
what<00:02:08.280> they<00:02:08.369> deliver<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.479> how<00:02:10.229> about

that

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.710 
that
they're<00:02:11.670> level<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.150> played<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.600> one

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
they're level that we played the one

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.840 
they're level that we played the one
with<00:02:12.870> more<00:02:13.020> sort<00:02:13.710> of<00:02:13.770> stealthy<00:02:14.220> approach<00:02:14.340> it

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
with more sort of stealthy approach it

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.610 
with more sort of stealthy approach it
looks<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.270> that's<00:02:15.630> that's<00:02:16.110> one<00:02:16.320> of<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.470> ones

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
crossbow and again builds the tension

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.860 
crossbow and again builds the tension
but<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.340> mean<00:02:56.490> if<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.910> set<00:02:57.090> off<00:02:57.209> an<00:02:57.360> alarm<00:02:57.450> if

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
but I mean if you set off an alarm if

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.900 
but I mean if you set off an alarm if
you<00:02:58.080> blow<00:02:58.770> something<00:02:59.100> up<00:02:59.190> then<00:02:59.430> it's<00:02:59.700> going<00:02:59.850> to

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
to really like big explosions and we've

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.040 
to really like big explosions and we've
shown<00:03:29.820> them<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:30.030> lot<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.269> big<00:03:30.390> explosions<00:03:30.900> and

trailers<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.620> think<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.400> think<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.760> fact<00:03:33.000> that

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
trailers I think I think the fact that

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.790 
trailers I think I think the fact that
we've<00:03:33.269> been<00:03:33.450> layering<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:33.959> those<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.650> that

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
we've been layering in those that that

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.380 
we've been layering in those that that
variety<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.310> gameplay<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.880> know<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.209> best

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
variety of gameplay you know the best

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.750 
variety of gameplay you know the best
stealth<00:03:36.600> stuff<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.489> know<00:03:38.610> that

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
stealth stuff and and that you know that

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.340 
stealth stuff and and that you know that
the<00:03:38.940> tension<00:03:39.570> sequence<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.080> like<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:40.290> the

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
the tension sequence is like in the

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.370 
the tension sequence is like in the
tunnel<00:03:40.709> that<00:03:41.430> we<00:03:41.760> showed<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.030> III<00:03:42.360> and<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.110> here

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
tunnel that we showed it III and in here

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.680 
tunnel that we showed it III and in here
Victor<00:03:43.709> Charlie<00:03:43.920> yeah<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:44.910> mean<00:03:45.030> those<00:03:45.540> are

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
intrigued about we don't want to spoil

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.770 
intrigued about we don't want to spoil
our<00:03:50.160> story<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.580> we're<00:03:50.970> being<00:03:51.180> very<00:03:51.300> careful

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
our story and we're being very careful

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.940 
our story and we're being very careful
and<00:03:51.900> selective<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.290> what<00:03:52.350> we're<00:03:52.590> showing<00:03:52.739> from

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
and selective of what we're showing from

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.310 
and selective of what we're showing from
the<00:03:53.070> campaign<00:03:53.400> because<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:54.030> but<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:55.050> sure

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
the campaign because of that but it sure

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.290 
the campaign because of that but it sure
does<00:03:55.590> leave<00:03:56.040> more<00:03:56.250> questions<00:03:56.640> than<00:03:56.820> answers<00:03:57.150> I

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
does leave more questions than answers I

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.449 
does leave more questions than answers I
think<00:03:57.540> that's<00:03:57.810> exactly<00:03:58.100> what<00:03:59.100> we<00:03:59.220> were<00:03:59.310> going

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
think that's exactly what we were going

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.759 
think that's exactly what we were going
