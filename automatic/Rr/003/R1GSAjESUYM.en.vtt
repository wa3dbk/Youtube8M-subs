00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
okay today let's talk about some

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.539 
okay today let's talk about some
homemade<00:00:10.870> plant<00:00:11.290> propagation<00:00:11.530> flies<00:00:12.250> in<00:00:12.520> a

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:12.549 
homemade plant propagation flies in a

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.580 
homemade plant propagation flies in a
lot<00:00:12.850> of<00:00:12.969> different<00:00:13.299> ways<00:00:13.450> that<00:00:13.780> you<00:00:14.320> things

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
lot of different ways that you things

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.770 
lot of different ways that you things
you<00:00:14.709> can<00:00:14.860> use<00:00:14.889> for<00:00:15.070> flats<00:00:15.580> but<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:16.420> other<00:00:16.570> day

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
you can use for flats but the other day

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.779 
you can use for flats but the other day
I<00:00:16.810> made<00:00:17.170> a<00:00:17.230> bunch<00:00:17.560> of<00:00:17.740> these<00:00:17.890> wooden<00:00:18.340> flowers

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
I made a bunch of these wooden flowers

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.240 
I made a bunch of these wooden flowers
just<00:00:19.510> because<00:00:20.080> it's<00:00:20.440> winter<00:00:20.680> time<00:00:20.800> we're

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
just because it's winter time we're

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.290 
just because it's winter time we're
going<00:00:21.400> to<00:00:21.460> use<00:00:21.550> them<00:00:21.670> for<00:00:21.699> our<00:00:21.910> hardwood

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
going to use them for our hardwood

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.210 
going to use them for our hardwood
cuttings<00:00:22.539> and<00:00:22.990> this<00:00:23.439> way<00:00:23.619> we<00:00:23.800> can<00:00:23.830> bring<00:00:24.130> them

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
cuttings and this way we can bring them

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.829 
cuttings and this way we can bring them
in<00:00:24.279> here<00:00:24.490> we'll<00:00:24.670> fill<00:00:24.910> them<00:00:25.000> with<00:00:25.060> like<00:00:25.810> a

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:25.839 
in here we'll fill them with like a

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.769 
in here we'll fill them with like a
p-type<00:00:26.800> potting<00:00:27.310> mix<00:00:27.580> we'll<00:00:28.269> keep<00:00:28.480> that

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
p-type potting mix we'll keep that

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.960 
p-type potting mix we'll keep that
somewhere<00:00:29.199> where<00:00:29.439> it's<00:00:29.560> not<00:00:29.619> frozen<00:00:30.099> right

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
somewhere where it's not frozen right

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.280 
somewhere where it's not frozen right
now<00:00:31.119> it's<00:00:31.300> kind<00:00:31.509> of<00:00:31.570> warm<00:00:31.779> I'll<00:00:31.929> but<00:00:32.140> that's

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
now it's kind of warm I'll but that's

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.200 
now it's kind of warm I'll but that's
going<00:00:32.439> to<00:00:32.500> change<00:00:32.590> and<00:00:33.430> then<00:00:33.579> we'll<00:00:33.730> pack<00:00:34.030> this

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
going to change and then we'll pack this

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.910 
going to change and then we'll pack this
stuff<00:00:34.329> in<00:00:34.600> here<00:00:34.750> so<00:00:34.810> anyway<00:00:35.230> I'll<00:00:35.650> give<00:00:35.829> you

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
stuff in here so anyway I'll give you

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.200 
stuff in here so anyway I'll give you
the<00:00:36.040> dimensions<00:00:36.220> of<00:00:36.670> this<00:00:36.760> thing<00:00:36.940> there's

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
the dimensions of this thing there's

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.880 
the dimensions of this thing there's
really<00:00:37.450> only<00:00:37.570> two<00:00:37.810> dimensions<00:00:38.440> that<00:00:38.620> you<00:00:38.710> need

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
really only two dimensions that you need

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.580 
really only two dimensions that you need
to<00:00:39.010> know<00:00:39.160> this<00:00:39.789> thing<00:00:40.059> is<00:00:40.120> put<00:00:40.840> this<00:00:41.050> into<00:00:41.379> the

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
to know this thing is put this into the

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.799 
to know this thing is put this into the
end<00:00:41.800> boards<00:00:42.280> or<00:00:42.489> 12<00:00:42.789> inches<00:00:43.180> I've<00:00:43.360> got<00:00:43.570> them<00:00:43.780> on

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
end boards or 12 inches I've got them on

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.200 
end boards or 12 inches I've got them on
the<00:00:44.050> inside<00:00:44.440> to<00:00:45.219> the<00:00:45.309> inside<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.699> the<00:00:45.789> flattest

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
the inside to the inside of the flattest

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.000 
the inside to the inside of the flattest
12<00:00:46.510> inches<00:00:46.809> and<00:00:47.020> then<00:00:47.140> this<00:00:47.800> long<00:00:48.550> board<00:00:49.030> is<00:00:49.270> 16

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
12 inches and then this long board is 16

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.250 
12 inches and then this long board is 16
so<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.190> inside<00:00:51.640> of<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.090> flat<00:00:52.359> is<00:00:52.570> about<00:00:52.780> 14

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
so the inside of the flat is about 14

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.590 
so the inside of the flat is about 14
and<00:00:53.289> a<00:00:53.469> half<00:00:53.500> and<00:00:54.039> then<00:00:54.699> these<00:00:54.879> boards<00:00:55.329> I<00:00:55.420> have

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
and a half and then these boards I have

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.160 
and a half and then these boards I have
out<00:00:56.019> of<00:00:56.199> our<00:00:56.350> 13<00:00:56.829> and<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.070> half<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:58.090> now<00:00:58.480> you<00:00:58.989> can

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
out of our 13 and a half and now you can

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.160 
out of our 13 and a half and now you can
see<00:00:59.440> that<00:00:59.890> there's<00:01:00.789> big<00:01:01.030> openings<00:01:01.600> here<00:01:01.809> and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
see that there's big openings here and

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.590 
see that there's big openings here and
that's<00:01:02.559> good<00:01:03.429> for<00:01:03.730> a<00:01:03.760> couple<00:01:03.910> of<00:01:04.030> reasons<00:01:04.210> one

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
that's good for a couple of reasons one

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.930 
that's good for a couple of reasons one
that's<00:01:05.320> going<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.650> allow<00:01:06.100> for<00:01:06.130> good<00:01:06.610> drainage

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
that's going to allow for good drainage

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.580 
that's going to allow for good drainage
because<00:01:07.270> you<00:01:07.450> don't<00:01:07.600> want<00:01:07.810> your<00:01:08.080> cuttings<00:01:08.530> to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
because you don't want your cuttings to

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.560 
because you don't want your cuttings to
be<00:01:08.710> sitting<00:01:09.130> in<00:01:09.280> water<00:01:09.550> so<00:01:09.880> whatever<00:01:10.270> you're

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
be sitting in water so whatever you're

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.120 
be sitting in water so whatever you're
putting<00:01:10.720> them<00:01:10.990> in<00:01:11.170> you've<00:01:11.680> got<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:12.010> have

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
putting them in you've got to have

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.890 
putting them in you've got to have
really<00:01:12.310> good<00:01:12.520> drainage<00:01:12.820> out<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.300> bottom<00:01:13.750> and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
really good drainage out the bottom and

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.850 
really good drainage out the bottom and
the<00:01:14.440> fact<00:01:14.770> that<00:01:14.920> these<00:01:15.190> things<00:01:15.490> are<00:01:15.760> raised

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the fact that these things are raised

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.110 
the fact that these things are raised
even<00:01:17.860> on<00:01:18.190> muddy<00:01:18.790> ground<00:01:19.120> the<00:01:23.760> can<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:24.910> flat

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
even on muddy ground the can the flat

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.970 
even on muddy ground the can the flat
can't<00:01:25.420> set<00:01:25.810> down<00:01:26.020> tight<00:01:26.380> against<00:01:26.650> a<00:01:26.740> ground

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
can't set down tight against a ground

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.430 
can't set down tight against a ground
where<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.220> can't<00:01:27.460> drain<00:01:27.790> so<00:01:28.390> even<00:01:28.840> setting<00:01:29.320> on

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
where it can't drain so even setting on

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.070 
where it can't drain so even setting on
the<00:01:29.530> ground<00:01:29.830> you'll<00:01:30.730> still<00:01:31.060> have<00:01:31.270> space<00:01:31.750> here

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
the ground you'll still have space here

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.360 
the ground you'll still have space here
in<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.260> waters<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.620> be<00:01:32.800> able<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:32.980> get<00:01:33.100> out<00:01:33.250> of

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
in the waters and be able to get out of

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.220 
in the waters and be able to get out of
the<00:01:33.430> flat<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:33.940> escape<00:01:34.360> so<00:01:34.600> your<00:01:34.750> cuttings<00:01:35.110> are

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
the flat and escape so your cuttings are

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.410 
the flat and escape so your cuttings are
never<00:01:35.410> going<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:35.620> be<00:01:35.710> soggy<00:01:36.120> another<00:01:37.120> thing

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
never going to be soggy another thing

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.880 
never going to be soggy another thing
that<00:01:37.600> this<00:01:37.750> does<00:01:37.810> is<00:01:38.050> when<00:01:38.410> these<00:01:38.560> things<00:01:38.740> are

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
that this does is when these things are

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.140 
that this does is when these things are
setting<00:01:39.220> flat<00:01:39.430> on<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.670> ground

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
setting flat on the ground

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.880 
setting flat on the ground
you've<00:01:40.540> got<00:01:40.720> three<00:01:40.960> cores<00:01:41.230> an<00:01:41.410> inch<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.740> air

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
you've got three cores an inch of air

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.130 
you've got three cores an inch of air
space<00:01:42.220> there<00:01:42.580> when<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.180> cuttings<00:01:43.600> trying<00:01:43.960> to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
space there when the cuttings trying to

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.990 
space there when the cuttings trying to
run<00:01:44.380> out<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.710> bottom<00:01:45.100> of<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.340> flat<00:01:45.700> which

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
run out the bottom of the flat which

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.240 
run out the bottom of the flat which
they<00:01:46.240> will<00:01:46.450> typically<00:01:47.080> do<00:01:47.410> a<00:01:47.440> lot<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:48.010> times

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
they will typically do a lot of times

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.220 
they will typically do a lot of times
especially<00:01:48.670> with<00:01:49.180> things<00:01:49.330> that<00:01:49.480> they're<00:01:49.990> run

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
especially with things that they're run

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.920 
especially with things that they're run
aggressively<00:01:50.830> these<00:01:51.610> things<00:01:52.060> will<00:01:52.300> actually

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
aggressively these things will actually

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.040 
aggressively these things will actually
air<00:01:53.200> prune<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:54.670> kite<00:01:55.210> so<00:01:55.540> as<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.840> cutting

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
air prune the kite so as the cutting

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.660 
air prune the kite so as the cutting
tries<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.680> go<00:01:56.800> out<00:01:56.950> there<00:01:57.190> it's<00:01:57.310> going<00:01:57.430> to<00:01:57.520> hit

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
tries to go out there it's going to hit

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.700 
tries to go out there it's going to hit
the<00:01:57.790> air<00:01:57.970> as<00:01:58.420> soon<00:01:58.690> as<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.960> root<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.380> mean<00:01:59.560> when

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
the air as soon as the root I mean when

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.200 
the air as soon as the root I mean when
the<00:01:59.800> root<00:01:59.950> tries<00:02:00.160> Roger<00:02:00.460> seems<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:00.880> ROI<00:02:01.000> hits

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
the root tries Roger seems the ROI hits

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.450 
the root tries Roger seems the ROI hits
the<00:02:01.330> air<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:02.080> tip<00:02:02.320> of<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.590> root<00:02:02.800> dives<00:02:03.070> back

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
the air the tip of that root dives back

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.360 
the air the tip of that root dives back
and<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.420> any<00:02:04.660> industry<00:02:05.170> they<00:02:05.470> use<00:02:05.800> air<00:02:06.100> pruning

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
and in any industry they use air pruning

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.609 
and in any industry they use air pruning
a<00:02:06.610> lot<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.150> keep<00:02:07.390> plant<00:02:07.750> from<00:02:08.080> growing<00:02:08.470> a

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
a lot to keep plant from growing a

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.320 
a lot to keep plant from growing a
really<00:02:08.950> long<00:02:09.160> tap<00:02:09.489> root<00:02:09.819> so<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:11.050> know

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
really long tap root so you know

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.570 
really long tap root so you know
when<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:11.810> trimmer<00:02:12.140> plant<00:02:12.530> with<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> single

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
when you trimmer plant with a single

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.950 
when you trimmer plant with a single
stem<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:14.030> cut<00:02:14.210> it<00:02:14.300> off<00:02:14.420> here<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.720> get

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
stem you cut it off here you get

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.600 
stem you cut it off here you get
multiple<00:02:15.440> stamps<00:02:15.710> you<00:02:15.920> cut<00:02:16.100> it<00:02:16.190> again<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.490> get

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
multiple stamps you cut it again you get

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.910 
multiple stamps you cut it again you get
multiple<00:02:17.060> stems<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:18.080> same<00:02:18.290> thing<00:02:18.530> with<00:02:18.650> rooks

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
multiple stems the same thing with rooks

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.440 
multiple stems the same thing with rooks
you<00:02:19.160> guys<00:02:19.280> are<00:02:19.370> even<00:02:19.550> go<00:02:19.640> on<00:02:19.760> tap<00:02:20.000> grow<00:02:20.270> that's

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
you guys are even go on tap grow that's

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.820 
you guys are even go on tap grow that's
no<00:02:20.690> good<00:02:20.930> but<00:02:21.110> if<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.200> keep<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.650> thing

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
no good but if you keep that thing

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.220 
no good but if you keep that thing
trimmed<00:02:22.190> as<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.520> grows<00:02:22.870> you're<00:02:23.870> going<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.110> get

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
trimmed as it grows you're going to get

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.040 
trimmed as it grows you're going to get
a<00:02:24.260> nice<00:02:24.860> tight<00:02:25.280> root<00:02:26.030> ball<00:02:26.270> with<00:02:26.570> a<00:02:26.600> lot<00:02:26.900> of

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
a nice tight root ball with a lot of

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.900 
a nice tight root ball with a lot of
fibrous<00:02:27.440> roots<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:27.890> when<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.520> cutting<00:02:28.850> is

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
fibrous roots so when the cutting is

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.730 
fibrous roots so when the cutting is
trying<00:02:29.180> no<00:02:29.540> cuttings<00:02:29.990> trying<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.320> send<00:02:30.530> rooks

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
trying no cuttings trying to send rooks

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.310 
trying no cuttings trying to send rooks
out<00:02:30.950> here<00:02:31.190> here<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:32.360> actually<00:02:32.870> if<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.050> really

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
out here here so actually if you really

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.750 
out here here so actually if you really
wanted<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.860> make<00:02:33.920> sure<00:02:33.980> they<00:02:34.220> were<00:02:34.280> air<00:02:34.460> proved

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
wanted to make sure they were air proved

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.460 
wanted to make sure they were air proved
you<00:02:34.880> could<00:02:35.030> set<00:02:35.300> these<00:02:35.480> on<00:02:35.690> concrete<00:02:36.170> blocks

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
you could set these on concrete blocks

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.280 
you could set these on concrete blocks
so<00:02:37.280> you've<00:02:37.490> got<00:02:37.640> plenty<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:38.000> airspace<00:02:38.600> any

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
so you've got plenty of airspace any

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.620 
so you've got plenty of airspace any
kind<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.770> root<00:02:39.950> comes<00:02:40.160> out<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.460> bottom<00:02:40.640> boom

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
kind the root comes out the bottom boom

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.480 
kind the root comes out the bottom boom
the<00:02:42.110> air<00:02:42.290> is<00:02:42.470> going<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.710> nip<00:02:42.890> it<00:02:43.010> off<00:02:43.160> and

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
the air is going to nip it off and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.040 
the air is going to nip it off and
that's<00:02:43.850> going<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.060> force<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.570> cutting<00:02:44.900> to

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
that's going to force that cutting to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.960 
that's going to force that cutting to
make<00:02:45.230> more<00:02:45.530> lateral<00:02:46.070> roots<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.610> you'll<00:02:46.730> you

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
make more lateral roots and you'll you

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.760 
make more lateral roots and you'll you
end<00:02:47.150> up<00:02:47.240> with<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.420> much<00:02:47.630> nicer<00:02:47.840> root<00:02:48.230> system<00:02:48.590> so

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
end up with a much nicer root system so

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.380 
end up with a much nicer root system so
there<00:02:49.190> are<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.310> lot<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.459> advantage<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.270> these

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
there are a lot of advantage of these

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.960 
there are a lot of advantage of these
things<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:50.810> anyway<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.650> is<00:02:51.709> treated<00:02:52.430> one<00:02:52.760> by

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
things so anyway this is treated one by

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.449 
things so anyway this is treated one by
four<00:02:53.320> I've<00:02:54.320> never<00:02:54.590> had<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.830> problem<00:02:55.130> with

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
four I've never had a problem with

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.610 
four I've never had a problem with
treated<00:02:55.820> wood<00:02:56.000> in<00:02:56.150> my<00:02:56.180> plants<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:56.959> whatever

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
treated wood in my plants that whatever

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.199 
treated wood in my plants that whatever
the<00:02:57.770> treatment<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.310> doesn't<00:02:58.880> travel

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
the treatment is doesn't travel

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.250 
the treatment is doesn't travel
horizontally<00:02:59.540> into<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.320> soil<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.840> of

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
horizontally into the soil so and of

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.840 
horizontally into the soil so and of
course<00:03:03.470> they'll<00:03:03.620> last<00:03:03.830> a<00:03:04.010> long<00:03:04.160> time<00:03:04.190> are<00:03:04.700> good

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
course they'll last a long time are good

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.330 
course they'll last a long time are good
and<00:03:04.970> sturdy<00:03:05.240> once<00:03:06.050> they<00:03:06.260> dry<00:03:06.500> out<00:03:06.530> in<00:03:07.130> those

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
and sturdy once they dry out in those

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.280 
and sturdy once they dry out in those
trees<00:03:07.580> wood<00:03:07.790> dries<00:03:08.030> out<00:03:08.270> pretty<00:03:08.510> good<00:03:08.780> then

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
trees wood dries out pretty good then

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.680 
trees wood dries out pretty good then
they'll<00:03:09.500> be<00:03:09.620> relatively<00:03:10.310> light<00:03:10.640> filled<00:03:11.450> with

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
they'll be relatively light filled with

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.480 
they'll be relatively light filled with
sand<00:03:11.930> they'll<00:03:12.230> be<00:03:12.350> heavy<00:03:12.560> but<00:03:12.950> if<00:03:13.190> we<00:03:13.310> use<00:03:13.459> a

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
sand they'll be heavy but if we use a

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.220 
sand they'll be heavy but if we use a
lighter<00:03:13.820> mix<00:03:14.150> especially<00:03:14.630> for<00:03:14.810> our<00:03:14.900> hardwood

lighter mix especially for our hardwood

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.530 
lighter mix especially for our hardwood
cuttings<00:03:15.440> that'll<00:03:16.280> be<00:03:16.370> fine<00:03:16.640> so<00:03:16.880> anyway

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
cuttings that'll be fine so anyway
