00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.990
 several methods to hold the reins 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.960
 the parallel queens method this will be 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.660
 a state that we said we will use 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.699
 more the net than the flange and time 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.830
 in time by closing the Abbot's hand 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.840
 flange to me which allows me to have a 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.789
 best bring back in my case 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.830
 and regarding my horse 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.980
 then this method is allowed in the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:38.250
 second method of training 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.260
 Authorized is to have the Queen Anne 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.719
 English that is to say that you spend the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.110
 queen of the nets on the grid arena and 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.340
 the horse is held a little bit 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.640
 different since the reins are 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.250
 crossed but the relationship of the hand will make 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.370
 we will have exactly the same job 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.289
 except that this is of no use is a 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.420
 little bit different at the level of the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.489
 hand is the work of the hand this 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.909
 trail the rider only work the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.110
 horse's mouth since we will use 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.880
 independently either the flange or the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.880
 net be the two together 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.080
 the third step is that of 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.159
 the school of estreniol of come where they 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.869
 take three queens in the hand 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.380
 left is the queen of the net in the 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.650
 right hand and they have it since 400 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.420
 years 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.810
 but this method does not use in 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.729
 dressage in a classic way simply to 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.619
 the school of Vienna is simply 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.170
 a little bit up we can take 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.940
 in addition to the work of the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.950
 horses and that's a benefit 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.290
 this has an advantage is that we have a 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.539
 point of fixity and that will bring a 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.050
 better organization in horses 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.030
 since fixity and the absence of everything 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.050
 unnecessary movement that may interfere or 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.050
 worry the horse
