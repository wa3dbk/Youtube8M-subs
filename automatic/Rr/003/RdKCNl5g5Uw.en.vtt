 we participate in this type of videos like this 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.560
 that we see beginning this series of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.500
 videos with the top 5 of the best 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.930
 compound foods to lose weight 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.610
 remember this compound word is going to be 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.840
 very important for the end of the video 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.270
 so let's start and open this top 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.030
 with the beans in general led 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.370
 for the black beans or beans like you 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.280
 called in Colombia this food is a 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.079
 food composed of carbohydrates and 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.570
 proteins that's why it's inside this 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.329
 top is a super convenient food 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.949
 when you do not have time or you need 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.570
 prepare a super fast meal and not 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.489
 you know what to eat and between administration 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.680
 you simply make a portion of 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.400
 black beans do not serve with a little 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.860
 salad 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.690
 you have proteins and carbohydrates in a 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.580
 little bit of seeing from a super dish 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.920
 fast and super efficient 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.920
 now we have until another very food 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.350
 efficient compound because it not only has 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.330
 the proteins that you need but also 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.250
 It has compounds of omega 3 oils 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.110
 that help you in an incredible way 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.420
 when you are trying to lose weight 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.220
 then it is another quick solution when 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.590
 You are in another situation like that 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.590
 where you simply need to serve yourself 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.180
 good piece of salmon fish with a 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.560
 little salad and maybe because of a 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.650
 little bit of carbohydrates of your choice 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.750
 for another fast and efficient meal like 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.510
 number 3 we have the almonds another 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.790

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.369

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.340
 healthy all in one food 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.380
 Now this one has to have a little bit of 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.460
 careful because even though it is 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.619
 excellent his portions that by weight are 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.350
 super small then maybe you can not 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.720
 you can give an account and it serves you too much and 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.360
 instead of eating a meal 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.220
 rational that you would need to eat such 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.150
 you may be consuming 600 calories 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.610
 you feel 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.340
 without realizing this is a food 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.200
 super good super important at the time 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.510

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.790
 a little bit of care with the amounts 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.159
