 someone had been sowing chaos 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.950
 in the big city 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.010
 this mysterious figure every day left 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.560
 that a new footprint a new message 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.440
 expressed in some original way a 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.650
 graffiti a logo an installation of some 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.650
 kind

 the followers of punks and toured the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.320
 city ​​frantically armed with their 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.350
 cell phones looking for some new 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.439
 graffiti of his idol to photograph him 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.780
 and upload it to social networks there 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.960
 where the new graffiti was found 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.439
 a crowd gathered they improvised 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.840
 parties the mayor of new york michael

 situation that he defined as loss of 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.190
 control the police was staying in 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.100
 ridiculous chasing someone whose 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.720
 identity I did not know chasing a 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.819
 ghost

 in November there was no trace of punks 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.979
 and had left new york ' 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.099
 a month later in the various angels 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.250
 of his graffiti were removed from the 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.590
 walls and auctioned each one of these 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.380
 graffiti reached prices of up to one 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.630
 quarter of a million dollars a bargain 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.580
 according to some art experts that 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.739

 his works will be paid ten times more 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.190
 faces who banks and why so much fame 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.650
 because he has become a character 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.019
 of worship with thousands of followers throughout 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.660
 the world among those who are 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.900
 Celebrities like Angelina Jolie or Brad 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.900

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.240
 English and is from princeton 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.860

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.660
 he also knows that he has a patron 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.950
 artistic in the figure of the artist 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.200
 conceptual danger first heart the artist 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.110
 richest in the world is an admirer of 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.900
 punk if the hordes of punk if they appear 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.390
 regularly in the exhibitions of 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.570
 first and to return the favor 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.290
 banks and makes continuous references towards 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.320
 his patron in his graffiti without the support 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.630
 first bank financial statement if it could not 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.900
 travel the world expressing their art 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.330
 because they are more than 20 years that 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.910
 they carry banks and leaving their graffiti for 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.580
 all the planet few countries must 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.130
 Be read to visit 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.280
 and how can a simple graffiti sta 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.730
 have attracted so much attention for its 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.840
 personality his actions and of course 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.870
 its secrecy and the mystery surrounding 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.750
 he is the basis of his success the one that has not 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.510
 a face associated with the pseudonym banc se 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.040
 convert this name into one more brand 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.710
 powerful 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.240
 the bank itself has stated that no 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.570
 is interested in making himself known never 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.269
 that there are already enough opinion sites to 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.600
 two trying to put their ugly face 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.610
 in front of you but there is also another 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.160
 reason to continue hiding his 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.320
 identity legally 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.750
 banks is a criminal with charges 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.990
 pending everywhere against the 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.790
 public property he recognizes this by 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.180
 that he signs his books with the 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:45.020
 pseudonym robin bank I know that on purpose 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.249
 is very similar to robin banks robbing 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.159
 banks 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:52.279
 he perceives himself as a robin 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:54.379
 street art hood in a 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:58.279
 interview granted 10 years ago 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:59.839
 He said it 's all a revenge 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:04.000
 You can take over half of the 

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:05.830
 city ​​scribbling on it 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.410
 in a recently published book 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.890
 seem to confirm the first 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:15.550
 photographs taken banks and painting one 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:20.300
 of his graffiti was in chiapas mexico in 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.580
 the 2001 this would be banks 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.909
 but among the speculations of those who 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.039
 they go if you include the one they go to if it's not 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:31.639
 an individual but a group of artists 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:34.190
 an international network which would explain 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:39.639
 facts like the appearance of a graffiti 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.639
 in australia and another one in mali the same day 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.419
 whoever it is while the mystery of 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.360
 punk identity is continued and its 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.699
 works continue to appear likely to be 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.199
 the most wanted person on the planet 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.199
 for quite some time 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.350
 and what do you think about the work of banks
