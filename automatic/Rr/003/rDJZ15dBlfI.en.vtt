200 here we're actually going to upgrade
it<00:00:11.400> from<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.170> stock<00:00:13.170> vacuum<00:00:14.099> operated<00:00:15.470> unit

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
it from the stock vacuum operated unit

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.300 
it from the stock vacuum operated unit
that<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.250> rubber<00:00:18.060> diaphragm<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.810> failed<00:00:19.350> it's

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
that the rubber diaphragm is failed it's

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.080 
that the rubber diaphragm is failed it's
pretty<00:00:20.550> common<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.330> type<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:22.850> fuel<00:00:23.850> on

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
pretty common on this type of fuel on

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
shelf it uses engine vacuum to open the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.160 
shelf it uses engine vacuum to open the
diaphragm<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.330> allow<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.390> fuel<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.869> go<00:00:30.990> in

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
diaphragm and allow the fuel to go in

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.299 
diaphragm and allow the fuel to go in
when<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> engines<00:00:31.920> running

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and then when they engines off it's

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.380 
and then when they engines off it's
supposed<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.500> automatically<00:00:35.340> shut<00:00:36.059> off<00:00:36.239> the

fuel in the event of a crash and just
for<00:00:39.270> safety<00:00:39.660> reasons<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.680> when<00:00:41.100> they<00:00:41.250> fail

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
for safety reasons but when they fail

for safety reasons but when they fail
the<00:00:42.360> fuel<00:00:42.570> doesn't<00:00:42.899> shut<00:00:43.050> off<00:00:43.079> usually<00:00:43.890> floods

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the fuel doesn't shut off usually floods

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.060 
the fuel doesn't shut off usually floods
the<00:00:44.579> car<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.750> case<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.410> diaphragm<00:00:46.920> was

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the car in this case the diaphragm was

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.970 
the car in this case the diaphragm was
leaking<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.760> she<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.899> able<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.289> leak<00:00:49.530> through

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
leaking so she was able to leak through

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.639 
leaking so she was able to leak through
the<00:00:50.280> diaphragm<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.210> back<00:00:51.809> into<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> vacuum

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the diaphragm and back into the vacuum

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.490

port<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> carburetor<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.210> wash<00:00:55.170> down<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
port of the carburetor and wash down the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.069 
port of the carburetor and wash down the
cellular<00:00:55.980> walls<00:00:56.219> thus<00:00:56.910> film<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> crankcase

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
cellular walls thus film the crankcase

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.619 
cellular walls thus film the crankcase
up<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:58.859> fuel<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.430> thus<00:00:59.940> causing

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
up with fuel and thus causing

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.020 
up with fuel and thus causing
lubrication<00:01:01.230> problems<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:01.980> not<00:01:02.010> attended<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
lubrication problems if not attended to

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.810 
lubrication problems if not attended to
promptly<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:04.070> skipped<00:01:05.070> ahead<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.369> little<00:01:05.549> bit

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
promptly I skipped ahead a little bit

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.640 
promptly I skipped ahead a little bit
I've<00:01:06.180> already<00:01:06.510> had<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.810> tank<00:01:07.049> off<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
I've already had the tank off and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.219 
I've already had the tank off and
drained<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.610> make<00:01:09.210> sure<00:01:09.240> there's<00:01:09.689> no

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
drained it and make sure there's no

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.859 
drained it and make sure there's no
traces<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.040> fuel<00:01:11.280> left<00:01:11.340> before<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.360> actually

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
traces of fuel left before it actually

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.230 
traces of fuel left before it actually
removed<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.159> old<00:01:15.080> fuel<00:01:16.080> shutoff<00:01:16.820> device<00:01:17.820> I've

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
removed the old fuel shutoff device I've

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.999 
removed the old fuel shutoff device I've
actually<00:01:18.479> already<00:01:18.869> taken<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.710> apart

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
actually already taken this one apart

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.380 
actually already taken this one apart
I'm<00:01:20.250> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> show<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.939> pieces<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
I'm going to show you the pieces a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630 
I'm going to show you the pieces a
little<00:01:22.229> bit<00:01:22.380> later<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:23.009> show<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.340> what

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
little bit later here show you what

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.030 
little bit later here show you what
failed<00:01:24.000> show<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.869> look<00:01:25.020> look<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:25.830> on

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
failed show you what to look look for on

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.039 
failed show you what to look look for on
yours<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.000> said<00:01:27.210> these<00:01:27.330> are<00:01:27.390> common<00:01:27.900> on

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
yours like I said these are common on

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.319 
yours like I said these are common on
most<00:01:28.080> street<00:01:28.920> bikes<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.369> carbureted<00:01:29.939> engines

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
most street bikes and carbureted engines

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.580 
most street bikes and carbureted engines
so<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.320> isn't<00:01:31.530> unique<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.549> model

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
so this isn't unique to just this model

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
so this isn't unique to just this model
alright<00:01:34.590> let<00:01:34.860> me<00:01:34.950> show<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.159> what<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.460> have

alright let me show you what we have

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.640 
alright let me show you what we have
here<00:01:35.909> I've<00:01:36.479> taken<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.900> apart<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.500> more

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
here I've taken this apart for more

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.749 
here I've taken this apart for more
clarity<00:01:38.360> there's<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.450> cover<00:01:39.979> we<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.220> two

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759

this<00:01:45.509> little<00:01:46.229> o-ring<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.880> actually<00:01:47.880> what

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
this little o-ring is actually what

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.710 
this little o-ring is actually what
seals<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:50.250> shut<00:01:50.460> off<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.640> fuel<00:01:51.000> when<00:01:51.540> this

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
seals to shut off the fuel when this

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.160 
seals to shut off the fuel when this

you're<00:02:58.140> going<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.350> have<00:02:58.530> more<00:02:58.769> like<00:02:59.010> close<00:02:59.610> to

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
you're going to have more like close to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.490 
you're going to have more like close to
three<00:02:59.910> quart<00:03:00.180> or<00:03:00.269> maybe<00:03:00.540> even<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.900> gallon<00:03:01.290> left

now here's a problem that some of you

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.270 
now here's a problem that some of you
might<00:04:31.050> have<00:04:31.940> installing<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:33.060> on<00:04:33.090> a<00:04:33.410> on<00:04:34.410> a<00:04:34.470> bike

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
might have installing it on a on a bike

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.120 
might have installing it on a on a bike
that<00:04:35.310> has<00:04:35.760> a<00:04:35.790> smaller<00:04:36.600> fuel<00:04:36.870> line<00:04:37.169> then<00:04:37.500> what

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
that has a smaller fuel line then what

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.580 
that has a smaller fuel line then what
the<00:04:38.340> outlet<00:04:39.300> pipe<00:04:39.930> is<00:04:40.169> on<00:04:40.410> your<00:04:40.590> new<00:04:40.949> shuttle<00:04:41.430> a

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
the outlet pipe is on your new shuttle a

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.100 
the outlet pipe is on your new shuttle a
way<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:43.650> can<00:04:43.889> do<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:44.040> is<00:04:44.370> take<00:04:44.610> your<00:04:45.080> take<00:04:46.080> a

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
way you can do that is take your take a

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.300 
way you can do that is take your take a
large<00:04:46.470> screwdriver<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:47.190> it's

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
large screwdriver that it's

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.710 
large screwdriver that it's
approximately<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:48.210> diameter<00:04:49.020> of<00:04:49.590> the

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
approximately the diameter of the

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.320 
approximately the diameter of the
fitting<00:04:51.720> here<00:04:52.310> jam<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:53.460> on<00:04:53.580> as<00:04:53.880> hard<00:04:54.120> as<00:04:54.240> you

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
fitting here jam it on as hard as you

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.610 
fitting here jam it on as hard as you
can<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:55.500> if<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:55.770> need<00:04:56.040> to<00:04:57.260> use<00:04:58.260> something

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
can and if you need to use something

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.670 
can and if you need to use something
like<00:04:58.800> a<00:04:58.979> heat<00:04:59.370> gun<00:04:59.780> just<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.990> heat<00:05:01.229> it<00:05:01.410> up<00:05:01.530> a

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
like a heat gun just to heat it up a

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.980 
like a heat gun just to heat it up a
little<00:05:01.770> blow<00:05:02.669> drier<00:05:02.940> probably<00:05:03.419> work<00:05:03.600> it<00:05:03.930> just

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
little blow drier probably work it just

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.190 
little blow drier probably work it just
might<00:05:04.410> take<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.680> little<00:05:04.950> bit<00:05:05.100> extra<00:05:05.160> time<00:05:09.200> that

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
might take a little bit extra time that

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.050 
might take a little bit extra time that
might<00:05:10.560> be<00:05:10.830> enough<00:05:11.100> you<00:05:11.310> want<00:05:11.490> to<00:05:11.580> be<00:05:11.639> careful

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
might be enough you want to be careful

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.629 
might be enough you want to be careful
with<00:05:12.210> your<00:05:12.419> heat<00:05:12.600> gun<00:05:12.630> as<00:05:13.130> not<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.250> get<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.400> too

with your heat gun as not to get a too
hot<00:05:14.880> because<00:05:15.300> then<00:05:15.600> you'll<00:05:15.720> just<00:05:15.900> melt<00:05:16.199> the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
hot because then you'll just melt the

hot because then you'll just melt the
fuel<00:05:16.680> line<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.419> let's<00:05:18.530> try<00:05:19.530> it<00:05:19.590> try<00:05:20.250> it<00:05:20.370> out<00:05:20.580> I

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190
