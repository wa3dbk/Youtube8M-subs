00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:08.099
 Internet is a universe of multiforms 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.719
 of digital files since there is 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.140
 they hide millions of mysteries that 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.540
 many will never be resolved in this 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.269
 place walks around a video file 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.789
 called barbie skillful point and whose 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.220
 meaning and real sense has not yet 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.660
 been confirmed 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.420
 apparently it was originally posted 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.640
 for champ by a user called blas in 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.550
 the one who asked if anyone knew the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.130
 origin of this mysterious video in its 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.890
 post narrates his report of how he found 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.440
 the video his story is very convincing 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.809
 in the way as it narrates 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.809
 continuation the story of blas 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.950
 It was about twelve in the afternoon and he was 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.830
 something boring so I decided to go out to 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.320
 walk to kill time when 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.680
 I passed through a camp a flash of 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.300
 light caught my attention approaching me in the 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.820
 ground was buried a hard drive 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.610
 old and mistreated but I decided 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.350
 take it and see that I had saved the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.560
 curious to see what kind of files 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.409
 There was killing me 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.470
 when i get home i connect it to my 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.360
 computer what I found were 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.270
 many documents in format that my 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.460
 computer could not open but what 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.259
 more it caught my attention is that there was 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.200
 several videos with the name of barbie 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.450
 point there were many of them were 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.390
 damaged and I tried to convert them to another 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.970
 format in order to repair them but I 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.689
 it was impossible from the 8 videos that had 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.329
 on that hard drive I could only save 6 and 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.000
 when playing them you see a strange 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.280
 blonde woman who only has one arm she 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.069
 speak for several minutes with a 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.289
 totally distorted sound the most 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.780
 strange is the language that is speaking 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.000
 it is totally unknown 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.580
 another scary aspect is that of a 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.349
 moment that was cheerful 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.230
 he quickly changed his character and 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.360
 start crying all that night I put on 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.900
 to analyze the videos with the intention 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.670
 to find out who that girl was 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.609
 I asked in many forums and without any 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.700
 answer but a fragment of the video 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:33.560
 that after reproducing it, it 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.110
 in a few seconds you see a man 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.870
 walking across the train tracks with 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.510
 direction very close makes a bear ate and 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.700
 is when the video cuts those tracks 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.739
 of the train that appears in the video is 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.280
 very close to my house and also to a 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.310
 nosocomio so the next day 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.709
 I decided to take a look 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.069
 my grandfather told my brother and me 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.959
 that an asylum operated in that place 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.020
 but for some reason it stopped working 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.720
 many times I visited that place 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.120
 I liked very much to see their runners but 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.990
 I never found anything interesting but that 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.210
 day would be different 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.580
 I had never climbed to the third floor 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.220
 of the building but I think it was more for 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.040
 afraid that out of laziness and that's when I 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.230
 I was approaching up the steps I entered 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.770
 in one of the rooms there was a 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.680
 old cpu those white but this one 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.170
 it was yellowish it was very 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.880
 battered not to say destroyed so 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.210
 I could see the inside and the plate 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.200
 mother but that cpu was missing the disk 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.510
 hard when I was walking through the corridors 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.730
 I heard a sound of water dripping me 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.130
 I approach the bathrooms and one of the 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.800
 lights had the key open like that 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.320
 someone was using it in that 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.990
 I instantly feel that someone was 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.970
 watching and that's when I'm invaded 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.820
 fear that I can not describe with 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.520
 words immediately fled in terror 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.130
 from that damn hospital, never again 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.470
 I went back to that madhouse and I think that 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.860
 hospital is not yet uninhabited 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.860
 all 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.230
 it's really almost impossible to find out 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.480
 great thing about this video or about the 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.910
 girl that appears in the seems to be more 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.180
 a kind of amateur interview of 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.430
 quite a few years ago on the other hand 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.639
 some say they are just frames 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.310
 modified from a French movie of 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:44.610
 1992 called albert surfers and that is 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.650
 really hard to get and from the 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.570
 which seems that nobody has contributed in the 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.200
 catch that shed some light on 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.450
 this is a drug addict part of a 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.820
 documentary snob or a video of 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.979
 research from a university is 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.770
 they extracted several unproven hypotheses 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.680
 like that could be an interview to a 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.720
 survivor of human trafficking but yes 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.030
 It seems to be true that the woman is missing 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.729
 the right arm can be seen in the 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.190
 fourth video is most likely to be 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.830
 try an interview or talk about 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.500
 the big identity disorder of the 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.120
 body integrity 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.520
 nobody knows the reason why he cries 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.510
 Maybe it's due to remember why 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.210
 he lost his arm so we will qualify 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.100
 as indeterminate a whole ministry 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.620
 because we do not even know what 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.270
 language they speak although they assure that a 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.060
 moment of the video can be heard 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.730
 say the skin while pulling 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.860
 of your skin a video that is really 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.350
 mysterious sits the case of what 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.020
 you would like to see the link in the description 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.780
 and many languages say that it is only a 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.630
 CREEPYPASTA or urban legend such 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.830
 Once you can solve the mystery of 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.830
 origin of this video 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:19.309
