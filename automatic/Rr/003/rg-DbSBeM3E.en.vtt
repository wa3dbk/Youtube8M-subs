00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.350
 it was going the geeks and secular is the one 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.599
 opus I hope you have 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.309
 let's go for a little powerful video 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.170
 coliseum so commented afterwards but 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.350
 it is true that it is uc of the small 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.930
 casting espresso fight and compo 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.250
 that I like finally on the beta 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.619
 in previous videos I tested 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.090
 a little different combo there I go there 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.380
 a little bit on my ecaflip I 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.300
 left a little bit of air I have a little 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.429
 not far from the action so I blame myself for 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.650
 dead always the initiative with my 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.770
 eliatropes one I like to play the liana 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.030
 first of all so we can put the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.550
 pressure quite easily on 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.200
 the opponent in second line and that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.649
 also that makes it possible to put the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.129
 pressure 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.210
 age and cases last this is true 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.420
 that in the ideal might be worth 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.739
 the better I do heliotrope eca and eni in 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.680
 last one like that my team can give 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.180
 also upstream pm ellipsa the heliotrope 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.739
 as I play it first and who 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.940
 can put his portals so what he 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.579
 gives a lot of doors and I have not 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.100
 so need to have more than 6 pm 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.539
 therefore this side is what sex is 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.869
 classy and very aggressive without necessarily 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.189
 much to advance because it's true 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.960
 that by posing the portals even if towers 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.450
 1 we can not cast the spell that boosts 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.150
 the door and the portals we can not 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.860
 thanks to the given door and additional 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.170
 by the portals we can still typed 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.250
 far enough far enough what in 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.250
 any case for this is interesting 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.200
 the little boost with the elder rip here and there 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.330
 it is true that that is what makes 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.860
 very pleasure is the boosts of 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.230
 damage in hurtful words across the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.150
 portal someone in a video yesterday me 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.100
 why were you still trying 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.780
 finally instead of galley with the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.130
 portals rather directly 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.780
 opponents yes but the thing is that 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.090
 the portals that boosts the damage so 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.180
 there is interest there you see 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.290
 offensive words 600 in critical shot that 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.670
 is really fun it takes 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.470
 enjoy stuck it's open 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.600
 and it's true that I thought about it a little 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.170
 just now to this class 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.220
 eliatropes and someone was asking me about 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.690
 twitter to what it is hard to play 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.890
 tomorrow it is not particularly hard to 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.229
 play the dialogues I think besides 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.820
 that it's less complicated to play by 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.989
 example that the new xelor the new 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.130
 version of the museum when I found more 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.870
 complex that the heliotrope after good 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.489
 this is not the links trope it's 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.220
 not a simple class as we will say 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.530
 I do not know the cra for example where the iop 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.340
 which are pretty basic as place 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.470
 it's still a little bit more 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.700
 complicated but now I would say that the 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.840
 diatribes do not know either very 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.850
 complicated the difference thing and that's 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.420
 the portals the little notion of 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:39.350
 vectors but if not yeah that's it 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.360
 not hyper mega complex either 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.750
 after there is plenty of subtlety and it's 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.640
 also true that via hatches there is no 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.940
 bad blood placement spells that 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.830
 draws spells that grows and when one 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.269
 add that with the portals that when we 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.200
 push someone into a portal can get 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.580
 find at the other end of the map 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.069
 in fact that's what I mean it's 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.980
 in the end it is the heliotrope its 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.840
 spells in itself are not it's not 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.160
 very very hard to understand but the trick 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.739
 is that actually once there are two 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.420
 three portals on the map the number of 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.980
 possibilities the number of things that 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.620
 can do in a round it increases 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.040
 a lot and suddenly there is certainly a 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.840
 turn where it can take time to 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.830
 look where are I putting my 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.230
 gate is what I braid 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.780
 do I cross such portal or 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.440
 not leave it here it leaves a lot of 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.160
 potential 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.959
 it still hits hard and there suddenly 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.860
 in this video the diatribes that I 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.510
 cheek no longer crowd 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.799
 aj moan I visited what to 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.299
 less a little bit and it's true that 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.790
 the more you see there I anticipate it's at 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.230
 to say that at the end of my time with 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.569
 the heliotrope I put a portal on purpose 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.060
 to see how to hit booster 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.319
 the opponent and there good I'm doing 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.329
 a little bit I put myself in bad 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.709
 side of the portal like a con but there 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.250
 blow you see normal guys up 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:01.690
 583 and there you see how far it goes 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.819
 it's amazing for 3 pea I do 971 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.590
 on my opponent and it's not a 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.329
 punching ball there it's not like when 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.220
 I was doing my tests and I was there 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.660
 to tell you wow that's going to be balÃ¨ze 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.430
 I already told you when I was doing 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.930
 on the putsch but here it is sorne 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.019
 action there it's on a quiz hub 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.070
 so agree in the face it's not a 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.579
 mentally ill team 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.039
 but still for 3 p when we manage 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.450
 a few portals you can ride I 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.729
 am not far from milo hurtful words 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.530
 see if I had done a little more 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.479
 boost on my older rip that we went up to 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.330
 1000 then of course the opponents 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.740
 also can take advantage of it 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.870
 so the deadly attacks also make 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.810
 very badly but really that's me what 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.550
 I think about that to this class 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.980
 and diatribe is that really 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.810
 it's really going to change the game a lot 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.520
 in the sense that we were going to 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.020
 have been nose redone recently so all 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.160
 the classes that was finally here 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.750
 this class that was doing the hardest and 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.360
 the fights were nerve is there with 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.700
 lelia trope very clearly it goes too 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.400
 much reduce the duration of the fights that 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.870
 allows you to type very carefully the care he 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.640
 was going hyatt europe is interesting 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.230
 but unless you really have 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.940
 big percentage resistance in 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.120
 the team the case care for the four 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.740
 tires do not make up for the damage 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.120
 additional lake composter with the 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.380
 big class that are very high the 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.940
 Zional damage that can be done 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:23.210
 thanks to this class so I think 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.190
 really that's okay it'll change the game 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.330
 because it's going to hit 20 years a lot 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.890
 stronger than before and it's true that 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.290
 it's whew because for blow ten 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.390
 men in a few months finally there are 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.830
 had the nerve of the fact that at the arrival of 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.090
 this class there the xelor also who types 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.830
 very strong it would do another 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.180
 video in the week to talk about 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.520
 some composed during very very 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.660
 nagging and suddenly this is the game in 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.630
 a few months I think it is 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.360
 completely changed a lot of teams 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.740
 play how to really say a lot of 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.260
 very long fighting resistance 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.970
 the archetype the bomb companies well 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.170
 sure it's going to continue a style of play will have 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.540
 always people who will play like that 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.460
 but there it is true that there is a big 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.230
 big aggression big fat 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.670
 additional damage with the 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.160
 portals so I think that 's okay 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.520
 really not bad change the 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.360
 how the game works in pvp 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.770
 here I hope this little video 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.910
 you liked it I wanted to show you 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:16.490
 hugo rocks of 772 971 by which 760 on 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.230
 know nothing now we know 971 for 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.150
 troyes loses so it's rather fun 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.150
 this video was more I disconnect
