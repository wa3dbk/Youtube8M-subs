00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
there's no dust there's just look great

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.150 
there's no dust there's just look great
right<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.510> top<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.199> seemed<00:00:28.710> as<00:00:29.099> if

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
right but on top of that it seemed as if

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.769 
right but on top of that it seemed as if
they<00:00:29.670> improve<00:00:30.060> some<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> green<00:00:30.750> screen

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
they improve some of the green screen

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.950 
they improve some of the green screen
and<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.949> sort<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.489> king<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.510> fact<00:00:33.809> that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
and just that sort of a king a fact that

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.510 
and just that sort of a king a fact that
they<00:00:34.079> had<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> rocketeer<00:00:35.130> when<00:00:35.280> he<00:00:35.340> goes

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
they had on the rocketeer when he goes

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.000 
they had on the rocketeer when he goes
off<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.940> flies<00:00:36.270> around<00:00:36.540> he<00:00:37.350> used<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.890> have

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
off and flies around he used to have

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.799 
off and flies around he used to have
like<00:00:38.190> sort<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.579> green<00:00:38.910> halo<00:00:39.270> around<00:00:39.510> him<00:00:39.719> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
like sort of green halo around him and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.720 
like sort of green halo around him and
it<00:00:39.930> seemed<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.200> they<00:00:40.530> got<00:00:40.680> rid<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.489> for

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it seemed like they got rid of it for

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.700 
it seemed like they got rid of it for
the<00:00:41.790> most<00:00:41.969> part<00:00:42.270> although<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> would

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the most part although you know I would

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.619 
the most part although you know I would
have<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.980> physically<00:00:44.489> go<00:00:44.730> back<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.149> compare

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
have to physically go back and compare

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.910 
have to physically go back and compare
the<00:00:45.870> two<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.379> before<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.860> after

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the two the before and the after

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.889 
the two the before and the after
versions<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.969> couldn't<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.510> when

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
versions and couldn't do that when

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.150 
versions and couldn't do that when
you're<00:00:48.989> watching<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.469> movie<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> very

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
you're watching the movie for the very

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.380 
you're watching the movie for the very
first<00:00:50.340> time<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.120> would<00:00:51.239> be<00:00:51.270> interesting

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
first time but it would be interesting

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.049 
first time but it would be interesting
to<00:00:51.840> see<00:00:52.050> how<00:00:52.500> much<00:00:52.710> they<00:00:52.949> did<00:00:53.190> improve<00:00:53.610> upon

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
to see how much they did improve upon

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.209 
to see how much they did improve upon
the<00:00:54.300> original<00:00:54.870> film<00:00:55.110> after<00:00:55.350> we<00:00:55.620> saw<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.920> movie

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the original film after we saw the movie

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.910 
the original film after we saw the movie
we<00:00:56.820> went<00:00:57.030> ahead<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.360> did<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:57.870> whole<00:00:58.230> Q<00:00:58.590> &amp;<00:00:58.739> A

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
we went ahead and did this whole Q &amp; A

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.910 
we went ahead and did this whole Q &amp; A
that<00:00:59.520> we<00:00:59.789> couldn't<00:01:00.149> take<00:01:00.270> pictures<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.320> was

their<00:01:09.720> take<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.350> movie<00:01:10.710> 20<00:01:11.430> years<00:01:11.670> after

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
their take on this movie 20 years after

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.760 
their take on this movie 20 years after
the<00:01:12.450> fact<00:01:12.659> right<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.380> was<00:01:13.470> pretty<00:01:13.650> cool

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the fact right so that was pretty cool

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.969 
the fact right so that was pretty cool
but<00:01:14.159> thankfully<00:01:14.939> though<00:01:15.150> Disney<00:01:15.930> did<00:01:16.439> film

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
but thankfully though Disney did film

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.490 
but thankfully though Disney did film
this<00:01:17.400> whole<00:01:17.729> panel<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.479> hopefully<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.470> some

this whole panel so hopefully at some

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.010 
this whole panel so hopefully at some
point<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.970> going<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.360> be<00:01:21.450> released<00:01:21.780> on
