00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.229
 hello good afternoon again something today 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.050
 greets you by presenting a work of 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:10.759
 training on this occasion makes a 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.440
 technical work that we are going to do here 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.440
 a series of exercises to strengthen 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.180
 precisely the technical part some 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.340
 important gestures in the development 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.650
 own for this exercise because what 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.080
 we locate when you observe in 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.720
 human couples in pairs and for each 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.449
 couple then a saucer that we see there in 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.980
 medium and a big cone at the end we're going to 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.930
 do a series of exercises as I said 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.510
 previously to strengthen the part 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.730
 technique and mobility of the players 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.770
 the exercise 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.020
 because it is located the player who is 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.800
 in front of us forward the red color 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.500
 on the lateral line can be 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.800
 moves about 6 meters 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.090
 we are attracting more the frontal 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.510
 emphasizing always in the evolution by 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.510
 floor 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.010
 another variant of the same work now the 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.740
 ball does not move much ground the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.510
 player if you are going to look for the contact be 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.520
 front and he returns to his position 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.870
 initial what's important or what 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.400
 development of this work is that the 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.190
 player gets used to always going to 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.590
 look for the ball touched and I'll focus 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.110
 touched and I go backwards forces me to 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.550
 work anticipation and search 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.550
 always the ball in the game 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.470
 this is a routine that can also 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.270
 prepared as a heat input 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.890
 for more meaningful work within 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.100
 of training 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.380
 driving you see return to the first cone 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.090
 passed the ball and mix was presented 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.219
 control 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.009
 back to the first cone and add a 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:51.229
 work of greater mobility always of 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.400
 technical requirement and speed in the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:59.320
 I give it back to work cone 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.320
 step and peak to the starting position 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.220
 the red I turn to the orange cone and in 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.500
 sun passed control driving 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.770
 he left the ball still speed towards the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.380
 second with return I make the pass and I come 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.390
 in speed another variant remember 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.330
 that we are using a ball for 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.700
 couples and we only need two cones in 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.520
 this case a saucer and a cone so that 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.209
 distance or space is not located 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.209
 that we are going to work 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.970
 next we see another variant the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.950
 player now moves towards the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.150
 second with makes one more driving 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.860
 long in speed goes around the cone 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.989
 and when it reaches the cone in the middle of it 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.150
 to be unreal and splash these are 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.130
 simple works but they serve to 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.060
 get warm to improve the strong 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.690
 technique to strengthen some flaw 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.090
 specifically in such elements 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.780
 simple as driving control 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.780
 or the pass 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.190
 the variable plus driving color red 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:16.430
 for the ball he moved to the second 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.620
 with there I will receive the control ball 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.990
 and I bring it to create the companion of 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.710
 college 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.290
 stop and pass second speed with help 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.270
 to receive the control ball and bring it 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.760
 there are a series of exercises that we can 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.640
 do but this time I did illustrate 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.960
 what we can do in pairs with two 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.000
 cones or dishes each 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.670
 the two players one at each end of 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.660
 the work area dribble with 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.780
 the cones that we have located 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.380
 strategically in the center receives the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.790
 player drives makes a feint passes the 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.620
 ball and the other one is returned from back 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.640
 player does the same thing makes a deception 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.640
 to leave the state 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.480
 now let's do a series of 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.959
 exercises a little more complex than 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.739
 it requires a more technical and greater work 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.739
 of major milestones 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.910
 speed back to the first cone 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.970
 I receive the ball only now by 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.400
 up chest control stopped the ball 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.250
 delivery and peak until the second bonus and 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.170
 I will receive the pass and bring it in 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.610
 speed and we add a little more 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.030
 difficulty that is the work of 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.740
 speed locate me well control it with 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:43.090
 the chest in this case with the thigh 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.190
 look at control 130 as fast as possible 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.789
 from peak to second with where I'm going 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.789
 to receive more 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.930
 They are actions for the football game 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.540
 and then you have to recreate the form 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.900
 more real more like the game in 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.900
 function 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.610
 let's add a difficulty now that 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.700
 it's going to be a chest control for the 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.720
 return to the first cone and do the work 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.720
 of speed 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.590
 let's add the difficulty the player 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.990
 control of the chest the turn in the 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.990
 first with step comes to pick up the 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.400
 the ball again will be the same but 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.470
 now very up to the second with the 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.770
 speed is like I said we are adding 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.910
 a series of variations of the exercise 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.910
 but emphasizing 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:38.230
 driving ball control 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:42.190
 the key is that we do it the best 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:45.340
 way and the great speed a football today 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.490
 day is technical diffusion technique in 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.490
 speed 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.510
 the last variant that I'm going to do now 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.640
 Word and Calco does not receive twice for the 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.220
 floor and will return by the edge 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.230
 The red cone moves to the 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.270
 first and it will return a head cut 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.390
 now it's going to move in speed the 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.790
 second cone receives the ball and goes to 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.500
 bring in speed is another kind of 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.600
 already combined a little bit more 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.300
 of difficulty I always extend the 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.980
 whistle speed inner right edge 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.610
 by internal left scroll 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.260
 cone speed I receive from above 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.110
 return to the hands equation second 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.430
 cone equal to receive the stick 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.870
 to bring her 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.570
 as I said earlier we can make a 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:36.050
 Exercise always looking for development 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.789
 of technical or technical physical work and 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.610
 Well in this case, in front of a 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:42.620
 series of variants I hope that you your 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.169
 trainings incorporate this kind of 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.810
 exercises or add improvements so that 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:50.180
 have more benefits for your team we 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:55.690
 we see the next but let's tell them 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.690
 they are taking advantage of the videos
