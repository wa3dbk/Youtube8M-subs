in<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.890> lungs<00:01:02.100> which<00:01:02.399> allows<00:01:02.940> them<00:01:03.180> to

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
in the lungs which allows them to

Snyder<00:01:06.270> says<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.960> prevents<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> lungs<00:01:07.770> from

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100

operating<00:01:08.790> normally<00:01:09.110> anecdotally<00:01:10.159> most
