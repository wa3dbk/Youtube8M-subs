you've got the compact fluorescent light
bulbs<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.159> are<00:01:29.310> power<00:01:29.640> efficient<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.329> then

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
bulbs which are power efficient and then

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.940 
bulbs which are power efficient and then
these<00:01:30.659> LED<00:01:31.049> bulbs<00:01:31.290> which<00:01:31.380> are<00:01:31.470> even<00:01:31.740> more

so<00:01:48.360> let's<00:01:48.390> say<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.740> picture<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.369> your

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
so let's say you have a picture on your

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.819 
so let's say you have a picture on your
wall<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:51.299> has<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.720> color<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.140> sunset<00:01:52.649> you

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
wall that has the color of a sunset you

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.100 
wall that has the color of a sunset you
can<00:01:53.009> actually<00:01:53.340> make<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.939> lights<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.840> those

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
can actually make the lights have those

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.840 
can actually make the lights have those
colors<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.590> them<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.070> kind<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.490> create

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
colors in them so you kind of create

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.539 
colors in them so you kind of create
this<00:01:57.090> mood<00:01:57.719> within<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.320> room<00:01:58.530> or<00:01:58.920> maybe<00:01:59.250> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
this mood within a room or maybe you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.179 
this mood within a room or maybe you
want<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.790> have<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.240> light<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.380> very

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
want to have a light that is very

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.770 
want to have a light that is very
conducive<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.880> paying<00:02:03.149> attention<00:02:03.630> or

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
conducive to paying attention or

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.499 
conducive to paying attention or
studying<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.799> bright<00:02:05.340> light<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.149> really

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
studying a very bright light that really

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.419 
studying a very bright light that really
focuses<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.649> kind<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.190> natural

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
focuses and it's kind of like a natural

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.460 
focuses and it's kind of like a natural
sort<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.060> sunlight<00:02:09.539> I'm<00:02:09.720> not<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> lighting

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
sort of sunlight I'm not a lighting

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.320 
sort of sunlight I'm not a lighting
expert<00:02:10.560> as<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.250> tell<00:02:11.459> but<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.000> foss

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
expert as you can tell but the the foss

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.670 
expert as you can tell but the the foss
they<00:02:12.510> seem<00:02:12.690> really<00:02:12.930> cool<00:02:13.080> here<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.350> let's<00:02:13.530> just

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
they seem really cool here so let's just

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.010 
they seem really cool here so let's just
take<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> look<00:02:14.160> inside<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.090> packaging<00:02:15.630> and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
take a look inside the packaging and

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.350 
take a look inside the packaging and
exactly<00:02:16.710> what<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:18.030> get<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:20.000> by<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.060> way<00:02:21.210> this

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
exactly what we get and by the way this

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.860 
exactly what we get and by the way this
system<00:02:21.570> can<00:02:21.900> handle<00:02:22.140> up<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.320> 52<00:02:23.690> lightbulbs<00:02:24.690> so

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
system can handle up to 52 lightbulbs so

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.720 
system can handle up to 52 lightbulbs so
if<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.590> flood<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:25.980> too<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.370> could<00:02:26.460> put<00:02:26.640> your

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
if you flood it too you could put your

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.120 
if you flood it too you could put your
whole<00:02:26.970> house<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.540> this<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.960> each<00:02:28.440> individual

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
whole house on this and each individual

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.500 
whole house on this and each individual
light<00:02:29.370> bulb<00:02:29.610> can<00:02:29.760> be<00:02:29.820> linked<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.300> one<00:02:30.480> another

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
light bulb can be linked to one another

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.810 
light bulb can be linked to one another
so<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.530> could<00:02:31.800> press<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.280> button<00:02:32.310> for<00:02:32.790> a

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
so you could press one button for a

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.760 
so you could press one button for a
party<00:02:33.180> mode<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.540> one<00:02:33.690> button<00:02:33.930> for<00:02:34.020> relaxation

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
party mode of one button for relaxation

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.770 
party mode of one button for relaxation
mode<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.400> all<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:35.940> light<00:02:36.120> bulbs<00:02:36.420> respond

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
mode and all of the light bulbs respond

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.820 
mode and all of the light bulbs respond
differently<00:02:36.990> throughout<00:02:37.530> your<00:02:37.650> house

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
differently throughout your house

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.560 
differently throughout your house
whether<00:02:38.130> you're<00:02:38.610> connecting<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.360> to

whether you're connecting this to

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.600 
whether you're connecting this to
overhead<00:02:40.320> lighting<00:02:40.590> when<00:02:40.950> you're<00:02:41.070> connecting

overhead lighting when you're connecting

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.150 
overhead lighting when you're connecting
it<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.720> lamp<00:02:43.200> which<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.710> probably<00:02:43.950> what<00:02:44.130> most

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
it to a lamp which is probably what most

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.010 
it to a lamp which is probably what most
people<00:02:44.490> are<00:02:44.580> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.760> be<00:02:44.880> doing<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.840> we've

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
people are going to be doing so we've

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.800 
people are going to be doing so we've
got<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.550> ethernet<00:02:47.550> cord<00:02:47.820> here<00:02:48.180> interesting

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
got a ethernet cord here interesting

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.940 
got a ethernet cord here interesting
alright<00:02:49.080> because<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.410> connect<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.770> ethernet

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
alright because we connect the ethernet

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.330 
alright because we connect the ethernet
cable<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:51.150> guy<00:02:51.500> which<00:02:52.500> makes<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:52.890> Wi-Fi

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
cable to this guy which makes a Wi-Fi

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.460 
cable to this guy which makes a Wi-Fi
mesh<00:02:53.640> network<00:02:54.030> for<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.360> light<00:02:54.510> bulbs<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.110> can't

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
mesh network for the light bulbs I can't

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.660 
mesh network for the light bulbs I can't
believe<00:02:55.620> they<00:02:55.709> put<00:02:55.860> Wi-Fi<00:02:56.070> chips<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.580> light

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
believe they put Wi-Fi chips and light

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.440

and they've got LEDs in them a series of

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.360 
and they've got LEDs in them a series of
LEDs<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.200> be<00:03:22.320> able<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.470> make<00:03:22.620> those<00:03:22.769> 16<00:03:23.160> million

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.050 
colors so I'm super curious about these
whether<00:03:26.100> this<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.459> something<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.820> actually

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
whether this is something that actually

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.820 
whether this is something that actually
makes<00:03:27.420> life<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.900> little<00:03:28.019> bit<00:03:28.230> better<00:03:28.290> or<00:03:28.709> if

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
makes life a little bit better or if

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.320 
makes life a little bit better or if
it's<00:03:28.920> just<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.130> complete<00:03:29.430> novelty<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:29.970> who

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
it's just a complete novelty and who

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.840 
it's just a complete novelty and who
cares<00:03:30.660> about<00:03:30.900> having<00:03:31.170> 16<00:03:31.500> million<00:03:31.709> colors<00:03:31.950> so

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
cares about having 16 million colors so

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.009 
cares about having 16 million colors so
