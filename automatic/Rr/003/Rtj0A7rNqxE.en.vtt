so<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.160> thought<00:00:21.590> well<00:00:22.590> she<00:00:23.310> give<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.670> shot<00:00:23.880> and

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
so I thought well she give it a shot and

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.290 
so I thought well she give it a shot and
I<00:00:25.260> had<00:00:25.680> never<00:00:25.890> really<00:00:26.220> had<00:00:26.369> bangs<00:00:26.760> before

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
I had never really had bangs before

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000 
I had never really had bangs before
which<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> little<00:00:28.199> weird<00:00:28.410> for<00:00:28.500> me<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:28.980> I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
which is a little weird for me but I

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.609 
which is a little weird for me but I
actually<00:00:29.220> think<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.390> them<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.929> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
actually think that I like them and a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.220 
actually think that I like them and a
lot<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.309> people<00:00:32.579> told<00:00:32.730> me<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.540> was<00:00:33.989> better

expected so it's not horrible um the
only<00:01:06.450> complaint<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.740> with<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
only complaint I have with this is that

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.859 
only complaint I have with this is that
there<00:01:09.119> no<00:01:09.299> comb<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:11.210> personally<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.390> comb<00:01:12.630> I

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
there no comb I personally like comb I

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.200 
there no comb I personally like comb I
know<00:01:12.960> some<00:01:13.170> people<00:01:13.290> don't<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.820> not<00:01:14.970> too

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
know some people don't so it's not too

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.620 
know some people don't so it's not too
bad<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.450> guess<00:01:15.619> there<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:17.880> abandon<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
bad I guess there is a just abandon the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.800 
bad I guess there is a just abandon the
back<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.970> really<00:01:21.210> want<00:01:21.390> combs<00:01:21.600> I

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
back and if you really want combs I

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.030 
back and if you really want combs I
suppose<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.439> shove<00:01:22.770> them<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.509> and

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
suppose you can just shove them in and

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.300 
suppose you can just shove them in and
bangs

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
bangs

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.249 
bangs
I<00:01:26.460> thought<00:01:26.700> at<00:01:27.030> first<00:01:27.060> when<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.659> bought<00:01:27.840> them<00:01:28.049> I

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
I thought at first when I bought them I

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.100 
I thought at first when I bought them I
thought<00:01:28.470> they<00:01:28.530> were<00:01:29.490> too<00:01:29.880> thin<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
thought they were too thin and on the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.899 
thought they were too thin and on the
picture<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.829> look<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> website<00:01:32.460> they

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
picture if you look on the website they

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.999 
picture if you look on the website they
are<00:01:32.939> actually<00:01:33.600> they<00:01:33.780> look<00:01:33.930> very<00:01:33.960> very<00:01:34.710> thin

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
are actually they look very very thin

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.550 
are actually they look very very thin
and<00:01:35.220> they're<00:01:35.310> actually<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:36.869> which

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and they're actually not that then which

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.120 
and they're actually not that then which
I<00:01:37.829> was<00:01:38.040> happy<00:01:38.159> about<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:40.409> more<00:01:40.590> wear<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
I was happy about but the more wear it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.800 
I was happy about but the more wear it
the<00:01:41.280> more<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.150> okay<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the more I think that it's okay like it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.630 
the more I think that it's okay like it
wouldn't<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.170> bad<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> banks<00:01:44.189> were<00:01:44.310> fuller

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
wouldn't be bad if the banks were fuller

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.670 
wouldn't be bad if the banks were fuller
but<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.750> okay<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.409> too<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:49.350> yeah

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
but it's okay like this too and so yeah

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.289 
but it's okay like this too and so yeah
the<00:01:49.829> combs<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.340> bangs<00:01:50.610> were<00:01:50.909> my<00:01:51.030> only

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the combs and bangs were my only

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.819 
the combs and bangs were my only
complaint<00:01:51.570> stuff<00:01:51.899> like<00:01:52.200> otherwise<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.600 
like alright this one is probably one
they<00:04:21.169> haven't<00:04:21.470> stopped<00:04:21.739> that's<00:04:22.010> why<00:04:22.250> but

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
they haven't stopped that's why but

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.870 
they haven't stopped that's why but
still<00:04:23.410> it's<00:04:24.410> nice<00:04:24.680> I<00:04:24.860> guess<00:04:25.070> this<00:04:25.370> is<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.580> only

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
still it's nice I guess this is the only

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.090 
still it's nice I guess this is the only
wig<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.180> think<00:04:26.419> that<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:26.750> will<00:04:26.960> ever<00:04:27.500> buy<00:04:27.889> from

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.790 
wig I think that I will ever buy from
them<00:04:28.310> again<00:04:28.460> because<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:30.860> takes<00:04:31.250> too<00:04:31.460> long

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800
