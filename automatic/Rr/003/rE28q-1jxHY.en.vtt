00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 an air hostess who died in 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.410
 practicing his profession and a husband whose 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.580
 life is broken since the accident that 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.440
 took the life of his wife 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.599
 patrick verb she had never been 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.280
 expressed in the press if he speaks 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.350
 today is that he does not believe 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.000
 still not at the official version 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.680
 I hope that Russian justice and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.020
 French will try to bring us 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.820
 the answers because the thesis of 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.090
 the accident the more I thought about it 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.640
 think 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.160
 it is almost midnight this 20 October 2014 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.590
 at the airport of vnukovo in Moscow a 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.750
 falcon 50 is about to take off on board 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.700
 christophe de margerie the president of 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.010
 total and three crew members 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.809
 the pilots think he sees a car at 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.540
 far off the track it's actually 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.980
 of a snow plow a doubt maybe but 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.780
 like the control tower does not give them 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.840
 no information he does not care 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.230
 more the plane is going up and that's the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 shock 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.890
 for patrick vervelle that would not 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.199
 never had to happen 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.100
 there is snow eight months a year which 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.010
 to be eight times the snow 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.960
 it is midnight that 3 snowblowers make 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.190
 midnight whereas since the morning they 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.589
 should theoretically be removed if there is 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.930
 snowdrifts have nearly 2 to 5 cm 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.820
 snow on moscow's this weekend there the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.920
 pilot waiting behind 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.080
 falcon says in his interview 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.040
 anyway it was not snowing the track 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.549
 was wet by the rain 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.890
 it was raining then I wondered other 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.259
 inconsistency according to him the actions of this 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.420
 man bladimir martin and co the 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.880
 driver of the snowplow involved he 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.439
 know very well as snow clearers 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.960
 we're not going through a soundtrack 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.340
 authorization of his conveyor or without 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.619
 the authorization of the control tower 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.610
 apparently they ask for nothing he 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.590
 crosses the track 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.869
 he does not take a look left right 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.200
 it seems surprising he returns to the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.990
 lily 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.149
 so he stops on a third of the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.649
 track it stops 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.869
 he cut them off the engine he would 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.100
 descended geneva the magic my captain 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.770
 it's not an accident it will be a 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.299
 bombing questions that does not oppose 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.210
 not all families of victims 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.649
 joined by bfmtv the pilot's father by 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.689
 example considers that these words 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.939
 come up I quote from anything 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.799
 patrick vervelle still counts 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.539
 get those answers then what I 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.430
 would like is that the truth be made 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.020
 but do not close one too 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.300
 ten years 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.310
 an incident we go no further 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.460
 that we prospect a little bit in 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.230
 trying to find out who would benefit 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.400
 already this accident if he would 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.260
 interesting to know 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.420
 I am serene but I say to myself but he 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.010
 must for russian anna to make him 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.320
 tribute the truth must one day 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.030
 burst just like two other families 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.720
 patrick vervelle was part of 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.570
 civil 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.160
 so far only christophe's family 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.160
 of margerie is not imitate them
