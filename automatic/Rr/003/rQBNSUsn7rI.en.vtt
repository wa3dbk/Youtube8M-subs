00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
okay well see we're going to talk about

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.299 
okay well see we're going to talk about
this<00:00:08.330> particular<00:00:10.660> ampere<00:00:11.660> this<00:00:11.780> matchless

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
this particular ampere this matchless

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.860 
this particular ampere this matchless
c30<00:00:13.309> reverb<00:00:13.700> there's<00:00:14.570> something<00:00:14.780> real

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
c30 reverb there's something real

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.140 
c30 reverb there's something real
special<00:00:14.990> about<00:00:15.380> these<00:00:15.830> amps<00:00:16.160> here<00:00:16.279> because

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
special about these amps here because

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.339 
special about these amps here because
sometimes<00:00:17.689> when<00:00:18.439> you're<00:00:18.529> doing<00:00:18.740> TV<00:00:19.360> yeah<00:00:20.360> well

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:21.349 
sometimes when you're doing TV yeah well

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:22.990 
sometimes when you're doing TV yeah well
how<00:00:21.560> should<00:00:21.739> I<00:00:21.800> say<00:00:21.980> it<00:00:22.009> I<00:00:22.340> don't<00:00:22.730> know<00:00:22.790> whose

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
how should I say it I don't know whose

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.019 
how should I say it I don't know whose
gear<00:00:23.239> this<00:00:23.360> is<00:00:23.540> but<00:00:24.759> sometimes<00:00:25.759> it<00:00:25.880> would<00:00:25.970> do

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
gear this is but sometimes it would do

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.760 
gear this is but sometimes it would do
tracks<00:00:26.360> you<00:00:26.720> know<00:00:26.809> like<00:00:26.989> the<00:00:27.140> record<00:00:27.500> tracks

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
tracks you know like the record tracks

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.650 
tracks you know like the record tracks
ahead<00:00:28.130> of<00:00:28.220> time<00:00:28.369> so<00:00:28.880> it's<00:00:29.029> technically<00:00:29.360> live

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
ahead of time so it's technically live

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.839 
ahead of time so it's technically live
because<00:00:30.529> they're<00:00:31.009> recording<00:00:31.399> the<00:00:31.460> live<00:00:31.610> band

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
because they're recording the live band

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.560 
because they're recording the live band
at<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:32.290> studio<00:00:33.290> but<00:00:33.559> then<00:00:33.739> they<00:00:34.329> they<00:00:35.329> get<00:00:35.450> to

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
at the studio but then they they get to

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.810 
at the studio but then they they get to
the<00:00:35.719> actual<00:00:36.440> TV<00:00:36.860> part<00:00:37.190> of<00:00:37.280> it<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:37.550> they<00:00:37.609> play

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
the actual TV part of it and they play

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.389 
the actual TV part of it and they play
the<00:00:38.000> tracks<00:00:38.269> that<00:00:38.390> they<00:00:38.510> recorded<00:00:39.019> live<00:00:39.399> so

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
the tracks that they recorded live so

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:41.829 
the tracks that they recorded live so
that's<00:00:40.670> how<00:00:40.820> they<00:00:40.969> kind<00:00:41.120> of<00:00:41.269> it's<00:00:41.600> kind<00:00:41.750> of<00:00:41.780> a

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
that's how they kind of it's kind of a

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.979 
that's how they kind of it's kind of a
trick<00:00:42.109> live<00:00:42.999> concept<00:00:43.999> and<00:00:44.629> that's<00:00:44.719> what<00:00:44.899> these

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
trick live concept and that's what these

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.630 
trick live concept and that's what these
amps<00:00:45.230> are<00:00:45.320> for<00:00:45.499> see<00:00:45.649> these<00:00:45.800> match<00:00:46.010> this<00:00:46.219> check

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
amps are for see these match this check

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.239 
amps are for see these match this check
it<00:00:46.730> out<00:00:46.850> here<00:00:47.089> see<00:00:47.300> this<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:48.649> if<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:48.920> look<00:00:49.100> at

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249 
it out here see this and if you look at

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.439 
it out here see this and if you look at
how<00:00:49.999> they're<00:00:50.480> all<00:00:50.629> set<00:00:50.929> you<00:00:51.769> know<00:00:52.449> sitting

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
how they're all set you know sitting

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:54.279 
how they're all set you know sitting
really<00:00:53.690> don't<00:00:53.960> matter

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
really don't matter

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
a whole lot on this particular amp and

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.270 
a whole lot on this particular amp and
I'll<00:00:57.050> show<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:57.230> why<00:00:57.350> in<00:00:57.469> a<00:00:57.530> second<00:00:57.920> they<00:00:58.100> power

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
I'll show you why in a second they power

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.059 
I'll show you why in a second they power
up<00:00:58.519> you<00:00:58.699> know<00:00:58.819> everything

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
the interesting part about these amps

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.560 
the interesting part about these amps
that<00:01:03.079> are<00:01:03.229> being<00:01:03.350> used<00:01:03.589> today<00:01:04.089> is<00:01:05.089> what's<00:01:05.449> on

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
that are being used today is what's on

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.100 
that are being used today is what's on
the<00:01:05.600> back<00:01:05.870> side<00:01:07.570> Hey<00:01:08.570> look<00:01:09.560> at<00:01:09.740> that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
the back side Hey look at that

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.360 
the back side Hey look at that
see<00:01:12.110> they're<00:01:12.890> powered<00:01:13.280> up<00:01:14.470> power<00:01:15.470> cable<00:01:15.920> this

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
see they're powered up power cable this

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.930 
see they're powered up power cable this
controls<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:18.020> LED<00:01:18.470> light<00:01:18.680> on<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.430> front<00:01:19.700> just

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
controls the LED light on the front just

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.610 
controls the LED light on the front just
just<00:01:20.480> a<00:01:20.540> little<00:01:20.750> light<00:01:20.870> bulb<00:01:20.990> on<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.200> front<00:01:21.470> to

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
just a little light bulb on the front to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.250 
just a little light bulb on the front to
light<00:01:21.770> it<00:01:21.890> up<00:01:21.980> as<00:01:22.850> well<00:01:23.180> as<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.990> matchless

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.880 

matchless<00:01:27.260> light<00:01:27.470> right<00:01:27.650> there

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
matchless light right there

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.020 
matchless light right there
so<00:01:28.790> these<00:01:28.940> ants<00:01:29.560> aren't<00:01:30.560> actually<00:01:30.920> being

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.460 

there's<00:01:35.030> no<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.720> your<00:01:36.050> speakers<00:01:36.440> or

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
there's no to your speakers or

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.740 
there's no to your speakers or
electronics<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.490> then<00:01:37.580> they're<00:01:37.760> just<00:01:37.790> fake

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
electronics and then they're just fake

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.950 
electronics and then they're just fake
little<00:01:38.930> amps<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:40.190> sometimes<00:01:40.780> that's<00:01:41.780> how

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
little amps and sometimes that's how

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.310 
little amps and sometimes that's how
it's<00:01:42.140> done<00:01:42.370> all<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.490> time<00:01:43.610> but<00:01:44.200> once<00:01:45.200> in<00:01:45.290> a

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
it's done all the time but once in a

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.440 
it's done all the time but once in a
while<00:01:45.470> with<00:01:46.460> the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
while with the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.970 
while with the
nationalists<00:01:48.230> c30<00:01:48.620> retriever<00:01:49.310> still<00:01:50.180> a<00:01:50.210> clamp

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
nationalists c30 retriever still a clamp

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.140 
nationalists c30 retriever still a clamp
and<00:01:51.980> the<00:01:52.130> actual<00:01:52.460> amp<00:01:52.640> is<00:01:52.760> still<00:01:52.940> little

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
and the actual amp is still little

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.750 
and the actual amp is still little
colder<00:01:53.650> and<00:01:54.650> even<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.950> fake<00:01:55.070> ampere<00:01:55.370> to<00:01:55.550> it<00:01:55.670> I

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
colder and even the fake ampere to it I

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.410 
colder and even the fake ampere to it I
still<00:01:56.000> don't<00:01:56.120> know<00:01:57.160> anyways<00:01:58.190> that's<00:01:59.180> one

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
still don't know anyways that's one

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.840 
still don't know anyways that's one
thing<00:01:59.600> okay
