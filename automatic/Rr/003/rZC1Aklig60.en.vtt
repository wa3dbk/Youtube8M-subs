00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.330 

now<00:01:17.050> I<00:01:17.080> haven't<00:01:17.290> taught<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.710> anything<00:01:17.890> yet<00:01:18.160> so

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
now I haven't taught you anything yet so

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.850 
now I haven't taught you anything yet so
I'll<00:01:18.460> show<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:18.760> I<00:01:19.410> believe<00:01:20.410> it's<00:01:20.620> going<00:01:20.770> to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
I'll show you I believe it's going to

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.140 
I'll show you I believe it's going to
start<00:01:21.130> even<00:01:21.460> though<00:01:21.490> it<00:01:21.670> hasn't<00:01:21.820> been<00:01:21.970> started

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
start even though it hasn't been started

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.030 
start even though it hasn't been started
so<00:01:22.450> long<00:01:22.600> we<00:01:23.230> got<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.560> get<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:23.800> job<00:01:24.010> done

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
so long we got to get the job done

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.700 
so long we got to get the job done
before<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:25.660> rain<00:01:25.870> comes<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.960> always<00:01:29.320> starts

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
before the rain comes it's always starts

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.480 
before the rain comes it's always starts
so<00:01:29.950> I'm<00:01:30.220> hoping<00:01:31.980> this<00:01:32.980> is<00:01:33.160> called<00:01:33.400> the

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
so I'm hoping this is called the

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.270 
so I'm hoping this is called the
decompression<00:01:34.000> lever<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:35.770> try<00:01:35.950> pulling

that knob it's hard to pull all the way

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.100 
that knob it's hard to pull all the way

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
choke off if I say more choke you pull

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.990 
choke off if I say more choke you pull
the<00:03:22.049> choke<00:03:22.260> almost<00:03:22.739> all<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.130> way<00:03:23.250> out<00:03:23.459> not

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
the choke almost all the way out not

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.819 
the choke almost all the way out not
quite<00:03:24.060> as<00:03:24.359> far<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.720> now<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.500> give<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.769> a

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
quite as far it is now to give it a

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.110 
quite as far it is now to give it a
little<00:03:25.980> bit<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.220> chocolate<00:03:26.340> starting<00:03:27.000> and

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
little bit of chocolate starting and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.699 
little bit of chocolate starting and
then<00:03:27.180> when<00:03:27.329> I<00:03:27.359> say<00:03:27.630> off<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:28.079> push<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.440> in<00:03:28.590> again

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
then when I say off you push it in again

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.280 
then when I say off you push it in again
because<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:30.209> sort<00:03:30.419> of<00:03:30.480> likes<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.900> full<00:03:31.049> choke

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
because this sort of likes to full choke

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.770 
because this sort of likes to full choke
when<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.560> starts<00:03:31.859> then<00:03:32.519> no<00:03:32.760> choke<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.599> then<00:03:33.690> a

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
when it starts then no choke and then a

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.400 
when it starts then no choke and then a
little<00:03:33.959> bit<00:03:34.109> of<00:03:34.230> choke<00:03:35.239> so<00:03:36.239> we<00:03:36.810> put<00:03:37.019> this<00:03:37.169> back

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
little bit of choke so we put this back

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.960 
little bit of choke so we put this back
in<00:03:37.620> neutral<00:03:37.799> so<00:03:38.190> push<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.549> clutch<00:03:38.700> all<00:03:38.940> the
