00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
talking to him pretty much the entire

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.120 
talking to him pretty much the entire
day<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:21.930> two<00:02:21.990> days<00:02:22.290> after<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.740> got<00:02:22.890> back<00:02:22.950> from

day so two days after I got back from

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.190 
day so two days after I got back from
England<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.670> was<00:02:23.790> completely<00:02:24.150> tired<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.720> was

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
England and was completely tired I was

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.600
