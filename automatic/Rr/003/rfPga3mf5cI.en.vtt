quick review on the bike lock system
that<00:00:12.920> I<00:00:13.370> bought<00:00:14.030> it's<00:00:14.990> a<00:00:15.080> bit<00:00:15.320> overkill<00:00:15.679> for

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
that I bought it's a bit overkill for

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.880 
that I bought it's a bit overkill for
your<00:00:16.279> standard<00:00:16.700> bike<00:00:16.910> but<00:00:17.450> it<00:00:18.140> seems<00:00:18.470> to<00:00:18.650> work

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
your standard bike but it seems to work

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.010 
your standard bike but it seems to work
pretty<00:00:18.920> good<00:00:19.750> it<00:00:20.750> consists<00:00:21.199> of<00:00:21.320> an<00:00:21.830> Avis<00:00:22.520> 14<00:00:23.420> KS

this<00:00:38.660> lock<00:00:39.500> was<00:00:39.860> originally<00:00:40.370> designed<00:00:40.610> to

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
this lock was originally designed to

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.950 
this lock was originally designed to
secure<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.680> outer<00:00:42.710> hatch<00:00:43.219> of<00:00:43.520> Tanks<00:00:43.969> and<00:00:44.149> can

withstand 50,000 pounds of tensile force

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.459 
withstand 50,000 pounds of tensile force
it's<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.579> pretty<00:00:49.850> heavy-duty<00:00:50.270> lock<00:00:50.719> good

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
it's a pretty heavy-duty lock good

it's a pretty heavy-duty lock good
enough<00:00:51.710> for<00:00:52.010> your<00:00:52.219> pedal<00:00:52.850> bike<00:00:53.000> I<00:00:53.270> should

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
enough for your pedal bike I should

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.750 
enough for your pedal bike I should
think<00:00:54.850> so<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.120> Avis<00:00:56.449> chain<00:00:56.809> is<00:00:57.379> 2<00:00:58.340> feet<00:00:58.520> long

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
think so the Avis chain is 2 feet long

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.620 
think so the Avis chain is 2 feet long
it<00:00:59.059> has<00:01:00.340> rounded<00:01:01.340> squares<00:01:02.680> links<00:01:04.059> it<00:01:05.059> has<00:01:05.390> this

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
it has rounded squares links it has this

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.870 
it has rounded squares links it has this
cover<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:06.290> keeps<00:01:07.189> you<00:01:07.280> from<00:01:07.310> digging<00:01:07.640> up

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
cover that keeps you from digging up

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.320 
cover that keeps you from digging up
your<00:01:08.689> bicycle<00:01:09.560> well<00:01:10.400> that<00:01:10.640> one<00:01:10.909> end<00:01:11.150> is<00:01:11.299> a

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
your bicycle well that one end is a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.880 
your bicycle well that one end is a
little<00:01:11.479> bit<00:01:11.810> longer<00:01:12.049> than<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.380> other<00:01:12.439> which

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
little bit longer than the other which

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.200 
little bit longer than the other which
allows<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:14.260> go<00:01:15.260> through<00:01:15.560> for<00:01:15.950> locking<00:01:16.549> one

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
allows it to go through for locking one

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.289 
allows it to go through for locking one
thing<00:01:17.540> that<00:01:17.689> I<00:01:17.720> really<00:01:18.140> like<00:01:18.350> about<00:01:18.850> this<00:01:19.880> Avis

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
thing that I really like about this Avis

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.350 
thing that I really like about this Avis
lock<00:01:21.310> aside<00:01:22.310> from<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.610> fact<00:01:22.759> that<00:01:23.000> it<00:01:23.150> has<00:01:23.330> a

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
lock aside from the fact that it has a

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.920 
lock aside from the fact that it has a
really<00:01:24.320> high<00:01:24.500> security<00:01:25.270> core<00:01:26.270> it's<00:01:26.540> got<00:01:26.720> the

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
really high security core it's got the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.840 
really high security core it's got the
rotating<00:01:27.350> disc<00:01:27.560> cylinder<00:01:28.070> key<00:01:28.340> very<00:01:29.330> secure

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
rotating disc cylinder key very secure

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.550 
rotating disc cylinder key very secure
is<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.270> shackle<00:01:32.689> just<00:01:32.869> like<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:33.259> comes

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
is that the shackle just like it comes

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.780 
is that the shackle just like it comes
right<00:01:33.979> out<00:01:34.509> ball<00:01:35.509> bearing<00:01:35.960> lock<00:01:36.710> up<00:01:36.979> very

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
right out ball bearing lock up very

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.719 
right out ball bearing lock up very
secure<00:01:38.329> this<00:01:38.540> thing<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:40.310> know<00:01:40.400> when<00:01:40.579> it

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
secure this thing is you know when it

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.210 
secure this thing is you know when it
says<00:01:40.939> 50,000<00:01:41.810> pounds<00:01:42.409> of<00:01:42.500> tensile<00:01:42.890> strength

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
says 50,000 pounds of tensile strength

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.100 
says 50,000 pounds of tensile strength
when<00:01:43.759> you<00:01:43.820> pick<00:01:44.030> this<00:01:44.180> thing<00:01:44.240> up<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.689> you<00:01:44.899> can

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
when you pick this thing up you you can

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.319 
when you pick this thing up you you can
believe<00:01:45.560> that

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
believe that

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.990 
believe that
so<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.990> shackle<00:01:48.409> just<00:01:48.590> goes<00:01:49.189> through<00:01:49.220> the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
so the the shackle just goes through the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.850 
so the the shackle just goes through the
link<00:01:51.070> this<00:01:52.070> locks<00:01:52.460> up<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:56.049> your<00:01:57.049> bicycles<00:01:57.590> not

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
link this locks up and your bicycles not

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.070 
link this locks up and your bicycles not
going<00:01:58.549> anywhere

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
going anywhere

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.230 
going anywhere
so<00:02:00.620> this<00:02:00.740> is<00:02:00.860> pretty<00:02:01.010> good<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:01.490> have<00:02:01.820> to<00:02:01.940> admit

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
so this is pretty good I have to admit

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.970 
so this is pretty good I have to admit
that<00:02:03.340> for<00:02:04.340> day-to-day<00:02:04.900> this<00:02:05.900> setup<00:02:06.290> is<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:06.650> bit

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
that for day-to-day this setup is a bit

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.630 
that for day-to-day this setup is a bit
overkill<00:02:07.460> or<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:08.540> pedal<00:02:09.200> bike<00:02:09.350> but<00:02:10.220> if<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.490> know

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
overkill or a pedal bike but if you know

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.620 
overkill or a pedal bike but if you know
that<00:02:10.760> you're<00:02:10.910> going<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.090> be<00:02:11.180> leaving<00:02:11.360> your

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
that you're going to be leaving your

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.080 
that you're going to be leaving your
bike<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.140> high<00:02:12.560> risk<00:02:12.890> area<00:02:13.220> for<00:02:13.520> an<00:02:13.700> extended

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
bike in a high risk area for an extended

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.330 
bike in a high risk area for an extended
period<00:02:14.210> of<00:02:14.390> time<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.840> use<00:02:15.320> this<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:15.920> combination

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
period of time I use this in combination

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.590 
period of time I use this in combination
with<00:02:17.090> an<00:02:17.390> Avis<00:02:17.810> mini<00:02:18.200> D<00:02:18.470> lock<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.600> cobra

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
with an Avis mini D lock and a cobra

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.020 
with an Avis mini D lock and a cobra
cable<00:02:20.960> so<00:02:21.770> I<00:02:21.800> can<00:02:22.160> put<00:02:22.490> it<00:02:22.580> through<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.820> wheels

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
cable so I can put it through the wheels

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.150 
cable so I can put it through the wheels
and<00:02:23.270> get<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.650> frame<00:02:25.090> lock<00:02:26.090> ups<00:02:26.590> it's<00:02:27.590> enough<00:02:27.890> to

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
and get to frame lock ups it's enough to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160 
and get to frame lock ups it's enough to
make<00:02:28.490> a<00:02:28.730> thief<00:02:29.030> think<00:02:29.330> well<00:02:29.750> maybe<00:02:29.780> another

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
make a thief think well maybe another

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.790 
make a thief think well maybe another
bike<00:02:30.410> would<00:02:30.620> be<00:02:30.650> easier<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.130> get<00:02:32.140> or<00:02:33.140> force<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
bike would be easier to get or force the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.170 
bike would be easier to get or force the
thief<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.100> actually<00:02:34.340> destroy<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.700> bike<00:02:35.000> in

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
thief to actually destroy the bike in

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
for a pedal bike it might be a little

for a pedal bike it might be a little
bit<00:02:43.700> overkill<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.390> it's<00:02:44.960> definitely<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:46.220> bit

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
bit overkill and it's definitely a bit

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.130 
bit overkill and it's definitely a bit
on<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.210> pricey<00:02:47.450> side<00:02:47.600> so<00:02:48.140> my<00:02:49.180> security<00:02:50.180> setup

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.490 
on the pricey side so my security setup
is<00:02:51.800> probably<00:02:52.460> costs<00:02:52.880> about<00:02:53.410> one-fourth<00:02:54.410> of

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
is probably costs about one-fourth of

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.280 
is probably costs about one-fourth of
the<00:02:54.560> total<00:02:54.680> investment<00:02:55.520> of<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:56.600> actual<00:02:57.050> bike
