00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.180
 happiness is basically the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.139
 possibility and freedom to express if 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.240
 the same fear can prevent you from 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.809
 express yourself so the fear is 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.279
 a universal source of unhappiness 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.289
 we learn fear in contexts 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:25.289
 educational I borrow his 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.240
 obsessive personality that typical of the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.880
 our own culture we could say that 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.730
 all of our company has a fund of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.160
 obsessiveness on people tabs and dinner 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.750
 basically this is born of 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.480
 these are the origins there is a 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.489
 impulse to express themselves freely 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.890
 so if anyone says no there is 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.300
 another impulse and an eye is said 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.820
 another impulse is said no what yes 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.820
 will say this no education is needed 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.789
 and I say no education is not necessary 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.430
 it depends on what kind of no soul no 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.920
 yes or no and golico is not really 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:11.030
 need the no I'm talking about e 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.710
 no egoic no soul is simply 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.869
 the sweet hand of a parent who 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.200
 holds the field test of a child from 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.860
 is born to break against the wall and deviates it 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.830
 at the last moment it is a rumor that if 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.920
 he says no he says to drive in another 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.530
 way but does not say no no this is not 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.020
 infused with violence and violence 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.610
 child is scary 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.790
 so whether or not that loving no coming out 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.640
 from the heart there is a no that comes from 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:53.130
 violence is an oppressive no 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.649
 a structure of domination and power 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.540
 very well our society is imbued with 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.500
 no like that 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.500
 not only for children but a 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.930
 social level so you can't 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.759
 express yourself so you can't do this not 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.370
 you can do that other good suture 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.080
 excessive is farne born from 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.170
 this impulse no pulse no pulse no 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.270
 this is not gradually internalized 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.100
 so the structure if you notice what it is 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.960
 made by an impulse from an immediate 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.540
 against impulse that the internalized no 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.060
 but since this is contrary to life 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.770
 which presupposes freedom 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.420
 what happens there will be a part 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.910
 let's call it narcissist in ours 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.850
 terms we call the one that defends the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.400
 true identity of the nascent identity that 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:50.310
 what will make this no booty say 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.340
 this will then be repressed with a 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.650
 no, not even stronger this no 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.320
 so to oppress this no it will take 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.300
 another not driven that generates fear 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.300
 still maybe you miss the most 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.870
 then if this is true already at the level 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.390
 of childhood and then it is true plus level 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.620
 great is that leonardo boff speaks precisely 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:18.019
 of entire peoples who have absorbed no 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.810
 and so they learned to stay here 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:24.330
 attention here there is no freedom of 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.459
 express themselves by expressing what of 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.010
 express your soul your own 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.470
 true nature therefore from own to expense 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.890
 own biological impulses that come 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.230
 modulated by the soul in the healthy person 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.760
 instead here the fundamental impulses 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.130
 being of the human sociability 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.930
 expressions if they are blocked then 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.100
 we are faced with people 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:51.330
 basically living in fear 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.959
 the structure of the avoidant personality 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.850
 is one of the infinite variations of no 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.400
 internalized in the sense that I would like 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.160
 do I would like to say two words but me 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.610
 I hold back because I keep it 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.740
 just think of 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.200
 I'm going to tell her I'm scared 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.180
 fear of what of judgment but 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.400
 possible in adult judgment ligety 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.190
 that someone judges me the blocks a 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.730
 primary impulse like that of being able to 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.150
 to express 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.489
 sure why not he said now is not 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.210
 no more than a rubber band the no I receive 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:29.440
 now it is a rubber band of many others in the eye 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.810
 received before that is when I was 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.040
 small and therefore I was in the position of 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.020
 weakness and helplessness therefore great 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.490
 I relive those situations terry but that 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.120
 they can also be very terrible 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.370
 since childhood because there is this block 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.180
 of human expressiveness of expressing 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.530
 themselves of creativity but it is obvious it is 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.350
 inherent in the maintenance of this 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.370
 structure without the block 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.430
 of the expression of one's soul here 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.230
 this structure simply jumps e 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.820
 only thanks to having internalized the 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.640
 block to one's arthur expression 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.400
 al and that really is also the attention 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.050
 block of the creativity and block of the 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.240
 fully flush yourself and 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.330
 necessary step essential for 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.140
 the creativity that you need needs 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.780
 necessarily a secure base without 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.880
 there is a sure base of creativity and it is one 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.370
 very secure base practice 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.820
 what we need to internalize is the 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.130
 base which does what 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.169
 it only cancels fear when it is not there 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.919
 more fear then there will be no fear 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.020
 of judgment 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.540
 there was more last and judgment then it does 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.570
 people will express themselves freely and 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.550
 will learn to be in the world in harmony 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.190
 with who he really is and with his own 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.479
 hear but this is contrary I repeat to 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.479
 all power structures
