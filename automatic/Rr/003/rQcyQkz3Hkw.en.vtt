00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.189
 wow did you know that in 2003 in the USA a 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.559
 second- grader was expelled 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.590
 he was suspended from his school 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.350
 because the child brings a portal teachers 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.150
 like bread gringas cookies that you moses in 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.890
 the toaster and they jump and they're very good 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.039
 The case is that the child 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.170
 bit in the shape of mountain but people 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.930
 well the masters believed that he had 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.300
 done in the form of a weapon then what 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.669
 suspended for this in the life of the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.430
 schools in japan there is no one person 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.140
 that is dedicated to what is to clean the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.899
 bathrooms of a concierge as we did 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.960
 here in mexico and why because in japan 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.590
 the custom is that the same students 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.469
 clean the bathrooms 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.260
 this is a Buddhist tradition where 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.840
 relates cleanliness to morality 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.289
 in a study that was done in the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.020
 schools where lower level or lower 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.719
 rules are where they are most relaxed 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.239
 there is less bullying, less vandalism and 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.339
 the boys are more focused on their 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.130
 classes it turns out that 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.609
 give them many rules stresses them and 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.649
 generates these antisocial attitudes 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:16.049
 mussolini this Italian dictator to the 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:20.009
 10 years was expelled at school 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.719
 because he stabbed a classmate who was 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.689
 what happened for a sister in another 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:27.090
 school and that's exactly the same or 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.090
 I was crazy since I was little in Armenian 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.850
 children from 6 years old have 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.700
 what to wear your obligatory 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.099
 chess at the university of colombia in 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.349
 new york in the usa which is one of the 

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:42.479
 most prestigious universities and 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:45.000
 surely one of the most expensive a 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.860
 man managed to graduate but when I 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.869
 difference this man the rest of his 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.149
 students because this man at the same 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.369
 time that the student was also 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.349
 concierge at the same university was 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.450
 concierge for 12 years 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:00.989
 at the same time he paid for his studies to 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.530

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:07.289
 Saudi Arabia in 2002 15 children 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.329
 they died in a school as it turns out that 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.310
 a school fire but children do not 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.170
 they were allowed to leave 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.200
 of the school even though he was in 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.060
 flames because he did not bring the necessary clothes 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.880
 that they have to bring according to the rules 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.849
