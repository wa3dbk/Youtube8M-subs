00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello friends we are November 17 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.950
 from 2013 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.040
 and today I will satisfy one of your 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.860
 Doubts 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.760
 what is how to make a seed of 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.780
 olive 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.780
 a painting 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.840
 and we started the process there were going to be several 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:32.920
 videos where we will see how to perform 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:34.750
 the process of grading the seed and 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.090
 then we are going to stratify these 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.440
 seeds that you can qualify it during 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.320
 two months 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.110
 Now I am going to show you more closely the 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.090
 olive trees well in the olive trees in the part of 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.410
 up in the olive tree and the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.570
 seeds 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.150
 good as I told you at the beginning of 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.510
 video in this first phase we are going to 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.270
 collect the olives what are the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.600
 olives to keep in mind that we have 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.239
 to catch ripe olives this 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.190
 it means when the olives 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.890
 your skin is black 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.410
 the olive if you do not know is that 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.200
 you buy a green pot is because it's 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.240
 green does not exist the olive does not exist 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.100
 green and black but the olive 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.950
 when it is green it is green and 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.710
 when it reaches maturity in the period 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.860
 end of ripening is lilac 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.050
 black and to consider the seeds 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.600
 that serve us are seeds that we take 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.630
 in the field or in the mature tree 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.180
 let's see more closely and go to 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.480
 watch 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.180
 here in this area 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.370
 you are going to see a lot of seeds here 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.890
 we take advantage in the field we can not 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.840
 do it but here if you look you fall 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.850
 on a sidewalk and 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.729
 and the cortex there are you see 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.520
 these are the seeds what is the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.090
 flesh of the seed 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.990
 as people go by and the rush and so on 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.260
 they have already eliminated the meat part of 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.140
 the seed of the olive is already only 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.510
 is to take them and then we go to 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.269
 disqualify we are going to encourage what 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.750
 is the cortex to facilitate that 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.750
 germinate 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.920
 now let's see 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.040
 the tree 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.660
 this is valid for olives olive trees 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.780
 wild and for all variety of 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.450
 olive the face of the olive trees we are going to 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.040
 see if we reach there in the cup and if it 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.640
 can distinguish 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.100
 let's zoom 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.100
 and see if we get to see the olives 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.260
 they are there 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.780
 the olives are there in the center of 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:01.460
 group of them if you look at the color 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.560
 It is a lilac black color 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.819
 and this means that the olive is 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.730
 ripe in the olive that serves us to 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.790
 germinate a new tree and I tell you 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.999
 when you go to look for seeds always 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.290
 black lilac seeds the greens 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:22.780
 they serve us they do not serve us to do 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.400
 hotbed 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.000
 good 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.349
 and already in the next video until the 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.510
 first part we are going to do all the 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:39.019
 process then let's see how 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.019
 is to qualify the seed and how 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.610
 how 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.120
 after stratifying the e 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.610
 here that we are here we are now 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.870
 November 17 , 2013 but this 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.390
 You can do it in any process 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:00.090
 time of year to be a deciduous tree it 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.090
 can do better if it can be 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.709
 at the end of 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.190
 from winter to stratify and it's 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.190
 qualify 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.320
 the image moves a lot but it is that 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:24.720
 I'm started one that does not work out 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.720
 as I said to you first we are going to 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.820
 to stratify 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.280
 also from the cortex to qualify and 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.650
 after certifying vale 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.400
 I think it's been clear to you 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.600
 how to collect the seeds and now I'm going 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.890
 to start taking seeds 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:51.250
 clear these are the seeds here the 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.670
 we have to take the soil 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.040
 we are taking seeds yes yes in the 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.700
 field 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.370
 or you find them like this you see these blacks 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.280
 well 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.710
 there is the seed with the meat there we have 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.350
 other 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.320
 it would be better left to dry it 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:17.210
 we let dry about 15 days or so and 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:19.729
 then with our step well let's go 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.020
 like scouring pad or so we're going to 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.699
 remove the bark 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.610
 see how many seeds here is a 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:29.479
 lots of them 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.479
 here it makes our work easier 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.250
 as they are on a sidewalk as I said 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.940
 next to the tree there is a sidewalk 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.770
 we have clean 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.800
 the seeds 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.789
 I believe that for this year I will get 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.789
 there you have the olive 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.909
 cleansed 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.449
 this already congratulates us a lot the work 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:57.539
 because we're just going to have to file the 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.449
 bark we will continue to pick up more 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:04.400
 clear how many how easy it is when the 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:07.190
 seed falls 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.409
 you have the black olive that color that 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:13.070
 has to have the olive 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:16.900
 to make seedbed 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.900
 we will continue to pick olives 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:24.420
 the shell 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:28.670
 if you have we take more here 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.670
 how easy it is to take the seeds like this 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.499
 I believe that to do the demonstration 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.560
 I think there are enough of some 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:41.449
 I sold so many 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.879
 but good 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:45.710
 see how they are grouped here here that goes 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:49.130
 of friction 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:51.380
 there are a lot of olives with their 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.140
 Cortex 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:57.100
 yet here we have more there 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.100
 let's take them 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.639
 how can we do 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:09.789
 with 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:13.449
 olives from with olive trees to 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:15.510
 from seed good I will continue and 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:20.750
 I leave you here 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.750
 picking more olives already peeled
