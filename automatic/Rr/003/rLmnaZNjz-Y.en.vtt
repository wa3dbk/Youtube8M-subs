00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello good morning and thanks for 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.389
 accompany me again here in the kitchen 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.180
 of play break I like it very much in 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.620
 present them with another original recipe 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.050
 using our wake product 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.699
 up of brand flavor drive day 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.970
 today what we are going to do is introduce 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.210
 a chocolate syrup this to the whipped 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.429
 we're going to do with the EU think what 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.520
 first thing we're going to do is use the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.770
 ue to think as before is the one in this going to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.110
 be in the shape of a liter and what 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.230
 let's do is let's shake it to 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.420
 open it and enter it directly to 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.940
 our blender 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.770
 and also what we are going to do is 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.370
 add him 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.860
 our chocolate syrup that was formed 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.180
 using three quarters of a cup of 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.650
 milk with eight spoonfuls of cocoa 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.390
 already mixed chocolate let's introduce 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.460
 something of thought here in the blender 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.620
 and now what we are going to do and we are going to 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.060
 lift the case 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.450
 turn on the blender at half speed 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.240
 using the balloon of thread 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.899
 while the cream is being whisked 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.719
 let's go get my mini swivel and 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.789
 my cake to form a thing that will 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.149
 I want to explain about using a 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.320
 chocolate syrup with the way to think 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.360
 this 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.390
 they will never be able to achieve only in 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.500
 adding more cocoa to this recipe what 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.690
 what's going to happen is that they're going to 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.060
 dry out the product very quickly and 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.520
 is going to scream another thing is that if you 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.350
 they add too much color because 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.229
 we have an original recipe that is already 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.259
 formulated this that already comes on the web 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.600
 think chocolate if they try to duplicate 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.509
 that what is going to happen to them is also going 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.430
 to be irregularities in your product and 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.780
 they will leave a bit bitter on the part 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:07.010
 of a lot of chocolate color addition 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.560
 now let's look at our consistency 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.620
 let's turn off the blender lower the 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.800
 arm and put the spatula inside the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.800
 product 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.740
 has good performance good texture 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.720
 but if you look at the color it's nothing 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.300
 compared to what we have that 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.890
 It was formulated especially for 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.890
 that is the way thinker of chocolate 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.350
 Now what we are going to do is use 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.910
 our cream we are going to put in the 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.910
 center of cake 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.380
 and putting the other cake stand 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.380
 over 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.760
 we mount more cream up 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.069
 and we started to move it 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.720
 going down it going down taking care 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.700
 that we do not spend touching the cake 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.870
 so that we will not fall apart 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.959
 let's put next 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.959
 sliding it a little bit by applying more 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.430
 in a little more and using the spatula 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.430
 to slide the cake 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.069
 following with the spatula we are going 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.370
 sliding and matching the cake to the 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.370
 sides 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.600
 and leveling the top 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.030
 okay 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.030
 and ending with cleaning the edge 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.790
 and now we continue 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.670
 with reigning our sleeve for you 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.130
 with the cream of web thought to 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.110
 chocolate 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.090
 using doubt 403 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.420
 on the top all around the 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.420
 cake 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.970
 we are repeating this form 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.970
 the leaf shape 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.880
 and the fourth one up 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.120
 continuing we're going to use the ganas 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.120
 that we had prepared 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.860
 we do not have in a cartridge 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.270
 and every time we prepare it is with half 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.490
 concentrated and half chocolate 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.410
 melt the bar 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.620
 we will use it to put it all 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.750
 around making a band 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.750
 make a secondary band to the bass 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.430
 and using our spatula 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.790
 lying against the face 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.960
 let's slide it 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.960
 closing the band 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:23.710
 using the tip the scissors we're going 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.710
 carving up diagonally 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.129
 to finish our sunflower 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.710
 we will add it over 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.710
 chocolate cake crown 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.880
 and to give it a little contrast the 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:45.690
 fresh strawberries 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.690
 with class 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.410
 or not 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.990
 and so they have a nice cake 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.480
 simple and very easy to be very 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.550
 Practical using the web selling 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.370
 vanilla and a chocolate syrup 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.460
 what is an original recipe that you 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.760
 They can use this to have good day
