00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
fire has been patched to increase recoil

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.980 
fire has been patched to increase recoil
twice<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.220> has<00:01:53.760> to<00:01:53.940> turn<00:01:54.150> many<00:01:54.480> people<00:01:54.870> away

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
twice and has to turn many people away

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.649 
twice and has to turn many people away
from<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.380> infamous<00:01:55.860> setup<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:57.150> now<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
from the infamous setup but now with the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.810 
from the infamous setup but now with the
SML<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.470> use<00:01:58.650> the<00:01:58.800> exact<00:01:59.250> same<00:01:59.340> concept

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
SML we can use the exact same concept

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.270 
SML we can use the exact same concept
and<00:02:00.210> apply<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.229> particular<00:02:01.770> assault

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
and apply it to this particular assault

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.380 
and apply it to this particular assault
rifle<00:02:03.710> ok<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.340> first<00:02:05.580> attachment<00:02:06.240> will

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
rifle ok so the first attachment will

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.779 
rifle ok so the first attachment will
use<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.870> obviously<00:02:07.380> select<00:02:07.860> fire<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.610> will

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
use is obviously select fire this will

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.790 
use is obviously select fire this will
give<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> SMR<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.629> constant<00:02:10.229> rate<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.530> fire

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
give the SMR a constant rate of fire

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.410 
give the SMR a constant rate of fire
without<00:02:11.190> having<00:02:11.519> to<00:02:11.640> worry<00:02:11.849> about<00:02:12.150> shooting

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
without having to worry about shooting

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.050 
without having to worry about shooting
one<00:02:12.750> bullet<00:02:12.989> at<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.260> time<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.859> in<00:02:14.459> my<00:02:14.639> opinion

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
one bullet at a time and in my opinion

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.089 
one bullet at a time and in my opinion
makes<00:02:15.299> the<00:02:15.480> weapon<00:02:15.659> more<00:02:16.049> accurate<00:02:16.560> if<00:02:16.709> you're

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
makes the weapon more accurate if you're

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.800 
makes the weapon more accurate if you're
somebody<00:02:17.370> who<00:02:17.730> struggles<00:02:18.299> with<00:02:18.329> SEM

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
somebody who struggles with SEM

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.470 
somebody who struggles with SEM
automatic<00:02:19.349> weapons<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.980> because<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.940> SM<00:02:21.330> is

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
automatic weapons and because the SM is

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.350 
automatic weapons and because the SM is
so<00:02:21.900> incredibly<00:02:22.530> high<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.130> damage<00:02:23.520> being<00:02:24.239> able

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
so incredibly high in damage being able

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.630 
so incredibly high in damage being able
to<00:02:24.540> make<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.260> weapon<00:02:25.590> fully<00:02:25.830> automatic<00:02:26.459> will

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
to make the weapon fully automatic will

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.850 
to make the weapon fully automatic will
really<00:02:27.090> destroy<00:02:27.510> enemies<00:02:27.930> at<00:02:28.110> close<00:02:28.470> quarter

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
really destroy enemies at close quarter

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.250 
really destroy enemies at close quarter
battle<00:02:28.890> even<00:02:29.849> against<00:02:30.209> shotgun<00:02:30.630> enemies<00:02:31.080> and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
battle even against shotgun enemies and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.140 
battle even against shotgun enemies and
also<00:02:32.010> long-distance<00:02:32.790> battles<00:02:33.150> as<00:02:33.420> well<00:02:35.150> so

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
also long-distance battles as well so

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.000 
also long-distance battles as well so
now<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:36.480> have<00:02:36.720> got<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.019> key<00:02:37.290> attachments

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
now we have got the key attachments

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.949 
now we have got the key attachments
selected<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.970> next<00:02:39.269> attachment<00:02:39.569> will

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
selected the next attachment will

equipped on the SMR is extended mags

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.080 
equipped on the SMR is extended mags
because<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.410> SMR<00:02:43.920> only<00:02:44.190> carries<00:02:44.550> one<00:02:44.580> full

clip of 20 bullets reloading often can

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.000 
clip of 20 bullets reloading often can
be<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> nuisance<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.599> due<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.410> slow<00:02:49.709> rate

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
be a nuisance and due to the slow rate

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.979 
be a nuisance and due to the slow rate
of<00:02:50.040> fire<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:50.700> don't<00:02:50.730> want<00:02:51.299> to<00:02:51.450> stop<00:02:51.690> shooting

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
of fire we don't want to stop shooting

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.830 
of fire we don't want to stop shooting
as<00:02:52.260> often<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:53.010> reload<00:02:53.430> hence<00:02:54.120> that's<00:02:54.360> why<00:02:54.540> I've

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
as often to reload hence that's why I've

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.740 
as often to reload hence that's why I've
chosen<00:02:55.170> extended<00:02:55.920> mags<00:02:56.160> over<00:02:56.880> fast<00:02:57.180> mags

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
chosen extended mags over fast mags

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.380 
chosen extended mags over fast mags
now<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.860> attachment<00:02:59.250> will<00:02:59.580> bump<00:02:59.880> up<00:03:00.090> one

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
now this attachment will bump up one

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.420 
now this attachment will bump up one
full<00:03:00.660> clip<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.200> SMR<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.830> twenty<00:03:02.190> six

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
full clip of the SMR to twenty six

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.220 
full clip of the SMR to twenty six
bullets<00:03:02.790> now<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.269> may<00:03:03.569> not<00:03:03.750> sound<00:03:03.989> like<00:03:04.110> much

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
bullets now I may not sound like much

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.860 
bullets now I may not sound like much
but<00:03:04.709> with<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> guns<00:03:05.340> high<00:03:05.819> damage<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.630> can

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
but with the guns high damage it can

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.350 
but with the guns high damage it can
equate<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.470> number<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:07.980> two<00:03:08.459> kills<00:03:08.730> with<00:03:08.970> six

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
equate to a number of two kills with six

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.300 
equate to a number of two kills with six
bullets<00:03:11.599> okay<00:03:12.599> so<00:03:12.660> normally<00:03:13.349> I<00:03:13.590> may<00:03:13.860> end<00:03:14.099> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
bullets okay so normally I may end the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.460 
bullets okay so normally I may end the
video<00:03:14.489> here<00:03:14.670> but<00:03:15.360> this<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.660> only<00:03:15.840> half<00:03:16.230> the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
make anyone watching this video one

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.020 
make anyone watching this video one
dangerous<00:03:23.850> fuck<00:03:24.150> in<00:03:24.359> multiplayer<00:03:25.250> ok<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.910> the

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
dangerous fuck in multiplayer ok so the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.479 
dangerous fuck in multiplayer ok so the
first<00:03:27.299> perk<00:03:27.570> in<00:03:27.780> tier<00:03:28.049> 1<00:03:28.109> that<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.500> use<00:03:28.859> is<00:03:29.070> ghost

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
first perk in tier 1 that I use is ghost

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.910 
first perk in tier 1 that I use is ghost
like<00:03:30.239> most<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.690> my<00:03:30.810> other<00:03:30.959> class<00:03:31.290> setups<00:03:31.739> I

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
like most of my other class setups I

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.130 
like most of my other class setups I
believe<00:03:32.250> it's<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.670> most<00:03:32.910> effective<00:03:33.450> perk<00:03:33.900> who

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
believe it's the most effective perk who

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.080 
believe it's the most effective perk who
you're<00:03:34.380> running<00:03:34.530> around<00:03:35.040> especially<00:03:35.670> if<00:03:35.940> your

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
you're running around especially if your

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.210 
you're running around especially if your
enemies<00:03:36.510> are<00:03:36.690> constantly<00:03:37.230> putting<00:03:37.500> up<00:03:37.650> UAVs

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
enemies are constantly putting up UAVs

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.550 
enemies are constantly putting up UAVs
so<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:38.970> gives<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.569> ability<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.200> run

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
so this gives you the ability to run

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.960 
so this gives you the ability to run
around<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:41.040> flank<00:03:41.370> enemies<00:03:41.519> if<00:03:42.000> needed<00:03:42.510> to

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
around and flank enemies if needed to

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.210 
around and flank enemies if needed to
now<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.030> next<00:03:45.510> /<00:03:45.810> will<00:03:46.049> use<00:03:46.290> from<00:03:46.560> tier<00:03:46.890> 1<00:03:47.069> and

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220
