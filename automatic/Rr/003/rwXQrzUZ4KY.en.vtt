00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.580
 following with the tutorial we are going to 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.630
 convert a photograph 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.400
 his image 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.400
 an autocad file 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.410
 then and simply 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.410
 we open 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.510
 the picture 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.199
 I open 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.480
 then there is this option to embed 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.860
 It is not necessary to know how to use all 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.650
 program elements about some that 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.900
 I'll explain now for saying 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:56.600
 we have someone's picture 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.600
 and if we want to update it simply 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 a trip on a trip later 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.270
 prioritize bitmap is not necessary 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.700
 that the image is a bitmap but that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.050
 with these functions although it is already done 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.170
 we have several options which 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.700
 can you try 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.130
 and see how the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.619
 in this case 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.409
 remember that they have to be here 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.659
 selected this icon here of the 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.130
 arrow we select the image 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.020
 we see what 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.310
 the whole image that is a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.950
 Once selected , we can 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.399
 use 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.659
 this menu then cut off luminosity 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.220
 we test with the value that is here 0.45 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.840
 we must update 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.189
 sometimes delay or say do not seem 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.189
 then we will accept 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.399
 like 50 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.399
 This is how we are staying 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.690
 I take off I click selected the image 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.690
 background 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.110
 to press the delete key or bill gates 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.520
 and I have left the image 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.390
 as they realize they are images of 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.870
 use in suddenly on some plane in 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.260
 something that they want to do some detail a 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.260
 special flight 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.260
 and this and they can try all of a sudden with 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.020
 other values and other options have fallen 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.210
 who can also try it and watch it play 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.280
 with the values â€‹â€‹in this case I think 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.400
 that has been very well you can see the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.000
 Face figure can try with 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.000
 other values 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:55.030
 there would be control z 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.030
 again control z to go back 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.989
 then again he selected me 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.020
 I assure you that I am here to select this 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.200
 select selection icon 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.470
 I will not try to see with point 35 as 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.470
 mega 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.800
 I will give him to accept 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.190
 deleted the background image in the image of 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.260
 background as it already causes some 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.950
 details then I'll go back to 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:28.080
 point 45 as control z not from doing 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.080
 again control z undo 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.980
 selected the image 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:38.969
 and I do not think it was okay with that 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.540
 value but you must accept deleted the image 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.780
 background 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.180
 I'm closing this window of Victor 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.730
 hoist 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.720
 and the file 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.790
 save as 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.790
 and I will not save in x format 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.170
 26 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.170
 is save 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.260
 I leave you with the default values 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.239
 to accept 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:17.489
 since m created this folder this file 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:20.010
 x double click and give us consider what 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.370
 has kept me is the edge of the edge the 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.420
 recognizes as a policy 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:29.120
 then this what I'm going to do 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:35.569
 for you to see that he does 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:37.129
 pretty good I'm going to paint what I'm going to this one 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.590
 pizarro 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:43.280
 I will not create 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.280
 the black background 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.650
 baquedano 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:52.180
 so 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.180
 now 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:06.419
 I'm not going to be helping 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.419
 the internal parts 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.180
 but this part also 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:26.000
 but also that they want a majority 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:29.600
 enters 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.320
 with the big account if you can see the 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.860
 figure of the person 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:38.370
 the person can use it for rigor 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.500
 good friends that would be all if you liked 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.020
 click like I can also 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.600
 Share the video with your friends or 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.360
 colleagues invite you to enter the page 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.480
 of facebook and twitter where they can 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.810
 find more tutorials and tips and tricks 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.770
 of autocad combined with a bit of 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.840
 humor to make a little more entertaining 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.540
 this page the link is in the 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.450
