00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hi hi everyone knows but lee 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.660
 I can see with a new video 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.099
 a video to discuss my hair 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.769
 what it's been a while since I do not 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.120
 did not keep you informed of the 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.389
 way in which things happen 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.820
 were going in between but I but you 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.750
 do me since lately it's good 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.550
 not toc toc 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.820
 yeah I hereby inform you that I have a 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.960
 times will neglect because when I 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.640
 the slang words we made our 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.269
 championship 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.830
 I want something else is that I 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.000
 cut the hair started to drop and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:40.050
 more hock globally two textures 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.350
 I had a texture more or less scheme 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.600
 how more flexible and that but I want 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.070
 they were pushing was cooler able to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.010
 so do that on the next a lot 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.410
 more of my true nature of hair and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.489
 I noticed that at the end I actually had 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.829
 I still had points of 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.629
 straightening that is starting to become more and 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.339
 plus a wireless guy with different 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.110
 different textures etc so voice and 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:12.000
 since you get a little bored with 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.590
 only vanilla or afro and him 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.630
 is good to be quite honest 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.310
 it was not so good too not bad 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.229
 in the way that I felt 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.220
 and these last days I am I know 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.080
 not how to say I did not feel 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.329
 in the mood to really take care of my 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.220
 hair or to take care of me or busy 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.830
 of anything in fact a game 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.180
 so just 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.500
 like that hat is no indications 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.200
 I do not think it has much to 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.160
 see with the subject of the video that is 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.540
 michelin wants to agree and yes so 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.920
 today actually what I did 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.090
 I did a lot of little things 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.180
 vanilla and by making my friends actually 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.380
 I cut my friends so I got 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.790
 busy with the moon because as usual 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.400
 they follow well know that it 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.410
 I'm balancing a little bit what I 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.570
 wanted anyway it was that no longer 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.690
 have weird little dots when 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.040
 I made my twitts top that 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.550
 information renée orange is so 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.770
 here, but overall, how are you going? 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.510
 happy to have cut but point I 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.450
 did not pull out the big shows I did not 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.740
 not bothered to film since I 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.709
 did not know where this is 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.520
 looked like late so I preferred 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.620
 play the card 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.120
 safety but the next time I 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.020
 will do it I guess it's 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.290
 probably in six to eight months 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.490
 if ever I notice I need to 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.560
 trim the spikes again 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.720
 I will do it with pleasure but especially 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.200
 do not hesitate to comment if you want 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.880
 comment 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200
 are you on your side 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.690
 trim your points if you do it 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.360
 how many times do you do it in 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.070
 the year or other, do not hesitate to 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.390
 we are here to share as 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.160
 usually you already know 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.190
 and that's what in this video was 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.830
 single drop radio or the days makes a 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.270
 little 360 ​​so you see a point 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.070
 does my hair look like 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.930
 now but in any case a thing 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.880
 is sure that I love them 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.700
 new today I did either 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.040
 I hope this reconciliation is going 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.450
 last for a long time and so these are the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.820
 just darling the next video 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.000

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.000
 Japanese and the engadine area ranging from 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
