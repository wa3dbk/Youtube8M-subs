00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
into the top card in the book and then

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.670 
into the top card in the book and then
there's<00:03:48.640> no<00:03:49.600> what<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:50.050> look<00:03:50.170> like<00:03:50.200> you're

about halfway through you can see these

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.490 
about halfway through you can see these
two<00:03:52.930> got<00:03:53.320> cut<00:03:53.620> off<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:55.140> that's<00:03:56.140> how<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:56.350> do

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
two got cut off and that's how you do

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.770
