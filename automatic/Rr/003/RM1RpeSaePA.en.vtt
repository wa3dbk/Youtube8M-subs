00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.420
 hello guys welcome to my channel 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:06.040
 decomposed my hard drive 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.200
 computer and open I'm from scratch 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.610
 I'm going to start customizing it so 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.590
 if they hear my voice hit 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.310
 so very loud microphone forgive me but 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.820
 is that I have not configured anything yet 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.110
 let's install a theme for windows 7 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.360
 for this first let's create a point 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.470
 of restoration in case something goes wrong that 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.080
 there is no problem with the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.410
 computer or laptop we will click on 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.130
 start on computer right click and 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.020
 properties 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.670
 we are going to click here on protection of the 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.500
 system 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.809
 and here we are going to click here to create 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.039
 where it says create a point of restoration 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.789
 you put the name you want 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.800
 he does not speak to him and they give him in creating this 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.359
 It works because if something goes wrong 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.879
 they work the computer does not 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.530
 they installed something wrong you restore the 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.059
 computer to that point and it's going to 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.649
 go back to the configuration they had 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.990
 at that point all changes are going to 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.230
 undo 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.910
 so there are no problems problems 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.580
 now we need the winrar program to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.230
 force already have it perfect and if not what 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.890
 download from here I'll leave the link 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.890
 in the description 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.920
 now let's patch windows you need 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.780
 make patch to force here we go 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.369
 download it you need the strength has 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.110
 patched because if not the issues are not 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.940
 are going to install or are going to be installed but 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.490
 they are not going to look good 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.790
 this is not really dangerous 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.290
 download it from here 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.650
 I will also leave the link in the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.650
 description 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.830
 it takes a few seconds to download 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.840
 okay 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.840
 we are going to give him or we are going to execute him 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.400
 let's patch windows 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.259
 remember if something goes wrong they have the 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.460
 restoration point to return to 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.500
 to accept 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.960
 in this part I recommend that you put 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.760
 here in taste sometimes says custom 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.210
 and remove all these popcorn so that 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.110
 do not install other things 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.110
 and accept 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.810
 well once it's over they're going to 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.250
 open in the location folder like this 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.380
 open automatically here is the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.440
 folder 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.310
 and two of them are going to come 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.490
 patches one is for computers dell 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.980
 64 bits 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.910
 and another is for 32-bit computers 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.470
 I'm going to close this here 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.540
 so if you do not know I have a 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.850
 64 bit if you do not know how many 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.970
 bits have but if you do not know how many 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.710
 they have to go to start click team 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.620
 right and properties 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.780
 here says the operating system of me 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.280
 I have 64 bits 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.610
 you 20 have 64 32 if they have 32 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.310
 bits use this that says 86 if they have 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.500
 64 use the 64 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.650
 then I will click here they will 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.160
 give in executing not in extracting in 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.030
 run 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.080
 okay 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.560
 and they install it in English ok 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.069
 we give him yes 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.470
 this is the important patch you are going 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.940
 to have this patch option to give it 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.520
 click that I do not have it because I just 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.840
 patch it to see if it worked 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.390
 then you are going to click on 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.430
 the first patch in the second and in the 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.170
 third where it says patch to the three you 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.300
 they will give that if ok 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.030
 when they do this, they will ask 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.000
 restart the computer then close 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.520
 and restart 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.360
 ok then this repeat is easy nothing 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.840
 more click on the three spaces 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.660
 and his computer was already split 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.160
