in the city to Yvette their arts so
let's<00:00:32.309> take<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.520> little<00:00:33.270> look-see<00:00:34.280> detail<00:00:35.280> me

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
let's take a little look-see detail me

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.979 
let's take a little look-see detail me
so<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.410> got<00:00:37.559> fire<00:00:37.770> rate<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.820> an<00:00:39.239> auto<00:00:39.480> rifle

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
so we got fire rate so is an auto rifle

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.100 
so we got fire rate so is an auto rifle
so<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.680> course<00:00:40.739> fire<00:00:41.340> raised<00:00:41.660> above<00:00:42.660> think

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
so of course fire raised above think

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.869 
so of course fire raised above think
bout<00:00:44.090> seventy<00:00:45.090> five<00:00:45.180> percent<00:00:45.239> impact<00:00:46.230> below

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
bout seventy five percent impact below

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.910 
bout seventy five percent impact below
45<00:00:47.879> range<00:00:48.840> 46<00:00:50.420> stability<00:00:51.420> fifty<00:00:52.410> percent<00:00:52.710> now

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
45 range 46 stability fifty percent now

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.779 
45 range 46 stability fifty percent now
50<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.510> 49<00:00:54.960> ish<00:00:55.610> reload<00:00:56.610> it's

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
50 and that is like 49 ish reload it's

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.959 
50 and that is like 49 ish reload it's
quite<00:00:56.969> fast<00:00:57.270> indeed<00:00:58.190> so<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> magazine<00:00:59.820> is

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
quite fast indeed so the magazine is

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.619 
quite fast indeed so the magazine is
quite<00:01:00.210> small<00:01:00.359> indeed<00:01:00.780> hum<00:01:01.879> like<00:01:02.879> my<00:01:03.210> cup<00:01:03.600> of

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
quite small indeed hum like my cup of

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.010 
quite small indeed hum like my cup of
tea<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.320> hate<00:01:04.739> reloading<00:01:05.070> all<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> time<00:01:05.640> but

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
tea I do hate reloading all the time but

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.980 
tea I do hate reloading all the time but
this<00:01:07.020> does<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.890> kinetic<00:01:08.580> damage<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:09.810> got<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
this does do kinetic damage so we got a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.520 
this does do kinetic damage so we got a
quick<00:01:10.409> draw<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.549> small<00:01:11.850> scope<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
quick draw the small scope and we have a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.990 
quick draw the small scope and we have a
red<00:01:13.920> dot<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> precise<00:01:16.320> site<00:01:16.729> highest<00:01:17.729> zoom

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
red dot so precise site highest zoom

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.190 
red dot so precise site highest zoom
class<00:01:18.450> enhance<00:01:19.140> range<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.210> does<00:01:21.450> lower

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
class enhance range so it does lower

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.990 
class enhance range so it does lower
your<00:01:22.439> reloading<00:01:22.920> speed<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.460> increases

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
your reloading speed but increases

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.910 
your reloading speed but increases
stability<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:25.080> range<00:01:26.030> now<00:01:27.030> focus<00:01:27.840> Lynn<00:01:28.200> tip<00:01:28.799> I

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
stability and range now focus Lynn tip I

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.399 
stability and range now focus Lynn tip I
can't<00:01:29.220> take<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> look<00:01:29.700> at<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.020> so<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.229> got<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
can't take a look at it so we got a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.710 
can't take a look at it so we got a
sharpshooter<00:01:32.070> scope<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.729> long<00:01:32.970> range<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.509> hands

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
sharpshooter scope a long range of hands

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.359 
sharpshooter scope a long range of hands
target<00:01:34.530> question<00:01:35.090> surprising<00:01:36.090> lights<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> I'm

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
target question surprising lights so I'm

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.850 
target question surprising lights so I'm
assuming<00:01:38.720> it's<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.079> big<00:01:40.350> scoop<00:01:40.680> I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
assuming it's going to be a big scoop I

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.810 
assuming it's going to be a big scoop I
think<00:01:41.130> no<00:01:41.790> just<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.049> no<00:01:43.829> no<00:01:44.250> no<00:01:44.430> don't

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
know so we got glass half full the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.069 
know so we got glass half full the
bottom<00:01:49.320> half<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.649> each<00:01:49.890> mags<00:01:50.659> magazine<00:01:51.659> cause

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
that it's a 15 compression mag a mass

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.710 
that it's a 15 compression mag a mass
compression<00:02:17.490> device<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:18.150> packs<00:02:18.450> in

compression device that packs in

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.900 
compression device that packs in
slightly<00:02:19.170> more<00:02:19.530> ammo<00:02:19.920> at<00:02:20.160> no<00:02:20.610> penalty<00:02:22.880> well<00:02:23.880> I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
slightly more ammo at no penalty well I

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.150 
slightly more ammo at no penalty well I
one<00:02:24.210> second<00:02:24.480> yeah<00:02:25.260> increase<00:02:25.800> increase<00:02:26.220> no<00:02:28.160> so
