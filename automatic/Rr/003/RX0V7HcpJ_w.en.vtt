00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
if I would lift hundred years years

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.580 
if I would lift hundred years years
before<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.510> would<00:00:06.810> paint<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.979> landscape<00:00:09.590> but

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
before I would paint the landscape but

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.299 
before I would paint the landscape but
now<00:00:11.519> in<00:00:11.990> our<00:00:12.990> times<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.620> know<00:00:13.709> everything<00:00:14.190> you

certain beauty I try to accelerate that

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.239 
certain beauty I try to accelerate that
that<00:00:43.829> fact<00:00:44.129> by<00:00:44.550> modifying<00:00:45.390> them<00:00:45.749> or<00:00:46.249> changing

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
that fact by modifying them or changing

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.599 
that fact by modifying them or changing
them<00:00:47.429> so<00:00:47.929> extremely<00:00:48.929> that<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.159> see<00:00:50.399> this

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
them so extremely that you see this

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.419 
them so extremely that you see this
modification<00:00:51.739> to<00:00:52.739> make<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.399> clear

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
modification to make it really clear

that<00:00:54.300> they<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.559> modified<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.589> that<00:00:55.890> you

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
that they are modified and that you

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.860 
that they are modified and that you
cannot<00:00:56.399> trust<00:00:57.059> them

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.910 

I<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:07.390> Peter<00:01:07.570> answers<00:01:07.990> a<00:01:08.020> question<00:01:08.290> of<00:01:08.680> what

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
I think Peter answers a question of what

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.610 
I think Peter answers a question of what
can<00:01:09.700> be<00:01:09.760> new<00:01:10.030> with<00:01:10.240> painting<00:01:10.780> in<00:01:10.990> this<00:01:11.410> day<00:01:11.590> and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
can be new with painting in this day and

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.920 
can be new with painting in this day and
age<00:01:11.860> how<00:01:12.310> can<00:01:12.490> an<00:01:12.610> artist<00:01:13.000> sort<00:01:13.300> of<00:01:13.360> transform

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
age how can an artist sort of transform

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.380 
age how can an artist sort of transform
a<00:01:14.080> medium<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:15.070> sort<00:01:15.250> of<00:01:15.310> reflect<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:15.970> new<00:01:16.000> time

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
a medium to sort of reflect a new time

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.300 
a medium to sort of reflect a new time
you<00:01:17.080> got<00:01:17.229> a<00:01:17.260> very<00:01:17.440> traditional<00:01:17.620> medium<00:01:18.160> of

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
you got a very traditional medium of

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.609 
you got a very traditional medium of
painting<00:01:19.060> basically<00:01:19.600> that<00:01:20.110> he's<00:01:20.260> addressing

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
painting basically that he's addressing

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.250 
painting basically that he's addressing
but<00:01:20.920> he's<00:01:21.010> found<00:01:21.190> a<00:01:21.610> way<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.570> sort<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:22.930> reinvent

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
but he's found a way to sort of reinvent

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.950 
but he's found a way to sort of reinvent
it<00:01:23.590> for<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.340> digital<00:01:24.729> age<00:01:24.970> by<00:01:25.360> transforming

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
it for the digital age by transforming

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.590 
it for the digital age by transforming

can say I need a long time to really

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.620 
can say I need a long time to really
make<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.350> decision<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:03.160> know<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.550> I<00:02:03.970> watched

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
make a decision you know so I I watched

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.990 
make a decision you know so I I watched
these<00:02:04.930> these<00:02:05.560> files<00:02:05.860> on<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:06.399> on<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:06.729> on<00:02:06.819> and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
these these files on and on and on and

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.930 
these these files on and on and on and
on<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.509> then<00:02:07.750> suddenly<00:02:08.170> in<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.740> end<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.190> find<00:02:09.700> a

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
on and then suddenly in the end I find a

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.020 
on and then suddenly in the end I find a
solution<00:02:10.090> what<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:10.899> can<00:02:11.170> use<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.530> for<00:02:11.770> I<00:02:12.100> think

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
solution what I can use it for I think

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.690 
solution what I can use it for I think
what<00:02:13.209> he's<00:02:13.390> looking<00:02:13.750> for<00:02:14.020> in<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.410> end<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:15.069> not

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
what he's looking for in the end is not

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.360 
what he's looking for in the end is not
just<00:02:15.940> novel<00:02:16.330> imagery<00:02:16.870> but<00:02:17.440> imagery<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.069> sort

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
just novel imagery but imagery that sort

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.420 
just novel imagery but imagery that sort
of<00:02:18.430> maintains<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:20.470> aura<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
of maintains the the aura of the

but<00:04:06.019> in<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.290> end<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:06.920> have<00:04:07.220> really<00:04:07.940> one

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
but in the end you you have really one

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:19.870 
but in the end you you have really one
beautiful<00:04:08.870> painting<00:04:09.260> again

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.830 

you<00:04:20.880> have<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.120> think<00:04:21.299> about<00:04:21.449> the<00:04:21.570> fact<00:04:21.720> that

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
you have to think about the fact that

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.720 
you have to think about the fact that
he's<00:04:22.019> from<00:04:22.049> cologne<00:04:22.650> which<00:04:23.160> was<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.400> sort<00:04:23.669> of

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
he's from cologne which was a sort of

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.340 
he's from cologne which was a sort of
hotbed<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.150> activity<00:04:24.419> for<00:04:25.050> rethinking

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
hotbed of activity for rethinking

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.469 
hotbed of activity for rethinking
painting<00:04:25.980> so<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.460> think<00:04:26.820> Peters<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.330> that

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
painting so I think Peters of that

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.870 
painting so I think Peters of that
