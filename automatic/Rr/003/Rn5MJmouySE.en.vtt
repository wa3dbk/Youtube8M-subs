00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello good today we talk about import 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.690
 of the video file of the total station one 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.150
 txt file to the top graf nor the classes 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.090
 passed talked about load of field long 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.619
 distance radiation but only the most people 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.140
 works with reprehensible coordinates 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.340
 we were twice in the serve 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.160
 topography ok let's see here you can 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.910
 typing their coordinates here comes with a 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.489
 case and each one here you can copy and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.820
 paste a new excel table here in 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.020
 house as change or can not import 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.450
 in the txt file and reapply I can do 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.280
 this in the garden file 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.040
 so it's scanzi, I think this same 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.680
 in the portal 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.360
 We live here because that pays the file. 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.259
 have to have the unit be a single range 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.259
 there but it is who seek to descend 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:17.480
 Maybe I'll let you see here. 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.870
 txt its intention is that variable well 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.280
 but only in our file is who goes 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.790
 make our game and have to have a 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.590
 different format a different format 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:46.490
 so that the pv with this file txt to 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:51.290
 Wow, but only who will vote? 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:54.850
 O no different top does not recognize that 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:01.640
 in files here with this space here the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:05.690
 file replace locate school is 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.250
 a space on the team and put ppwk button 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:16.430

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.230
 table 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:45.070
 in our first variable that is fixed 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.070
 let's evaluate 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.709
