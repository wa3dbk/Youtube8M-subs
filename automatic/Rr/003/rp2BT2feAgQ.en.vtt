00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.889
 just what is this saved for a program we have so many 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.070
 in the little ones all my life not even in the mental field 

00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:19.470
 winter sports 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.740
 a spokesman called 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.640
 and since me 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.919
 15 I'm with me 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.659
 Mental training deals 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.499
 And not in 2007, the us documents work on the way 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.260
 Your device has developed with the a mental training very very fast 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.480
 to be effective 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.490
 has spoken to him and use it said Conrad he already had for golf 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.740
 and then of course the goals only one more for tennis 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.570
 the second game against St the program allows a stand 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.350
 an internal one for me as his player 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.060
 quite a concept 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.730
 What's special about a day? 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.360
 "I'll tell you, I think 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.020
 when the kidneys play tennis and entertain everyone knows where that 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.280
 Problem lies 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.920
 very many 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.730
 I play Pinger on the pitch two to play the world champion team the day before 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.890
 and when it gets serious when the opponent stands on one side 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.640
 Mint maybe never won 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.510
 then failure they replace the frequent topic each 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.869
 Player of many players in all classes 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.869
 the Commander Kreisklasse Guggenberger men's world watching 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.920
 frequently 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.180
 There is no potential for players to put that potential on the field 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.250
 and one says so beautifully lost between the ears 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.310
 that is common 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.540
 no technical problem blow technically today no conventional 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.189
 problem 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.330
 no problem today 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.680
 what's happening in the head 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.140
 what mental training use are 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.619
 she was meant to be 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.080
 this component for the tennis player 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.900
 now he is to be done 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.430
 only one cascade around which version also circle class a 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.810
 this program built it up that way 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.900
 many things are so versatile 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.910
 have developed a standard program to develop this 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.040
 and these CDs include phrases like "I'll make Maciol 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.490
 a tennis player often has a self-confidence problem with that 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.430
 self-worth 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.489
 What a CD includes, therefore, it also sets little confidence in a beat 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.610
 all were called harmony 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.339
 that means in this formation under the player 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.339
 Ing brought his optimal field 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.099
 the criterion worked out in Beslan but then defeated with the sentences 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:23.299
 they're crying about you 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.209
 Daily work while exercising can sometimes even catch up without that 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.019
 but what are they doing? 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.909
 so are together 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.519
 Visualization affirmations coupled with the cement 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.519
 which bring in the players is again to develop potential 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.959
 I have to play single players now 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.999
 For example, that of 30 years plays that "because I know that 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.569
 What I can do »said van Bommel very hard came out fishing for 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.409
 Example what was to learn 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.970
 I have to play for another 30 years so that's my coach 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.609
 very experienced 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:56.600
 because it is 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.790
 Actually every tennis player knows men fell forehand has Moser 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.319
 ten thousand blows more 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.139
 Do good at doing important things to iron out this mistake as well 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.959
 put us to the preheat and programming as I can not 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.969
 win or I'm too bad 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:14.480
 We need a certain amount of time to get around the house 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:15.689
 to get 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.969
 That's what makes them the ideal device for everything in an hour 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.379
 2008 to ten thousand repetitions 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.579
 So that would be like if in one hour 8 to 10 000 forehand right 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:26.880
 make suggestions 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.750
 that means I'm driving an online program for 30 to 40 years I'm not good 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.480
 enough 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.669
 I can win 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.119
 I can exceed that for peace within two to three months 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:37.289
 and the program 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:38.699
 so to say 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.879
 program what I do not have 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.149
 the program may have been in practice 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:48.429
 yes, we had a steady job with displacements subjects 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.599
 at the age of 16 to 60 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.179
 66 even 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:57.469
 and most different of the leagues we had Kreisklassist Regionalliga 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:58.609
 was represented 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.759
 different professional groups 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:04.799
 And for us the conclusion was that was very very amazing that through the bank way 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.909
 said they have become much calmer on the course much more relaxed 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.500
 they could 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.800
 For example, if a player had an opponent, he would be relegated after a month 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.009
 could lay 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:18.180
 lost in the halls years before 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.969
 because it contained lesser the so smoothly beaten Seidenath claim 9 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.909
 especially fascinating 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.300
 and it really was that way 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.729
 this is this effect of calm and balance 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.240
 in some even in everyday life, even though they are now with 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.999
 tennisnet at work 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:38.159
 a manager for example also said 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.830
 i feel in the ethic- much more relaxed i am much calmer 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.839
 So even that has had a Mr. impact many areas of the 

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:45.620
 life 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.680
 that was very strong for us 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.240
 Lisa, after being behind bars for a long time, leaves Turku the best 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.370
 this program also remains open 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.199
 without question 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.370
 since I really am 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.030
 five ASG 30 years with mental training workers and also many of my 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.420
 I was able to solve blockages but sometimes I was able to solve them very much 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.880
 a short time quite a lot for me to cover what I had 20 years ago 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.570
 needed that thing is with me again in the month so now that's the hike 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.629
 menstrual 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:17.400
 for experience 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.370
 and I still see that in my development, which is long ago 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.879
 not completed so there it is only uphill 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.400
 the players would have the super exciting 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.729
 he is a possibility besides the program 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.229
 in the form of a lecture or television 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.930
 then go deeper into the topic 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.960
 Season are so 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.509
 nearly one year lectures 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.319
 in Gießener or in clubs that do not book quasi 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.089
 So that's one thing you look for on the show too 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:49.539
 internet page maybe great as well as a talk on tennis revive 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.169
 understand the game 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.020
 is shown or held and 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.119
 abber Winter 2011 there will also be a seminar where interested people 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:03.869
 Just learning how they can potential their potential reber tables up 

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:04.879
 to bring the place 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:08.239
 From then on, I would like to thank you for the interesting and informative conversation 

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:09.989
 and wish you success because it is a series
