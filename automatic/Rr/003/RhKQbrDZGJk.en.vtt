00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
Algonquin which we know of in gta4 and

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.470 
Algonquin which we know of in gta4 and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.380 
after a while these settlers who were
already<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.110> colony<00:02:50.030> decided<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.150> sign<00:02:51.360> a

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
already in the colony decided to sign a

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.460 
word Bohan that's what it means in real
life<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.630> don't<00:03:39.690> think<00:03:39.840> that's<00:03:40.140> what<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.320> means

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.930 
life I don't think that's what it means
I<00:03:40.710> think<00:03:40.740> there's<00:03:41.070> another<00:03:41.250> term<00:03:41.550> for<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:41.850> but

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
I think there's another term for it but

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.930 
I think there's another term for it but
that's<00:03:42.180> what<00:03:42.540> Rockstar<00:03:43.050> wanted<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.470> do<00:03:43.590> and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
that's what Rockstar wanted to do and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.390 
that's what Rockstar wanted to do and
make<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.390> guess<00:03:46.020> mean<00:03:46.260> in<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.950> Grand<00:03:47.250> Theft
