school of golf I'm going to talk to you
today<00:00:09.450> about<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.780> most<00:00:10.139> effective<00:00:10.679> way<00:00:10.800> to

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
today about the most effective way to

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.650 
today about the most effective way to
understand<00:00:11.490> how<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.700> draw<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.090> ball<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.570> how

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
understand how to draw the ball and how

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.110 
understand how to draw the ball and how
to<00:00:12.719> fade<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.139> ball<00:00:13.280> the<00:00:14.280> advent<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.849> launch

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
to fade the ball the advent of launch

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.060 
to fade the ball the advent of launch
monitors<00:00:15.630> such<00:00:15.870> as<00:00:16.049> Trackman<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:16.890> use

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
monitors such as Trackman that we use

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.560 
monitors such as Trackman that we use
back<00:00:17.310> at<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.520> golf<00:00:17.699> school<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.150> helped<00:00:18.449> us

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
back at the golf school have helped us

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.990 
back at the golf school have helped us
to<00:00:18.690> understand<00:00:19.320> much<00:00:19.949> more<00:00:19.980> implicitly<00:00:20.760> what

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
to understand much more implicitly what

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.810 
to understand much more implicitly what
happens<00:00:21.420> as<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.170> clubface<00:00:22.710> impacts<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.640> ball

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
happens as the clubface impacts the ball

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.880 
happens as the clubface impacts the ball
and<00:00:24.090> how<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.570> moves<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.050> golf<00:00:25.230> ball<00:00:25.439> around<00:00:25.650> is

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
and how it moves the golf ball around is

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.849 
and how it moves the golf ball around is
it<00:00:26.010> as<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.369> flies<00:00:26.580> off<00:00:26.789> into<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> sky<00:00:27.859> we've

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
it as it flies off into the sky we've

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.099 
it as it flies off into the sky we've
had<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.130> change<00:00:29.460> some<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.150> ways<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.960> we

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
had to change some of the ways that we

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.720 
had to change some of the ways that we
would<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.380> described<00:00:31.949> how<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> hit<00:00:32.430> draws

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
would have described how to hit draws

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.139 
would have described how to hit draws
and<00:00:33.000> fades<00:00:33.270> due<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.140> these<00:00:34.260> changes<00:00:34.980> in

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
and fades due to these changes in

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.610 
and fades due to these changes in
technology<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.300> maybe<00:00:36.480> due<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.930> our<00:00:37.230> deeper

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
technology and maybe due to our deeper

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.080 
technology and maybe due to our deeper
understanding<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.309> what's<00:00:38.489> happening<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
understanding of what's happening so to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.090 
understanding of what's happening so to
clarify<00:00:39.420> first<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.200> all<00:00:40.290> for<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> right-handed

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
clarify first of all for a right-handed

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.549 
clarify first of all for a right-handed
player<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.610> draw<00:00:42.239> shot<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> shot<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.050> starts

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
target and never finishes to the left so

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.950 
target and never finishes to the left so
it's<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> finish<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.149> line<00:00:54.390> never<00:00:54.660> left

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it's going to finish on line never left

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.260 
it's going to finish on line never left
of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> target<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.250> fade<00:00:56.520> being<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> exact

of the target the fade being the exact

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.779 
of the target the fade being the exact
opposite<00:00:57.750> now<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.530> used<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.039> tell<00:00:59.280> people<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
opposite now we used to tell people to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.510 
opposite now we used to tell people to
aim<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.149> clubface<00:01:00.800> at<00:01:01.800> where<00:01:02.100> we'd<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
aim the clubface at where we'd like the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.280 
aim the clubface at where we'd like the
ball<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> finish<00:01:03.000> being<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> target<00:01:03.870> line<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
ball to finish being the target line and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
ball to finish being the target line and
they<00:01:04.799> named<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> body<00:01:05.369> lines<00:01:05.700> off<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
they named the body lines off to the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.030 
they named the body lines off to the
right<00:01:06.540> for<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.869> drawer<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> left<00:01:07.740> for<00:01:08.010> a

right for a drawer to the left for a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.890 
right for a drawer to the left for a
fade<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.520> then<00:01:08.970> quite<00:01:09.210> simply<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.750> produce

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
fade and then quite simply to produce

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.660 
fade and then quite simply to produce
the<00:01:10.229> curvature<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.740> would<00:01:10.979> swing<00:01:11.280> along<00:01:11.520> the

the curvature you would swing along the
line<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.000> body<00:01:12.500> we<00:01:13.500> now<00:01:13.650> know<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.920> that

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
too much curvature so we now know that

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.170 
too much curvature so we now know that
