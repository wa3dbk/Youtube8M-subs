00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.360
 passing game called office 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.700
 The ridge of this game is that you 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.100
 must all destroy the gun and destroy everything 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.470
 in an office building why yes because 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.930
 your own director doesn't like you 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.220
 do you work badly nothing at all 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.590

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.170
 Well, in the background of the face you can see 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.260
 that our hero is a very strong dugout 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.510

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.300
