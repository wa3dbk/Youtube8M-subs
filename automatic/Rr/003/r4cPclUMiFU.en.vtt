00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.370
 the goal that I remember most was that of kempis 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.430
 in the year 1978 the final against holland 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:27.430
 it was the first soccer world cup that I saw 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.050
 with consciousness with a use of reason and 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.330
 for me it was very shocking because in 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.520
 that era where there were not so many 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.860
 things a global if it was like the center 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.989
 of the universe at that time was Sunday 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.420
 every Sunday and we were going to 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.860
 my grandmother's house and especially that 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.989
 Sunday that was the final of the World Cup 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.360
 football all the cousins ​​all the dudes 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.790
 there were dozens of people and they had 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.770
 picchu roque was there tucked in watching the 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.780
 grand finale with some awareness of the 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.550
 things 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.809
 field goal an impressive goal that 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.180
 within a style of football that no longer 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.769
 there was very beautiful the truth the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.350
 elegance with which Argentina played 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.659
 I think it has lost the way 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.860
 Arming the play is almost like a ballet 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.860
 I think it's unmatched 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.530
 after all these years my team 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.210
 Argentina in the World Cup I remember 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.910
 I was 8 years old and I was shocked by everything 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.490
 was that amount of pieces of paper at the end 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.890
 the emotion of having also won 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.440
 Latin American to the Dutch 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.700
 all of that one without knowing takes it 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.280
 dragging for the rest of his life 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.940
 until the 2014 world cup one when 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.830
 see after the years that final 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.500
 argentina holland and knows that talking 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.050
 was there as the great power the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.810
 'mechanical orange' versus argentina that 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.880
 It had its tradition but it was Europe 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.520
 strong against latin america one is given 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.590
 that when there mystique when 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.990
 There is truly delivery as you are 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.380
 with your country with love to your country things 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.280
 can be given is a goal that is built 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.060
 under the premise of the cooperation of 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.130
 teamwork 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.349
 of putting together the play at the moment with a 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.849
 goal that rushes in the moment and 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.160
 all those things are in the end the life 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.560
 same the same life playing with 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.540
 those values ​​cooperating always playing 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.300
 in egypt always saving the situation 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.920
 always at the end not only hits goal 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.760
 on the court if he hits goal in life 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.760
 that the most important thing
