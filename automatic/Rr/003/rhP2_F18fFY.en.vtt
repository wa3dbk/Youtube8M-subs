bit and I punched it a little crooked

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.249 
bit and I punched it a little crooked
but<00:01:38.729> that's<00:01:39.030> okay<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.869> put<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.079> back<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.590> and

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.100 
but that's okay just put it back in and
reap<00:01:43.259> unch<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.740> until<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.149> where<00:01:45.930> it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
reap unch it until you like it where it

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.760 
reap unch it until you like it where it
is<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:47.930> think<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.079> looks<00:01:49.259> pretty<00:01:49.470> good<00:01:49.710> right

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
is I think that looks pretty good right

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.570 
is I think that looks pretty good right
there<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.490> even

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.660 

so<00:01:56.500> that<00:01:57.500> would<00:01:57.710> be<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.860> top<00:01:58.190> of<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.460> dress

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
so that would be the top of the dress

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.740
