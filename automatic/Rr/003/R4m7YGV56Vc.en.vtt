the next game was taking on the the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.000 
the next game was taking on the the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
Redbirds now Cardiff really interesting

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.979 
Redbirds now Cardiff really interesting
like<00:03:30.160> Cardiff<00:03:30.519> we've<00:03:30.639> just<00:03:30.819> been<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.389> cool<00:03:31.720> on

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.750 
like Cardiff we've just been so cool on
this<00:03:32.109> game<00:03:32.349> this<00:03:32.680> season<00:03:32.919> yeah<00:03:33.250> in<00:03:33.400> real<00:03:33.549> life

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
this game this season yeah in real life

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.309 
this game this season yeah in real life
too<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.269> think<00:03:34.780> it's<00:03:34.870> still<00:03:34.959> top<00:03:35.169> of<00:03:35.200> the

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
too I think it's still top of the

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.900 
too I think it's still top of the
championship<00:03:35.470> in<00:03:35.919> LA<00:03:36.040> I<00:03:36.250> guess<00:03:36.519> it<00:03:36.639> depends

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
championship in LA I guess it depends

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.300 
championship in LA I guess it depends
what<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.120> was<00:03:37.239> today<00:03:37.359> I<00:03:37.660> was<00:03:38.019> pink<00:03:38.200> yeah<00:03:38.859> I<00:03:39.069> might

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
what I was today I was pink yeah I might

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.650

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
be wrong

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.120 
be wrong
yeah<00:03:41.109> I<00:03:41.169> think<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.410> saw<00:03:41.530> talking<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:41.829> champ<00:03:42.010> ship

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.830 
yeah I think I saw talking to champ ship
but<00:03:42.849> anyway<00:03:43.060> they're<00:03:43.239> doing<00:03:43.419> pretty<00:03:43.630> poorly

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
but anyway they're doing pretty poorly

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.509 
but anyway they're doing pretty poorly
and<00:03:44.169> this<00:03:44.560> career<00:03:44.799> my<00:03:44.950> defender<00:03:45.220> sitting<00:03:45.459> in

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
and this career my defender sitting in

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.909 
and this career my defender sitting in
my<00:03:45.579> 18th<00:03:46.000> place<00:03:46.150> but<00:03:46.510> we<00:03:47.169> took<00:03:47.319> lead<00:03:47.530> just<00:03:47.799> in

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
ball back and do a facial into the back

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.569 
ball back and do a facial into the back
of<00:04:03.129> the<00:04:03.190> net

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
of the net

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.970 
of the net
but<00:04:03.940> Cardiff<00:04:04.660> did<00:04:05.139> manage<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.470> win<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.680> penalty

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
but Cardiff did manage to win a penalty

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.860 
but Cardiff did manage to win a penalty
just<00:04:06.310> soon<00:04:06.849> after<00:04:07.239> really<00:04:07.419> I'm<00:04:07.510> not<00:04:07.629> sure<00:04:07.810> it

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
just soon after really I'm not sure it

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.720 
just soon after really I'm not sure it
was<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:08.019> penalty<00:04:08.230> but<00:04:08.560> I<00:04:08.950> guess<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.430> can<00:04:09.549> see<00:04:09.639> the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
was a penalty but I guess I can see the

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.220 
was a penalty but I guess I can see the
road<00:04:09.879> wider<00:04:10.030> referee<00:04:10.359> gave<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:10.720> wise<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:11.109> did

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
road wider referee gave it wise it did

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.289 
road wider referee gave it wise it did
coming<00:04:11.410> pretty<00:04:11.650> strongly<00:04:11.919> on<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.310> this<00:04:13.000> shot

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
coming pretty strongly on the this shot

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.569 
coming pretty strongly on the this shot
taker<00:04:13.599> and<00:04:13.959> Cardiff<00:04:14.949> had<00:04:15.099> the<00:04:15.220> chance<00:04:15.430> to

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
taker and Cardiff had the chance to

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:16.830 
taker and Cardiff had the chance to
level<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.849> game<00:04:15.970> I<00:04:16.030> guess<00:04:16.269> justice<00:04:16.660> would

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
level the game I guess justice would

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.689 
level the game I guess justice would

served when Peter Witten and the cats in

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.819
