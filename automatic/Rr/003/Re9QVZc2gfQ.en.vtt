00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
fairly small set so I figure probably in

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.490 
fairly small set so I figure probably in
front<00:00:46.670> of<00:00:46.820> you<00:00:48.280> sure<00:00:49.329> castle<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.109> that<00:00:51.320> was

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
like so in 10 easy steps let's build a

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.270 
like so in 10 easy steps let's build a
stink<00:01:06.370> we<00:01:07.370> start<00:01:07.700> with<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:07.970> squirrel<00:01:09.280> stick

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
stink we start with the squirrel stick

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.820 
stink we start with the squirrel stick
this<00:01:10.490> ball<00:01:10.880> in<00:01:11.180> his<00:01:11.590> or<00:01:12.590> her<00:01:12.650> tail<00:01:13.250> I<00:01:13.520> guess<00:01:14.830> and

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
this ball in his or her tail I guess and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.770 
this ball in his or her tail I guess and
then<00:01:16.070> we<00:01:16.420> take<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.660> scroll<00:01:18.020> football<00:01:19.780> take

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
then we take the scroll football take

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.250 
then we take the scroll football take
these<00:01:21.170> I<00:01:22.030> hope<00:01:23.030> it's<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.330> squirrel<00:01:23.630> football

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
can walk to the screen base these pieces

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.340 
can walk to the screen base these pieces
the<00:01:40.430> other<00:01:40.610> ground<00:01:40.850> piece<00:01:41.090> when<00:01:41.690> I<00:01:41.720> first<00:01:42.020> saw

necessary please that's cool I can see
that<00:02:28.690> piece<00:02:29.049> before<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:33.700> that's<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.239> base

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
that piece before it's that's the base

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:47.220 
that piece before it's that's the base
on<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:37.440> base<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.680> our<00:02:38.799> tree<00:02:45.450> 66<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:46.750> we're<00:02:46.900> almost

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
on a base of our tree 66 so we're almost

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
on a base of our tree 66 so we're almost
there<00:02:54.180> there's<00:02:55.180> 22<00:02:55.510> others<00:02:56.170> three<00:02:56.829> all

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
there there's 22 others three all

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.390 
there there's 22 others three all
together<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:57.879> way<00:02:58.090> if<00:02:58.269> there's<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:59.400> turtle

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
together this way if there's a turtle

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.349 
together this way if there's a turtle
one<00:03:00.579> the<00:03:01.569> squirrel<00:03:02.049> one<00:03:02.349> I<00:03:02.940> think<00:03:03.940> I'll<00:03:04.239> see

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
one the squirrel one I think I'll see

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.650 
one the squirrel one I think I'll see
all<00:03:04.450> those<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.720> cash<00:03:05.049> something<00:03:05.890> like<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.660> so

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
all those a cash something like that so

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.120 
all those a cash something like that so
you<00:03:07.840> know<00:03:07.900> three<00:03:08.319> three<00:03:08.890> basic<00:03:09.220> pets<00:03:09.459> and

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
you know three three basic pets and

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.000 
you know three three basic pets and
knowing<00:03:12.130> Lego<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.660> will<00:03:14.260> probably<00:03:14.500> be<00:03:14.650> many

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
knowing Lego it will probably be many

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.720 
knowing Lego it will probably be many
more<00:03:15.569> then<00:03:16.569> the<00:03:17.440> kool<00:03:17.680> Kone<00:03:17.950> would<00:03:18.069> probably

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
more then the kool Kone would probably

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.449 
more then the kool Kone would probably
be<00:03:18.940> animal<00:03:19.810> like<00:03:20.139> the<00:03:20.290> squirrel<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:20.829> think<00:03:21.370> the

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
be animal like the squirrel I think the

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.960 
be animal like the squirrel I think the
turtle<00:03:21.849> looks<00:03:22.030> really<00:03:22.599> cool<00:03:23.609> but<00:03:24.609> thank<00:03:24.819> you

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
turtle looks really cool but thank you

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.690 
turtle looks really cool but thank you

upon<00:05:40.199> completing<00:05:40.649> this<00:05:41.039> Seth<00:05:41.609> realized<00:05:42.599> there

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:42.959 
upon completing this Seth realized there

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:46.849 
upon completing this Seth realized there
was<00:05:43.139> a<00:05:43.609> link<00:05:44.609> for<00:05:44.849> alternate<00:05:45.449> instructions<00:05:46.409> on

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:46.859 
was a link for alternate instructions on

00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:49.489 
was a link for alternate instructions on
the<00:05:47.789> website<00:05:48.239> so<00:05:48.449> i<00:05:48.719> thought<00:05:49.019> i<00:05:49.079> would<00:05:49.199> just

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:49.499 
the website so i thought i would just

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:52.579 
the website so i thought i would just
throw<00:05:50.099> together<00:05:50.339> too<00:05:50.849> short<00:05:51.179> you<00:05:51.389> there<00:05:51.629> use

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:52.589 
throw together too short you there use

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:56.989 
throw together too short you there use
about<00:05:52.949> half<00:05:53.009> the<00:05:53.369> pieces<00:05:54.709> so<00:05:55.709> very<00:05:56.099> low<00:05:56.279> now<00:05:56.939> we

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:56.999 
about half the pieces so very low now we

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:58.819 
about half the pieces so very low now we
return<00:05:57.329> to<00:05:57.569> our<00:05:57.839> regularly<00:05:58.169> scheduled

00:05:58.819 --> 00:05:58.829 
return to our regularly scheduled

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:01.909 
return to our regularly scheduled
programming<00:05:59.509> so<00:06:00.509> there<00:06:01.139> we<00:06:01.289> have<00:06:01.319> our

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919
