she makes the point there shouldn't be

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.010 
she makes the point there shouldn't be
like<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> hard<00:00:53.670> line<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.239> defines<00:00:54.360> gender

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
like a hard line that defines gender

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
gender roles are not gender rules I have

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.189 
gender roles are not gender rules I have
a<00:00:59.789> feeling<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.210> these<00:01:00.390> rules<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.989> kind<00:01:01.170> of

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
a feeling that these rules just kind of

naturally<00:01:01.829> developed<00:01:02.250> over<00:01:02.489> time<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:03.000> there

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
naturally developed over time like there

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.670 
naturally developed over time like there
was<00:01:03.239> two<00:01:03.449> tasks<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.049> had<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:04.439> done<00:01:04.650> that

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it absolutely could go either way but I

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.490

feel<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.390> there<00:01:09.600> was<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.930> way<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.260> made<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
feel like there was one way that made a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.469 
feel like there was one way that made a
little<00:01:10.740> more<00:01:10.979> sense<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.850> topics<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.330> these

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
little more sense but topics like these

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.300 
little more sense but topics like these
are<00:01:12.659> always<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:13.200> touchy<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
kind of get into them because you get

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.390 
kind of get into them because you get
some<00:01:15.869> really<00:01:16.140> great<00:01:16.439> responses<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.250> of
