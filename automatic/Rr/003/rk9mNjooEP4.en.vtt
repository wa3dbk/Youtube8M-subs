00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.509
 your fire sting and let's place 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.230
 sheet 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.490
 nintendo today has the 23 or today 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.920
 already 24 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.379
 sunday from 0 to 1 o'clock worldwide 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.840
 again a global test case allowed 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.240
 And yes, this time I want you as a girl 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.660
 deny and catch it with us 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.890
 the dab roller yes I know that 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.680
 nintendo now possible again 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.769
 and in this are even driving the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.420
 friends possibilities with built-in 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.100
 Hot if you have any friends 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.760
 you also play the game 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.719
 can join you without any problems 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.640
 I think it 's good that we do that 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.140
 now also want to test out 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.600
 they try that out again and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.600
 give us the opportunity again 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.449
 to play this ingenious game yes people 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.610
 and off you go I wonder if it is 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.219
 new maps are available as well 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.360
 Definitely find out who 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.890
 Definitely nice if she is not 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.690
 again the oil rig nautilus edge 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.609
 pushing the comma for schlager but 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.890
 it seems they are the same again 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.380
 maps should not bother us we can 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.810
 continue to gamble on the platoon that's it 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.369
 everything we want to do or and me 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.580
 with my scooter back on the mighty 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.689
 Europe 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.090
 if we get everything right 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.520
 and for that later something has to happen 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.670
 to be quieter that means not too much 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.740
 so please something 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.210
 take it into account because mine 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.070
 sister plain and country 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.299
 not so good when I'm so loud now 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.299
 as a result, scarcer 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.470
 yes maybe a bit 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.750
 difference to the last tact of the 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.900
 he has voice quality now i have now 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.770
 finally another microphone position 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.030
 Microphone position can also 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.250
 apparently change a lot 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.100
 my voice sounds deeper and deeper now 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.680
 generally afterwards as they are a real one 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.380
 to year card properly flattened so 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.440
 your ball tip in any case the new 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.620
 york lexar we are also pretty strong 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.510
 I think and let's go ahead to one 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.300
 our colleague year is also one 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.170
 skill of skela you do for yourself 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.170
 can claim 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.870
 the superjet on the touchscreen 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.630
 we can type a colleague completely 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.270
 easy to jump e-mail blade 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.500
 yes that's why the name super job and 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.930
 I just wanted to treat myself 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.460
 as well as times everything flattened behind the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.940
 we have another endangered and on 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.460
 it was a good thing we did 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.560
 actually dominate pretty strong right now 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.790
 if I need it 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.910
 and we want that, too 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.160
 keep our leadership 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.350
 the corner is still a bit green the 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.270
 to change 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.740
 No, never mind my points 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.840
 why has nobody done it here ? 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.790
 hello ok too little interest 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.140
 You also have to be careful that you 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.330
 enough twitter the kids can be seen 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.060
 behind one already there the world that the 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.430
 titles you have and while ever 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.600
 after how much we have embedded 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.060
 you have to always pay attention 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.090
 but I think that's not too big 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.090
 problem 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.860
 and here also have to reintroduce 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.200
 I'm really hot for the game 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.450
 The game will come out on May 28th and me 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.160
 yes, as I said first the 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.110
 singleplayer and the challenges of 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.370
 different amigos prefer that 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.590
 means they are first shown me 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.390
 also shows an unboxing video in the beginning 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.700
 where I show the amigos and everything 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.220
 because I have me all to order the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.860
 means and linklink girl so in the 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.720
 young girls and left creed which 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.319
 but the limited edition also with 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.910
 is included from the beginning and yes 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.360
 why that does not show all that I have 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.690
 That's why I'm doing it 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.079
 Yes, I told you that is also caught and 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.420
 each of the different amigos gives us 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.160
 Several jazz are available 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.630
 means we can then play and 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.070
 cope with it and when we master it 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.320
 we get special 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.090
 equipment then how will I become 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.489
 course also show and preferred the 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.860
 then compete online too 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.530
 use because I think so you have 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.810
 certain advantages because you just stronger 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.450
 is or can act better 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.229
 because better weapon better ways 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.660
 that just belongs together and judge 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.340
 the cat here always evaluates who 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.650
 has won and the case is natural 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.200
 like I think I'm not quite like that 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.410
 been uninvolved or what place 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.410
 I am 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.630
 i am always two years old 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.460
 but it is still behind the first one 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:40.510
 Well , I want to say we'll see each other 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:43.370
 easy again after it has done 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.660
 here you see it again it could not 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.580
 connection can be made there 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.470
 currently no further connection to 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.840
 servers are possible try it 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.060
 later again the servers are yes 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.130
 apparently really overwhelmed I think 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.710
 bit of a shame but you can not go 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:02.480
 Well you later I try it further 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.030
 mr. I'm really sorry but 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.070
 I tried and tried there 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.350
 until 1 o'clock the servers were closed 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.910
 I'm really sorry why I have the video 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.350
 Now put it up for you anyway 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.090
 just another taste 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.860
 to play the game and it is only 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.050
 a level but at least one 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.250
 further level and see in the background 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.540

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.640
 in the middle you come to the claims of 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.320
 multiplayer mode yes not too 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.630
