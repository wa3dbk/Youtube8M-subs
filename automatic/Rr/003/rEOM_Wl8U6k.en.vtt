00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.520
 I'll show you the new bosch today 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.680
 maximum 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:14.309
 I have the granite gray model of 630 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.930
 gx de with sensor control and i have 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.499
 not tried yet but 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.999
 just built 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:26.569
 the evening of the machine can be 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:26.569
 swing wonderfully high with this knox 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:38.670
 here is a cover that already 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.710
 then agreed here is a cover 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.820
 bridges ceiling with judge 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:52.969
 The funnel can be turned off 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.149
 nice big stainless steel shot 54 liters 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:02.550
 capacity of the bowl and 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:14.300
 1600 continues the machine now in the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:17.580
 Accessories once a stainless steel whisk 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:23.720
 very robust, I'm curious 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:31.620
 how it works a knethaken 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:33.960
 also stainless steel robust that here 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.070
 yet another son of kind knethaken 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.650
 with silicone and these silicone strips 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.830
 should be along the edge of the bowl 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.230
 slide and take any dough with you 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.230
 can be bent so easily here 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.080
 then the pass carver 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:09.780
 and the right inserts for it 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:12.870
 four pieces are on both sides 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.110
 suitable so have two different ones 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:25.830
 snow opportunities each per 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:28.050
 So that's it and in the next 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.490
 videos we will try the machine then 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.490
 right out
