00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.080
 but I could get there 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:12.040
 this is a ritual that is done for 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.760
 move the dam away from the marsh by raising 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.760
 a hand 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.189
 very good to all the kids and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.710
 mamas the bmw 2 and good and I'm here 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.400
 is rice is very good rite and as such 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.070
 we are low 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.050
 Well, my opponent today in this cup 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.290
 america is the first match the day 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.390
 1 and I face the king of the manual like this 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.490
 it's good that I go with Peru and Ecuador 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.000
 you already know 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.970
 Reserve with Paraguay and that's how good 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.350
 how about this team as you see it match 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.320
 the heights I think we can say 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:55.290
 here being sincere is this team its 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.600
 object me and a lot of silver little bronze and 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.120
 little gold but good a team manages 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.430
 let's say I have more or less has 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.220
 the same situation only goalkeeper of 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.750
 average 69 single center to the good zambrano 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.540
 the chemistry is a little bit messy 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.490
 question finally I give you the honor of the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.500
 T-shirt because since you go with Paraguay 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.970
 fabrics curraba and with the equipment of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.190
 there 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.720
 and I carry mine because I do not know what to wear 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.470
 I wear the one from Peru 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.470
 so 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.180
 how it protects the ball is what I have left 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.439
 why is 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.439
 physically the truth that we're going 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.430
 fernandez this theme what god 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:52.680
 and that looked like a crazy octopus 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.680
 barea shrunk all the tentacles there 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.350
 and now we're going to see it let's see there 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.930
 the net 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.930
 check that go go 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:14.000
 do not fuck me go good cloth then 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.000
 we started well 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.280
 and how are you going to 23 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.910
 even if you see more 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.769
 I'm like the bastard is running, that's what he 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.010
 let's fuck but it does not ruffle me 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.120
 a lot of time I go to the pass is that 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:51.370
 it seems that the good pass good 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:54.440
 Well, it's already 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.270
 if you were in player work 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.270
 and another dress and the ball anger 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.950
 ah 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.950
 they are working mothers 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.150
 to the barrier the goalkeeper moves super 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.150
 Of space 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.710
 it really is a goalie that is a good 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.710
 signal 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.520
 Well he proposes this very difficult 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.520
 above 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.799
 today I feel so much in power 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.659
 to this extreme I mean to have 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.730
 substances and to move at your leisure 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.849
 but this is where you can do me a lot 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.849
 hurt 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:51.930
 to see well 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.110
 He had great run of program runs 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.110
 with 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.080
 let's come this life 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.099
 and this is where the problems come 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.340
 it's really that if it's not a thing it 's 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.810
 another and in the end 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.810
 grass that passes 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.350
 and it is strong 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:44.530
 what's up but something weird happens I do not know I do not know 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.530
 what would it be but something weird without a doubt 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.310
 well let's see yes 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.310
 we can get something like that 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.210
 we're looking back is that they are three 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.680
 goals that do not take away any merit 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.680
 from for that 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:14.729
 last month the repetition and the shot and 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.729
 do not take out the arm gods are going to fall 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.770
 I'm very afraid that they throw 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.080
 that's precisely why 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.210
 Well, sovereign stick 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.690
 Custard receiving here from friend 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.690
 light 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.729
 it's like a pass 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.550
 forward and we handle the salle 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.639
 next to I passed it inside if it is that 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.639
 there really is 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:10.220
 but it does not react in time god 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.220
 desperate says it sounds bad 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.419
 of the living removal done but nothing 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:33.710
 but I'm already listening understands removes 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.990
 the desire to play seriously two games 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:39.189
 more like this and nobody is from those days that 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.189
 turn off the ground console 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.420
 host what great of the fabric 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.720
 now he said 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:55.130
 my mother 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.930
 for the game we just have to catch 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.990
 the electric racket that you carry between 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.710
 daughter of such that no one that the good 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:10.050
 match that the result is a bit 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:12.780
 less rage why uncle 03 I do not think 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.440
 that I think I deserved to at least 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.720
 some golito 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.300
 but equally you have played much better and 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.760
 The victory was worthy of luck 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:24.620
 What's left of the league is worth the first 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:28.340
 party does not happen anything is worth friends 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.139
 and nothing we see the next past 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.979
