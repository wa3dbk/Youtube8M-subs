down to the noise tab now not every

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.209 
down to the noise tab now not every
image<00:01:30.539> will<00:01:30.689> require<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.229> use<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.469> every<00:01:31.950> tab

but<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.060> still<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> good<00:01:33.509> idea<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.930> follow

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
but it's still a good idea to follow

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.679 
but it's still a good idea to follow
this<00:01:34.320> order<00:01:34.609> also<00:01:35.609> keep<00:01:35.969> in<00:01:36.060> mind<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
this order also keep in mind that the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.959 
this order also keep in mind that the

application of noise reduction will slow

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:40.700 
application of noise reduction will slow
down<00:01:39.000> your<00:01:39.390> adjustments<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.530> always

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
down your adjustments so it's always

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:00.230 
then doing some additional tweaking so
over<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> presets<00:01:59.670> panel<00:01:59.789> you'll

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
over here in the presets panel you'll

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.660 
over here in the presets panel you'll
see<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.450> variety<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.960> presets<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.490> can

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
see a variety of presets that you can

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.179 
see a variety of presets that you can
use<00:02:02.850> when<00:02:03.119> editing<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.749> the<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.140> now<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
use when editing with the just now the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.459 
use when editing with the just now the
idea<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.759> use<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.240> presets<00:02:06.719> as<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.960> starting

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
idea is to use the presets as a starting

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.919 
idea is to use the presets as a starting
point<00:02:07.710> for<00:02:07.979> your<00:02:08.099> adjustments<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:09.479> often<00:02:09.899> you

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
point for your adjustments but often you

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.780 
point for your adjustments but often you
may<00:02:10.200> notice<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.590> applying<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.400> preset

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
may notice that applying just a preset

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.860 
may notice that applying just a preset
alone<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.330> enough<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:13.620> can

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
alone is enough you can

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.720 
alone is enough you can
also<00:02:14.080> create<00:02:14.379> and<00:02:14.620> save<00:02:15.010> your<00:02:15.220> own<00:02:15.250> presets

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
also create and save your own presets

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.539 
also create and save your own presets
for<00:02:16.030> later<00:02:16.209> use<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:17.620> again<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.920> want<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.370> take

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
for later use so again I want to take

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.280 
for later use so again I want to take
