the magic mile is the very best way I

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.440 
the magic mile is the very best way I
have<00:03:30.990> found<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.860> determine<00:03:32.850> what<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.270> an

have found to determine what is an

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.620 
have found to determine what is an

what<00:04:23.160> you're<00:04:23.310> capable<00:04:23.520> of<00:04:23.970> doing<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:24.720> half

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
what you're capable of doing and a half

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.500 
what you're capable of doing and a half
marathon<00:04:25.200> or<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.860> marathon<00:04:26.490> because<00:04:27.030> over<00:04:27.390> the

marathon or a marathon because over the

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.810 
marathon or a marathon because over the
years<00:04:27.870> I've<00:04:28.140> crunched<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.980> numbers<00:04:29.010> I've

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
years I've crunched the numbers I've

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.020 
years I've crunched the numbers I've
taken<00:04:30.210> over<00:04:31.160> 15,000<00:04:32.160> instances<00:04:32.700> of<00:04:32.880> people

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
taken over 15,000 instances of people

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.090 
taken over 15,000 instances of people
running<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.570> magic<00:04:33.930> mile<00:04:34.169> and<00:04:34.470> then<00:04:34.560> compared

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
running a magic mile and then compared

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.219 
running a magic mile and then compared
it<00:04:35.220> with<00:04:35.610> what<00:04:35.850> they<00:04:36.000> ended<00:04:36.300> up<00:04:36.479> running<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:37.110> I

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
it with what they ended up running and I

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.830 
it with what they ended up running and I
found<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:37.710> most<00:04:38.370> people<00:04:38.700> tend<00:04:38.970> to<00:04:39.090> slow<00:04:39.630> down

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
found that most people tend to slow down

found that most people tend to slow down
20%<00:04:40.680> when<00:04:41.490> they<00:04:41.610> go<00:04:41.790> to<00:04:41.850> a<00:04:42.180> half<00:04:42.479> marathon<00:04:43.020> and

20% when they go to a half marathon and

of<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:14.010> magic<00:05:14.370> mile<00:05:14.580> is<00:05:14.910> to<00:05:15.360> determine<00:05:15.750> what

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
of the magic mile is to determine what

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.409 
of the magic mile is to determine what
your<00:05:16.260> long-run<00:05:16.740> pace<00:05:16.979> should<00:05:17.430> be<00:05:17.760> and<00:05:18.030> that's

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
your long-run pace should be and that's

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.450 
your long-run pace should be and that's
determined<00:05:18.660> very<00:05:19.080> simply<00:05:19.650> by<00:05:19.830> adding<00:05:20.070> two

determined very simply by adding two

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.390 
determined very simply by adding two
minutes<00:05:20.880> to<00:05:21.450> what<00:05:21.630> is<00:05:21.780> predicted<00:05:22.440> in<00:05:22.620> the

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
minutes to what is predicted in the

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.340 
minutes to what is predicted in the
marathon<00:05:23.700> even<00:05:24.120> if<00:05:24.419> you're<00:05:24.600> training<00:05:24.930> for<00:05:25.289> the

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
marathon even if you're training for the

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.460 
marathon even if you're training for the
half<00:05:25.530> marathon<00:05:25.830> so<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.789> example<00:05:27.360> here

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
half marathon so the example here

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.170 
half marathon so the example here
someone<00:05:28.470> that<00:05:28.650> runs<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:29.130> ten<00:05:29.490> minute<00:05:29.700> flat

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
magic mile as their fastest magic mile

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.490 
magic mile as their fastest magic mile
multiplied<00:05:34.200> by<00:05:34.490> 1.3<00:05:35.490> that<00:05:36.090> predicts<00:05:36.870> a<00:05:36.990> really

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
multiplied by 1.3 that predicts a really

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.650 
multiplied by 1.3 that predicts a really
fast<00:05:37.860> marathon<00:05:38.520> pace<00:05:38.820> of<00:05:39.120> 13

fast marathon pace of 13
minutes<00:05:40.050> per<00:05:40.260> mile<00:05:40.470> so<00:05:40.500> that<00:05:40.920> person<00:05:41.370> should

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.020 
mile on their long runs the main concept
here<00:05:48.720> is<00:05:48.870> that<00:05:49.230> the<00:05:49.830> pace<00:05:50.100> that<00:05:50.670> is

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
here is that the pace that is

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.050 
here is that the pace that is
recommended<00:05:51.540> for<00:05:52.050> long<00:05:52.230> runs<00:05:52.530> is<00:05:52.890> the<00:05:53.100> fastest

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
recommended for long runs is the fastest

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.970

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
that pace all this means is that you

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.070 
that pace all this means is that you
will<00:06:01.560> recover<00:06:01.920> faster<00:06:02.640> it<00:06:03.330> all<00:06:03.510> falls<00:06:03.810> into
