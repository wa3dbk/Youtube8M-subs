I'll<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.110> start<00:00:43.410> with<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.590> build<00:00:43.890> quality

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
I'll just start with the build quality

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.069 
I'll just start with the build quality
the<00:00:44.430> bill<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.210> nice<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.690> think<00:00:45.930> that

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the bill is really nice I think that

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.529 
the bill is really nice I think that
there<00:00:46.289> they<00:00:47.129> are<00:00:47.340> built<00:00:47.700> really<00:00:47.789> well<00:00:47.940> there's

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
there they are built really well there's

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.270 
there they are built really well there's
the<00:00:48.809> same<00:00:48.989> very<00:00:49.200> hard<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.680> won't<00:00:49.860> break

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the same very hard and they won't break

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.819 
the same very hard and they won't break
easily<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.360> cables<00:00:51.690> also<00:00:51.870> very<00:00:52.230> thick<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.770> you

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
easily the cables also very thick so you

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.520 
easily the cables also very thick so you
don't<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.250> worry<00:00:53.430> about<00:00:53.550> its<00:00:53.730> splitting

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
don't have to worry about its splitting

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.319 
don't have to worry about its splitting
the<00:00:55.530> cables<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:56.070> removable<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:57.000> anything

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the cables are removable so if anything

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.939 
the cables are removable so if anything
were<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> happen<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.680> take<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
were to happen you can just take the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.270 
were to happen you can just take the
cable<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.430> replace<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:00.020> um<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.100> for

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
cable out and replace it um so as for

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.399 
cable out and replace it um so as for
the<00:01:02.399> sound<00:01:02.670> these<00:01:02.969> are<00:01:03.210> triple<00:01:03.660> drivers<00:01:04.049> so

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
the sound these are triple drivers so

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.100 
the sound these are triple drivers so
you<00:01:05.010> they<00:01:05.489> will<00:01:05.670> cover<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.330> lot<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.570> music

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.690 
you they will cover a lot of music
genres<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.710> that's<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.189> really<00:01:08.430> good<00:01:08.549> for

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
genres and that's it's really good for

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.530 
genres and that's it's really good for
that<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:10.040> personally<00:01:11.040> look<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.119> earphones

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
that I personally look for earphones

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.320 
that I personally look for earphones
that<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:13.409> well<00:01:13.590> with<00:01:13.770> vocals<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:15.299> I

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that do well with vocals and when I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.550 
that do well with vocals and when I
first<00:01:15.540> tried<00:01:15.720> them<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.110> thought<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.470> they

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
first tried them I thought that they

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.560 
first tried them I thought that they
really<00:01:16.860> fit<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.280> them<00:01:17.490> they<00:01:18.180> book<00:01:18.390> was

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
really fit with them they book was

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.039 
really fit with them they book was
really<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:19.700> really<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.909> front<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.509> they

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
really really really up front and they

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.710 
really really really up front and they
really<00:01:22.259> shone<00:01:22.500> through<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.540> really

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
really shone through and it was really

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.590 
really shone through and it was really
clear<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:26.250> base<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.460> low<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.000> warm<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.450> it's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
clear the base is low and warm and it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.179 
clear the base is low and warm and it's
not<00:01:27.780> too<00:01:27.960> overpowering<00:01:28.259> which<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.920> exactly

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
not too overpowering which is exactly

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.390 
not too overpowering which is exactly
what<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:31.560> only<00:01:31.799> problem<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.340> that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
what I like the only problem is that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.420 
what I like the only problem is that
they're<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:33.060> big<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:34.860> anyone<00:01:35.189> was<00:01:35.400> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
they're really big so if anyone was a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.249 
they're really big so if anyone was a
small<00:01:35.820> ear<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.360> gonna<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.750> really<00:01:36.960> hard<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
small ear it's gonna be really hard to

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.319 
small ear it's gonna be really hard to
keep<00:01:37.470> them<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.860> there<00:01:38.189> they're<00:01:38.549> meant<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> be

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
keep them in there they're meant to be

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.870 
keep them in there they're meant to be
placed<00:01:39.780> over<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.110> ear<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.070> makes<00:01:41.759> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
placed over the ear so that makes a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.550 
placed over the ear so that makes a
little<00:01:42.030> bit<00:01:42.299> easier<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:42.840> they<00:01:42.869> do<00:01:43.020> stick<00:01:43.409> out

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
little bit easier but they do stick out

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.280 
little bit easier but they do stick out
a<00:01:43.590> lot<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.790> you're<00:01:45.060> wearing<00:01:45.540> even<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.200> you

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
a lot and if you're wearing even if you

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.780 
a lot and if you're wearing even if you
