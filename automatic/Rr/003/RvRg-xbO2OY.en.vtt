going to give can I circle to keep a few

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.980 
going to give can I circle to keep a few
things<00:02:33.260> but<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:35.450> I've<00:02:35.600> learned<00:02:35.750> my<00:02:35.960> English

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
things but like I've learned my English

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.510 
things but like I've learned my English
is<00:02:36.260> not<00:02:36.380> as<00:02:36.620> good<00:02:36.770> as<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:36.980> thought<00:02:37.160> there's<00:02:37.430> a

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
is not as good as I thought there's a

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.100 
is not as good as I thought there's a
lot<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.670> like<00:02:38.150> grammatical<00:02:38.690> rules<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.080> I

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
lot of like grammatical rules that I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.750 
lot of like grammatical rules that I
just<00:02:39.319> don't<00:02:39.500> know<00:02:39.650> I<00:02:39.890> look<00:02:40.160> at<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.310> sentence<00:02:40.670> and

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
just don't know I look at a sentence and

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.430 
just don't know I look at a sentence and
I<00:02:40.850> think<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.630> doesn't<00:02:41.900> sound<00:02:42.170> quite<00:02:42.350> as

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
I think that doesn't sound quite as

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.190 
I think that doesn't sound quite as
natural<00:02:42.980> as<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.280> could<00:02:43.490> and<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:44.450> go<00:02:44.630> off<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:45.020> that

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
natural as it could and I go off of that

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.320 
natural as it could and I go off of that
so<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.500> told<00:02:45.770> her<00:02:45.950> one<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.340> her<00:02:46.460> sentences<00:02:47.000> would

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
so I told her one of her sentences would

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.880 
so I told her one of her sentences would
have<00:02:47.510> sounded<00:02:47.690> better<00:02:48.080> if<00:02:48.380> she<00:02:48.530> had<00:02:48.620> written

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
have sounded better if she had written

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.840 
have sounded better if she had written
it<00:02:49.010> this<00:02:49.520> other<00:02:49.730> way<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.300> she<00:02:51.080> goes<00:02:51.110> oh<00:02:51.470> so

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
it this other way and she goes oh so

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.520 
it this other way and she goes oh so
Japanese<00:02:52.850> textbooks<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.780> dictionaries<00:02:54.319> are

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
Japanese textbooks and dictionaries are

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.940

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
placed it a bit more of a competitive

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.620 
placed it a bit more of a competitive
school<00:04:36.440> which<00:04:37.310> is<00:04:37.340> my<00:04:37.550> base<00:04:37.760> school<00:04:38.030> which<00:04:38.479> is

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
school which is my base school which is

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.540 
school which is my base school which is
where<00:04:38.810> my<00:04:38.960> predecessor<00:04:39.560> sort<00:04:40.280> of<00:04:40.340> broke

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
where my predecessor sort of broke

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.159 
where my predecessor sort of broke
contract<00:04:41.000> and<00:04:41.150> left<00:04:41.360> so<00:04:42.229> I<00:04:42.760> can't<00:04:43.760> be<00:04:43.940> sure<00:04:44.419> but

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
contract and left so I can't be sure but

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.620 
contract and left so I can't be sure but
I<00:04:45.229> think<00:04:45.320> that<00:04:45.740> my<00:04:46.099> workload<00:04:46.370> might<00:04:46.970> maybe<00:04:47.419> be

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
I think that my workload might maybe be

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.930 
I think that my workload might maybe be
a<00:04:47.810> little<00:04:47.930> bit<00:04:48.669> more<00:04:49.669> than<00:04:50.180> most<00:04:50.449> lt's<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:52.280> try

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
a little bit more than most lt's I try

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.080 
a little bit more than most lt's I try
to<00:04:52.970> get<00:04:53.120> there<00:04:53.330> about<00:04:53.449> 810<00:04:54.139> I<00:04:54.380> leave<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:55.090> just

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
to get there about 810 I leave that just

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.589 
to get there about 810 I leave that just
before<00:04:56.300> five<00:04:56.570> o'clock<00:04:56.630> and<00:04:58.030> in<00:04:59.030> terms<00:04:59.210> of<00:04:59.360> time

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
before five o'clock and in terms of time

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.360 
before five o'clock and in terms of time
it's<00:04:59.810> not<00:04:59.870> that<00:05:00.080> much<00:05:00.229> but<00:05:00.470> honestly<00:05:00.949> I<00:05:01.039> wish

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370
