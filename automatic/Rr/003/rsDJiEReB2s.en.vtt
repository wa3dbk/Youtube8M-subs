 as 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.720
 manolo 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.220
 CÃ©lestin will debut in this has something to do with it 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.100
 such since assumption 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.660
 this nature 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.230
 maybe when I listen is the term global warming many in 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.830
 sci-fi movies of radical environmental groups or even worse than 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.250
 it's been many years before they become reality, maybe if 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.760
 they are recovering 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.270
 this is our planet 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.870
 the house that surrounds it from the atmosphere its function is to treat some of the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.110
 Sun rays and keep them inside the planet to conserve a temperature 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.840
 of 15 degrees Celsius otherwise the sun's rays will 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.610
 would escape if our planet would drop to a temperature of -18 degrees 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.040
 centigrade 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.580
 this is known as greenhouse effect ten effected by gases like steam 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.830
 of water the carbon dioxide methane and we in an adequate proportion 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.280
 Greenhouse gases fulfill their purpose 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.290
 but you and your concentration increases the sun's rays can not escape if the 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.659
 temperature of the planet 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.290
 if really with repercussions that these causes this is the concentration of 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.770
 carbon dioxide the global average temperature of the last 30 years 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.869
 and this is the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere currently 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.510
 routes some relation 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.850
 because they increase greenhouse gases there are three factors 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.200
 fundamental 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.670
 the burning of fossil fuels 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.470
 the destruction of forests that absorb carbon dioxide and the increase of 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.270
 the whole population is a vicious circle the population of the world increases 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.680
 dizzily which supposes a greater demand of food water and the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.159
 natural resources 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.329
 the trees absorb a large percentage of the dioxide emanations 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.020
 carbon 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.710
 but now we are destroying our forests and jungles the lungs 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.670
 of our planet to meet the demands that lead to the third point 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.769
 of the vicious circle 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.469
 obsolete technologies 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.659
 the human being still uses coal-based plants to generate energy 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.669
 this translates into 2 thousand 500 million tons of carbon dioxide per year 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.739
 that excessive use of the Geneva car be expelled into the environment 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.399
 hundreds of millions of tons of carbon dioxide that are going away 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.269
 he urged the atmosphere what consequences the 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.859
 global warming let's see 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.459
 When caught, a greater number of sun rays and the temperature of the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.699
 planet increase this causes shinji okazaki water shortage so that it does not 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.549
 lose 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.329
 paradoxically, global warming also predicted rains of 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.339
 more severe floods 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:16.099
 the sun's rays increase the temperature of the oceans this causes 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.099
 greater evaporation and more severe rainfall 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.759
 but also when a hurricane prevents contagion 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.239
 in warmer waters 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.709
 the worst happens 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.709
 the increase in temperature occasion also that which one is unknown 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.079
 as a consequence basagoiti a central plus weight raise the level of the 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.389
 oceans causing severe floods the problem is serious if the sea level 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:45.899
 will raise 6 meters breaststroke and some places like lorica san francisco holland 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:50.049
 in fact illusion that I have to prove nobody nobody started when 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.169
 one person denounced the coasts of chile 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.769
 you can keep cheating you can keep thinking there's still time to change 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.219
 but that's not true we have to start acting now here there are some 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.219
 municipalities points that you can adopt to help the planet 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.369
 buy energy-saving lights 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:14.239
 turn off electrical appliances instead of leaving them on hold reduces consumption 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.470
 of heaters and air conditioning if you can buy a motor car 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:22.889
 own electricity of a percentage of 17 kilometers per liter 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:27.869
 maintained always had as victims who do not share the car 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.479
 walking opposed bicycle 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.340
 use less hot water to bread and art washes clothes with cold water porthole 

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:39.649
 recycle separate trash planted a tree 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:46.779
 We are finishing the planet this wonderful world that makes us so much 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:51.499
 we are on time but we have to change our way of thinking and 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.499
 start acting now 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.220
 yet
