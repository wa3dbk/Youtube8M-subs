00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.249
 padi 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.249
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.640
 Hi everyone this guitar course is to introduce the phrase using the power cord 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.290
 Though 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:47.629
 And also this time I use a technique called lining 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:50.150
 Usually I talk Then see in the continuous marks what one of such a large number of eighth notes is because backing 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.990
 Cheap it's I also previously threatened weak beats 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.470
 That is the love of strong beat 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:00.150
 We talked about how to take rhythm by good 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:04.890
 Weak towards the back of the lie selling strongly towards the head in a normal sub 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.820
 Weak person of the head in the case of the backing but is a translation of how to take the rhythm in beating 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:16.330
 Stronger behind 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:20.590
 I is at the bottom with respect to take the Nppe rhythm slept better of the above by doing so that you 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:26.810
 I will take a rhythm like that 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:33.020
 In fact, it is not Yeah because in the case of this phrase are using a technique called shuffle to 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.009
 Well here eight minutes benefit is in the middle and that hope of triples is shaken 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.820
 But also 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.130
 Shall we play slowly ? 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:46.060
 Mountain stroke day 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:51.170
 Firmly pressing the up stroke Nde not issue a sound emerged to take cutting 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:56.530
 It has become a place to hold the place and make a sound, so this time 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:00.130
 I'm using a power cord but my index finger is a 6th string with 5 frets 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:05.909
 And the ring finger is 5 cases of 7 frets 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:10.490
 The other thing is to mute this side of the finger by touching the strings lightly 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:15.850
 It is done and luck 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.850
 At the beginning, everything was on the turn 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:33.890
 I have heard the wind say what 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:39.560
 And oh 2 fret aaron a would have do do 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:42.140
 It looks like the way you look at the turn of the turn 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.660
 Shift to the bottom 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.910
 Yup 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.510
 It does Deee's is due to be 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:59.050
 Turner at the power code of salt 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:02.140
 He came in front of the fret in the middle and left him in heavy rain in Kobe branch office as it was g 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.710
 Yes 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:10.320
 Much And then came down one by stone 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.320
 The power of d Kawahiro c 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.670
 I wonder if I came to the lower side 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:21.650
 I think you have come to the above six-string this matter 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:24.340
 So it's not only that I'll touch lightly the previous whiff of part of the index finger of the child 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.340
 You can mute 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:39.380
 Cutting approach feet saying, it sinks in it that character by that we play in 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:40.490
 As a king , in the sense that it sounds only the necessary matter when pulling something 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.860
 You can use it 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:52.070
 So while practicing this phrase, make good use of its power cord 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.260
 And there is also a way to make the necessary sound out and eliminate the unnecessary sound . 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.180
 about 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.370
 road 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.980
 If you wear well 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.319
 With this in mind 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.319
 I think it seems like you're better off
