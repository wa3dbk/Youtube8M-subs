00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 ways greets you wanna know 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.879
 Clearly sell sharply for breaking 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.360
 Now we will analyze the selection 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.280
 tasks c 3 and 9 question so for what 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.610
 featured determines ownership 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.170
 plants to the cruciferous family 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.910
 let's remember the cruciferous family 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.010
 relates monocot class and most 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.779
 the main features that characterize 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.410
 plant belonging to different 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.019
 families 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.060
 This is the structure of the flower, that is, the first with 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.160
 what should we start with this formula 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:40.820
 flower now I'll write it and then I will explain 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.649
 flower shape will be it right and those 4 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:50.879
 l 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:54.239
 4 pupil 24 and one pestle and so this 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.340
 flower formula meaning each 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.520
 element is this asterisk it means that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.690
 Flower correct recall that correctly 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.549
 the flower has several axes of symmetry 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.340
 cruciferous way by what 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.200
 representative 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.090
 this cabbage is swede 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.520
 This repo colza shepherd's bag 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.840
 I really a beautiful flower but 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.330
 no less than it looks like 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.759
 cruciferous right now I'm you 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.119
 I demonstrate that I can get through 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.880
 this flower has several axes of symmetry this 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.619
 says that the flower is correct and we 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.220
 this is correcting the formula here 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.259
 an asterisk is characteristic of 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.509
 cruciferous on petals have them 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.590
 sorry for the sepals to remind 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:47.520
 sepals are green leaves which 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:52.020
 I also have a cup of them 4 on my bony 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.479
 drawings of this are not visible further petals 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.149
 4 1 2 3 4 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.799
 they are all separate ie we show 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.920
 usually with a brace if 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.759
 accrete petal here they are of birth 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.730
 how do stamens 2 + 4 mean what it is 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.760
 two rows in the same stamen row 4 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.180
 in another row 2 this is what we show 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.510
 plus sign that they lie in two rows 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.319
 and a pestle one so that it is characteristic 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.920
 principle for all 2 characteristic is 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.260
 what will not be what will inflorescence you 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.840
 flowers we will gather inflorescence 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.569
 for general for cruciferous many 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.420
 inflorescences characteristic and but more 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.319
 still it is a brush 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:46.799
 most and the third characteristic is 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:51.269
 what will be the fruit of the cruciferous stronghold 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.780
 he will be specific this pod or 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.780
 pod 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:03.010
 so yes here are these three characteristics three 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.390
 characteristics you are good just 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.640
 determine the plant belonging to 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.230
 cruciferous family that is a long time ago 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.470
 remembering this flower structure 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.420
 rules set was school I want to know about 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.489
 ostrenko him subscribe to our channel 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.590
 on youtube riot now run come to us 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.950
 Moscow courses get ready for the game together 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.950
 with us
