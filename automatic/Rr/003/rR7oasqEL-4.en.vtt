00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.490 
size for 76 mm x 3 7 5 mm you can use a
medium<00:00:32.099> size<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> simple<00:00:33.300> or<00:00:33.540> smaller<00:00:34.230> one

which is 7.5 cm so any and then using a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.720 
which is 7.5 cm so any and then using a
ruler<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.600> pen<00:00:40.440> pencil<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.250> marker<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:43.730> so

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
paper is to use the paper to make into a

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
find using ruler better but to make it

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.180 
find using ruler better but to make it
fast<00:02:05.850> I'm<00:02:06.030> using<00:02:06.240> scissors<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.590> all<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.010> need

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
fast I'm using scissors so all you need

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:31.880 
fast I'm using scissors so all you need
to<00:02:08.250> do<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.850> Train

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.530 

so<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:34.300> get<00:02:34.630> these<00:02:35.440> triangles<00:02:36.430> then<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.330> just

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
so you get these triangles then you just

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.080 
so you get these triangles then you just
want<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.780> open<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.260> up<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:39.490> then<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.910> wanna

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
want to open it up and then you wanna

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.670 
want to open it up and then you wanna
make<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:40.540> into<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.780> cut<00:02:41.050> line

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
make it into a cut line

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.199 
make it into a cut line
so<00:02:42.130> using<00:02:42.550> this<00:02:43.770> make<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.920> diamond<00:02:45.400> using<00:02:46.000> this

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
so using this make a diamond using this

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.480 
so using this make a diamond using this
part<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.990> wanna<00:02:47.170> fold<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.860> other<00:02:48.100> part

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
part you wanna fold it to the other part

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:58.290 
part you wanna fold it to the other part
of<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.020> wanna<00:02:56.500> use<00:02:56.860> your<00:02:57.100> hand<00:02:57.550> finger

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
of it so you wanna use your hand finger

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.590 
of it so you wanna use your hand finger
to<00:02:58.989> drag<00:02:59.739> down<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:01.270> line<00:03:02.070> here<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:04.090> then

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
to drag down to the line here and then

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.440 
to drag down to the line here and then
you<00:03:05.500> spread<00:03:05.920> out<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.400> then<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.940> press<00:03:07.269> it

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
you spread out and then you press it

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.490 
you spread out and then you press it
that's<00:03:07.989> how<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.170> do<00:03:08.350> it<00:03:08.380> easier<00:03:08.800> then<00:03:10.500> using

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
that's how you do it easier then using

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.280 
that's how you do it easier then using
this<00:03:11.680> points<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.519> want<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.850> put<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.180> here<00:03:13.480> into

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
this points you want to put it here into

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.280 
this points you want to put it here into
the<00:03:14.500> middle<00:03:16.140> then<00:03:17.140> you<00:03:17.290> press<00:03:17.560> it

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.770 

maybe<00:03:21.980> what<00:03:22.580> they<00:03:22.670> are<00:03:22.819> finger<00:03:23.120> here<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:23.720> you

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
my everything where I put them looking

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.600 
my everything where I put them looking
better<00:05:22.729> done<00:05:23.090> so<00:05:23.840> fit<00:05:24.259> you<00:05:24.560> will<00:05:24.710> at<00:05:24.979> one<00:05:25.280> box

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
better done so fit you will at one box

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.149 
better done so fit you will at one box
you<00:05:25.880> find<00:05:26.210> another<00:05:26.630> line<00:05:26.960> in<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.650> middle<00:05:27.800> a

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 
you find another line in the middle a

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:37.480 
you find another line in the middle a
dot<00:05:28.370> and<00:05:28.970> then<00:05:29.270> from<00:05:29.659> the<00:05:29.870> middle<00:05:30.020> again<00:05:36.490> then

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
dot and then from the middle again then

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.700 
dot and then from the middle again then
they<00:05:37.909> you<00:05:37.969> get<00:05:38.210> one<00:05:38.509> under<00:05:38.960> you<00:05:39.110> go<00:05:39.289> down<00:05:39.469> one

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
they you get one under you go down one

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.010 
they you get one under you go down one
box<00:05:40.610> and<00:05:41.270> then<00:05:41.599> you<00:05:41.750> get<00:05:41.960> from<00:05:42.710> here<00:05:43.780> you<00:05:44.780> get

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
box and then you get from here you get

00:05:45.020 --> 00:06:02.940 
box and then you get from here you get
one<00:05:45.229> you<00:05:45.830> go<00:05:46.009> one<00:05:46.310> box<00:05:46.610> here<00:05:47.320> at<00:05:59.349> 9.10<00:06:00.349> SOTA

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.880 

so<00:06:03.670> anyways<00:06:04.030> using<00:06:04.870> the<00:06:04.990> scissors<00:06:05.440> you<00:06:05.650> want

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
so anyways using the scissors you want

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.370 
so anyways using the scissors you want
to<00:06:06.010> cut<00:06:06.250> too<00:06:06.460> don't<00:06:07.000> you<00:06:07.600> don't<00:06:07.810> end<00:06:08.080> of<00:06:08.200> it

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
to cut too don't you don't end of it

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.430 
to cut too don't you don't end of it
don't<00:06:10.740> so<00:06:11.740> all<00:06:11.890> you<00:06:12.040> need<00:06:12.220> to<00:06:12.280> do<00:06:12.580> is<00:06:13.270> to<00:06:13.630> cut

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
don't so all you need to do is to cut

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.550 
don't so all you need to do is to cut
this<00:06:18.300> you<00:06:19.300> don't<00:06:19.450> want<00:06:19.690> to<00:06:19.810> use<00:06:19.960> the<00:06:20.080> ruler<00:06:20.320> for

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
this you don't want to use the ruler for

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.020 
this you don't want to use the ruler for
this<00:06:20.710> because<00:06:20.920> it<00:06:21.220> will<00:06:21.310> be<00:06:21.520> ending<00:06:21.940> really

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
this because it will be ending really

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.920 
this because it will be ending really
soggy<00:06:26.730> they<00:06:27.730> cut<00:06:28.000> it<00:06:28.180> like<00:06:28.360> into<00:06:28.630> you<00:06:28.810> like

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
soggy they cut it like into you like

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:50.010 
soggy they cut it like into you like
that<00:06:29.460> so<00:06:30.460> cut<00:06:30.640> it<00:06:30.670> for<00:06:30.910> the<00:06:30.970> other<00:06:31.270> side<00:06:31.450> -<00:06:48.570> okay

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
that so cut it for the other side - okay

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.190 
that so cut it for the other side - okay
then<00:06:50.440> after<00:06:51.400> you<00:06:51.520> cut<00:06:51.790> it<00:06:52.030> you<00:06:52.330> get<00:06:52.690> it<00:06:52.930> like

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 
then after you cut it you get it like

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.670 
then after you cut it you get it like
that<00:06:53.610> so<00:06:54.610> this<00:06:55.030> basically<00:06:55.660> is<00:06:55.780> only<00:06:56.500> two

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
that so this basically is only two

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.330 
that so this basically is only two
triangles<00:06:57.280> outside<00:06:58.290> so<00:06:59.290> these<00:06:59.710> two<00:06:59.980> triangles

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
triangles outside so these two triangles

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.730 
triangles outside so these two triangles
we'll<00:07:00.880> call<00:07:01.120> it<00:07:01.240> big<00:07:01.420> training<00:07:01.720> and<00:07:02.170> this<00:07:02.560> one

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
we'll call it big training and this one

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.720 
we'll call it big training and this one
we<00:07:02.860> call<00:07:03.070> it<00:07:03.190> a<00:07:03.220> house<00:07:03.490> and<00:07:03.970> this<00:07:04.660> on<00:07:04.840> a<00:07:05.110> roof

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.730 
we call it a house and this on a roof

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.920 
we call it a house and this on a roof
then<00:07:07.530> using<00:07:08.530> the<00:07:08.740> tool<00:07:09.100> a<00:07:09.460> big<00:07:09.910> triangle<00:07:10.630> the

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
then using the tool a big triangle the

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.290 
then using the tool a big triangle the
pointy<00:07:11.380> part<00:07:11.710> you<00:07:12.430> want<00:07:12.610> to<00:07:12.730> go<00:07:12.880> all<00:07:13.120> the<00:07:13.240> way

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 
pointy part you want to go all the way

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.430 
pointy part you want to go all the way
into<00:07:13.570> the<00:07:13.780> middle<00:07:14.050> point<00:07:15.390> then<00:07:16.390> using<00:07:17.200> these

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 
into the middle point then using these

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.400 
into the middle point then using these
two<00:07:17.710> flaps<00:07:18.070> you<00:07:18.400> wanna<00:07:18.760> put<00:07:19.120> it<00:07:19.240> in<00:07:19.510> into<00:07:19.930> this

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410 
two flaps you wanna put it in into this

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.420 
two flaps you wanna put it in into this
dot<00:07:20.800> we're<00:07:21.730> gonna<00:07:22.030> put<00:07:22.390> here<00:07:22.690> and<00:07:22.930> then<00:07:23.710> for

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430 
dot we're gonna put here and then for

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:33.090 
dot we're gonna put here and then for
this<00:07:24.610> one<00:07:24.850> or<00:07:25.000> so<00:07:30.900> then<00:07:31.900> all<00:07:32.500> you<00:07:32.680> need<00:07:32.710> to<00:07:32.860> do

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:33.100 
this one or so then all you need to do

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:39.200 
this one or so then all you need to do
is<00:07:33.280> to<00:07:33.430> for<00:07:33.670> the<00:07:33.760> air<00:07:33.970> like<00:07:34.630> that<00:07:36.900> using<00:07:37.900> the

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.210 
is to for the air like that using the

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:44.550 
is to for the air like that using the
house<00:07:40.210> to<00:07:40.690> keep<00:07:41.260> it<00:07:41.470> over<00:07:42.090> and<00:07:43.090> then<00:07:43.780> so<00:07:44.410> the

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 
house to keep it over and then so the

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.510 
house to keep it over and then so the
move<00:07:44.800> of<00:07:45.010> the<00:07:45.040> house<00:07:45.400> must<00:07:45.820> end<00:07:46.120> up<00:07:46.270> like<00:07:46.480> that
