 Strong fire until it starts to boil 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.880
 once our mixture starts to 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.830
 boil down let's put the fire under and what 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.560
 we're going to leave two boiling 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.440
 minutes once you have passed a 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.720
 two minutes we're going to put out the fire and what 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.270
 we are going to withdraw and we are going to leave here that 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.340
 cool while it cools let's go to 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.960
 happen to cut the fruits first let's go 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.680
 to cut the bananas we're going to 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.680
 cut in slices 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.079
 Not very large 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.149
 once we have cut the 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.420
 bananas let's move on to cut the pineapple 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.960
 taquitos let's cut it first in the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.290
 slices 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.650
 and we already cut it first of this 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.650
 shape 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.430
 and then 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.880
 well and we'll have taquitos 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.710

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.110
 that we have cut the pineapple 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.150
 happen to cut the peach in my case 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.800
 As I like the skin, I have just 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.530
 washed and I have not removed the skin but if 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.539
 we like it so you can peel it 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.259
 let's cut it so the closest to the 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.259
 possible bone 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.129
 and these pieces are going to cut the 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.129
 appetites 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.219
 once we have cut we are going to 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:32.519
 spend the 3000 I usually peel this 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:34.709
 shape we cut it with the first half and 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.530
 With the help of a spoon we are going to 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.250
 remove it flush with the skin 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.250
 we are turning 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.450
 and her skin is removing 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.629
 when we have finished we make door 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.480
 and here I will come out clean and we went to 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.950
 cut it into slices 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.950

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.629
