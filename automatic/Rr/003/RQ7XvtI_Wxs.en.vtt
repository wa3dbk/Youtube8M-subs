00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.220
 village 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:19.689
 separate frame grazes the actual entry into 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:24.100
 this side of the village is the only road 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:31.940
 there while the road to Vladirovka 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:34.940
 all there you will not pass no people do not MSS 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:41.059
 no one all residents sit at home and 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:43.449
 can not get out and no one is home 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.449
 can 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.120
 Telman settlement 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.710
 setting the good bus last yet 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:12.770
 that road goes I certainly wanted to go 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.120
 there show what's going on in 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.229
 running shoes it will be very difficult 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.180
 it must be difficult to do in the car 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.110
 to drive 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.110
 are good men 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.070
 try to show duplicate lives 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.780
 guys railwaymen 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.840
 thank them so much they 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.560
 here is a wonderful dam which according to not 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.909
 I know who I must save 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:55.899
 village from the water which is actually here 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:02:01.920
 she is the other side of the dam she was there 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.920
 Tunguska field there is now on the mind 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:13.239
 racetrack as they said on tv 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:18.250
 the only far east is not yet 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:23.110
 cupid is groundwater mur over there 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:27.700
 ahead of us and that's about there on that 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.170
 altitude cupid that's the dam 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.630
 Unfortunately I would like to take pictures there 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.510
 Well there is not given there are 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.700
 railway workers they work there 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.310
 the fire can be seen in the distance 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.900
 which here has something tried 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.420
 pump out 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.989
 but as far as I know she is not right now 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.849
 it works just because it broke 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:57.970
 water pump 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:03:00.549
 Here is what we can say 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.030
 here are such a road like this now 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:10.379
 then we will go try to show you well 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:17.620
 This is what the structures call Dombai. 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:19.299
 it is designed to keep water which 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.680
 oozing through this one 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.739
 railway embankment 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.370
 there they decided far away after all 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:31.319
 correct your mistakes after 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.269
 today's breakthrough of this dam say 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.129
 Now let's go show what's there 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.870
 happens in reality and how it 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:46.780
 It looks like this 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:49.569
 this dam regret say here lap 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:54.239
 which many have seen driving through 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.239
 Amur bridge 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:02.220
 that's what the sun is doing unfortunately 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.740
 interferes but there is a house flooded and some 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.770
 beats trickle see someone deflates 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.770
 water 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:15.850
 Here is such a beautiful dam even 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.640
 will call dam and call 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.920
 construction 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.310
 This facility saves us from 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:30.280
 water male 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.280
 which combine 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:39.360
 here is the actual breakthrough place today 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:39.360
 which despite the fact that people know 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.080
 12 hours no one can close up 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.180
 literate 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.020
 who is there and 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.180
 he will 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.540
 trying to do a second because here 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.560
 the battle 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.560
 they lost 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:07.240
 Well, actually this dam as far as I am 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:13.100
 I could walk here because I washed 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.449
 here we will not do anything and judging by 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:20.150
 to flow 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:23.059
 and there we go further there the water goes 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:27.849
 actively to houses for what is lower 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:31.389
 flooded that higher 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.389
 still holding 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:40.560
 now here are the good ones 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:45.270
 what a good building moment i am very 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:49.260
 I wanted to show when it started with us 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:52.260
 attempt to build the dam's power we 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:06:01.160
 they decided to use these 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:06:08.070
 moment and make yourself a way there even 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:12.979
 compare interesting comes here 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:18.030
 on the contrary, there is a better village council 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:20.449
 today's metal dam break as we 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.449
 see 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.240
 perfect 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.259
 we will try and drive through 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:36.159
 but this again the consequences also blur a 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:41.829
 dam construction too 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:44.969
 from the other side to another angle with that 

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:48.969
 hand I tried to drive up failed 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:54.039
 had to run around it somewhere 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:56.649
 a kilometer and a half that side is 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:07:01.599
 two flooded wells where people of water 

00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:04.689
 they are recruited there for a tubercle too 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:05.159
 there are wells where people come from 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:07.559
 water 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:12.989
 Well coming from this place 

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:15.819
 see a lot of houses here 

00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:20.459
 full of start the biggest street in 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:24.719
 thermo village on the nearest well here 

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:24.719
 somewhere around a kilometer away 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:33.120
 here actually is not as if to 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:36.639
 evacuation of people out of the question here is not present 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:39.660
 which should save us save us 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:42.120
 railroad workers and thats just because 

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:45.669
 just on that side 

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:50.290
 railway bridge and next goes 

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:54.780
 tunnel under mur if the dam breaks through 

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.780
 solid water level will come here 

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:04.690
 the fence that we see will be under 

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:06.990
 approximately one and two meters of water 

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.990
 here is the situation
