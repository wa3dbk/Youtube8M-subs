00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hey guys it's crafting tutorials 24 and

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.940 
hey guys it's crafting tutorials 24 and
today<00:00:03.389> I'm<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.929> show<00:00:04.110> you<00:00:04.140> how<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.620> make

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
today I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.360 
today I'm going to show you how to make
these<00:00:05.310> 3d<00:00:05.970> pure<00:00:06.450> bead<00:00:06.779> vise<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.620> these<00:00:08.189> are

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
these 3d pure bead vise and these are

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.030 
these 3d pure bead vise and these are
fun<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.910> make<00:00:09.150> but<00:00:09.719> just<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.440> little<00:00:10.650> warning

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
fun to make but just a little warning

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.370 
fun to make but just a little warning
these<00:00:11.340> can<00:00:11.700> get<00:00:11.910> frustrating<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:13.139> make

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
these can get frustrating to make

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.410 
these can get frustrating to make
because<00:00:13.620> if<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.099> over<00:00:14.429> iron<00:00:14.670> them<00:00:14.940> they<00:00:15.179> won't

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
because if you over iron them they won't

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.099 
because if you over iron them they won't
connect<00:00:15.929> like<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:17.029> right<00:00:18.029> here<00:00:18.510> but<00:00:18.810> if<00:00:18.930> you

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
connect like this right here but if you

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.160 
connect like this right here but if you
under<00:00:19.619> iron<00:00:19.830> them<00:00:20.100> then<00:00:20.550> your<00:00:21.270> dice<00:00:21.689> will<00:00:22.020> be

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
under iron them then your dice will be

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.400 
under iron them then your dice will be
loose<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.430> let's<00:00:23.850> get<00:00:24.060> started<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> tutorial

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
loose so let's get started on a tutorial

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.410 
loose so let's get started on a tutorial
so<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.160> supplies<00:00:26.490> we'll<00:00:26.760> be<00:00:26.880> needing<00:00:27.240> to

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
so the supplies we'll be needing to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.689 
so the supplies we'll be needing to
create<00:00:27.779> your<00:00:27.990> 3d<00:00:28.289> pair<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.010> dice<00:00:29.369> our

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
create your 3d pair to be dice our

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.440 
create your 3d pair to be dice our
pillar<00:00:30.240> beads<00:00:30.949> 1<00:00:31.949> large<00:00:32.250> square<00:00:32.820> peg<00:00:33.149> board

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
pillar beads 1 large square peg board

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.860 
pillar beads 1 large square peg board
and<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.559> use<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.250> small<00:00:36.030> square<00:00:36.329> peg<00:00:36.630> board

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and you can use a small square peg board

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.750 
and you can use a small square peg board
if<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.140> don't<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.890> large<00:00:38.129> square<00:00:38.430> peg

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
if you don't have a large square peg

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.869 
if you don't have a large square peg
board<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.809> will<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:40.050> very<00:00:40.290> time<00:00:40.739> consuming

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
board but it will be very time consuming

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.569 
board but it will be very time consuming
doing<00:00:41.879> each<00:00:42.180> side<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.050> dice<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:44.070> by<00:00:44.280> one

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
doing each side of the dice one by one

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.910 
doing each side of the dice one by one
and<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.180> really<00:00:45.239> mean<00:00:45.510> them<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:46.200> by<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
and I really mean them one by one and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.340 
and I really mean them one by one and
you<00:00:47.430> will<00:00:47.579> also<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.969> meeting<00:00:48.329> ironing<00:00:49.079> paper

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you will also be meeting ironing paper

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.069 
you will also be meeting ironing paper
and<00:00:49.710> an<00:00:50.039> iron<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> pattern<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
and an iron so this is the pattern that

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.930 
and an iron so this is the pattern that
you'll<00:00:52.379> be<00:00:52.559> needing<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.100> create<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.640> 3d

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
you'll be needing to create your 3d

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.319 
you'll be needing to create your 3d
pyramid<00:00:54.809> dice<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.739> very<00:00:56.010> important<00:00:56.670> to

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
pyramid dice and it is very important to

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.840 
pyramid dice and it is very important to
make<00:00:58.079> sure<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.500> get<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.829> pattern<00:00:59.070> correctly

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
make sure you get the pattern correctly

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.420 
make sure you get the pattern correctly
because<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.140> misplace<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.800> pattern<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
because if you do misplace a pattern it

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.549 
because if you do misplace a pattern it
will<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.879> very<00:01:03.120> frustrating<00:01:03.930> trying<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.320> fix

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
will be very frustrating trying to fix

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.510 
will be very frustrating trying to fix
that<00:01:04.830> side<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:06.000> either<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.750> choice<00:01:06.869> of

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
that side you either have the choice of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.520 
that side you either have the choice of
remaking<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.760> side<00:01:09.119> or<00:01:09.450> trying<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.080> fix<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
remaking that side or trying to fix the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.520 
remaking that side or trying to fix the
side<00:01:10.799> which<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.760> very<00:01:11.970> frustrating<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.350> do

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
side which is very frustrating so I do

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.859 
side which is very frustrating so I do
not<00:01:13.830> recommend<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.630> also

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
not recommend that and it is also

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.550 
not recommend that and it is also
important<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.920> at<00:01:17.189> least<00:01:17.240> put<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
important that you at least put the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.950 
important that you at least put the
sides<00:01:19.560> at<00:01:19.950> least<00:01:20.130> two<00:01:20.400> pegs<00:01:21.090> away<00:01:21.600> from<00:01:21.810> each

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
sides at least two pegs away from each

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.080 
sides at least two pegs away from each
other<00:01:22.170> because<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.159> want<00:01:23.549> them<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
other because you do not want them to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.840 
other because you do not want them to
iron<00:01:24.360> together<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:26.250> pause<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.729> video

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
iron together so you can pause the video

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.840 
iron together so you can pause the video
right<00:01:27.450> here

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.130 

once<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:37.030> have<00:01:37.180> finished<00:01:37.360> copy<00:01:37.780> in<00:01:38.049> the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
once you have finished copy in the

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.440 
once you have finished copy in the
pattern<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:38.710> is<00:01:39.070> time<00:01:39.400> for<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.820> second<00:01:40.270> most

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
pattern it is time for the second most

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.710 
pattern it is time for the second most
important<00:01:40.960> part<00:01:41.290> which<00:01:41.830> is<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.369> irony<00:01:42.880> you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
important part which is the irony you

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.870 
important part which is the irony you
want<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.140> make<00:01:44.320> sure<00:01:44.350> you<00:01:44.950> don't<00:01:45.100> over<00:01:45.640> iron

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
want to make sure you don't over iron

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.780 
want to make sure you don't over iron
because<00:01:46.509> then<00:01:46.899> the<00:01:47.380> pieces<00:01:47.890> will<00:01:48.310> not<00:01:48.490> fit

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
because then the pieces will not fit

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.580 
because then the pieces will not fit
together<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:49.630> want<00:01:49.869> to<00:01:49.990> make<00:01:50.140> sure<00:01:50.170> that

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
together and you want to make sure that

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.670 
together and you want to make sure that
you<00:01:50.740> don't<00:01:50.950> under<00:01:51.610> iron<00:01:51.789> because<00:01:52.360> then<00:01:53.080> the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
you don't under iron because then the

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.050 
you don't under iron because then the
pieces<00:01:54.220> will<00:01:54.640> just<00:01:55.509> be<00:01:55.869> loose<00:01:56.289> I<00:01:56.710> have<00:01:57.580> my<00:01:57.789> iron

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
pieces will just be loose I have my iron

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.170 
pieces will just be loose I have my iron
and<00:01:58.479> cotton<00:01:59.289> setting<00:01:59.590> which<00:01:59.920> is<00:01:59.950> pretty<00:02:00.789> high

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
and cotton setting which is pretty high

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.240 
and cotton setting which is pretty high
and<00:02:01.509> you<00:02:02.020> want<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.320> make<00:02:02.500> sure<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:03.070> also

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
and you want to make sure that you also

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.359 
and you want to make sure that you also
don't<00:02:03.729> have<00:02:03.909> steam<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:05.140> go<00:02:05.619> ahead<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.130> turn

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
don't have steam so go ahead and turn

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.279 
don't have steam so go ahead and turn
off<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.670> steam<00:02:07.119> so<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.630> way<00:02:07.840> your<00:02:08.050> Peter

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
off the steam so that way your Peter

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.280 
off the steam so that way your Peter
beads<00:02:08.590> will<00:02:08.830> not<00:02:08.979> over<00:02:09.369> mow<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:10.720> want<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:11.110> make

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
beads will not over mow you want to make

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.100 
beads will not over mow you want to make
sure<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:12.069> go<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.970> circular<00:02:13.239> motion<00:02:13.780> so

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
sure that you go in a circular motion so

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.240 
sure that you go in a circular motion so
that<00:02:14.380> all<00:02:14.739> sides<00:02:15.130> get<00:02:15.580> iron<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:17.590> you

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
that all sides get iron and that you

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.650 
that all sides get iron and that you
don't<00:02:19.060> over<00:02:19.630> iron<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:21.459> don't<00:02:21.760> under<00:02:22.420> eyes

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
don't over iron and you don't under eyes

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.440 
don't over iron and you don't under eyes
and<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.200> can<00:02:23.380> tell<00:02:23.650> when<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.790> ready<00:02:25.299> when

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
and you can tell when it is ready when

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.990 
and you can tell when it is ready when
the<00:02:25.720> beads<00:02:25.959> begin<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.739> stick<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.519> ironing

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
the beads begin to stick to the ironing

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.500 
the beads begin to stick to the ironing
paper<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:29.080> when<00:02:29.560> they<00:02:29.830> begin<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.549> got<00:02:31.030> like<00:02:31.299> a

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
paper and when they begin so got like a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.039 
paper and when they begin so got like a
square<00:02:32.080> shape<00:02:32.799> and<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.540> just<00:02:34.750> keep

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
square shape and so you just keep

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.840 
square shape and so you just keep
ironing<00:02:35.590> because<00:02:35.680> if<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.340> lift<00:02:36.610> them<00:02:36.819> and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
ironing because if you lift them and

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.630 
ironing because if you lift them and
some<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.690> beads<00:02:37.900> have<00:02:38.200> an<00:02:38.350> iron<00:02:38.650> then<00:02:39.370> iron

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
some of the beads have an iron then iron

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.289 
some of the beads have an iron then iron
together<00:02:40.090> yet<00:02:40.420> then<00:02:41.200> they'll<00:02:42.100> fall<00:02:42.489> out<00:02:42.820> which

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
together yet then they'll fall out which

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.800 
together yet then they'll fall out which
will<00:02:43.660> make<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.280> mess<00:02:45.280> too<00:02:45.820> which<00:02:46.390> will<00:02:46.600> make<00:02:46.780> it

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
will make a mess too which will make it

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.750 
will make a mess too which will make it
even<00:02:47.019> harder<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.620> put<00:02:47.859> back<00:02:48.100> on<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.489> pegboard

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
even harder to put back on the pegboard

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.220 
even harder to put back on the pegboard
to<00:02:49.209> try<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.540> fix<00:02:49.959> it

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
to try to fix it

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.729 
to try to fix it
then<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.470> like<00:02:53.829> to<00:02:54.100> get<00:02:54.250> another<00:02:54.670> ironing<00:02:55.359> paper

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
then I like to get another ironing paper

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.250 
then I like to get another ironing paper
put<00:02:56.739> it<00:02:56.769> on<00:02:56.980> top<00:02:57.340> once<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.359> flip<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.750> over<00:02:58.870> on

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
put it on top once you flip it over on

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.069 
put it on top once you flip it over on
top<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.829> keep<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.670> ironing<00:03:01.329> in<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.720> circular

motion be careful again not so over iron
on<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.630> iron<00:03:15.750> as<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.900> can<00:03:17.109> see<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.500> beads<00:03:17.709> are

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
on the iron as you can see the beads are

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.220 
on the iron as you can see the beads are
sticking<00:03:18.459> but<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:19.090> want<00:03:19.329> them<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:20.019> have<00:03:20.170> a

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
sticking but you want them to have a

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.580 
sticking but you want them to have a
little<00:03:20.470> bit<00:03:20.829> of<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.400> square<00:03:22.000> shape<00:03:22.350> starter<00:03:23.350> for

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
little bit of a square shape starter for

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.000 
little bit of a square shape starter for
this<00:03:24.190> one<00:03:24.750> which<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:25.930> having<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.380> small<00:03:26.680> shape

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
this one which is having a small shape

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.520 
this one which is having a small shape
and<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.700> can<00:03:27.760> see<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.299> these<00:03:28.720> are<00:03:29.019> sticking

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
and you can see that these are sticking

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:40.020 
and you can see that these are sticking
through<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.340> pieces

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.229 

sorry<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.180> can't<00:03:41.420> see<00:03:41.540> this<00:03:43.060> once<00:03:44.060> you

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
sorry you can't see this once you

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.479 
sorry you can't see this once you
finished<00:03:44.689> ironing<00:03:44.930> both<00:03:45.439> sides<00:03:45.799> it<00:03:46.069> is<00:03:46.219> time

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
finished ironing both sides it is time

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.699 
finished ironing both sides it is time
to<00:03:46.670> put<00:03:46.879> the<00:03:47.060> Peter<00:03:47.359> B<00:03:47.569> pieces<00:03:48.049> together<00:03:48.290> and

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
to put the Peter B pieces together and

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.949 
to put the Peter B pieces together and
this<00:03:49.189> is<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.370> good<00:03:49.760> example<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.480> how<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.750> should

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
this is a good example of how you should

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.369 
this is a good example of how you should
iron<00:03:51.500> your<00:03:51.799> carry<00:03:52.250> B<00:03:52.459> parts<00:03:52.909> not<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.599> iron<00:03:53.870> but

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
iron your carry B parts not to iron but

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.429 
iron your carry B parts not to iron but
not<00:03:54.590> under<00:03:55.010> iron<00:03:55.219> but<00:03:56.180> this<00:03:56.480> is<00:03:56.599> this<00:03:57.079> is<00:03:57.139> an

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 
not under iron but this is this is an

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.879 
not under iron but this is this is an
example<00:03:57.829> of<00:03:58.159> how<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.120> should<00:03:59.750> not<00:03:59.989> iron<00:04:00.290> your

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
example of how you should not iron your

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.830 
example of how you should not iron your
appear<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.370> be<00:04:01.459> parts<00:04:01.819> you<00:04:02.060> can<00:04:02.239> see<00:04:02.419> it's<00:04:02.569> flat

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
appear to be parts you can see it's flat

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.740 
appear to be parts you can see it's flat
and<00:04:03.200> it's<00:04:03.499> probably<00:04:03.859> gonna<00:04:04.069> be<00:04:04.249> hard<00:04:04.489> to<00:04:05.239> put

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
and it's probably gonna be hard to put

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.800 
and it's probably gonna be hard to put
together<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.439> other<00:04:06.650> pieces<00:04:07.129> so<00:04:07.969> be

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
together to the other pieces so be

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.559 
together to the other pieces so be
careful<00:04:09.349> of<00:04:09.379> that<00:04:09.609> since<00:04:10.609> I<00:04:10.730> over<00:04:11.030> ironed<00:04:11.419> the

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
careful of that since I over ironed the

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.270 
careful of that since I over ironed the
sides<00:04:11.810> of<00:04:12.079> the<00:04:12.439> blue<00:04:12.919> dice<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.900> was<00:04:15.409> hard<00:04:16.130> to

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
sides of the blue dice it was hard to

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.370 
sides of the blue dice it was hard to
connect<00:04:16.849> the<00:04:16.970> pieces<00:04:17.209> together<00:04:17.539> since<00:04:18.169> they

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
connect the pieces together since they

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.339 
connect the pieces together since they
were<00:04:18.410> iron<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.220> they<00:04:19.579> wouldn't<00:04:19.910> snap<00:04:20.180> in<00:04:20.479> so<00:04:21.320> I

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
were iron and they wouldn't snap in so I

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.770 
were iron and they wouldn't snap in so I
decided<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:21.889> take<00:04:22.310> apart<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:23.090> orange<00:04:23.599> and

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
decided to take apart the orange and

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.960 
decided to take apart the orange and
pink<00:04:24.080> dies<00:04:24.470> to<00:04:24.919> show<00:04:25.099> you<00:04:25.160> guys<00:04:25.460> how<00:04:25.520> to

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
pink dies to show you guys how to

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.140 
pink dies to show you guys how to
connect<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.199> parts<00:04:27.530> together<00:04:28.150> connecting

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
connect the parts together connecting

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.520 
connect the parts together connecting
the<00:04:29.270> parts<00:04:29.539> is<00:04:29.720> sort<00:04:29.960> of<00:04:30.050> like<00:04:30.199> a<00:04:30.229> puzzle

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
the parts is sort of like a puzzle

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.339 
the parts is sort of like a puzzle
because<00:04:31.190> there<00:04:32.060> is<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.210> certain<00:04:32.449> way<00:04:32.840> in<00:04:33.169> which

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
because there is a certain way in which

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.830 
because there is a certain way in which
to<00:04:33.800> connect<00:04:34.220> them<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.210> you<00:04:35.270> want<00:04:35.509> to<00:04:35.570> get

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
to connect them and so you want to get

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.600 
to connect them and so you want to get
your<00:04:36.139> one<00:04:36.349> and<00:04:36.620> make<00:04:36.740> sure<00:04:36.949> that<00:04:37.070> this<00:04:37.280> side<00:04:37.580> is

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
your one and make sure that this side is

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.749 
your one and make sure that this side is
to<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.300> right<00:04:38.509> and<00:04:38.780> you<00:04:39.530> get<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.740> two<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.280> put

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 
to the right and you get a two and put

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.659 
to the right and you get a two and put
it<00:04:40.940> on<00:04:41.120> top<00:04:41.419> and<00:04:41.630> since<00:04:42.020> I<00:04:42.229> did<00:04:42.500> it

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
it on top and since I did it

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.080 
it on top and since I did it
iron<00:04:44.300> well<00:04:44.599> I<00:04:44.900> under<00:04:45.530> iron<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:46.190> just<00:04:46.520> slides<00:04:46.789> in

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
iron well I under iron it just slides in

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.020 
iron well I under iron it just slides in
easily<00:04:47.360> which<00:04:48.110> can<00:04:48.770> easily<00:04:49.280> fall<00:04:49.520> out<00:04:49.729> but

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
easily which can easily fall out but

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.149 
easily which can easily fall out but
once<00:04:50.210> you<00:04:50.360> put<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.720> other<00:04:50.840> parts<00:04:51.229> and<00:04:51.500> lights

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.159 
once you put the other parts and lights

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.330 
once you put the other parts and lights
light<00:04:52.550> up<00:04:52.580> then<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:53.509> want<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.810> get<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.289> four<00:04:54.650> and

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
light up then you want to get a four and

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.879 
light up then you want to get a four and
then<00:04:56.000> make<00:04:56.659> sure<00:04:56.690> this<00:04:57.050> part<00:04:57.380> is<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.680> right

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
then make sure this part is to the right

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.420 
then make sure this part is to the right
tune<00:04:58.599> and<00:04:59.599> then<00:05:00.639> connect<00:05:01.639> them<00:05:01.940> together<00:05:02.210> and

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
tune and then connect them together and

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.490 
tune and then connect them together and
sorry<00:05:04.430> they<00:05:05.060> should<00:05:05.419> snap<00:05:05.960> in<00:05:06.699> like<00:05:07.699> that<00:05:08.500> then

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
sorry they should snap in like that then

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.870 
sorry they should snap in like that then
you<00:05:09.740> want<00:05:09.979> to<00:05:10.070> get<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:11.060> number<00:05:11.419> six<00:05:11.720> and<00:05:12.880> then

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
you want to get the number six and then

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.850 
you want to get the number six and then
make<00:05:14.120> sure<00:05:14.300> that<00:05:14.449> this<00:05:14.690> part<00:05:15.080> is<00:05:15.229> to<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:15.650> right

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
make sure that this part is to the right

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.370 
make sure that this part is to the right
so<00:05:16.820> you<00:05:16.880> go<00:05:17.120> here<00:05:17.630> and<00:05:17.810> just<00:05:18.370> snap<00:05:19.370> it<00:05:19.610> in<00:05:20.380> they

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
so you go here and just snap it in they

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.689 
so you go here and just snap it in they
should<00:05:21.440> easily<00:05:22.039> snap<00:05:22.490> in<00:05:22.729> like<00:05:22.969> I<00:05:23.150> say<00:05:23.650> and

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
should easily snap in like I say and

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.839 
should easily snap in like I say and
then<00:05:25.699> you<00:05:26.030> get<00:05:26.659> your<00:05:26.960> number<00:05:27.259> five<00:05:27.639> you<00:05:28.639> see

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
then you get your number five you see

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:35.379 
then you get your number five you see
you<00:05:29.030> have<00:05:29.210> a<00:05:29.539> 1<00:05:30.169> a<00:05:30.440> 2<00:05:31.039> a<00:05:31.370> 4<00:05:31.960> a<00:05:33.580> 6<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:34.969> then<00:05:35.120> you<00:05:35.150> go

you have a 1 a 2 a 4 a 6 and then you go

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.649 
you have a 1 a 2 a 4 a 6 and then you go
to<00:05:35.449> the<00:05:35.659> bottom<00:05:35.840> you<00:05:36.440> should<00:05:36.469> have<00:05:37.630> you<00:05:38.630> should

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
to the bottom you should have you should

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:42.219 
to the bottom you should have you should
put<00:05:39.020> in<00:05:39.169> the<00:05:39.469> number<00:05:39.919> 5<00:05:40.219> and<00:05:40.729> then<00:05:41.690> since<00:05:42.020> all

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
put in the number 5 and then since all

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.080 
put in the number 5 and then since all
sides<00:05:42.620> are<00:05:42.889> the<00:05:42.979> same<00:05:43.010> you<00:05:43.639> could<00:05:43.789> put<00:05:43.969> them

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
sides are the same you could put them

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.740 
sides are the same you could put them
either<00:05:44.360> way<00:05:44.630> you<00:05:44.690> want

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750

and last but not least there's only one

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.440 
and last but not least there's only one
more<00:05:50.480> way<00:05:50.690> to<00:05:50.720> put<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.410> last<00:05:51.590> piece<00:05:51.800> and<00:05:52.450> this

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
more way to put the last piece and this

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
part should be to the right and then you

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:03.160 
part should be to the right and then you
snap<00:05:57.350> it<00:05:57.380> into<00:06:01.210> so<00:06:02.210> that<00:06:02.420> is<00:06:02.600> how<00:06:02.780> you<00:06:02.840> make<00:06:03.140> a
