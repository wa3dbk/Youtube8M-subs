this morning so this is the probably the
most<00:01:26.780> intense<00:01:27.410> part<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:29.170> of<00:01:30.170> where<00:01:30.500> my<00:01:30.680> ceases

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
most intense part of of where my ceases

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.260 
most intense part of of where my ceases
which<00:01:32.829> I<00:01:33.040> don't<00:01:33.100> like<00:01:33.549> because<00:01:33.820> I<00:01:34.030> love<00:01:34.240> my

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
to do that today so I think I ran into

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.900 
to do that today so I think I ran into
the<00:01:55.720> house<00:01:55.930> about<00:01:56.290> three<00:01:56.350> times<00:01:57.070> back<00:01:57.850> in

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
the house about three times back in

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.050 
the house about three times back in
before<00:01:58.540> I<00:01:58.810> left<00:01:59.460> making<00:02:00.460> sure<00:02:00.700> I<00:02:00.730> had

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
before I left making sure I had

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.360 
before I left making sure I had
everything<00:02:01.090> or<00:02:01.960> forgot<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:02.830> pack<00:02:03.040> something

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
everything or forgot to pack something

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.280 
everything or forgot to pack something
so<00:02:03.880> that's<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.600> good<00:02:04.780> idea<00:02:04.930> as<00:02:05.380> well<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.930> you
