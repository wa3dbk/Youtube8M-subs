00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello then today I'm going to you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.310
 present my project then what is it 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.180
 what is this new heading 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.319
 it's simple 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.460
 now i am in a known license 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.830
 visual the grave of the blow I will you 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:20.100
 present my architectural projects 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:22.170
 friends so suddenly very often I'm going 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.519
 having to do projects and I got 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.930
 said it could be that wanted 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.250
 show then here and then like that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.990
 you can criticize me tell me this is 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.630
 shit everything then even after I you 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.050
 would say the note that I saw and xterra 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.120
 little globe 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.770
 so my first project was a novel 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.660
 photo is like the stop motion was 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.040
 you put endabout emails but 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.149
 unlike the stop motion 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.950
 it does not have to give the impression 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.910
 whether it's a video actually it takes 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.110
 that it's still pretty demarcated 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.640
 so we'll see that it's 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.140
 photos that have been taken and which are 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.460
 kill different actions for that 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.410
 be fluid in fact and what I hear 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.780
 the courses of his why because in 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.039
 does the novel-photo everything is played on the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.239
 new floors it's because that's it 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.860
 which will give a dynamic 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.899
 since it's just that there are no pictures 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.940
 movement there are no legs 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.670
 action and it's really the sound effects 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.110
 who will play this role actually our 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.119
 story it had to unfold as 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.350
 we have a character waiting for him 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.939
 character he is then he surrenders 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.340
 count here gets fucked up in support 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.570
 to die who stops them who stops him the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.770
 character b and gives an object to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.720
 characters then he fights and now in 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.100
 you were that once the subject 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.590
 it was good we could take 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.979
 Photos uphill and xterra and salads 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.979

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.670

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.619
 1:20 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.570

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.979

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.320
