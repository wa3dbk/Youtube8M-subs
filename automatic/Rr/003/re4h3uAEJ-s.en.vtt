00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello to all of you it may be that 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.220
 this trailer so today I am 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.870
 very very very very very happy so 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.179
 some will wonder why 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.849
 well I had talked about the house 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.230
 video some time ago I had by 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.020
 he who did not want his partners 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.789
 so I went to see him in real a 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.160
 true true network and not the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.740
 detours kawar sus where do we have to 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.340
 pay 10 euros 5 years night listed by 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.269
 we saw so I made my request and he 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.690
 a few weeks ago with a real 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.980
 network and i got my answer iard and i 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.690
 am partner so as you want 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.300
 see a young bather but that's not it 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.680
 definitive because it's the only one I have 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.100
 put so I'll surely be the front 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.260
 of a graphic designer so here today I 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.680
 introduces you to a small tutorial on 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.570
 sponsors these bats what is it that 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.440
 she gets on my nerves 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:59.129
 so we'll already see an example the ten 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.199
 sponsors we know them all the way 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.489
 that and especially not that an item years is 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.460
 well with the artist we do not know 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:13.760
 lie and two years up to bits so 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:15.540
 we will see them here a helping one a two 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:22.369
 one two three 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.369
 these are the three cards 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:35.370
 being only 5 so if you think 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:38.940
 not to shit without throwing we will start again 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.070
 one for you prove it fifty six 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.759
 to weight and videos are fake 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:52.619
 so here's one here we're going to be 3 here 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:54.710
 so that's 2-1 2-3 I'm at 6 he's getting 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.180
 will be 10 are ten 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:17.340
 so if we are to 5 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:19.560
 here is 5 and 6 here is this lan too much I 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.500
 believe I played with the system a little 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.500
 little yet 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:42.120
 forgiveness of the mistake I do not understand 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:47.050
 here are 7 and 8 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.880
 this goal so what it is all so 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.530
 the world knows that to cook a 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.440
 style of any subject he 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.080
 must quickly coal so next to the ten 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.450
 sponsors you can put ovens and 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.010
 then it can 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.650
 you can cook your material 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.320
 but know that we do not have to 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.210
 m coal we can put diamonds 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.850
 food equipment that's at 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.320
 your choice 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.010
 so they have a small simplified model 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.070
 that's how it is so I take the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.450
 necessary materials and we will see to the 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.980
 construction 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:28.360
 so I'll take you the model already 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.360
 So here is a bah it's okay 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:42.400
 so here it is one of the kinds 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.959
 here we are going to make a small place 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.640
 to be able to see it so try the 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.810
 rout 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:56.320
 then to move to where you put 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:59.470
 a torch a house not happened 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.470
 excuse me 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.470
 so here are two to go to 3 you 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:15.540
 add a redstone beam 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:18.660
 we're going to see here is the proof here we are 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:25.650
 to 3 to move to 4 you put yourself 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:28.890
 buy a golden skin are behind ah 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.420
 no pardon so to go to 4 you 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.200
 add a few reasons behind 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.470
 as well as a torch underneath so we 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.470
 will see 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:46.410
 and here I am at 4 to go to 5 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:51.980
 you put a repeater on the first 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:54.090
 chrono seems to me non sas at 6 so 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.190
 forgive me the tutorial 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.190
 I did it some time ago 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.260
 but I was afraid of videos so he 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.720
 would have started yet s announcement 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:09.030
 now his 7th 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:16.290
 we will see on the 2nd fear now 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:17.270
 attacking here if I have how much we are at 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:25.070
 5 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:27.990
 oh here it is that so we have 7 5 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.570
 and here we are at 5 in for the 5th 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.750
 you keep the same key pattern in 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:38.160
 below from above here you put 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:40.620
 the repeaters on on the third big 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.930
 so for the six we already saw a 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:49.140
 is that a repeaters will be no 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:50.700
 fear for the 7th you put 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.030
 you redeem that a simple torso in 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.030
 below 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.450
 oh no sorry you put on 12 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.690
 oh there, there 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.420
 that's it for the ccm you have to be 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.810
 only by putting a torch in 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.330
 below 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:28.780
 the repeater on the third train and 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:29.830
 like this oh no sorry it was 6th 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:36.430
 forget what I do not want to forget 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.910
 forget so here are the eighths on it 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.070
 already sees 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.300
 so the eighths is simply 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:48.190
 the repeater at the last notch and ben here 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:50.230
 so donations down there we see the 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.090
 seventh a torch below and the 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.850
 repeater on any notch with of course the 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.680
 same early model so that was all for 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.090
 his sides blinds yesterday do not hesitate 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.040

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.670
 videos are shared and so puts if 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.370

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:15.490
 formally invite me to see my job 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:19.360

 gravel too and afterwards but 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:27.010

 like this one for example story she 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:32.740
