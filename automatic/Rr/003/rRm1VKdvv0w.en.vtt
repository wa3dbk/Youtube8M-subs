00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.050
 let's start with the parameters of the 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.910
 v raid render setup window 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:13.570
 we'll start with the v raid frame buffer 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.459
 in render setup we will open and go to the 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.420
 tab where it puts frame will be inside 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.270
 of web 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.760
 we are going to do is activate it 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.560
 when activated a window that shows us 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.960
 both the render that is being made 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.380
 as the last render that has been done 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.180
 this window in this case replaces the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.160
 render window of three studies max 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.500
 when we activate the frame 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.989
 buffer dv rain automatically the frame 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.629
 buffer of 3 studio max is deactivated 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.090
 this same window that has also has 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.370
 three studio max is deactivated and in 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.340
 we will use our own 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.739
 overdrive I'm going to close it to explain 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.480
 all the options that we have in this 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.550
 part the first thing we have to have 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.829
 into account is the resolution to which 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.770
 let's render the size of the 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.710
 image that we are going to render as 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.050
 we adjust what I usually do and I 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.430
 I recommend because it 's the simplest thing is 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.229
 go to common and here or else use one of 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.030
 the sizes that come predetermined 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.940
 within the study more or put it in 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.180
 custom and here we tell you the size 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.030
 Exactly in pixels that we want to reuse 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.820
 our image 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.920
 once we have the size at which 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 we want to render in this case it's a 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.159
 very small size to make a 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.369
 preview the logical thing is that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.320
 let's use sizes between 2,000 and 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.270
 5,000 pixels is for printing once 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.590
 We have the size and relationship of 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.270
 appearance the pixel etcetera already configured 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.490
 we have the size we want we are going to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.290
 a raid and here we tell you to take that 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.770
 same resolution that I marked him in 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.810
 common that welcomes us for the frame buffer 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.280
 of brain if one wanted this if I 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.860
 I would like to configure it directly here 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.050
 he deactivated it and this is where I say that 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.270
 size and see how exactly 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.190
 same that we have in common only that here 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.130
 we do not have the presets I habitually 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.679
 I use the presets and the configuration 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.380
 of three studio max therefore this what 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.420
 I leave it activated in this way 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.270
 one option that we have below is the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.060
 render a raul image what makes me 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.190
 is that instead of keeping inside the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.410
 branch that uses the run to store 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.810
 the image that is rendering what 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.580
 it makes me without the keeps on the disk 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.950
 hard therefore allows us in 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.830
 very large images can save a 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.980
 amount of considerable ram memory in 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.140
 images beginning at 45 thousand 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.300
 pixels this can already become a 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.100
 Considerable ram consumption imagine 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.290
 that we want to render an image of 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.720
 10,000 pixels wide that will be a 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.640
 perfect occasion to activate this 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.700
 option now we go to the screen of the 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.890
 base frame let's open the numeral 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.630
 frame will do and here we see an image 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.910
 pre- rendering 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.830
 here we see the layers that make up this 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.530
 image in render elements we could 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.790
 have added a few more there 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.310
 available I think decades 30 35 35 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.130
 layers or elements to sell in this case 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.650
 it's a basic render with only up 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.300
 the color and the alpha channel that in 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.740
 principle is not applied 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.640
 an object there is no fund we have 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.040
 here several switches to visualize 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.470
 the colors of which it is composed in 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.790
 this case the image we have here the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.700
 channels in rgb 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.069
 and we have to visualize the alpha channel 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.980
 we have to visualize blank and 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.260
 black monochrome mode this option we 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.750
 allows to see save the image on disk 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.410
 hard 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.870
 jpg tiff this option allows me to load 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.810
 an image in the frame asf we have this 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.430
 button that cleans the base frame this 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.770
 image would disappear we have the option 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.420
 of duplicating this image in the frame goes to 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.420
 make 3 studio max 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.569
 if I spike I would open the same image in 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.569
 frame affair of the study max 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.280
 this option will wright render now 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.379
 where I was passing the mouse if 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.780
 I pass the mouse in this area I started 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:18.169
 to sell hoist here would go down 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.989
 let's say I would be doing the render 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.360
 wherever the mouse is passing this 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.539
 option is to perform a render region 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.539
 of a specific area that I marked 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.580
 to our right and I just render myself already 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.250
 this area here we have an option that I 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.169
 links the render that I have made with 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.500
 a cause group tool that is the 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.830
 pd player similar or similar to an after 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.590
 effects or combustion we have three types 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.990
 of image comparators when I 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.910
 I can upload two images and compare them 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.590
 in this case I only have one charged by 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.840
 so I can not compare it with any 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.849
 another one and this is the way in which I 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.729
 I would be comparing the next option 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.860
 What it does to me is to make the 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.020
 render and then when rendering 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.940
 I would erase the image that I have in this 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.590
 case in which I'm visualizing in 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.120
 these moments and replace it with the 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.120
 render when completed
