00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.670
 the kit comes 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.310
 he is 30 years old Cessna 182 that here is the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.130
 I do not have to be able to take pictures with 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.250
 the manual and I'm sending along the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.520
 personnel who purchase the kit have all the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.630
 step-by-step mounting with more than 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.000
 200 photos there also complete 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.790
 and here I 'll give you some tips later 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.739
 show the goal 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.100
 so for example here I used to think 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.500
 to fix because in the event of knocking 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.300
 some fall knock wing tip you do not 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.130
 breaks the plane and has this 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.930
 this mobility is that the landing gear 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.910
 teaching wheels do everything in the manual in the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.640
 if here I used what I had already 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.760
 fiberglass that myself so I did 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.090
 I do not use pvc but in the manual goes the mold 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.130
 for you will recognize training wheels 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.399
 see the dacon carlotinha here I was used 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.439
 plastic ice cream pot here to 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.870
 to use what to do a wheel retainer 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.420
 those connectors raining is also 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.370
 everything in the manual 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.550
 the assembly is very quiet 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.299
 following the steps of companion 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.630
 Plane will go quiet 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.190
 in case here this plane to flight 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.710
 slow then it has an angle of 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.680
 a very positive attack on the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.619
 engine shaft 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.860
 so the flight you're going to have to find 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.049
 a point on the accelerator there that he 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.240
 stay stable if you accelerate all 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.090
 everyone is full power the plane goes 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.920
 understand the normal climb and take the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.850
 engine will go down so you have to find a 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.820
 middle ground where the plane was leveled and 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.119
 if he is very upward 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.610
 of wanting to rise from a light one 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.400
 tilted downwards that does not 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.739
 I know if you can understand but in relation to 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.019
 as the engine is about 3 degrees higher 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.049
 or less pointing down 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.780
 there doing these tests there during the flight 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:25.680
 you will find an ideal point is promoter 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.870
 do not stay stable during the goal 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.140
 now I'm going to fly to demonstrate 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.319
 with what works as I'm going to him 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.980
 it's a good goal in slow flight is a 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:42.450
 plane used to train including the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:47.610
 classes here on the track with the service and not 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.489
 has mystery is super easy to save 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.560
 for who has begun 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:58.290
 I recommend not getting on the track. 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.200
 will call the plane turn on the shekau radio 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.320
 adding aileron to right side 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.959
 right to lift left side 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.510
 left has to advance prosecutor 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:15.560
 putting a stick of who's work 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:22.830
 lift up he has to lower the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:25.980
 Director rights they have to 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.570
 put up against the wind and aid of 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.790
 someone more experienced to do the 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.090
 first flight because the airplane may be 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.230
 extreme will be there with a tendency to 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.450
 play either to the right or to the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.730
 left or down 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.620
 Anyone who ever goes can have a little 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.890
 difficulty suddenly breaking the 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.799
 plane then indicated necklace toward 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.700
 from the bush in case some plane crash 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.000
 fall into the sea 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.890
 simone was loved as we already have 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.959
 a certain experience I will take off in the 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.959
 lane always mess 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.690
 we're re-forming 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.750
 I do not know everything ok I'm over there I 'm going to accelerate 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.780
 a little more than half made it accurate 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.420
 accelerate everything will run on the track 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.810
 practically alone. 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.810
 anything 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:40.620
 imagine the motorola is already leaving reduce 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:46.230
 the engine ready power so much here 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:48.980
 which is already filmed as the control is 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:53.310
 this here looks at the same engine throttle 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:56.880
 the airplane engine brake throttle're 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:03.540
 level flying with no tendency to climb 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:11.490
 or down to slightly reduce the power 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:14.060
 I will make a low farce in the track 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.060
 engine again 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:26.000
 a little bit of inclusions more or less 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:40.670
 as the lipstick returns normal swinging with 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:54.230
 one more last a little more 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:57.060
 Hurry, I'll try as a miracle. 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:00.420
 I can not even make a curve of lenine 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.370
 use Haleron because of the money 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.250
 given the squid 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:09.360
 so in case I wanted is using three 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:16.110
 channels without playing and 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:18.710
 eron do one more and then last longer 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.710
 I heard a lot 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.600
 the quiet airplane 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:42.610
 who also want to give for a one 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:46.270
 Here is a nice look some 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:51.060
 maneuvers here are not so radical in their 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.060
 region was not made for this either. 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:10.330
 now I will come the landing 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:16.800
 I will not do the leg of young playmaker 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.800
 parallel flashes sending the same motor 

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:29.379
 pass some of the head of commerce 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:32.620
 turn the lane there 

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:38.499
 I will reduce the power to leave the plane. 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:47.319
 enter the ramp on the engine and 

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:49.860
 deep gurupi made with a taxi to 

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:49.860
 return 

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.670
 they say that only I was missing picchu
