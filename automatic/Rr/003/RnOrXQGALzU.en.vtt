00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
like a tradition for me I guess to build

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.959 
like a tradition for me I guess to build
up<00:00:48.629> brazilian<00:00:48.840> squad<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.469> every<00:00:49.680> FIFA<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.700> for

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
up brazilian squad on every FIFA not for

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.619

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.439 
back to my Bundesliga team which I don't
I<00:05:29.349> mean<00:05:29.380> I'm<00:05:29.710> not<00:05:30.010> against<00:05:30.849> using<00:05:31.240> my

depending<00:05:32.949> on<00:05:33.250> squads<00:05:33.729> I<00:05:34.000> don't<00:05:34.240> think<00:05:34.300> any

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
depending on squads I don't think any

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.990 
depending on squads I don't think any
players<00:05:35.050> should<00:05:35.229> depend<00:05:35.500> on<00:05:35.710> squad<00:05:36.010> I<00:05:36.280> think

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
players should depend on squad I think

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.730 
players should depend on squad I think
that<00:05:37.270> if<00:05:37.449> you're<00:05:37.630> good<00:05:37.870> with<00:05:38.050> one<00:05:38.260> squad<00:05:38.560> you

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
that if you're good with one squad you

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.379 
that if you're good with one squad you
should<00:05:38.919> be<00:05:39.099> just<00:05:39.610> as<00:05:39.789> good<00:05:39.940> with<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.240> other

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
should be just as good with the other

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.790 
should be just as good with the other
and<00:05:40.690> look<00:05:40.810> at<00:05:40.900> that<00:05:40.930> goal<00:05:41.260> by<00:05:41.470> Mickey<00:05:41.770> 30<00:05:41.949> on

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
and look at that goal by Mickey 30 on

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.409 
and look at that goal by Mickey 30 on
I<00:05:42.919> think<00:05:43.340> that<00:05:43.400> was<00:05:43.490> probably<00:05:43.789> the<00:05:44.000> best<00:05:44.240> goal

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
I think that was probably the best goal

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.490 
I think that was probably the best goal
of<00:05:44.810> the<00:05:44.930> episode<00:05:45.349> um<00:05:45.729> so<00:05:46.729> yeah<00:05:46.909> guys<00:05:47.120> um<00:05:47.539> nice
