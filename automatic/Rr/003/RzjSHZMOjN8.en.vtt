can see i removed the exhaust here we're

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.299 
can see i removed the exhaust here we're
actually<00:00:49.260> looking<00:00:49.469> at<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> driver's<00:00:50.070> side

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
actually looking at the driver's side

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.340 
actually looking at the driver's side
you<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.090> how<00:00:51.149> much<00:00:51.300> room<00:00:51.449> we've<00:00:51.629> got<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
you see how much room we've got now the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.400 
you see how much room we've got now the
next<00:00:52.469> step<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.890> want<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.100> go<00:00:53.160> ahead<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.579> gently

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
next step we want to go ahead and gently

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.450 
next step we want to go ahead and gently
bend<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> heat<00:00:55.710> shield<00:00:55.739> out<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> way

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
bend the heat shield out of the way

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.520 
bend the heat shield out of the way
towards<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> frame<00:00:57.510> rail<00:00:57.719> making<00:00:58.260> sure<00:00:58.379> not

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
towards the frame rail making sure not

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.590 
towards the frame rail making sure not
to<00:00:58.590> break<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.370> hitch<00:00:59.609> arms<00:01:00.210> are<00:01:00.329> actually

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
to break it the hitch arms are actually

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.959 
to break it the hitch arms are actually
going<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.780> go<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.199> between<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:02.039> spare<00:01:02.940> tire

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
going to go up in between the spare tire

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.140 
going to go up in between the spare tire
well<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.899> frame<00:01:04.220> up<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.549> crease<00:01:05.970> up

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
well and the frame up in this crease up

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.120 
well and the frame up in this crease up
in<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.619> want<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> bend<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.010> back

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
in here so we want to bend it back

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.800 
in here so we want to bend it back
enough<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> ensure<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.420> hitch<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.720> go

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
enough to ensure that the hitch can go

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.780 
enough to ensure that the hitch can go
up<00:01:09.900> there<00:01:10.049> fairly<00:01:10.439> easily<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.130> then<00:01:11.610> next

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
up there fairly easily and then next

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.340 
up there fairly easily and then next
we're<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> go<00:01:12.240> ahead<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.510> put<00:01:13.260> the

we're going to go ahead and put the
hitch<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.799> position<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.400> we're<00:01:14.670> going

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
hitch up into position and we're going

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.609 
hitch up into position and we're going
to<00:01:14.850> mark<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> holes<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.500> where

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
to mark the holes so that we know where

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.310 
to mark the holes so that we know where
to<00:01:16.680> drill<00:01:16.920> them<00:01:17.780> ok<00:01:18.780> now<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.049> we've<00:01:19.170> got<00:01:19.290> our
