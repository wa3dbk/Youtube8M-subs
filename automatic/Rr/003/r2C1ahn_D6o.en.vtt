golden poppy and i'm just applying it on

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.539 
golden poppy and i'm just applying it on
to<00:01:32.970> my<00:01:33.090> lids<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.170> wet<00:01:34.710> eye<00:01:34.920> shadow<00:01:35.340> brush

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
to my lids with a wet eye shadow brush

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.090

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
so i really like using a wet brush is

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.429 
so i really like using a wet brush is
for<00:01:38.689> eyeshadows<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.720> are<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.200> this

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
for eyeshadows that are like this

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.109 
for eyeshadows that are like this
because<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.950> really<00:01:40.979> brings<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.610> their<00:01:41.939> high

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119

big volumizing mascara i really like it
i<00:03:07.060> don't<00:03:07.570> know<00:03:07.660> if<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.810> can<00:03:07.930> tell<00:03:08.140> but<00:03:08.200> the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
i don't know if you can tell but the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.470 
i don't know if you can tell but the
brush<00:03:08.680> on<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.160> actually<00:03:09.400> hourglass<00:03:10.209> shape

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
brush on it is actually hourglass shape

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.100 
brush on it is actually hourglass shape
so<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:11.080> really<00:03:12.070> allows<00:03:12.489> you<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.330> lengthen<00:03:13.780> and

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
so it really allows you to lengthen and

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.020 
so it really allows you to lengthen and
curl<00:03:14.440> all<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:15.070> your<00:03:15.190> lashes<00:03:15.400> because<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.940> know

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
curl all of your lashes because you know

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.400 
curl all of your lashes because you know
how<00:03:16.150> some<00:03:16.360> of<00:03:16.390> your<00:03:16.570> lashes<00:03:16.750> are<00:03:17.080> shorter<00:03:17.380> than

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
how some of your lashes are shorter than

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.440 
how some of your lashes are shorter than
others<00:03:17.800> so<00:03:18.310> since<00:03:18.489> it's<00:03:18.640> hourglass<00:03:19.060> shape<00:03:19.269> it

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
others so since it's hourglass shape it

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.289 
others so since it's hourglass shape it
has<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.230> shorter<00:03:20.680> bristles<00:03:21.100> so<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:21.670> can<00:03:21.970> get<00:03:22.090> to

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
has a shorter bristles so you can get to

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.660 
has a shorter bristles so you can get to
these<00:03:22.630> shorter<00:03:22.989> lashes<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.620> lot<00:03:23.920> easier<00:03:24.130> so

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
these shorter lashes a lot easier so

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.280 
these shorter lashes a lot easier so
that's<00:03:24.910> why<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.060> like<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.269> but<00:03:25.840> I'm<00:03:26.049> just
