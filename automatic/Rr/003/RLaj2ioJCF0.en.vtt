length<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.770> usually<00:02:07.910> trailers<00:02:08.910> are<00:02:09.060> just

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
length and usually trailers are just

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.550 
length and usually trailers are just
like<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> mini<00:02:09.660> or<00:02:09.840> something<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.229> but

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
like a mini or something like that but

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.010 
like a mini or something like that but
this<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.520> two<00:02:12.180> minutes<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.720> four

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
this one is two minutes and four

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.020 
this one is two minutes and four
six<00:02:13.260> seconds<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.010> that's<00:02:14.490> something<00:02:14.760> new

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
six seconds so that's something new

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.270 
six seconds so that's something new
considering<00:02:15.570> that<00:02:15.690> none<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.500> black<00:02:16.710> ops<00:02:16.950> 2

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
considering that none of the black ops 2

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.790 
considering that none of the black ops 2
trailers<00:02:17.730> are<00:02:17.940> actually<00:02:18.300> above<00:02:18.900> two<00:02:19.350> minutes

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
trailers are actually above two minutes

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.700 
trailers are actually above two minutes
or<00:02:20.160> 40<00:02:20.520> seconds<00:02:21.060> usually<00:02:21.900> not<00:02:22.140> all<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.530> black

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
or 40 seconds usually not all the black

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.860 
or 40 seconds usually not all the black
ops<00:02:22.920> 2<00:02:23.070> videos<00:02:23.460> are<00:02:23.640> above<00:02:24.420> two<00:02:24.600> minutes<00:02:24.810> and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
ops 2 videos are above two minutes and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.660 
ops 2 videos are above two minutes and
40<00:02:25.110> seconds<00:02:25.470> besides<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.070> behind-the-scenes

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
40 seconds besides the behind-the-scenes

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.780 
40 seconds besides the behind-the-scenes
one<00:02:26.910> but<00:02:27.380> probably<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:29.250> might<00:02:29.490> be<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> new

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
one but probably this might be a new

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.820 
one but probably this might be a new
trailer<00:02:30.240> probably<00:02:30.660> for<00:02:30.870> multiplayer<00:02:31.530> because

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
trailer probably for multiplayer because

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.650 
trailer probably for multiplayer because
everybody's<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.520> know<00:02:32.550> buzzing<00:02:33.300> over<00:02:33.510> that

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
everybody's you know buzzing over that

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.630 
everybody's you know buzzing over that
that's<00:02:33.960> like<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.290> biggest<00:02:34.440> hype<00:02:34.890> everybody's

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640

talking<00:02:35.790> about<00:02:36.210> it's<00:02:36.420> trending<00:02:36.960> so<00:02:37.710> basically

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
talking about it's trending so basically

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.890 
talking about it's trending so basically
I<00:02:38.490> think<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.060> gonna<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.270> multiplayer

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
I think it's gonna be multiplayer

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.050 
I think it's gonna be multiplayer
probably<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> game's<00:02:41.010> con<00:02:41.310> if<00:02:41.490> not<00:02:41.700> then

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
probably a game's con if not then

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.080 
probably a game's con if not then
probably<00:02:42.690> after<00:02:43.470> because<00:02:43.830> all<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.610> hype<00:02:44.850> is

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
probably after because all this hype is

probably after because all this hype is
just<00:02:45.300> gonna<00:02:45.420> be<00:02:45.510> put<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.780> nothing<00:02:46.170> if

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
just gonna be put to nothing if

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.800

motion<00:03:33.780> sensor<00:03:33.930> or<00:03:34.320> put<00:03:34.740> it<00:03:34.860> somewhere<00:03:35.070> and

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
motion sensor or put it somewhere and

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.180 
motion sensor or put it somewhere and
radar<00:03:36.120> pops<00:03:36.750> up<00:03:36.990> I<00:03:37.140> guess<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.320> red<00:03:37.530> dot<00:03:37.680> pops<00:03:37.950> up

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
radar pops up I guess a red dot pops up

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.130 
radar pops up I guess a red dot pops up
and<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.400> go<00:03:38.580> in<00:03:38.700> for<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:38.880> kill<00:03:39.180> Pro<00:03:39.959> rush

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
and you go in for the kill Pro rush

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.510 
and you go in for the kill Pro rush
you're<00:03:40.320> constantly<00:03:40.680> moving<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.190> i<00:03:41.220> guess<00:03:41.400> you

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
you're constantly moving so i guess you

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.030 
you're constantly moving so i guess you
turn<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.850> on<00:03:41.970> for<00:03:42.840> i<00:03:43.080> guess<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.440> minute<00:03:43.890> or<00:03:44.010> so

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
turn it on for i guess a minute or so

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.070 
turn it on for i guess a minute or so
two<00:03:44.490> minutes<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.090> then<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.330> goes<00:03:45.450> off<00:03:45.690> and

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
two minutes and then it goes off and

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.540 
two minutes and then it goes off and
then<00:03:46.470> i<00:03:46.770> guess<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.010> have<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.130> wait<00:03:47.280> for<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.490> to

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
then i guess you have to wait for it to

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.730 
then i guess you have to wait for it to
recharge<00:03:48.030> or<00:03:48.390> i<00:03:48.690> guess<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.140> can<00:03:49.290> only<00:03:49.380> use<00:03:49.560> it

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
recharge or i guess you can only use it

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.920 
recharge or i guess you can only use it
once<00:03:49.920> for<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.310> specific<00:03:50.850> time<00:03:51.420> or<00:03:51.450> something

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
once for a specific time or something

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.720 
once for a specific time or something
like<00:03:52.020> that<00:03:52.110> but<00:03:52.770> there's<00:03:53.340> not<00:03:53.520> much

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
like that but there's not much

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.150 
like that but there's not much
information<00:03:54.330> but<00:03:54.360> you<00:03:55.080> gotta<00:03:55.260> say<00:03:55.470> stay<00:03:55.770> tuned

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
information but you gotta say stay tuned

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.699 
information but you gotta say stay tuned
so<00:03:56.610> obviously<00:03:57.540> i<00:03:57.630> think<00:03:58.110> it's<00:03:58.320> probably<00:03:58.440> going

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
so obviously i think it's probably going

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.650 
so obviously i think it's probably going
to<00:03:58.770> be<00:03:58.830> in<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.340> trailer<00:03:59.730> if<00:03:59.880> not<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.510> would<00:04:00.600> be

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
to be in the trailer if not it would be

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.830 
to be in the trailer if not it would be
revealed<00:04:01.110> some<00:04:01.500> somehow<00:04:02.280> somewhere<00:04:02.459> but<00:04:03.360> yeah

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
revealed some somehow somewhere but yeah

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.840 
revealed some somehow somewhere but yeah
alright<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:04.860> one<00:04:05.010> last<00:04:05.220> thing<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:05.550> could<00:04:05.730> talk

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
alright so one last thing I could talk

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.240 
alright so one last thing I could talk
to<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.060> guys<00:04:06.120> about<00:04:06.390> it<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:07.740> is<00:04:07.920> like<00:04:08.070> the

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
to you guys about it this is like the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.830 
to you guys about it this is like the
last<00:04:08.400> thing<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:09.180> just<00:04:09.390> when<00:04:09.570> you<00:04:09.660> thought

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
last thing and just when you thought

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.410 
last thing and just when you thought
that<00:04:10.080> game's<00:04:10.410> con<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:11.340> know<00:04:11.459> game's<00:04:11.850> con<00:04:12.090> just

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
that game's con you know game's con just

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.530 
that game's con you know game's con just
is<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.810> last<00:04:13.020> expo<00:04:13.650> that<00:04:14.100> might<00:04:14.820> reveal<00:04:15.209> games

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
is the last expo that might reveal games

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.539 
is the last expo that might reveal games
and<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> lot<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:15.930> good<00:04:16.020> stuff<00:04:16.200> there's<00:04:17.160> this<00:04:17.310> new

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
and a lot of good stuff there's this new

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.460 
and a lot of good stuff there's this new
thing<00:04:17.580> that's<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.600> guess<00:04:18.780> called<00:04:19.169> gamestop

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
thing that's I guess called gamestop

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.730 
thing that's I guess called gamestop
expo<00:04:19.770> and<00:04:20.430> it's<00:04:20.580> obviously<00:04:21.359> gamestop<00:04:21.870> but<00:04:22.229> it

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
expo and it's obviously gamestop but it

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.159 
expo and it's obviously gamestop but it
reveals<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.520> lot<00:04:23.700> more<00:04:23.970> good<00:04:24.180> stuff<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:24.900> there's

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
reveals a lot more good stuff so there's

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.650 
reveals a lot more good stuff so there's
probably<00:04:25.560> a<00:04:25.620> lot<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.919> demo

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
probably a lot of demo

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.650 
probably a lot of demo
probably<00:04:27.500> trailers<00:04:27.890> so<00:04:28.280> if<00:04:28.520> games<00:04:29.060> con<00:04:29.420> you

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
probably trailers so if games con you

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.420 
probably trailers so if games con you
know<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:29.810> guess<00:04:30.080> if<00:04:30.260> black<00:04:30.470> ops<00:04:30.680> 2<00:04:30.920> multiplayer

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
know I guess if black ops 2 multiplayer

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.670 
know I guess if black ops 2 multiplayer
doesn't<00:04:32.120> make<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.330> two<00:04:32.450> games<00:04:32.720> Colin<00:04:33.110> no

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
doesn't make it two games Colin no

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.370 
doesn't make it two games Colin no
probably<00:04:34.040> beat<00:04:34.220> I<00:04:34.730> guess<00:04:35.030> gamestop<00:04:35.510> expo<00:04:35.540> but

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
probably beat I guess gamestop expo but

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.830 
probably beat I guess gamestop expo but
my<00:04:36.950> theory<00:04:37.250> is<00:04:37.310> that<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:38.240> multiplayer

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
my theory is that the multiplayer

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.220 
my theory is that the multiplayer
trailer<00:04:39.050> will<00:04:39.290> be<00:04:39.320> on<00:04:40.270> gamescom<00:04:41.270> 2012<00:04:41.630> and

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
trailer will be on gamescom 2012 and

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.400 
trailer will be on gamescom 2012 and
then<00:04:42.410> you'll<00:04:43.250> be<00:04:43.280> able<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.910> play<00:04:44.090> black<00:04:44.930> ops<00:04:45.110> 2

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
then you'll be able to play black ops 2

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.370 
then you'll be able to play black ops 2
multi<00:04:45.830> player<00:04:46.040> at<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.970> gamestop<00:04:47.240> expo<00:04:47.750> and

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
multi player at the gamestop expo and

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.340 
multi player at the gamestop expo and
obviously<00:04:49.070> this<00:04:49.190> Expo<00:04:49.940> is<00:04:50.210> I<00:04:50.390> guess<00:04:50.660> it's<00:04:51.020> free

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
obviously this Expo is I guess it's free

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.770 
obviously this Expo is I guess it's free
or<00:04:51.650> I<00:04:52.070> guess<00:04:52.430> it's<00:04:52.610> for<00:04:52.760> gamestop<00:04:52.970> Rewards

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
or I guess it's for gamestop Rewards

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.950 
or I guess it's for gamestop Rewards
members<00:04:54.200> but<00:04:54.410> this<00:04:54.860> Expo<00:04:55.220> starts<00:04:55.610> at<00:04:56.000> August

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
and you can play a lot of more demos

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.580 
and you can play a lot of more demos
besides<00:05:01.850> you<00:05:02.390> know<00:05:02.480> called<00:05:02.780> you<00:05:02.930> black<00:05:03.140> ops<00:05:03.350> 2

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
besides you know called you black ops 2

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.950 
besides you know called you black ops 2
you<00:05:03.830> know<00:05:03.860> there's<00:05:03.980> the<00:05:04.310> wii<00:05:04.460> u<00:05:04.780> some<00:05:05.780> of

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
you know there's the wii u some of

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.720 
you know there's the wii u some of
Assassin's<00:05:06.590> Creed<00:05:06.770> 3<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.310> all<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.520> good

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
Assassin's Creed 3 and all the good

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.330 
Assassin's Creed 3 and all the good
stuff<00:05:08.030> so<00:05:08.390> it's<00:05:09.110> obviously<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:09.770> you're<00:05:10.250> not

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
stuff so it's obviously that you're not

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.580 
stuff so it's obviously that you're not
going<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:10.550> happen<00:05:10.790> and<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.960> coming<00:05:12.170> months

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
going to happen and the coming months

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.290 
going to happen and the coming months
but<00:05:12.830> there's<00:05:13.370> nothing<00:05:13.670> much<00:05:13.820> to<00:05:13.880> say

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
but there's nothing much to say

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.700 
but there's nothing much to say
considering<00:05:14.930> that<00:05:14.960> black<00:05:15.320> ops<00:05:15.560> 2

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
considering that black ops 2
