00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
good things that we're going to try and

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.700 
good things that we're going to try and
change<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.540> underlying<00:00:16.049> emotion<00:00:16.529> or

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
change that underlying emotion or

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.980

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
in the first place now the issue is most

rehab programs work with distance and in
these<00:00:24.330> cases<00:00:24.810> there<00:00:25.410> might<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:25.769> be<00:00:25.830> any<00:00:26.340> place

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
these cases there might not be any place

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.490 
these cases there might not be any place
where<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.359> go<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.779> you're<00:00:27.900> far<00:00:28.289> enough

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
where you can go that you're far enough

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.800 
where you can go that you're far enough
away<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.189> dog<00:00:29.340> feels<00:00:29.910> relaxed<00:00:30.570> enough

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
away that the dog feels relaxed enough

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.590 
away that the dog feels relaxed enough
to<00:00:31.650> be<00:00:31.800> able<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.040> feel<00:00:32.250> safe<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.940> things<00:00:36.300> like

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
to be able to feel safe so things like

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.799 
to be able to feel safe so things like
drugs<00:00:37.079> are

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.170 

our<00:00:45.809> goal<00:00:46.170> here<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:47.040> help<00:00:47.250> our<00:00:47.460> dogs<00:00:47.670> relax

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
our goal here is to help our dogs relax

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.790 
our goal here is to help our dogs relax
and<00:00:48.540> feel<00:00:48.690> safe<00:00:49.019> when<00:00:49.290> they<00:00:49.410> hear<00:00:49.649> these

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and feel safe when they hear these

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.490 
and feel safe when they hear these
sounds<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.430> obviously<00:00:51.030> they<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:51.449> need<00:00:51.839> to

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
sounds and obviously they don't need to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.920 
sounds and obviously they don't need to
lie<00:00:52.680> next<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> drum<00:00:53.579> kit<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.540> order<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
lie next to the drum kit in order to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.549 
lie next to the drum kit in order to
accomplish<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:57.750> would<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:58.079> our<00:00:58.320> end

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
accomplish this this would be our end

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:15.149 
accomplish this this would be our end

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.380 

we<00:01:16.159> have<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.340> bit<00:01:16.549> of<00:01:16.640> a<00:01:16.729> problem<00:01:16.939> here

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
we have a bit of a problem here

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.950 
we have a bit of a problem here
if<00:01:17.990> things<00:01:18.829> like<00:01:19.159> drums<00:01:19.579> or<00:01:19.960> thunderstorms

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
if things like drums or thunderstorms

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.330 
if things like drums or thunderstorms
and<00:01:21.110> construction<00:01:21.619> are<00:01:21.740> so<00:01:21.920> loud<00:01:22.130> they

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
and construction are so loud they

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.580 
and construction are so loud they
literally<00:01:22.850> shake<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.180> house<00:01:23.390> how<00:01:24.259> are<00:01:24.470> we

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
literally shake the house how are we

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.160 
literally shake the house how are we
ever<00:01:24.619> going<00:01:25.039> to<00:01:25.159> get<00:01:25.399> enough<00:01:25.759> distance<00:01:26.180> that

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
ever going to get enough distance that

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.950 
ever going to get enough distance that
our<00:01:27.200> dogs<00:01:27.590> can<00:01:27.979> be<00:01:28.220> relaxed<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.030> safe<00:01:29.630> while

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
our dogs can be relaxed and safe while

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.749 
our dogs can be relaxed and safe while
undergoing<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.710> process<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.399> learning<00:01:31.549> to

undergoing the process of learning to

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.690 
undergoing the process of learning to
like<00:01:32.000> these<00:01:32.179> things<00:01:32.740> by<00:01:33.740> recording<00:01:34.549> the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
like these things by recording the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.639 
like these things by recording the
sounds<00:01:35.149> we<00:01:35.479> can<00:01:35.720> lower<00:01:35.929> the<00:01:36.020> volume<00:01:36.500> even

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
sounds we can lower the volume even

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.800 
sounds we can lower the volume even
further<00:01:37.130> giving<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.000> doc<00:01:38.149> greater<00:01:38.479> comfort

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
further giving the doc greater comfort

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:50.030 
further giving the doc greater comfort
and<00:01:39.229> helping<00:01:40.130> with<00:01:40.280> our<00:01:40.310> rehab<00:01:40.759> process

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.680 

this<00:01:51.040> is<00:01:51.220> karma<00:01:51.610> getting<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:51.940> treat<00:01:52.270> for

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
this is karma getting a treat for

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.590 
this is karma getting a treat for
hearing<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.350> noise<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:55.000> it's<00:01:55.180> being<00:01:55.330> played

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
hearing the noise and it's being played

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.810 
hearing the noise and it's being played
at<00:01:56.020> very<00:01:56.590> low<00:01:56.800> volume<00:01:57.040> but<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.520> video<00:01:57.760> is

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
at very low volume but the video is

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.420 
at very low volume but the video is
playing<00:01:58.300> at<00:01:58.570> full<00:01:58.960> volume<00:01:59.320> so<00:01:59.830> this<00:02:00.010> is<00:02:00.190> what

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
playing at full volume so this is what

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.330 
playing at full volume so this is what
she<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:00.729> actually<00:02:01.390> hearing<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:05.110> we<00:02:05.650> can't<00:02:06.040> hear

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
she is actually hearing if we can't hear

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.699 
she is actually hearing if we can't hear
the<00:02:06.490> sound<00:02:06.760> then<00:02:07.090> how<00:02:07.420> is<00:02:07.690> it<00:02:07.900> that<00:02:07.930> we<00:02:08.410> can<00:02:08.619> be

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
the sound then how is it that we can be

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.390 
the sound then how is it that we can be
sure<00:02:08.740> that<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.429> dog<00:02:09.610> has<00:02:09.820> heard<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.119> sound

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
sure that the dog has heard the sound

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.400 
sure that the dog has heard the sound
since<00:02:12.400> Karma's<00:02:12.880> puppy<00:02:13.240> ears<00:02:13.480> are<00:02:13.690> black<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.350> a
