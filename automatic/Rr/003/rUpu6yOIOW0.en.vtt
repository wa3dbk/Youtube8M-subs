genius where does that idea come from
well<00:00:34.930> I<00:00:34.960> mean<00:00:35.110> the<00:00:35.230> idea<00:00:35.920> of<00:00:36.010> genius<00:00:36.250> itself

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
well I mean the idea of genius itself

geniuses<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:56.230> was<00:00:56.409> something<00:00:56.739> that<00:00:56.769> was

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
geniuses but it was something that was

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.469 
geniuses but it was something that was
special<00:00:57.219> it<00:00:57.670> looked<00:00:57.879> out<00:00:58.030> for<00:00:58.210> your<00:00:58.300> welfare

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
special it looked out for your welfare

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.360 
special it looked out for your welfare
we'd<00:00:58.690> probably<00:00:58.839> call<00:00:59.170> it<00:00:59.289> a<00:00:59.379> guardian<00:01:00.129> angel

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
we'd probably call it a guardian angel

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.880 
we'd probably call it a guardian angel
and<00:01:00.789> it<00:01:01.329> was<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.479> thing<00:01:01.780> that<00:01:01.929> made<00:01:02.109> you<00:01:02.260> kind<00:01:02.710> of

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
and it was a thing that made you kind of

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.369 
and it was a thing that made you kind of
unique<00:01:03.460> so<00:01:04.269> really<00:01:04.659> didn't<00:01:04.989> have<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.170> special

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
unique so really didn't have the special

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.070 
unique so really didn't have the special
connotations<00:01:06.159> that<00:01:06.250> it<00:01:06.430> has<00:01:06.640> today<00:01:06.880> but<00:01:07.840> later

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
connotations that it has today but later

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.469 
connotations that it has today but later
on<00:01:08.320> after<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.190> Renaissance<00:01:09.520> when<00:01:10.030> we<00:01:10.300> had

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
on after the Renaissance when we had

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.330

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.969 
Nicole Angelo and Li da da Vinci people
started<00:01:15.880> coming<00:01:16.030> with<00:01:16.119> this<00:01:16.180> idea<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.990> genius

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
started coming with this idea of genius

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.469

notice it's very important because in
this<00:01:21.219> new<00:01:21.399> idea<00:01:21.790> not<00:01:22.689> everybody<00:01:23.110> had<00:01:23.259> a<00:01:23.289> genius

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
this new idea not everybody had a genius

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.359 
this new idea not everybody had a genius
only<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.009> few<00:01:24.280> people<00:01:24.430> had<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.299> genius<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
only a few people had a genius and and

only a few people had a genius and and
one<00:01:27.909> of<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.060> major<00:01:28.240> figures<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.289> do<00:01:29.439> this<00:01:29.649> is

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
one of the major figures to do this is

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.590 
one of the major figures to do this is
Manuel<00:01:30.850> Khan<00:01:31.060> in<00:01:31.360> his<00:01:31.930> critique<00:01:32.289> of

aesthetics or judgment and in there he

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.590 
aesthetics or judgment and in there he
talked<00:01:37.990> about<00:01:38.219> geniuses<00:01:39.219> as<00:01:39.520> fulfilling<00:01:40.299> two

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
talked about geniuses as fulfilling two

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.170 
talked about geniuses as fulfilling two
requirements<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:42.399> first<00:01:42.430> is<00:01:42.850> they<00:01:42.969> have<00:01:43.090> to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
requirements the first is they have to

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.209 
requirements the first is they have to
do<00:01:43.240> something<00:01:43.509> original<00:01:44.130> something<00:01:45.130> that

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
do something original something that

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.550 
do something original something that
stands<00:01:45.490> out<00:01:45.759> different<00:01:46.600> than<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:47.049> crowd<00:01:47.320> and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
the second thing and this is very

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.910 
the second thing and this is very
important<00:01:50.259> because<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:50.590> got<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.799> remember

to produce something that's not just
original<00:02:04.109> but<00:02:05.109> also<00:02:05.289> exemplary<00:02:06.219> it's

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
original but also exemplary it's

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.669 
original but also exemplary it's
something<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.390> other<00:02:07.539> people<00:02:08.110> would<00:02:08.500> look

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
something that other people would look

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.700 
something that other people would look
up<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.640> admire<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.420> use<00:02:10.750> as<00:02:10.990> a<00:02:11.020> basis<00:02:11.500> for

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
up to and admire and use as a basis for

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.700 
up to and admire and use as a basis for
their<00:02:12.460> own<00:02:12.610> creativity<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.260> was<00:02:14.380> those

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
their own creativity so that was those

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.860 
their own creativity so that was those
two<00:02:14.770> things<00:02:15.190> originality<00:02:15.760> and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
two things originality and

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.680 
two things originality and
being<00:02:17.470> exemplary<00:02:18.010> where<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.520> primary<00:02:19.450> things

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
being exemplary where the primary things

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.940 
being exemplary where the primary things
but<00:02:20.020> it's<00:02:20.140> interesting<00:02:20.349> that<00:02:20.590> should<00:02:20.770> add

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
but it's interesting that should add

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.920 
but it's interesting that should add
this<00:02:21.250> because<00:02:21.849> we<00:02:21.970> included<00:02:22.360> scientists

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
this because we included scientists

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.370 
this because we included scientists
amongst<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.260> genius<00:02:23.610> according<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.760> Kant<00:02:25.380> only

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
amongst a genius according to Kant only

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.540 
amongst a genius according to Kant only
artists<00:02:26.860> could<00:02:27.790> be<00:02:27.940> geniuses<00:02:29.550> scientists

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
artists could be geniuses scientists

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.520 
artists could be geniuses scientists
didn't<00:02:30.940> have<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.300> be<00:02:31.390> geniuses<00:02:31.870> because<00:02:32.290> they

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
didn't have to be geniuses because they

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.000 
didn't have to be geniuses because they
had<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.770> scientific<00:02:33.430> method<00:02:34.500> he<00:02:35.500> even<00:02:35.709> says

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
had a scientific method he even says

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.550 
had a scientific method he even says
Isaac<00:02:36.940> Newton<00:02:37.269> was<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> genius<00:02:37.840> because<00:02:38.349> he

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
Isaac Newton was a genius because he

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.290 
Isaac Newton was a genius because he
could<00:02:38.709> teach<00:02:38.890> anybody<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.610> do<00:02:39.880> what<00:02:40.090> he<00:02:40.180> was

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
could teach anybody to do what he was

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.170 
could teach anybody to do what he was
doing<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.950> it's<00:02:42.099> interesting<00:02:42.489> things<00:02:42.760> but<00:02:43.060> let

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
doing so it's interesting things but let

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.670 
doing so it's interesting things but let
me<00:02:43.239> just<00:02:43.269> add<00:02:43.480> one<00:02:43.510> more<00:02:43.720> thing<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.500> is

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
me just add one more thing and that is

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.520 
me just add one more thing and that is
since<00:02:45.610> I'm<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.819> psychologist<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
since I'm a psychologist the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.110 
since I'm a psychologist the
psychologists<00:02:48.190> like<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.489> take<00:02:48.670> over<00:02:48.850> the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
psychologists like to take over the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.880 
psychologists like to take over the
people's<00:02:49.450> fields<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.140> other<00:02:50.410> people's<00:02:50.680> ideas

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
people's fields and other people's ideas

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.880 
people's fields and other people's ideas
and<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.750> early<00:02:53.080> part<00:02:53.319> of<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.500> 20th

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
and in the early part of the 20th

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.610 
and in the early part of the 20th
century<00:02:54.280> somebody<00:02:54.850> came<00:02:55.030> up<00:02:55.209> with<00:02:55.540> an<00:02:56.170> IQ<00:02:56.380> test

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
century somebody came up with an IQ test

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.660 
century somebody came up with an IQ test
and<00:02:57.840> decided<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.870> find<00:02:59.170> genius<00:02:59.890> in<00:03:00.100> terms<00:03:00.370> of

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
and decided to find genius in terms of

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.570 
and decided to find genius in terms of
your<00:03:00.819> IQ<00:03:01.000> score<00:03:01.680> instead<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.830> in<00:03:03.010> terms<00:03:03.310> of

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
your IQ score instead of in terms of

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.780 
your IQ score instead of in terms of
your<00:03:03.819> exemplary<00:03:04.480> originality<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:06.670> was

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
your exemplary originality this was

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.570 
your exemplary originality this was
actually<00:03:06.880> done<00:03:07.060> at<00:03:07.180> Stanford<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:09.310> IQ

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
actually done at Stanford and this IQ

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.370 
actually done at Stanford and this IQ
score<00:03:10.290> was<00:03:11.290> set<00:03:11.849> arbitrarily<00:03:12.849> and<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:14.019> hundred

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
score was set arbitrarily and a hundred

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.860 
score was set arbitrarily and a hundred
and<00:03:14.500> forty<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.010> that's<00:03:15.819> ended<00:03:16.180> up<00:03:16.299> in<00:03:16.540> the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
and forty and that's ended up in the

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.320 
and forty and that's ended up in the
dictionary<00:03:17.370> just<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.519> was<00:03:18.610> our<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:19.030> means

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
dictionary just it was our it means

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.430 
dictionary just it was our it means
you're<00:03:19.450> in<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.569> top<00:03:19.750> 1%<00:03:19.930> of<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.290> population

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
you're in the top 1% of the population

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.660 
you're in the top 1% of the population
that's<00:03:21.130> all<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.400> means

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
that's all it means

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.569 
that's all it means
and<00:03:21.959> so<00:03:22.959> if<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.590> don't<00:03:23.980> produce<00:03:24.130> something

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
and so if you don't produce something

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.810 
and so if you don't produce something
that's<00:03:24.940> original<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:26.049> exemplary<00:03:26.739> then<00:03:27.549> just

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
that's original and exemplary then just

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.479 
that's original and exemplary then just
get<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:27.940> high<00:03:28.120> IQ<00:03:28.269> score<00:03:28.829> two<00:03:29.829> ways<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.100> doing<00:03:30.220> it

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
get a high IQ score two ways of doing it

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.650 
get a high IQ score two ways of doing it
so<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.840> with<00:03:31.989> that<00:03:32.109> definition<00:03:32.560> is<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.730> was

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
so so with that definition is and was

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.370 
so so with that definition is and was
genius<00:03:35.140> typically<00:03:35.560> identified<00:03:36.780> early<00:03:37.780> in<00:03:37.989> age

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
genius typically identified early in age

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.550 
genius typically identified early in age
with<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.920> young<00:03:39.130> or<00:03:39.430> is<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:39.940> mean<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:41.290> have<00:03:41.470> an

no no yeah so he's the youngest tenured

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.699 
no no yeah so he's the youngest tenured
mathematician<00:03:52.510> at<00:03:53.040> Harvard<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:55.410> when<00:03:56.410> I<00:03:56.440> was

in high school you know we would hang

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.800 
in high school you know we would hang
around<00:03:58.660> sometimes<00:03:59.440> talk<00:04:00.010> about<00:04:00.040> pie<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:01.090> you

and<00:04:54.490> some<00:04:55.240> people<00:04:55.509> argue<00:04:55.870> that<00:04:56.220> general

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
and some people argue that general

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.939 
and some people argue that general
intelligence<00:04:57.789> they<00:04:57.910> actually<00:04:58.150> call<00:04:58.330> it<00:04:58.479> G<00:04:59.319> the

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
intelligence they actually call it G the

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.820 
intelligence they actually call it G the
G<00:04:59.979> factor<00:05:00.990> can<00:05:01.990> be<00:05:02.020> applied<00:05:02.470> a<00:05:02.500> lot<00:05:02.770> of

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
G factor can be applied a lot of

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.930 
G factor can be applied a lot of
different<00:05:03.070> areas<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.340> so<00:05:03.520> if<00:05:03.610> you<00:05:03.729> have

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
different areas and so if you have

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.659 
different areas and so if you have
tremendous<00:05:04.690> general<00:05:05.380> intelligence<00:05:05.919> you<00:05:06.490> can

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
tremendous general intelligence you can

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.189 
tremendous general intelligence you can
learn<00:05:06.820> how<00:05:07.030> to<00:05:07.150> whistle<00:05:07.389> at<00:05:07.630> home<00:05:07.780> at<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:08.020> same

okay not over there right the flags

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.979 
okay not over there right the flags
would<00:05:13.930> that<00:05:14.080> be<00:05:14.169> sitting<00:05:14.440> one<00:05:14.530> of<00:05:14.590> yours<00:05:14.770> here
