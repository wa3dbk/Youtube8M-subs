and<00:01:25.930> so<00:01:26.439> it<00:01:26.560> just<00:01:26.710> works<00:01:26.920> really<00:01:27.159> well<00:01:27.369> for<00:01:27.430> us

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
and so it just works really well for us

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.240 
and so it just works really well for us
if<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:27.969> just<00:01:28.180> had<00:01:28.329> one<00:01:28.360> child<00:01:28.810> or<00:01:29.289> a<00:01:29.590> huge<00:01:30.009> gap

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
if you just had one child or a huge gap

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.440 
if you just had one child or a huge gap
then<00:01:30.490> maybe<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:30.759> could<00:01:30.909> get<00:01:31.000> individual

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
then maybe you could get individual

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.700 
then maybe you could get individual
units<00:01:31.719> for<00:01:31.869> them<00:01:31.990> but<00:01:32.140> honestly<00:01:32.409> I<00:01:32.500> don't<00:01:32.560> see

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
units for them but honestly I don't see

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.219 
units for them but honestly I don't see
why<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.789> multi-level<00:01:34.420> works<00:01:34.810> just<00:01:35.110> fine

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
why the the multi-level works just fine

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.569 
why the the multi-level works just fine
for<00:01:35.469> us<00:01:35.500> so<00:01:35.829> this<00:01:35.920> is<00:01:36.070> what<00:01:36.189> the<00:01:36.280> teachers

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
for us so this is what the teachers

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.380 
for us so this is what the teachers
manual<00:01:36.789> look<00:01:37.030> like<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:38.219> it<00:01:39.219> has<00:01:39.579> you<00:01:40.299> know

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
manual look like and it has you know

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.300 
manual look like and it has you know
their<00:01:40.600> information<00:01:41.229> kind<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.740> how<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:41.979> work

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
their information kind of how to work

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.789 
their information kind of how to work
any<00:01:42.729> information<00:01:43.390> about<00:01:43.479> them<00:01:43.750> how<00:01:43.960> how<00:01:44.619> it

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
any information about them how how it

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.319 
any information about them how how it
works<00:01:44.979> what<00:01:45.189> you<00:01:45.219> should<00:01:45.460> do<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.640> prepare<00:01:46.090> and

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
works what you should do to prepare and

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:47.550 
works what you should do to prepare and
that<00:01:46.420> kind<00:01:46.630> of<00:01:46.689> thing<00:01:46.899> and<00:01:47.049> then<00:01:47.140> they<00:01:47.229> do<00:01:47.289> have

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
that kind of thing and then they do have

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.410 
that kind of thing and then they do have
some<00:01:47.740> schedules<00:01:48.189> in<00:01:48.340> here<00:01:48.549> honestly<00:01:49.030> I<00:01:49.329> don't

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
some schedules in here honestly I don't

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.240 
some schedules in here honestly I don't
really<00:01:49.719> follow<00:01:50.020> this<00:01:50.320> schedule<00:01:50.710> we<00:01:50.799> just<00:01:51.039> kind

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.870 
of put it into our schedule as it fits

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
and then we just do Bible or whatever

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.760 
and then we just do Bible or whatever
it's<00:01:55.270> called<00:01:55.329> for<00:01:55.689> in<00:01:55.780> our<00:01:55.899> schedule<00:01:56.289> and<00:01:56.439> and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.020 
it's called for in our schedule and and
and<00:01:57.399> it's<00:01:57.640> fine<00:01:57.820> I<00:01:58.060> don't<00:01:58.859> do<00:01:59.859> one<00:02:00.609> lesson<00:02:00.850> per

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
and it's fine I don't do one lesson per

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.730 
and it's fine I don't do one lesson per
day<00:02:01.299> I<00:02:01.329> will<00:02:01.630> say<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:02.020> because<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.439> lessons

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
day I will say that because the lessons

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.260 
day I will say that because the lessons
can<00:02:02.890> be<00:02:03.009> kind<00:02:03.280> of<00:02:03.369> long<00:02:03.549> and<00:02:03.579> so<00:02:03.909> we<00:02:04.030> spread

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
can be kind of long and so we spread

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.889 
can be kind of long and so we spread
them<00:02:04.479> out<00:02:04.570> just<00:02:04.899> kind<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.710> more<00:02:05.829> based<00:02:06.100> on<00:02:06.399> how

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
them out just kind of more based on how

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.150 
them out just kind of more based on how
things<00:02:07.899> are<00:02:08.020> going<00:02:08.380> how<00:02:08.500> much<00:02:08.619> time<00:02:08.860> we<00:02:08.979> have

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
things are going how much time we have

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.529 
things are going how much time we have
that<00:02:09.310> day<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:09.729> kind<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.000> thing<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:10.390> it's

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
that day and that kind of thing so it's

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.590 
that day and that kind of thing so it's
just<00:02:10.690> really<00:02:10.990> honestly<00:02:11.320> very<00:02:11.440> flexible<00:02:12.600> but

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
just really honestly very flexible but

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.660 
just really honestly very flexible but
it<00:02:13.900> tells<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.800> teachers<00:02:15.100> manual<00:02:15.280> kind<00:02:15.580> of

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
it tells you the teachers manual kind of

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.980 
it tells you the teachers manual kind of
tells<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:15.910> what<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.270> do<00:02:16.420> they<00:02:16.750> give<00:02:16.960> you

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
tells you what to do they give you

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.120 
tells you what to do they give you
sample<00:02:17.650> drawings<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:18.730> I

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
sample drawings and I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.770 
sample drawings and I
we'll<00:02:19.610> either<00:02:19.790> draw<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.180> on<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.450> board<00:02:20.660> or

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
we'll either draw this on the board or

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.480 
we'll either draw this on the board or
hold<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:21.020> up<00:02:21.080> for<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.320> students<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.770> see<00:02:21.800> my

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
hold it up for the students to see my

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.890 
hold it up for the students to see my
kids<00:02:22.670> are<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:22.910> used<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.210> doing<00:02:23.360> these<00:02:23.540> now<00:02:23.750> they

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
kids are so used to doing these now they

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.390 
kids are so used to doing these now they
don't<00:02:24.110> usually<00:02:24.260> need<00:02:24.590> me<00:02:24.740> to<00:02:24.890> show<00:02:24.920> them<00:02:25.280> a

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
don't usually need me to show them a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.640 
don't usually need me to show them a
picture<00:02:25.640> they<00:02:26.630> kind<00:02:26.870> of<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:27.140> draw<00:02:27.410> their<00:02:27.620> own

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
picture they kind of just draw their own

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.280 
picture they kind of just draw their own
things<00:02:28.100> but<00:02:28.540> but<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.630> gives<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.930> little<00:02:30.140> bit

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
things but but it gives you a little bit

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.110 
things but but it gives you a little bit
of<00:02:30.410> information<00:02:30.710> you<00:02:31.340> read<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.700> parts<00:02:31.970> in

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
of information you read the parts in

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.360 
of information you read the parts in
green<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:33.230> them<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.590> then<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.800> tells<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.160> how

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
green to them and then it tells you how

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.070 
green to them and then it tells you how
students<00:02:34.760> draw<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:35.120> burning<00:02:35.330> bush<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.900> just

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
students draw a burning bush you just

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.300 
students draw a burning bush you just
tell<00:02:36.260> them<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.440> draw<00:02:36.740> a<00:02:36.770> burning<00:02:37.100> bush<00:02:37.250> and

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
tell them to draw a burning bush and

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.070 
tell them to draw a burning bush and
then<00:02:37.610> they<00:02:37.730> can<00:02:37.880> either<00:02:37.970> make<00:02:38.210> it<00:02:38.240> up<00:02:38.480> or<00:02:38.690> you

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
then they can either make it up or you

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.130 
then they can either make it up or you
can<00:02:39.260> show<00:02:39.530> them<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.510> whole<00:02:41.660> teachers

covered<00:03:14.120> what<00:03:14.570> you've<00:03:14.870> gone<00:03:15.050> through<00:03:15.110> in<00:03:15.770> your

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
covered what you've gone through in your

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.790 
covered what you've gone through in your
in<00:03:16.520> your<00:03:16.780> previous<00:03:17.780> lessons<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.410> then<00:03:18.710> you

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
in your previous lessons and then you

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.290 
in your previous lessons and then you
kind<00:03:18.980> of<00:03:19.040> move<00:03:19.100> on<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.580> next<00:03:19.700> section<00:03:20.180> and

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
kind of move on to the next section and

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.700 
kind of move on to the next section and
then<00:03:20.450> there's<00:03:20.660> always<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:21.020> final<00:03:21.440> review

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
then there's always a final review

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.370 
then there's always a final review
drawing<00:03:22.010> also<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.970> there's<00:03:23.840> also<00:03:24.020> a<00:03:24.140> memory

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
drawing also and there's also a memory

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.170 
drawing also and there's also a memory
verse<00:03:24.770> and<00:03:25.160> then<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:25.370> can<00:03:25.520> review<00:03:25.850> that<00:03:26.000> and

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
verse and then you can review that and

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.400 
verse and then you can review that and
then<00:03:26.270> these<00:03:26.390> pictures<00:03:26.750> are<00:03:26.870> supposed<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.200> help

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
then these pictures are supposed to help

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.500 
then these pictures are supposed to help
you<00:03:27.650> kind<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.430> remember<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.940> verse<00:03:29.090> as<00:03:29.330> well

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
you kind of remember the verse as well

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.540 
you kind of remember the verse as well
so<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.960> do<00:03:30.320> like<00:03:30.680> this<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:31.070> think<00:03:31.130> that<00:03:31.400> as<00:03:31.520> the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
so I do like this I think that as the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.960 
so I do like this I think that as the
kids<00:03:31.940> are<00:03:32.120> drawing<00:03:32.450> their<00:03:32.750> stories<00:03:33.350> out<00:03:33.970> it

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
kids are drawing their stories out it

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.360 
kids are drawing their stories out it
just<00:03:35.030> helps<00:03:35.450> them<00:03:35.570> remember<00:03:36.220> what<00:03:37.220> they've

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
just helps them remember what they've

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.490 
just helps them remember what they've
learned<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.510> passages<00:03:39.020> and<00:03:39.200> all<00:03:39.320> that

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
learned and the passages and all that

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.930 
learned and the passages and all that
kind<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.740> things<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.160> that's<00:03:40.670> what<00:03:40.850> the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
kind of things so that's what the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.190 
kind of things so that's what the
teachers<00:03:41.120> manual<00:03:41.450> looks<00:03:41.750> like<00:03:41.930> so<00:03:42.110> you

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
teachers manual looks like so you

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.200 
teachers manual looks like so you
definitely<00:03:42.320> for<00:03:42.770> sure<00:03:42.800> need<00:03:43.130> back<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.700> then

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
definitely for sure need back and then

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.360 
definitely for sure need back and then
but<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.840> student<00:03:45.500> books<00:03:45.680> look<00:03:45.860> like<00:03:46.010> this<00:03:46.190> and

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
but the student books look like this and

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.280 
but the student books look like this and
again<00:03:46.460> I<00:03:46.610> have<00:03:46.850> them<00:03:47.030> spiral<00:03:47.420> bound<00:03:47.540> just<00:03:48.110> to

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
again I have them spiral bound just to

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.600 
again I have them spiral bound just to
make<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.530> easier<00:03:48.800> for<00:03:48.860> my<00:03:49.100> kids<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.460> we<00:03:49.520> don't

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
make it easier for my kids and we don't

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.040 
make it easier for my kids and we don't
have<00:03:49.760> pages<00:03:50.000> flying<00:03:50.390> out<00:03:50.570> or<00:03:50.690> anything<00:03:50.870> like

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
have pages flying out or anything like

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.650 
have pages flying out or anything like
that<00:03:51.110> but<00:03:51.860> you<00:03:52.040> can<00:03:52.220> get<00:03:52.490> two<00:03:53.270> different

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
that but you can get two different

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.040 
that but you can get two different
versions<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:54.640> these<00:03:55.640> and<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.120> don't<00:03:56.180> know<00:03:56.510> if

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
versions of these and I don't know if

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.250 
versions of these and I don't know if
you<00:03:57.260> can<00:03:57.470> see<00:03:57.800> this<00:03:58.010> on<00:03:58.280> camera<00:03:58.550> hopefully<00:03:59.260> you

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
you can see this on camera hopefully you

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.980 
you can see this on camera hopefully you
can<00:04:00.530> but<00:04:01.460> this<00:04:01.850> one<00:04:02.060> is<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:05.420> traceable

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
can but this one is the the traceable

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.370 
can but this one is the the traceable
version<00:04:06.380> and<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:08.030> there's<00:04:08.210> a<00:04:08.360> really<00:04:08.600> light

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
version and so there's a really light

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.230 
version and so there's a really light
kind<00:04:09.770> of<00:04:09.950> gray<00:04:10.160> drawings<00:04:10.670> hopefully<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.090> can

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
kind of gray drawings hopefully you can

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.090 
kind of gray drawings hopefully you can
see<00:04:11.450> that<00:04:11.630> and<00:04:12.170> then<00:04:12.320> so<00:04:12.500> my<00:04:12.650> teenie<00:04:12.860> Todd

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
see that and then so my teenie Todd

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.830 
see that and then so my teenie Todd
actually<00:04:13.490> just<00:04:13.700> traces<00:04:14.180> over<00:04:14.450> those<00:04:14.600> and<00:04:14.780> it

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
actually just traces over those and it

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.900 
actually just traces over those and it
just<00:04:14.990> makes<00:04:15.110> a<00:04:15.230> lot<00:04:15.380> easier<00:04:15.650> for<00:04:15.890> her<00:04:16.100> the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
just makes a lot easier for her the

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.660 
just makes a lot easier for her the
other<00:04:17.180> kids<00:04:17.690> as<00:04:17.870> versions<00:04:18.350> are<00:04:18.859> just<00:04:19.250> blank

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
other kids as versions are just blank

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.330 
other kids as versions are just blank
and<00:04:19.970> so<00:04:20.510> as<00:04:20.780> you<00:04:20.930> can<00:04:20.960> see<00:04:21.170> they<00:04:21.920> would<00:04:22.100> draw

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
and so as you can see they would draw

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.860 
and so as you can see they would draw
their<00:04:22.670> own<00:04:22.850> but<00:04:23.030> this<00:04:23.120> is<00:04:23.300> what<00:04:23.450> it<00:04:23.540> looks<00:04:23.720> like

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
their own but this is what it looks like

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.300 
their own but this is what it looks like
so<00:04:24.110> when<00:04:24.230> you<00:04:24.260> turn<00:04:24.590> it<00:04:24.740> up<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:24.980> mean<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.190> guess

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
so when you turn it up I mean I guess

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.240 
so when you turn it up I mean I guess
you<00:04:25.340> could<00:04:25.490> read<00:04:26.180> that<00:04:26.360> Scripture<00:04:26.900> but

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
you could read that Scripture but

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.280 
you could read that Scripture but
you<00:04:28.760> know<00:04:28.880> if<00:04:28.970> you<00:04:29.090> just<00:04:29.120> had<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.960> student

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
you know if you just had the the student

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.450 
you know if you just had the the student
manual<00:04:30.440> you<00:04:30.740> wouldn't<00:04:30.950> necessarily<00:04:31.040> know

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
manual you wouldn't necessarily know

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.680 
manual you wouldn't necessarily know
what<00:04:31.640> to<00:04:31.790> do<00:04:31.910> with<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.090> you<00:04:32.330> wouldn't<00:04:32.540> have

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
what to do with that you wouldn't have

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.210 
what to do with that you wouldn't have
the<00:04:32.810> review<00:04:33.080> questions<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:33.800> all<00:04:33.890> that<00:04:34.040> kind

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
the review questions and all that kind

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.870 
the review questions and all that kind
of<00:04:34.280> stuff<00:04:34.490> so<00:04:34.520> I<00:04:34.910> don't<00:04:35.780> know<00:04:35.870> I<00:04:35.900> guess<00:04:36.200> I<00:04:36.880> well

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
of stuff so I don't know I guess I well

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.610 
of stuff so I don't know I guess I well
I<00:04:37.940> guess<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.360> questions<00:04:38.750> are<00:04:38.930> in<00:04:39.140> here<00:04:39.470> but

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
I guess the questions are in here but

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.780 
I guess the questions are in here but
not<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.860> answers<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.310> that<00:04:40.430> kind<00:04:40.610> of<00:04:40.640> thing

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
not the answers and that kind of thing

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.270 
not the answers and that kind of thing
so<00:04:40.970> you<00:04:41.480> really<00:04:41.780> do<00:04:41.960> need<00:04:42.260> in<00:04:42.650> my<00:04:42.770> opinion<00:04:43.190> the

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
so you really do need in my opinion the

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.310 
so you really do need in my opinion the
teachers<00:04:43.580> manual<00:04:43.820> so<00:04:44.420> and<00:04:44.690> then<00:04:44.810> I<00:04:44.960> would<00:04:45.140> just

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
teachers manual so and then I would just

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.560 
teachers manual so and then I would just
get<00:04:45.470> to<00:04:45.590> whatever<00:04:45.890> student<00:04:46.460> workbook<00:04:46.850> you

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
get to whatever student workbook you

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.840 
get to whatever student workbook you
want<00:04:47.930> based<00:04:48.290> on<00:04:48.410> how<00:04:48.590> old<00:04:48.740> your<00:04:48.860> kids<00:04:48.890> are<00:04:49.220> I

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
want based on how old your kids are I

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.930 
want based on how old your kids are I

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
to use these so so this is what the the

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.210 
to use these so so this is what the the
unit<00:05:44.630> looks<00:05:44.810> like<00:05:45.140> and<00:05:45.530> we<00:05:45.710> just<00:05:45.919> use<00:05:46.040> these

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
unit looks like and we just use these

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.950 
unit looks like and we just use these
pencils<00:05:46.460> it's<00:05:46.760> relatively<00:05:47.090> simple<00:05:47.419> I<00:05:47.660> spend

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
pencils it's relatively simple I spend

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.980 
pencils it's relatively simple I spend
about<00:05:48.050> fifteen<00:05:48.680> or<00:05:48.710> so<00:05:49.250> minutes<00:05:50.210> a<00:05:50.479> day<00:05:50.660> doing

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
about fifteen or so minutes a day doing

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.840 
about fifteen or so minutes a day doing
these<00:05:51.169> and<00:05:51.470> there's<00:05:52.070> I<00:05:52.340> think<00:05:52.430> there's<00:05:52.669> no

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
these and there's I think there's no

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.120 
these and there's I think there's no
about<00:05:53.210> twelve<00:05:53.570> lessons<00:05:53.960> in<00:05:54.380> this<00:05:54.500> particular

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
about twelve lessons in this particular

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.870 
about twelve lessons in this particular
one<00:05:55.340> and<00:05:55.610> so<00:05:56.530> I<00:05:57.530> just<00:05:58.040> kind<00:05:58.250> of<00:05:58.340> split<00:05:58.669> it<00:05:58.700> up

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
one and so I just kind of split it up

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.610 
one and so I just kind of split it up
into<00:05:59.090> however<00:05:59.360> much<00:05:59.660> time<00:05:59.690> we<00:06:00.050> have<00:06:00.229> that<00:06:00.440> day

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
into however much time we have that day

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.300 
into however much time we have that day
and<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:01.160> I<00:06:02.060> don't<00:06:02.360> do<00:06:02.600> the<00:06:03.260> entire<00:06:03.650> lesson<00:06:03.979> one

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
and and I don't do the entire lesson one

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.000 
and and I don't do the entire lesson one
all<00:06:04.550> in<00:06:04.700> one<00:06:04.850> day<00:06:05.000> because<00:06:05.419> lesson<00:06:06.380> one<00:06:06.560> covers

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
all in one day because lesson one covers

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.120 
all in one day because lesson one covers
several<00:06:07.430> sheets<00:06:07.880> of<00:06:08.180> paper<00:06:08.770> I'm<00:06:09.770> not<00:06:09.919> even

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
several sheets of paper I'm not even

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.730 
several sheets of paper I'm not even
sure<00:06:10.340> where<00:06:10.520> it<00:06:10.640> starts<00:06:10.970> here<00:06:11.150> but<00:06:11.740> there's

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
sure where it starts here but there's

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.350 
sure where it starts here but there's
like<00:06:12.979> it<00:06:13.310> looks<00:06:13.669> like<00:06:13.790> this<00:06:13.940> might<00:06:14.120> be<00:06:14.270> the

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
like it looks like this might be the

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.800 
like it looks like this might be the
beginning<00:06:14.979> so<00:06:15.979> and<00:06:16.340> then<00:06:16.460> it<00:06:16.580> goes<00:06:16.729> clear<00:06:17.120> you

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
beginning so and then it goes clear you

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.810 
beginning so and then it goes clear you
know<00:06:17.900> back<00:06:18.110> tears<00:06:18.380> like<00:06:18.680> your<00:06:18.860> review<00:06:19.160> so<00:06:19.370> this

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
know back tears like your review so this

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.760 
know back tears like your review so this
is<00:06:20.000> quite<00:06:20.270> a<00:06:20.300> few<00:06:20.630> pages<00:06:20.870> to<00:06:21.200> do<00:06:21.350> in<00:06:21.530> one

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
is quite a few pages to do in one

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.920 
is quite a few pages to do in one
sitting<00:06:22.130> so<00:06:22.430> I<00:06:22.729> usually<00:06:23.270> only<00:06:23.390> do<00:06:23.660> like<00:06:23.900> a

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
sitting so I usually only do like a

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.490 
sitting so I usually only do like a
couple<00:06:24.350> of<00:06:24.440> pages<00:06:24.800> per<00:06:25.330> per<00:06:26.330> day<00:06:26.570> and<00:06:27.229> just

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
couple of pages per per day and just

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.780 
couple of pages per per day and just
when<00:06:27.650> we're<00:06:27.770> done<00:06:27.890> we're<00:06:28.100> done<00:06:28.130> so<00:06:28.460> I<00:06:28.490> don't

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:28.790 
when we're done we're done so I don't

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.760 
when we're done we're done so I don't
schedule<00:06:29.090> this<00:06:29.630> out<00:06:29.780> to<00:06:29.960> roughly<00:06:30.260> I<00:06:30.380> kind<00:06:30.710> of

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
schedule this out to roughly I kind of

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.860 
schedule this out to roughly I kind of
just<00:06:30.979> put<00:06:31.669> a<00:06:31.700> little<00:06:31.970> sticky<00:06:32.300> so<00:06:32.450> I<00:06:32.479> know<00:06:32.690> where

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
just put a little sticky so I know where

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.150 
just put a little sticky so I know where
we<00:06:32.960> are<00:06:33.110> and<00:06:33.260> we<00:06:33.320> just<00:06:33.500> pick<00:06:33.680> back<00:06:33.860> up<00:06:34.010> the<00:06:34.130> next

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
we are and we just pick back up the next

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.040 
we are and we just pick back up the next
day<00:06:34.430> so<00:06:34.580> this<00:06:34.880> is<00:06:34.940> really<00:06:35.210> easy<00:06:35.330> to<00:06:35.570> schedule

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
day so this is really easy to schedule

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.750 
day so this is really easy to schedule
out<00:06:36.169> and<00:06:36.440> it's<00:06:36.590> really<00:06:36.800> easy<00:06:37.039> to<00:06:37.190> use<00:06:37.430> and<00:06:37.700> the

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760
