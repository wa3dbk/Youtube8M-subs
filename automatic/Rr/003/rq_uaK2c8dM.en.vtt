 // josé lores what joy gives me to greet them 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.390
 you do not have that weird thing 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.220
 mix of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.220
 steps ceilings and seductive fury that runs through your body 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.799
 I wanted, I have skin 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.789
 like lists because of chicken never 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.819
 the same thing happens to me as the day I saw the face of God for the first time 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.890
 when my uncle sam bimep is an old cabaret and I started walking 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.999
 a hallway for me to tarno where at the end I expected chami 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:28.839
 the armed 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.939
 I wanted to marry her 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.760
 while for me it was the unforgettable thing for it barely a procedure but I 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.860
 I fell in love the same or when you're in the waiting room and you want the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.409
 doctor and tell you is a male 3,800 habit I congratulate him dad 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.910

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.380
 I'm waiting for the spicy doctor to correct the angle and socks 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.330
 you sad rapporteur no more 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.960
 Its Saturday I was in San Juan with the kids 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.680
 since the river lost with lanús I was left something in the freighter that for more 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.440
 that try to swallow it or spit them country 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.710
 and until I start playing Belgrano I will not be able to get out that way 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.190
 that turns my guts 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.690
 today I got up earlier than usual 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.460
 my dog ​​that always bites the feet looked at me out of the corner of his eye, serving as a false goose 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.250
 as if telling me that it had not even dawned 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.630
 like I could not botch pava 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.730
 Look at the picture of my grandparents matías and mateo 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.790
 he winked at the gaucho gil and cut a feta of bacon to take 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.510
 with mate the rhythm of the city and its styles still could not with 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.510
 Another custom of breakfast to eat strong more now than the gringos 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.580
 they prepare for araya meat was billed all year 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.650
 measure time through the window and I saw a celestial one of which there was now real city or 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.010

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.440
 I do not care 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.900
 except that the newspaper 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.140
 behind the kettle was heated on an old braceros and the bathroom with 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.680
 sports supplement and what is flatter had already told me I started 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.890
 imagine the environment with which I am now trotting 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.290
 people and people and more people walking happily through the streets that are left girls and 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.000
 will be widened the strength as the shoe of the poor man who still has this has 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.210
 that keep using it 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.430
 and the stadium at match time 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.440
 and what they queued to get the ticket, spending nights in Cávaco and Asia 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.440
 Syrian had expected him as much as the ticket to be tonight 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.879
 after all the mine is heated with another one and it happened to look for you as a 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.689
 combi but do not know that belgrano always be 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.569

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.229
 river entered the neighborhood 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.499
 when the collective accustomed to touring the houses left something to be 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:29.949
 enter the brahms 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.759

 walks the blondes and so cute compatible companies and also that black 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.479
 You are my undoing 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.869
 when they come out that tight jeans and dyed hair smelling problem 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.349
