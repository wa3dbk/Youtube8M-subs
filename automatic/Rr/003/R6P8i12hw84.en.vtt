00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
other reviews have shows you kind of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.920 
other reviews have shows you kind of
moving<00:00:58.610> it<00:00:58.760> around<00:00:58.850> really<00:00:59.149> fast<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.719> if<00:00:59.809> it's

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
moving it around really fast and if it's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.049 
moving it around really fast and if it's
on<00:01:00.050> lock<00:01:00.320> it'll<00:01:00.680> it'll<00:01:01.100> hold<00:01:01.370> on<00:01:01.550> everything<00:01:01.910> I

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
on lock it'll it'll hold on everything I

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.960 
on lock it'll it'll hold on everything I
found<00:01:02.449> that<00:01:02.629> to<00:01:02.719> be<00:01:02.750> pretty<00:01:03.109> good<00:01:03.379> but

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
found that to be pretty good but

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.960 
found that to be pretty good but
definitely<00:01:06.009> they<00:01:07.009> don't<00:01:07.220> generally<00:01:07.729> show<00:01:07.880> you

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
definitely they don't generally show you

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.070 
definitely they don't generally show you
the<00:01:08.090> shots<00:01:08.330> when<00:01:08.570> they're<00:01:08.690> doing<00:01:08.869> all<00:01:08.990> that

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
the shots when they're doing all that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.410 
the shots when they're doing all that
movement<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:09.800> I<00:01:10.009> definitely<00:01:10.970> will<00:01:11.300> get

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
movement and so I definitely will get

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.880 
movement and so I definitely will get
some<00:01:11.600> shake<00:01:11.840> if<00:01:12.020> you're<00:01:12.170> not<00:01:12.259> careful<00:01:12.530> on<00:01:12.860> that

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
some shake if you're not careful on that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.910 
some shake if you're not careful on that
so<00:01:13.720> but<00:01:14.720> you<00:01:14.810> can<00:01:14.960> see<00:01:15.110> here<00:01:15.289> is<00:01:15.350> I'm<00:01:15.470> in<00:01:15.770> the

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
so but you can see here is I'm in the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.240 
so but you can see here is I'm in the
mode<00:01:16.160> 1<00:01:16.399> as<00:01:16.550> I<00:01:16.640> twist<00:01:16.700> my<00:01:16.970> wrist<00:01:17.179> it<00:01:18.170> just<00:01:19.009> moves

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
mode 1 as I twist my wrist it just moves

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.800 
mode 1 as I twist my wrist it just moves
very<00:01:20.090> fluidly<00:01:20.569> I<00:01:21.310> click<00:01:22.310> it<00:01:22.429> twice<00:01:22.720> then<00:01:23.720> it

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
very fluidly I click it twice then it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.980 
very fluidly I click it twice then it
will<00:01:23.929> allow<00:01:24.050> me<00:01:24.200> to<00:01:24.319> tilt<00:01:24.800> if<00:01:25.369> I<00:01:25.580> flick<00:01:25.899> if<00:01:26.899> I

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
will allow me to tilt if I flick if I

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.589 
will allow me to tilt if I flick if I
kind<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.289> give<00:01:27.440> motions<00:01:28.190> forward<00:01:28.580> and<00:01:28.729> up<00:01:28.819> you

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:29.599 
kind of give motions forward and up you

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:34.960 
kind of give motions forward and up you
can<00:01:29.750> even<00:01:29.840> go<00:01:30.110> way<00:01:30.860> up<00:01:31.330> left<00:01:32.330> right<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.970> then

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
can even go way up left right and then

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.499 
can even go way up left right and then
down<00:01:35.179> of<00:01:35.420> course<00:01:36.220> so<00:01:37.220> that's<00:01:37.399> really<00:01:37.640> an

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
down of course so that's really an

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.859 
down of course so that's really an
amazing<00:01:39.849> function<00:01:40.849> and<00:01:41.030> then<00:01:41.599> the<00:01:41.720> third

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
amazing function and then the third

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.199 
amazing function and then the third
function<00:01:42.170> is<00:01:42.470> that<00:01:42.649> it's<00:01:42.800> not<00:01:43.759> supposed<00:01:44.090> to

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
function is that it's not supposed to

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.749 
function is that it's not supposed to
move<00:01:44.360> is<00:01:44.569> supposed<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.899> stay<00:01:45.140> on<00:01:45.459> target<00:01:46.459> and

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
move is supposed to stay on target and

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.609 
move is supposed to stay on target and
lock<00:01:47.679> shot<00:01:49.750> under<00:01:50.750> normal<00:01:51.080> conditions<00:01:51.530> you

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619

movement<00:02:55.830> here<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.430> there<00:02:56.690> when<00:02:57.690> walking

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
movement here and there when walking

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.620 
movement here and there when walking
with<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.530> gimbal<00:02:58.860> which<00:02:59.250> is<00:03:00.239> something<00:03:00.510> that

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
with the gimbal which is something that

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.080 
with the gimbal which is something that
it<00:03:00.840> was<00:03:00.989> actually<00:03:01.440> created<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.980> prohibit<00:03:02.430> so

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
it was actually created to prohibit so

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.350 
it was actually created to prohibit so
seeing<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.870> up-and-down<00:03:04.530> movement<00:03:05.000> even<00:03:06.000> to

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
seeing that up-and-down movement even to

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.710 
seeing that up-and-down movement even to
a<00:03:06.390> slight<00:03:06.690> degree<00:03:07.700> while<00:03:08.700> not<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.300> dealbreaker

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
a slight degree while not a dealbreaker

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.289 
a slight degree while not a dealbreaker
did<00:03:10.260> indeed<00:03:11.989> was<00:03:12.989> indeed<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.290> surprise<00:03:13.680> on<00:03:14.299> when

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
did indeed was indeed a surprise on when

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:25.360 
did indeed was indeed a surprise on when
when<00:03:15.660> using<00:03:16.019> this<00:03:16.110> for<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.410> first<00:03:16.440> time

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.289 

you'll<00:03:26.370> notice<00:03:26.549> I'm<00:03:26.760> starting<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.150> move

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
you'll notice I'm starting to move

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.660 
you'll notice I'm starting to move
faster<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.410> doesn't<00:03:28.830> appear<00:03:29.250> as<00:03:29.430> when<00:03:29.580> I'm

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
faster so it doesn't appear as when I'm

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.270 
faster so it doesn't appear as when I'm
moving<00:03:29.790> faster<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.630> even<00:03:31.260> jogging<00:03:31.709> that

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
moving faster that even jogging that

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.910 
moving faster that even jogging that
there's<00:03:32.610> any<00:03:33.090> more<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.840> movement<00:03:34.080> much<00:03:34.650> more

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
there's any more of a movement much more

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.560 
there's any more of a movement much more
anyway<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:38.150> faster<00:03:39.150> movement<00:03:39.480> was

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
anyway so that a faster movement was

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.220 
anyway so that a faster movement was
actually<00:03:39.959> fine<00:03:41.360> I'm<00:03:42.360> here<00:03:42.600> at<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.720> park<00:03:42.989> in

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
actually fine I'm here at the park in

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.470 
actually fine I'm here at the park in
mode<00:03:43.590> 2<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:44.930> testing<00:03:45.930> out<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:47.360> vertical<00:03:48.360> and

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
mode 2 so testing out the vertical and

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.390 
mode 2 so testing out the vertical and
horizontal<00:03:48.709> movement<00:03:49.709> of<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.890> camera

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:00.170 

overall<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:54.980> good<00:03:55.980> experience<00:03:59.000> you<00:04:00.000> might

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
overall a good experience you might

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.740 
overall a good experience you might
return<00:04:00.480> back<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:01.260> decided<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.549> run<00:04:03.060> you'll

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
return back I decided to run you'll

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.370 
return back I decided to run you'll
notice<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.140> pickup<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.590> speed<00:04:04.890> I'm<00:04:05.519> running

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
notice the pickup and speed I'm running

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.930 
notice the pickup and speed I'm running
not<00:04:07.380> as<00:04:07.500> fast<00:04:07.709> as<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:08.040> can<00:04:08.100> but<00:04:08.400> as<00:04:08.489> fast<00:04:08.549> as<00:04:08.850> I

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
not as fast as I can but as fast as I

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.000 
not as fast as I can but as fast as I
feel<00:04:09.150> comfortable<00:04:09.660> running<00:04:09.870> with<00:04:10.140> it<00:04:10.320> gimble

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
feel comfortable running with it gimble

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.550 
feel comfortable running with it gimble
in<00:04:11.070> my<00:04:11.220> hand<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:11.959> foreigner<00:04:12.959> dollar<00:04:13.110> go<00:04:13.350> pro

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
in my hand and foreigner dollar go pro

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.539 
in my hand and foreigner dollar go pro
so<00:04:14.930> definitely<00:04:15.930> moving<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.859> pretty<00:04:17.280> steady

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
so definitely moving a pretty steady

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.610 
so definitely moving a pretty steady
pace<00:04:17.820> and

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
pace and

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.530 
pace and
it<00:04:18.859> seemed<00:04:19.250> that<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:22.240> movements<00:04:23.240> kind<00:04:23.479> of

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
it seemed that the movements kind of

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.780 
it seemed that the movements kind of
smoothed<00:04:23.870> out<00:04:24.050> even<00:04:25.010> better<00:04:25.190> when<00:04:25.490> I<00:04:25.520> was

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
smoothed out even better when I was

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.740 
smoothed out even better when I was
moving<00:04:26.570> faster<00:04:27.050> versus<00:04:27.440> just<00:04:27.919> walking<00:04:28.750> but

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
moving faster versus just walking but

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:50.620 
moving faster versus just walking but
I'll<00:04:29.810> leave<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:29.990> for<00:04:30.169> you<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.500> decide<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:49.630> push

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
I'll leave that for you to decide I push

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.610 
I'll leave that for you to decide I push
the<00:04:50.870> gimbal<00:04:51.199> out<00:04:51.289> in<00:04:51.410> front<00:04:51.620> of<00:04:51.710> me<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:52.100> in<00:04:52.430> a

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
the gimbal out in front of me and in a

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.650 
the gimbal out in front of me and in a
so<00:04:54.620> as<00:04:54.740> a<00:04:54.770> flat<00:04:55.220> so<00:04:55.940> it's<00:04:56.090> flat<00:04:56.360> with<00:04:56.570> the

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
so as a flat so it's flat with the

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.890 
so as a flat so it's flat with the
camera<00:04:57.020> pointed<00:04:57.560> forward<00:04:58.060> just<00:04:59.060> up<00:04:59.210> here<00:04:59.240> and

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
camera pointed forward just up here and

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.320 
camera pointed forward just up here and
I<00:05:00.710> noticed<00:05:01.130> that<00:05:01.190> there<00:05:01.370> was<00:05:01.490> more<00:05:01.729> shake<00:05:02.060> when

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
I noticed that there was more shake when

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330 
I noticed that there was more shake when
doing<00:05:02.600> that<00:05:02.810> because<00:05:03.320> it's<00:05:03.620> not<00:05:03.680> resting<00:05:04.220> on

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
doing that because it's not resting on

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.820 
doing that because it's not resting on
the<00:05:04.510> proper<00:05:05.510> gimbal<00:05:05.870> but<00:05:06.020> overall<00:05:06.680> pretty

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
the proper gimbal but overall pretty

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.850 
the proper gimbal but overall pretty
good<00:05:07.870> pretty<00:05:08.870> good<00:05:09.020> ability<00:05:09.470> I<00:05:09.500> would<00:05:09.680> imagine

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
good pretty good ability I would imagine

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.320 
good pretty good ability I would imagine
if<00:05:10.130> you're<00:05:10.250> on<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.400> skateboard<00:05:10.699> or<00:05:11.030> something

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
if you're on a skateboard or something

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.240 
if you're on a skateboard or something
with<00:05:11.449> wheels<00:05:11.630> at<00:05:11.900> this<00:05:12.020> time<00:05:12.229> doing<00:05:12.560> that<00:05:12.680> it

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
with wheels at this time doing that it

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:24.399 
with wheels at this time doing that it
would<00:05:13.310> be<00:05:13.639> quite<00:05:13.970> smooth

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:32.460 

you

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.679 

you

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:35.689 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.080 

you

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.200 

you

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.640 

you

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:57.110 

you

you

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:09.710 

definitely<00:06:08.789> worth<00:06:08.849> picking<00:06:08.910> up<00:06:09.270> if<00:06:09.479> you're<00:06:09.569> an

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
definitely worth picking up if you're an

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.339 
definitely worth picking up if you're an
amateur<00:06:10.340> videography<00:06:11.630> one<00:06:12.630> of<00:06:12.720> the<00:06:12.840> downsides

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
amateur videography one of the downsides

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:15.439 
amateur videography one of the downsides
of<00:06:13.830> these<00:06:14.009> gimbals<00:06:14.849> is<00:06:15.060> they're<00:06:15.210> not

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
of these gimbals is they're not

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.540 
of these gimbals is they're not
waterproof<00:06:16.319> and<00:06:16.830> they're<00:06:17.069> definitely<00:06:17.340> not

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
waterproof and they're definitely not

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.249 
waterproof and they're definitely not
sand<00:06:18.449> proof<00:06:18.810> so<00:06:20.599> they<00:06:21.599> have<00:06:21.750> to<00:06:21.870> be<00:06:21.960> taken<00:06:22.229> care

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
sand proof so they have to be taken care

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.740 
sand proof so they have to be taken care
of<00:06:22.500> and<00:06:22.800> you<00:06:22.889> can't<00:06:23.150> you<00:06:24.150> definitely<00:06:24.539> can't

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
of and you can't you definitely can't

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.960 
of and you can't you definitely can't
move<00:06:25.410> them<00:06:25.620> around<00:06:25.740> easily<00:06:26.160> you<00:06:26.490> can't<00:06:26.729> just

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
move them around easily you can't just

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.450
