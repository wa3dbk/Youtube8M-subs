00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
bits to go to the game then I spray

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.260 
bits to go to the game then I spray
paint<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.830> whole<00:02:33.920> thing<00:02:34.130> black<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.150> all

more dividers for all the cards that go
with<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.090> game<00:02:44.240> I<00:02:44.480> have<00:02:44.720> done<00:02:44.870> all<00:02:45.080> sleeved

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
with the game I have done all sleeved

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.550 
with the game I have done all sleeved
and<00:02:45.770> divided<00:02:46.130> up<00:02:46.280> along<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.270> see<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.600> board

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
and divided up along you see the board

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.790 
and divided up along you see the board
for<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:48.800> game<00:02:48.950> in<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.220> top<00:02:49.400> right<00:02:49.610> corner<00:02:49.970> and

for the game in the top right corner and

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.030 
for the game in the top right corner and
then<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:53.030> can<00:02:53.180> remove<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.480> board<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.830> have

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
then you can remove the board and I have

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.900 
then you can remove the board and I have
more<00:02:55.880> dividers<00:02:56.330> for<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.900> villain<00:02:57.440> and

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
more dividers for the villain and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.210 
more dividers for the villain and
investigator<00:02:58.910> cards<00:02:59.300> along<00:02:59.600> with<00:02:59.780> all<00:02:59.960> the

investigator cards along with all the
miniatures<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.580> dice<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.330> go<00:03:02.450> with<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.630> game

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.360 

and<00:03:06.350> if<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:06.500> turn<00:03:06.650> from<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:06.920> side<00:03:07.100> here<00:03:07.250> you

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
and if you turn from the side here you

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.100 
and if you turn from the side here you
can<00:03:07.520> see<00:03:07.670> I've<00:03:07.790> got<00:03:07.910> everything<00:03:08.210> divided<00:03:08.780> so

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
can see I've got everything divided so

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.900 
can see I've got everything divided so
that<00:03:09.140> basically<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.680> whole<00:03:09.830> point<00:03:10.130> was<00:03:10.850> to

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
that basically the whole point was to

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.460 
that basically the whole point was to
make<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:11.210> to<00:03:11.360> where<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.570> could<00:03:11.870> play<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.260> game

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
make it to where I could play the game

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.070 
make it to where I could play the game
directly<00:03:13.190> from<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.790> box<00:03:14.030> I'll<00:03:14.630> have<00:03:14.870> to<00:03:14.960> do

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
directly from the box I'll have to do

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.449 
directly from the box I'll have to do
with<00:03:15.230> shuffle<00:03:15.560> at<00:03:15.650> first<00:03:15.890> time<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.130> draw<00:03:16.340> from

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
with shuffle at first time I draw from

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.699 
with shuffle at first time I draw from
each<00:03:16.640> individual<00:03:17.120> stack<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:17.750> not<00:03:18.380> have<00:03:18.560> to

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
each individual stack and not have to

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.979 
each individual stack and not have to
worry<00:03:18.920> about<00:03:19.120> pulling<00:03:20.120> everything<00:03:20.450> out<00:03:20.750> and

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
worry about pulling everything out and

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.350 
worry about pulling everything out and
then<00:03:21.080> putting<00:03:21.830> it<00:03:21.950> all<00:03:22.070> away<00:03:22.190> people<00:03:23.090> keep<00:03:23.239> it

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
then putting it all away people keep it

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
then putting it all away people keep it
all<00:03:23.450> together<00:03:25.870> in<00:03:26.870> order<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.080> have<00:03:27.200> enough

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
all together in order to have enough

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.010 
all together in order to have enough
room<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:28.060> have<00:03:29.060> all<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.330> cards<00:03:29.540> standing<00:03:29.959> up

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
room to have all the cards standing up

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.240 
room to have all the cards standing up
on<00:03:30.110> their<00:03:30.230> side<00:03:30.410> that<00:03:30.590> though<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:30.890> had<00:03:31.220> to

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
on their side that though I had to

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.660 
on their side that though I had to
remove<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:32.720> top<00:03:33.020> piece<00:03:33.320> that<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.250> said<00:03:34.550> you

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
remove the top piece that I said you

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.280 
remove the top piece that I said you
could<00:03:34.820> use<00:03:34.850> to<00:03:35.180> hold<00:03:35.360> instructions<00:03:36.050> and<00:03:36.140> stuff

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
could use to hold instructions and stuff

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.010 
could use to hold instructions and stuff
like<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:37.120> painted<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.209> black<00:03:38.570> just<00:03:38.959> so

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
like that I painted that black just so

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.210 
like that I painted that black just so
it<00:03:39.140> all<00:03:39.230> meshed<00:03:39.470> together<00:03:39.560> very<00:03:40.010> well<00:03:42.220> alright

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
it all meshed together very well alright

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.100 
it all meshed together very well alright
and<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.550> is<00:03:43.670> my<00:03:43.850> storage<00:03:44.180> case<00:03:44.480> for<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.780> Touch

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
and that is my storage case for a Touch

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.650 
and that is my storage case for a Touch
of<00:03:45.260> Evil<00:03:45.350> I<00:03:45.739> know<00:03:46.190> that<00:03:46.550> like<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.150> said<00:03:47.180> earlier

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
of Evil I know that like I said earlier

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.780 
of Evil I know that like I said earlier
it's<00:03:47.870> really<00:03:47.959> tough<00:03:48.380> finding<00:03:48.650> solutions<00:03:49.640> to

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
it's really tough finding solutions to

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.550 
it's really tough finding solutions to
hold<00:03:49.970> everything

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
hold everything

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.509 
hold everything
sometimes<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:51.709> punch<00:03:51.950> out<00:03:52.130> all<00:03:52.160> your<00:03:52.370> pieces

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
sometimes you punch out all your pieces

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.460 
sometimes you punch out all your pieces
and<00:03:52.820> it's<00:03:53.060> kind<00:03:53.660> of<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:53.780> pain<00:03:53.989> to<00:03:54.019> put<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.380> away

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
and it's kind of a pain to put it away

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.259 
and it's kind of a pain to put it away
you<00:03:55.160> don't<00:03:55.250> want<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.489> play<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:55.730> again<00:03:55.790> because

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
you don't want to play it again because

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.070 
you don't want to play it again because
you<00:03:56.300> don't<00:03:56.480> feel<00:03:56.570> like<00:03:56.690> separating

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
you don't feel like separating
