the standpoint of the mobility both are
key<00:00:27.660> terms<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.230> survivability<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:30.080> we

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
key terms of survivability and we

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.030 
key terms of survivability and we
believe<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:32.189> combination<00:00:32.940> of

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
believe that the combination of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.010 
believe that the combination of
state-of-the-art<00:00:35.690> components<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.899> have

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
state-of-the-art components that we have

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.900 
state-of-the-art components that we have
used<00:00:37.170> together<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.370> lightweight

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
used together with the lightweight

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.700 
used together with the lightweight
construction<00:00:39.239> really<00:00:40.079> gives<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.680> very

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
construction really gives it a very

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.970 
construction really gives it a very
unique<00:00:41.489> position<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.140> MRAP<00:00:43.440> community

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
unique position in the MRAP community

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.350 
unique position in the MRAP community
and<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.910> believe<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.329> by<00:00:45.870> leveraging<00:00:47.360> what

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and we believe that by leveraging what

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.080 
and we believe that by leveraging what
has<00:00:49.050> been<00:00:49.260> very<00:00:49.469> successful<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.879> US

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
has been very successful in the US

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.930 
has been very successful in the US
government<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.690> applying<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.730> what<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
government and applying it to what the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.720 
government and applying it to what the
Canadians<00:00:54.690> are<00:00:54.840> asking<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.500> they<00:00:56.250> put<00:00:56.579> those

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
Canadians are asking for they put those

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.200 
Canadians are asking for they put those
two<00:00:56.969> together<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.480> gives<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:58.020> gives<00:00:58.410> our

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
two together it gives it gives our

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.770 
two together it gives it gives our
vehicle<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.449> unique<00:01:01.109> opportunity<00:01:01.430> to<00:01:02.780> not

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
vehicle a unique opportunity to not

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.020 
vehicle a unique opportunity to not
start<00:01:04.140> from<00:01:04.350> an<00:01:04.470> improvement<00:01:04.860> us<00:01:05.159> start<00:01:06.000> with

other<00:01:37.960> characteristics<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:39.620> vehicle

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
other characteristics to this vehicle

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.570 
other characteristics to this vehicle
that<00:01:40.280> stand<00:01:40.909> up<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:43.540> in<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.690> model<00:01:45.050> that

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
that stand up the in the model that

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.710 
that stand up the in the model that
we're<00:01:46.580> proposing<00:01:47.530> taffie<00:01:48.530> program<00:01:49.600> one<00:01:50.600> of

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
we're proposing taffie program one of

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.180 
we're proposing taffie program one of
the<00:01:50.810> unique<00:01:50.840> features<00:01:51.050> is<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.770> know<00:01:51.860> we<00:01:52.010> have

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
the unique features is you know we have

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.050 
the unique features is you know we have
the<00:01:52.850> four<00:01:53.060> doors<00:01:53.330> for<00:01:53.630> quick<00:01:53.840> egress<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:55.060> from

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
the four doors for quick egress and from

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.050 
the four doors for quick egress and from
the<00:01:56.180> standpoint<00:01:56.450> of

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
the standpoint of

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.990 
the standpoint of
leveraging<00:01:59.290> oshkosh<00:02:00.310> tackle<00:02:01.310> or<00:02:01.399> system<00:02:01.820> to

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
leveraging oshkosh tackle or system to

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.090 
leveraging oshkosh tackle or system to
common<00:02:02.450> components<00:02:03.079> that<00:02:03.680> are<00:02:03.740> going<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:03.979> be

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
common components that are going to be

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.600 
common components that are going to be
used<00:02:04.310> wherever<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.970> vehicle<00:02:05.630> is<00:02:05.930> offered<00:02:06.610> so

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
used wherever the vehicle is offered so

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.510 
used wherever the vehicle is offered so
I<00:02:07.640> think<00:02:07.939> also<00:02:08.149> the

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
I think also the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.830 
I think also the
the<00:02:10.060> troops<00:02:10.840> will<00:02:11.230> have<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:12.070> comfortable<00:02:12.840> parts

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
the troops will have a comfortable parts

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.030 
the troops will have a comfortable parts
that<00:02:14.020> they<00:02:14.050> have<00:02:14.290> seen<00:02:14.530> before

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.300 

if<00:02:17.400> they're<00:02:17.640> ever<00:02:17.700> deployed<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.420> areas<00:02:18.989> where

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
if they're ever deployed in areas where

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.399 
if they're ever deployed in areas where
the<00:02:20.310> u.s.<00:02:22.730> cabinet<00:02:23.730> if<00:02:24.569> he<00:02:24.959> speak<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
the u.s. cabinet if he speak to the

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.190 
the u.s. cabinet if he speak to the

dynamics<00:02:28.290> land<00:02:28.620> systems<00:02:28.799> have<00:02:29.219> put<00:02:29.790> together

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
dynamics land systems have put together

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.520 
dynamics land systems have put together
for<00:02:30.269> this<00:02:30.390> what<00:02:30.599> makes<00:02:31.049> that<00:02:31.200> distinction

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
for this what makes that distinction

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.899 
for this what makes that distinction
happy<00:02:32.129> again<00:02:32.780> first<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.900> all<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.609> we<00:02:35.609> really
