this<00:00:03.129> is<00:00:03.250> my<00:00:03.399> third<00:00:03.670> year<00:00:03.699> on<00:00:03.969> a<00:00:04.029> power<00:00:04.240> meter<00:00:04.390> I

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:04.720 
this is my third year on a power meter I

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.269 
this is my third year on a power meter I
love<00:00:05.109> using<00:00:05.290> my<00:00:05.350> power<00:00:05.649> meter<00:00:05.830> for<00:00:05.979> training

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:06.279 
love using my power meter for training

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:07.590 
love using my power meter for training
and<00:00:06.370> racing<00:00:06.580> I<00:00:06.970> can<00:00:07.180> collect<00:00:07.390> a<00:00:07.450> lot<00:00:07.569> of

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:07.600 
and racing I can collect a lot of

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.780 
and racing I can collect a lot of
valuable<00:00:07.990> data<00:00:08.139> I've<00:00:08.469> have<00:00:08.680> data<00:00:08.980> from<00:00:09.160> the

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
valuable data I've have data from the

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.070 
valuable data I've have data from the
age<00:00:09.879> based<00:00:10.120> on<00:00:10.240> the<00:00:10.360> age<00:00:10.450> for<00:00:10.600> the<00:00:10.690> last<00:00:10.840> three

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
age based on the age for the last three

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.869 
age based on the age for the last three
years<00:00:11.110> now<00:00:11.500> this<00:00:12.190> year<00:00:12.309> out<00:00:12.400> a<00:00:12.430> second<00:00:12.730> in<00:00:12.789> the

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:12.879 
years now this year out a second in the

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.279 
years now this year out a second in the
race<00:00:13.029> and<00:00:13.059> I<00:00:13.240> was<00:00:13.360> able<00:00:13.449> to<00:00:13.570> analyze<00:00:14.080> my<00:00:14.260> data

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:14.289 
race and I was able to analyze my data

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:15.660 
race and I was able to analyze my data
and<00:00:14.680> look<00:00:14.799> at<00:00:14.889> the<00:00:14.980> differences<00:00:15.400> and<00:00:15.520> where<00:00:15.639> I

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
and look at the differences and where I

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.070 
and look at the differences and where I
made<00:00:15.879> the<00:00:16.000> differences<00:00:16.390> in<00:00:16.420> my<00:00:16.600> training<00:00:16.810> and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
made the differences in my training and

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.390 
made the differences in my training and
they<00:00:17.170> my<00:00:17.289> racing<00:00:17.650> and<00:00:17.680> preparing<00:00:18.100> for<00:00:18.220> its

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
they my racing and preparing for its

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.579 
they my racing and preparing for its
like<00:00:18.580> that<00:00:18.929> through<00:00:19.929> that<00:00:20.050> race<00:00:20.230> i<00:00:20.380> was<00:00:20.500> able

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:20.589 
like that through that race i was able

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.800 
like that through that race i was able
to<00:00:20.679> see<00:00:20.890> that<00:00:21.099> over<00:00:21.820> in<00:00:22.240> the<00:00:22.330> first<00:00:22.509> two<00:00:22.689> and<00:00:22.779> a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
to see that over in the first two and a

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.179 
to see that over in the first two and a
half<00:00:22.929> hours<00:00:23.199> the<00:00:23.320> race<00:00:23.499> i<00:00:23.710> was<00:00:23.859> able<00:00:23.980> to

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
half hours the race i was able to

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.130 
half hours the race i was able to
average<00:00:24.999> 40<00:00:25.329> watts<00:00:25.480> less<00:00:25.720> than<00:00:25.869> i<00:00:25.929> had<00:00:26.050> the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
average 40 watts less than i had the

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.870 
average 40 watts less than i had the
previous<00:00:26.470> two<00:00:26.619> years<00:00:26.650> although<00:00:27.609> my

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
previous two years although my

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.970 
previous two years although my
normalized<00:00:28.659> power<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:29.320> race<00:00:29.470> was<00:00:29.619> actually

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
normalized power the race was actually

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.420 
normalized power the race was actually
higher<00:00:30.369> because<00:00:30.880> they<00:00:31.089> made<00:00:31.269> my<00:00:31.419> big<00:00:32.230> man<00:00:32.430> big

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
higher because they made my big man big

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.070 
higher because they made my big man big
my<00:00:33.579> attack<00:00:33.820> at<00:00:33.970> the<00:00:34.000> end<00:00:34.210> he<00:00:34.750> was<00:00:34.870> able<00:00:34.930> to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
my attack at the end he was able to

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.300 
my attack at the end he was able to
produce<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.410> power<00:00:35.590> because<00:00:35.920> I<00:00:36.010> had<00:00:36.130> been

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
produce the power because I had been

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.010 
produce the power because I had been
saving<00:00:36.610> energy<00:00:36.700> throughout<00:00:37.060> the<00:00:37.120> race<00:00:37.360> so

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
saving energy throughout the race so

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.570 
saving energy throughout the race so
having<00:00:38.200> data<00:00:38.410> from<00:00:38.650> this<00:00:38.770> unit<00:00:39.070> to<00:00:39.160> be<00:00:39.220> able<00:00:39.370> to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
having data from this unit to be able to

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.460 
having data from this unit to be able to
retro<00:00:40.270> actively<00:00:40.570> go<00:00:40.750> back<00:00:40.960> and<00:00:41.230> look<00:00:41.290> at<00:00:41.440> what

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
retro actively go back and look at what

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.320 
retro actively go back and look at what
i<00:00:41.590> did<00:00:41.740> in<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.830> years<00:00:42.040> passed<00:00:42.310> and<00:00:42.700> also<00:00:43.240> be

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
i did in the years passed and also be

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.540 
i did in the years passed and also be
able<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.570> see<00:00:43.780> live<00:00:44.680> during<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.160> race<00:00:45.310> what

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
able to see live during the race what

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.400 
able to see live during the race what
I'm<00:00:45.640> doing<00:00:45.970> what<00:00:46.180> needs<00:00:46.210> to<00:00:46.420> be<00:00:46.510> done<00:00:46.540> it's<00:00:47.380> a

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
I'm doing what needs to be done it's a

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:57.030 
I'm doing what needs to be done it's a
real<00:00:47.590> benefit<00:00:47.950> to<00:00:48.010> us<00:00:48.190> as<00:00:48.340> racers

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.530 

yeah<00:00:57.700> it's<00:00:57.820> where<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.030> hero<00:00:58.150> the<00:00:58.300> gila

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
yeah it's where the hero the gila

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.230 
yeah it's where the hero the gila
monsters<00:00:58.930> a<00:00:58.960> big<00:00:59.170> day<00:00:59.350> is<00:00:59.590> a<00:00:59.760> 107<00:01:00.760> miles<00:01:00.910> but<00:01:01.210> i

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
monsters a big day is a 107 miles but i

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.260 
monsters a big day is a 107 miles but i
believe<00:01:01.920> 10,000<00:01:02.920> feet<00:01:03.040> of<00:01:03.160> climbing<00:01:03.280> there's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
believe 10,000 feet of climbing there's

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.640 
believe 10,000 feet of climbing there's
a<00:01:04.330> big<00:01:04.449> day<00:01:04.629> today<00:01:04.780> like<00:01:05.020> that<00:01:05.170> you<00:01:05.290> know<00:01:05.320> using

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
a big day today like that you know using

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.690 
a big day today like that you know using
having<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:05.890> power<00:01:06.100> meter<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.430> be<00:01:06.490> able<00:01:06.640> to

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
having a power meter to be able to

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.280 
having a power meter to be able to
record<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.090> climbing<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.540> distance<00:01:07.870> but

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
record the climbing the distance but

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.750 
record the climbing the distance but
also<00:01:08.410> the<00:01:08.590> kilojoules<00:01:09.070> burned<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.520> really

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
also the kilojoules burned is a really

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.730 
also the kilojoules burned is a really
critical<00:01:10.120> unit<00:01:10.630> of<00:01:10.720> measurement<00:01:10.990> you<00:01:11.560> know<00:01:11.680> to

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
critical unit of measurement you know to

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.540 
critical unit of measurement you know to
be<00:01:11.920> like<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.190> you<00:01:12.250> need<00:01:12.370> to<00:01:12.430> make<00:01:12.520> sure

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
be like that you need to make sure

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.190 
be like that you need to make sure
you're<00:01:12.730> drinking<00:01:12.790> water<00:01:13.180> you're<00:01:13.420> eating<00:01:13.780> your

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
you're drinking water you're eating your

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.290 
you're drinking water you're eating your
same<00:01:14.380> fuel<00:01:14.650> then<00:01:15.490> at<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.670> end<00:01:15.700> also<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.180> make

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
same fuel then at the end also to make

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.969 
same fuel then at the end also to make
sure<00:01:16.510> you<00:01:16.900> know<00:01:16.990> it<00:01:17.140> rates<00:01:17.560> like<00:01:17.650> that<00:01:17.830> also

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
sure you know it rates like that also

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.830 
sure you know it rates like that also
the<00:01:18.100> elevation<00:01:18.880> is<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.120> factor<00:01:19.510> in<00:01:19.570> your<00:01:19.690> power

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
the elevation is a factor in your power

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.380 
the elevation is a factor in your power
so<00:01:20.500> when<00:01:20.650> people<00:01:20.890> are<00:01:21.190> another<00:01:21.729> threshold<00:01:22.000> is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
so when people are another threshold is

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.620 
so when people are another threshold is
X<00:01:23.050> X<00:01:23.650> number<00:01:23.979> but<00:01:24.550> you<00:01:24.850> know<00:01:24.940> altitude<00:01:25.450> maybe

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
X X number but you know altitude maybe

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.600 
X X number but you know altitude maybe
it's<00:01:25.720> why<00:01:25.840> so<00:01:26.140> it<00:01:26.229> changes<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.710> variable<00:01:27.130> so

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
it's why so it changes the variable so

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.160 
it's why so it changes the variable so
people<00:01:27.850> are<00:01:27.970> trying<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.180> overdo<00:01:28.840> their<00:01:28.990> power

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
people are trying to overdo their power

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.420 
people are trying to overdo their power
they<00:01:29.320> might<00:01:29.440> blow<00:01:29.590> up<00:01:29.619> so<00:01:29.920> using<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.250> power

week and I guess after that right mount
baldy<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.680> probably<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.040> your<00:01:47.070> mind<00:01:47.460> that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
baldy is probably on your mind that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.460 
baldy is probably on your mind that
imagine<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.570> quark<00:01:48.870> power<00:01:49.080> meter<00:01:49.350> is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470

imagine that this quark power meter is
going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.680> come<00:01:49.800> into<00:01:49.950> play<00:01:50.220> come<00:01:50.730> like<00:01:50.880> that

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
going to come into play come like that

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.580 
going to come into play come like that
when<00:01:51.150> it's<00:01:51.270> long<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.750> got<00:01:51.870> to<00:01:51.990> keep<00:01:52.410> yourself

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
when it's long you got to keep yourself

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.960 
when it's long you got to keep yourself
into<00:01:52.890> zones<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.310> make<00:01:53.460> sure<00:01:53.580> that<00:01:53.730> you're<00:01:53.850> not

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
into zones and make sure that you're not

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.060 
into zones and make sure that you're not
going<00:01:54.150> to<00:01:54.210> blow<00:01:54.510> up<00:01:54.660> and<00:01:54.930> can't<00:01:55.320> recover<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.860> I

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
going to blow up and can't recover so I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.890 
going to blow up and can't recover so I
have<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.910> know<00:01:57.060> what<00:01:57.180> my<00:01:57.240> threshold<00:01:57.480> is<00:01:57.720> I<00:01:57.840> know

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
have I know what my threshold is I know

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.230 
have I know what my threshold is I know
kind<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.200> watts<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.650> produce<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.250> you<00:02:00.150> know

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
kind of watts I can produce and you know

kind of watts I can produce and you know
trying<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.480> keep<00:02:00.600> myself<00:02:00.720> within<00:02:01.080> those<00:02:01.200> zones

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
trying to keep myself within those zones

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.350 
trying to keep myself within those zones
so<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:01.980> you<00:02:02.430> know<00:02:02.550> do<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.970> right<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.120> know<00:02:03.300> I

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
might be the most important tool you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.240 
might be the most important tool you
have<00:02:09.450> its<00:02:10.170> most<00:02:10.380> important<00:02:10.740> for<00:02:10.860> training<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
have its most important for training and

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.650 
have its most important for training and
racing<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.730> know<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.910> know<00:02:12.210> what<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.540> do

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
racing you know you know what you can do

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.030 
racing you know you know what you can do
and<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.080> ride<00:02:13.230> within<00:02:13.410> your<00:02:13.560> limits<00:02:13.680> and

you know what the other guys can do and

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.790 
you know what the other guys can do and
so<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.690> know<00:02:15.720> then<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.440> comes<00:02:16.560> down<00:02:16.680> to

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
so you know then it comes down to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.410 
so you know then it comes down to
tactics<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.430> saving<00:02:17.640> your<00:02:17.730> energy<00:02:17.790> for<00:02:18.180> when
