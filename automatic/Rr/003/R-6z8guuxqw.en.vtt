00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:02.940
 odasso said jaeger mateos 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.200
 well before starting president greeted all the colleagues of the forum 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.210
 all types 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.449
 that by watching this 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.479
 and well this is after all just the trials I'm doing 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:14.759
 to use a 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.089
 gave double 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:17.640
 as sensors and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.759
 touch sensors proximity sensors 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.560
 then this matter is based on the fact that the widower can 

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:27.829
 behave in a certain way like a capacitor when you polarize it 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.130
 inversely 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.630
 and is able to accumulate a certain load 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.399
 that get it out is discharging little by little because it has a leakage current 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.480
 of cathode haddock still valued grounded 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.880
 that leakage current we can make it greater if faithful light 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.160
 about him 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.300
 while if there is no light on the month after that rapporteur is 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.180
 small 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.710
 the first rehearsals the vice count of this style that have eta his side 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.820
 epoxy 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.690
 painted 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.270
 in colors in red 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.620
 green john after the ones he had on hand 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.060
 and well I did not have very good results being this phenomenon as you can 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.490
 observe and you can measure 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.810
 but with very little resolution 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.900
 p act followed 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.530
 I went to try with matrices of this style 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.430
 here the result seems that it is better is much better 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.610
 percent that you do not get a better resolution 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.840
 but nevertheless with which better resolution 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.050
 a cigar had so far I can not prove 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.330
 they have been with milk like these they have in case it was completely deposited 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.540
 transparent 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.870
 in this case they are loose milk 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.040
 of high brightness good task are of average brightness 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.409
 Well, here I have a problem because it is because it turns out that it has a cone 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.420
 very narrow lighting are very directional and that for this 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.270
 application 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.540
 it favors us 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.870
 what I tried to simulate here because I did not have time for because a machi 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.490
 complete with them 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.350
 percent 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.670
 the state in which one of the reads is 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.040
 from the matrix it's as if you look at simulated julen from this matrix 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.350
 the disagreement is not that I'm interested is this one that is here in the center 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.110
 that covered with a cover to try to avoid being affected by the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.530
 residual lighting of the orb that has stay people 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.100
 what we are seeing here would be a row of the lérez that they are sharing 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.479
 your cato 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.839
 and the columns where they would be sharing their debts 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:20.939
 the procedure is to polarize inversely so that in such a way that 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.739
 they accumulate in a certain electrical charge 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.829
 immediately after we measure the load that is in your cato 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.129
 and that charge is diminishing as these other lethal agents reflect light 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.229
 on 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.569
 votes this would be a bit the matter 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.899
 p here a curious thing is that these cathodes 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.179
 but eastern Nestor are by columns 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:45.299
 in a commercial matrix of this one 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.449
 style they would be sharing their longings 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:52.849
 and those are the issues that most make me suspect that street experiments the 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.199
 ues on this matter 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:58.109
 he is not created using this type of matrices without other matrices 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.979
 fabricated 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.769
 exprofeso for this matter 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.769
 and later I will explain why you reached this conclusion 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.079
 As you can see, the assembly is very simple, we have a pillar 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.879
 which is the one that will control 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.929
 percent in dallas is only cathode account all this row 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:17.929
 and well this sotoles I can have permanently lit 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:23.269
 in fact the vcb connection but it's going to be serial type so then the 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.949
 computer we can see it sensitive so little sensitive and it's all this 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.409
 well I will not connect to see 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.949
 How does this work 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.949
 we connect agreement 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.939
 when connected 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.939
 I'm going to take the camera to vote for mejostilla 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:51.589
 If you look for a hundred, what is lit now, just read 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.119
 of the adjacent columns that I will have permanently nominated 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:04:01.339
 i apolo a lo of the central row at the end of which is the sensor 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:04.119
 that we are interested in this case is currently parana 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.689
 this is because the delphi program that you are waiting to do listed by the 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:08.399
 pp 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.699
 I'm going to run the pp program 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:11.620
 for what 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.539
 by the way it makes being in a veiled 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.659
 and then we will see 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.659
 we'll see 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.829
 by oars that are immediately understood so well 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.809
 that central row to which the sensor belongs 

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:26.610
 the defender in this case 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.889
 in theory, it is not permanently illuminated but uncovered by paying 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.559
 quickly alternating between lighting mode 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:34.229
 and the new census 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.740
 at a glance as you can see it is not observed at any kind of flicker the 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.259
 It is true that it is quite fast and this tomorrow I think that maybe it is 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:42.569
 can implement 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.770
 the magister majors I do not know if of eight by eight but with little more than one 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.189
 size maybe five by five 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:51.599
 it seems that it is possible to meet 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.219
 the operation of this one is the next I'm going to pay the light now 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.770
 because it's the best result you get 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.040
 so they can see it 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.319
 I'm going to replace the camera 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.319
 it also adds 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:08.110
 posey can see 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.719
 simultaneously 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.519
 but censor reads me a small application that created for the pc to 

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:14.749
 that we can see how 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:16.490
 how modest 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.490
 and what I'm going to do is turn off the light 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:25.779
 when turning off the light you can see that it is quite stable 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:29.710
 we came out of just this green column that we have right now here 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.389
 but nevertheless 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.779
 he approached me with his hand 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.779
 perfectly it is seen that it is quite sensitive 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:39.180
 However, there is a problem 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.930
 with this they are 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.400
 there are two problems in life 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.669
 one who, since he was here, as everyone has been able to do for the 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.840
 so many verticals and then the reflection us very uniform 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.509
 that would be the first problem and the second problem is that as they are so 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.639
 directional occurs next I low low low low and you see that the column goes 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:57.210
 going down 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.569
 and yet the moment 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.029
 because the reflection piece falling out 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:03.190
 of the descent and although it keeps going down 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.190
 the crown goes up 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:11.819
 percent and if we raise the blind to see how this works 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:14.999
 with your day 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:18.549
 finally not not too affected too, maybe there is a decrease 

00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:20.199
 in the dynamic range 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:23.460
 but that could compensate the mind is not not complex 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.229
 I'm currently using a four-bit resolution in conditions between 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.919
 them city could possibly go up to five or even six 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.589
 for an easy application neither the law 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:34.240
 application bush with 4 dic 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.400
 there are 16 positions I think enough 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.780
 works perfectly also with light as you can see right now not 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.039
 it reaches down 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:45.159
 because the calibration the fact that using the hand 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:46.150
 ponderó 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.210
 the fact to use the cards that allowed him area a little more than 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.050
 serious witness 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.550
 in the essays 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.319
 because it allowed us to perfectly position the position that should 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.409
 torrent with the card precisely 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:59.340
 yes that low 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.469
 until down they go up 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:05.669
 goes up low and here you see more clearly phenomenon that told them before he was going 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:06.899
 bringing the card closer 

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:09.749
 and yet system detects that it is moving away 

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:11.939
 that's because he knows very regional 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:14.939
 and the light that reflects no does not affect sex 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:18.710
 there they have it 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.719
 I just leave it here so you can see us 

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:23.909
 bearded entertaining 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:27.949
 When I owe you application, if you already have a maciel, you have some 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:30.219
 project because maybe it can give you a utility 

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:32.849
 the second utility or as a touch sensor 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:35.740
 or how this increased communication 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.940
 because of course this would allow us to implement the system 

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:42.889
 communication that devices against nuances 

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:46.740
 with which we could exchange information from one to another was not going to be 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.169
 a very fast transfer veto everything to transmit small 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.159
 information 

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:57.560
 that's all already the next essay that does what they are well-formed I hope 

00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:00.039
 that is something a little more attractive than this greetings to all
