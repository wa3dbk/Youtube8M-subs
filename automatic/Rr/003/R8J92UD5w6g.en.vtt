theories in so many different ways we
talked<00:03:45.780> about<00:03:45.930> how<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.170> do<00:03:46.350> it<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.280> kind

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
talked about how to do it that it kind

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.449 
talked about how to do it that it kind
of<00:03:47.610> gets<00:03:47.730> diluted<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.510> i<00:03:48.840> think<00:03:49.430> those<00:03:50.430> two

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
of gets diluted and i think those two

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.360 
of gets diluted and i think those two
things<00:03:50.700> really<00:03:51.269> impressed<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.110> 22<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:53.190> the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
things really impressed the 22 to the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.000 
things really impressed the 22 to the
few<00:03:53.820> ideas<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.180> are<00:03:54.590> extremely<00:03:55.590> important

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
few ideas that are extremely important

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.259 
few ideas that are extremely important
one<00:03:56.280> is<00:03:56.610> get<00:03:57.510> an<00:03:57.750> idea<00:03:58.709> of<00:03:58.799> what<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.340> want<00:03:59.370> what

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
one is get an idea of what you want what

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.810 
one is get an idea of what you want what
your<00:04:00.420> next<00:04:00.600> step<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.230> because<00:04:02.190> don't<00:04:02.430> think<00:04:02.670> of

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
your next step is because don't think of

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.509 
your next step is because don't think of
a<00:04:02.880> dream<00:04:03.209> house<00:04:03.480> like<00:04:04.010> that's<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.190> wrong<00:04:05.370> way

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
a dream house like that's the wrong way

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.039 
a dream house like that's the wrong way
to<00:04:05.579> do<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:05.970> because<00:04:06.060> it's<00:04:06.390> thats<00:04:06.600> limit

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
to do it because it's thats limit

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.660 
to do it because it's thats limit
yourself<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.440> one<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:08.100> you're<00:04:08.250> never<00:04:08.519> going

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
yourself to one and you're never going

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.979 
yourself to one and you're never going
to<00:04:08.700> move<00:04:08.880> from<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.150> house<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.660> this<00:04:09.720> and

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
to move from this house and this and

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.530 
to move from this house and this and
that<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.650> also<00:04:11.400> your<00:04:11.549> by<00:04:11.940> collecting

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
that and and also your by collecting

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.840 
that and and also your by collecting
ideas<00:04:12.660> all<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.050> time<00:04:13.140> and<00:04:13.440> saying

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
ideas all the time and saying

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.150 
ideas all the time and saying
maybe<00:04:14.360> I<00:04:14.450> want<00:04:14.660> that<00:04:14.780> too<00:04:15.020> you<00:04:15.920> never

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
maybe I want that too you never

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.540 
maybe I want that too you never
finalized<00:04:16.820> what<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:17.330> want<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:18.550> because

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:19.550 
finalized what you want and because

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.810 
finalized what you want and because
you're<00:04:19.730> in<00:04:19.880> that<00:04:20.000> vibrational<00:04:20.690> mode<00:04:20.930> of

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
you're in that vibrational mode of

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.530 
you're in that vibrational mode of
constantly<00:04:22.820> looking<00:04:23.090> for<00:04:23.300> little<00:04:23.420> things

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
constantly looking for little things

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.900 
constantly looking for little things
that<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:23.960> want<00:04:24.140> to<00:04:24.230> add<00:04:24.380> but<00:04:25.310> you're<00:04:25.430> also<00:04:25.640> at

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
that you want to add but you're also at

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.850 
that you want to add but you're also at
the<00:04:25.970> same<00:04:26.000> time<00:04:26.300> thinking<00:04:26.750> dream<00:04:27.320> house<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:27.830> a

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
the same time thinking dream house is a

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.700 
the same time thinking dream house is a
one<00:04:28.160> thing<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:29.180> are<00:04:29.720> never<00:04:30.020> in<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.290> process

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
one thing you are never in the process

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.330 
one thing you are never in the process
in<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.900> vibration<00:04:32.900> of<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.080> having<00:04:33.770> a<00:04:33.860> completed

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
in the vibration of a having a completed

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.340 
in the vibration of a having a completed
thing<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:34.790> so<00:04:35.390> it's<00:04:35.780> like<00:04:35.930> you<00:04:36.050> know<00:04:36.080> when<00:04:36.290> you

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
thing and so it's like you know when you

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.200 
thing and so it's like you know when you
have<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.740> when<00:04:37.370> your<00:04:37.490> manifest<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.090> you're

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
have that when your manifest and you're

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.610 
have that when your manifest and you're
trying<00:04:38.390> to<00:04:38.510> imagine<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:39.110> that<00:04:39.230> thing<00:04:39.440> is<00:04:39.470> on

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
trying to imagine that that thing is on

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.370 
trying to imagine that that thing is on
a<00:04:39.740> train<00:04:40.070> on<00:04:40.100> its<00:04:40.370> way<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.580> you<00:04:40.790> and<00:04:41.600> how<00:04:42.200> can

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
a train on its way to you and how can

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.780 
a train on its way to you and how can
they<00:04:42.470> send<00:04:42.680> you<00:04:42.770> that<00:04:42.950> thing<00:04:43.160> if<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:43.430> haven't

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
they send you that thing if you haven't

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.140 
they send you that thing if you haven't
finished<00:04:44.650> creating<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.920> in<00:04:45.950> your<00:04:46.100> mind<00:04:46.310> so<00:04:46.820> you

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
finished creating it in your mind so you

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.630 
finished creating it in your mind so you
know<00:04:47.680> you're<00:04:48.680> you're<00:04:48.980> never<00:04:49.220> going<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.430> get

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
know you're you're never going to get

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.070 
know you're you're never going to get
there<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:50.030> you're<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:50.870> other<00:04:51.050> thing<00:04:51.170> is

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
there and you're and the other thing is

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.270 
there and you're and the other thing is
gratitude<00:04:54.080> I<00:04:54.470> keep<00:04:54.620> forgetting<00:04:55.190> about

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
gratitude I keep forgetting about

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.240 
gratitude I keep forgetting about
gratitude<00:04:55.640> and<00:04:56.440> i'm<00:04:57.440> here<00:04:57.830> where<00:04:58.010> i<00:04:58.040> am<00:04:58.190> now

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
gratitude and i'm here where i am now

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.830 
gratitude and i'm here where i am now
thinking<00:04:58.760> like<00:04:59.030> i<00:04:59.120> got<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.360> get<00:04:59.480> out<00:04:59.600> of<00:04:59.690> here<00:04:59.780> i

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
thinking like i got to get out of here i

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.880 
thinking like i got to get out of here i
don't<00:05:00.050> like<00:05:00.170> this<00:05:00.290> place<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.710> so<00:05:00.800> i'm

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
don't like this place and so i'm

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.120 
don't like this place and so i'm
unsatisfied<00:05:01.250> all<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.820> time<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.560> thus<00:05:03.560> i<00:05:03.830> can

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
unsatisfied all the time and thus i can

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.440 
unsatisfied all the time and thus i can
never<00:05:04.310> attract<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:04.970> thing<00:05:05.180> that<00:05:05.330> will

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
never attract the thing that will

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.710 
never attract the thing that will
satisfy<00:05:05.600> me<00:05:06.170> so<00:05:06.700> I've<00:05:07.700> got<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.180> start<00:05:08.510> acting
