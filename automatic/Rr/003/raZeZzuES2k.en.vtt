00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and then it goes in there and you're

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.490 
and then it goes in there and you're
going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> place<00:00:48.629> about<00:00:50.030> 40<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:52.020> five

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
going to place about 40 know about five

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.750 
going to place about 40 know about five
to<00:00:54.020> six<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.039> work<00:00:56.190> right<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
to six just to get it to work right and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.910 
to six just to get it to work right and
it's<00:00:57.090> being<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> wrong<00:00:57.840> way<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.649> there's<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
it's being the wrong way so there's a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.430 
it's being the wrong way so there's a
lot<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.129> problems<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:01.109> mine

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
lot of problems with it but it's mine

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.340 
lot of problems with it but it's mine
co-op<00:01:01.710> booster<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:03.270> very<00:01:03.510> good<00:01:03.750> okay<00:01:04.290> so

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
co-op booster so it's very good okay so

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.370 
co-op booster so it's very good okay so
once<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.830> been<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> right<00:01:05.339> way<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:07.140> stop

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
once it's been in the right way you stop

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.929 
once it's been in the right way you stop
into<00:01:07.590> your<00:01:07.619> own<00:01:07.830> cart<00:01:08.450> and<00:01:09.450> go<00:01:09.630> all<00:01:09.780> across<00:01:10.130> and

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.130 

sometimes<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.119> doesn't<00:01:15.150> work<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.960> then

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
sometimes it doesn't work like just then

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.020 
sometimes it doesn't work like just then
you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.799> tell<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.280> reach<00:01:17.430> about<00:01:17.460> here

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
you can tell when you reach about here

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.179 
you can tell when you reach about here
that<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.509> hasn't<00:01:18.689> worked<00:01:20.270> but<00:01:21.270> then<00:01:22.189> so

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
that it hasn't worked but then so

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.899 
that it hasn't worked but then so
there's<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.729> lot<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:23.970> problems<00:01:24.450> with<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.810> but

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
there's a lot of problems with it but

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.819 
there's a lot of problems with it but
hopefully<00:01:26.909> i<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.150> get<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.710> just<00:01:28.710> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
hopefully i can get it to a just a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.880 
hopefully i can get it to a just a
really<00:01:29.159> nice<00:01:29.369> working<00:01:30.210> one<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.659> i<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:31.680> with

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
really nice working one but i think with

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.530 
really nice working one but i think with
this<00:01:32.100> design<00:01:32.640> there's<00:01:32.939> always<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.479> be

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
this design there's always going to be

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.830 
this design there's always going to be
problems<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.729> wow<00:01:35.729> I've<00:01:35.970> missed<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.360> twice

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
problems and wow I've missed it twice

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.660 
problems and wow I've missed it twice
this<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> first<00:01:38.250> time<00:01:38.400> that's<00:01:38.520> ever

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
this is the first time that's ever

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.520 
this is the first time that's ever
happened<00:01:39.090> I've<00:01:39.299> only<00:01:39.659> ever<00:01:39.810> missed<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.320> once

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
happened I've only ever missed it once

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.730 
happened I've only ever missed it once
so<00:01:41.509> not<00:01:42.509> too<00:01:42.659> much<00:01:42.780> luck<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.200> my<00:01:43.320> side<00:01:43.350> this

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so not too much luck on my side this

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.830 
so not too much luck on my side this
time<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:45.270> there<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.509> go<00:01:45.540> we've<00:01:46.140> hit<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:47.840> so

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
time and there we go we've hit it and so

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.160 
time and there we go we've hit it and so
it<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.850> boosts<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.390> want<00:01:51.600> minecraft

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
it just boosts you and I want minecraft

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.440 
it just boosts you and I want minecraft
one<00:01:52.619> point<00:01:52.890> know<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.369> any<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.000> guys<00:01:54.119> wanted

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
one point know if any of you guys wanted

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:04.250 
one point know if any of you guys wanted
to<00:01:54.479> know<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:57.439> so<00:01:58.759> or<00:02:00.290> balls

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.800 

so<00:02:05.190> I've<00:02:05.610> tried<00:02:05.970> this<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.150> few<00:02:06.330> times<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.720> there

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
so I've tried this a few times in there

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.219 
so I've tried this a few times in there
might<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.080> few<00:02:07.230> spare<00:02:07.620> minecart<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.490> but

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
might be a few spare minecart on it but

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.710 
might be a few spare minecart on it but
it<00:02:10.229> does<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.880> infinite<00:02:11.880> I've<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:12.480> made<00:02:12.660> a

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
it does go infinite I've just made a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.570 
it does go infinite I've just made a
full<00:02:12.960> track<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:13.710> goes<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.160> now<00:02:14.400> and

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
full track that just goes in now and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.770 
full track that just goes in now and
I've<00:02:14.760> had<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.000> make<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.270> render<00:02:15.630> distance

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
I've had to make the render distance

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.100 
I've had to make the render distance
tiny<00:02:16.530> because<00:02:17.210> my<00:02:18.210> computer<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:18.720> can't

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
tiny because my computer just can't

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.980 
tiny because my computer just can't
handle<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.680> my<00:02:20.160> rent<00:02:20.580> both<00:02:21.150> my<00:02:21.420> cores<00:02:21.660> are<00:02:21.900> on

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
handle it my rent both my cores are on

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.580 
handle it my rent both my cores are on
99<00:02:22.500> percent<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.630> your<00:02:24.630> bear<00:02:24.870> with<00:02:25.050> me<00:02:25.230> on<00:02:25.260> this

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
one and I'm making a full on my piston

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.170 
one and I'm making a full on my piston
redstone<00:02:30.800> minecart<00:02:31.800> world<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.850> I'm<00:02:32.970> just

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
redstone minecart world that I'm just

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.640 
redstone minecart world that I'm just
going<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.390> give<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.690> demonstrations<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.620> how

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
going to give you demonstrations on how

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.760 
going to give you demonstrations on how
to<00:02:34.830> work<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:38.690> so<00:02:39.690> I've<00:02:39.990> built<00:02:40.320> things<00:02:40.590> like

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
to work it and so I've built things like

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.990 
to work it and so I've built things like
Jeb<00:02:43.770> doors<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.460> know<00:02:44.550> what<00:02:44.670> they<00:02:44.790> I'll

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
Jeb doors if you know what they I'll

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.540 
Jeb doors if you know what they I'll
show<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.300> one<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:46.590> later<00:02:46.800> episodes<00:02:46.890> probably

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
show you one in later episodes probably

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.630 
show you one in later episodes probably
next<00:02:47.760> one<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.240> I'm<00:02:49.050> just<00:02:49.200> going<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.440> do<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:50.340> lot

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
next one and I'm just going to do a lot

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.630 
next one and I'm just going to do a lot
of<00:02:50.700> tutorials<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.750> how<00:02:51.960> to<00:02:51.990> do<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.350> how<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.370> do

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
of tutorials on how to do it how to do

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.730 
of tutorials on how to do it how to do
some<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.330> redstone<00:02:54.750> stuff<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:55.620> can

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
some of the redstone stuff that you can

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.160 
some of the redstone stuff that you can
see<00:02:55.920> right<00:02:55.950> here<00:02:56.400> I've<00:02:57.120> built<00:02:57.360> t<00:02:57.600> flip-flops

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
see right here I've built t flip-flops

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.310 
see right here I've built t flip-flops
and<00:02:58.590> stuff<00:02:58.860> ok<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:02.390> this<00:03:03.390> is<00:03:03.630> I'll<00:03:03.959> give<00:03:04.200> your

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
and stuff ok so this is I'll give your

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.120 
and stuff ok so this is I'll give your
nut<00:03:04.410> guys<00:03:04.590> another<00:03:04.830> look<00:03:05.040> at<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:07.130> minecart

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
nut guys another look at it the minecart

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.640 
nut guys another look at it the minecart
booster<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:11.900> believe<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.050> is<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.230> first

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
booster and I believe this is the first

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.350 
booster and I believe this is the first
one<00:03:13.830> that's<00:03:13.980> been<00:03:14.190> found<00:03:14.459> since<00:03:14.760> they<00:03:15.060> patched

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
one that's been found since they patched

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.900 
one that's been found since they patched
it<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:16.709> tell<00:03:17.160> me<00:03:17.190> from<00:03:17.459> them<00:03:17.610> not<00:03:18.180> right<00:03:18.450> but

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
it so tell me from them not right but

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.610 
it so tell me from them not right but
this<00:03:20.910> opens<00:03:21.330> up<00:03:21.420> another<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:22.200> lot<00:03:22.500> of

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
this opens up another a lot of

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.920 
this opens up another a lot of
opportunities<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:23.940> had<00:03:24.780> back<00:03:25.440> in<00:03:26.810> 1.7<00:03:27.810> i

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
opportunities like we had back in 1.7 i

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.110 
opportunities like we had back in 1.7 i
think<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.230> was<00:03:28.350> when<00:03:29.190> they<00:03:29.310> pass<00:03:29.850> maybe

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
think it was when they pass maybe

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.270 
think it was when they pass maybe
it<00:03:30.239> was<00:03:30.330> one<00:03:30.420> earlier<00:03:31.640> so<00:03:32.640> i<00:03:34.040> give<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.130> guys
