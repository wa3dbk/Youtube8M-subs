okay<00:00:02.650> well<00:00:03.220> let's<00:00:03.460> up<00:00:03.670> the<00:00:04.000> level<00:00:04.300> of

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.390 
okay well let's up the level of

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.970 
okay well let's up the level of
complexity<00:00:04.899> and<00:00:05.140> find<00:00:05.380> more<00:00:05.680> interesting

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:05.980 
complexity and find more interesting

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.520 
complexity and find more interesting
formulas<00:00:06.730> involving<00:00:06.910> exponents<00:00:07.630> so<00:00:08.350> here's

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
formulas involving exponents so here's

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.779 
formulas involving exponents so here's
the<00:00:08.650> next<00:00:08.799> one<00:00:08.950> I<00:00:08.980> want<00:00:09.160> us<00:00:09.219> to<00:00:09.250> take<00:00:09.400> a<00:00:09.460> look<00:00:09.639> at

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:09.789 
the next one I want us to take a look at

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.330 
the next one I want us to take a look at
let's<00:00:10.510> consider<00:00:10.840> X<00:00:11.170> to<00:00:11.379> the<00:00:11.500> fourth<00:00:11.799> raised<00:00:12.309> to

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
let's consider X to the fourth raised to

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.449 
let's consider X to the fourth raised to
the<00:00:12.760> third<00:00:12.969> power<00:00:13.110> what<00:00:14.110> does<00:00:14.320> that<00:00:14.350> mean<00:00:14.830> well

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459 
the third power what does that mean well

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.310 
the third power what does that mean well
if<00:00:15.699> we<00:00:15.820> think<00:00:16.029> about<00:00:16.209> it<00:00:16.510> it<00:00:16.660> means<00:00:16.900> that<00:00:17.260> I

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
if we think about it it means that I

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.150 
if we think about it it means that I
have<00:00:17.350> X<00:00:17.830> to<00:00:18.160> the<00:00:18.189> fourth<00:00:18.730> times<00:00:19.619> X<00:00:20.619> to<00:00:21.070> the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
have X to the fourth times X to the

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.359 
have X to the fourth times X to the
fourth<00:00:21.609> times<00:00:22.000> X<00:00:22.900> to<00:00:23.289> the<00:00:23.380> fourth<00:00:23.679> right<00:00:24.339> I

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
fourth times X to the fourth right I

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:25.800 
fourth times X to the fourth right I
have<00:00:24.550> X<00:00:24.759> to<00:00:24.880> the<00:00:24.999> fourth<00:00:25.330> and<00:00:25.630> being

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
have X to the fourth and being

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.290 
have X to the fourth and being
multiplied<00:00:26.169> by<00:00:26.199> itself<00:00:26.560> three<00:00:26.679> times<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:28.210> we

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
multiplied by itself three times but we

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.239 
multiplied by itself three times but we
know<00:00:28.480> what<00:00:28.720> to<00:00:28.839> do<00:00:28.960> now<00:00:29.169> since<00:00:29.769> we<00:00:29.890> have<00:00:30.099> the

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:30.249 
know what to do now since we have the

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.000 
know what to do now since we have the
same<00:00:30.460> base<00:00:30.699> and<00:00:30.880> are<00:00:30.970> multiplying<00:00:31.449> we<00:00:31.630> add<00:00:32.010> we

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
same base and are multiplying we add we

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.049 
same base and are multiplying we add we
add<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.879> exponents<00:00:34.750> and<00:00:34.870> so<00:00:35.440> I<00:00:35.469> see<00:00:35.739> X<00:00:36.059> raised

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
add the exponents and so I see X raised

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.490 
add the exponents and so I see X raised
to<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.449> 4<00:00:37.780> plus<00:00:38.410> 4<00:00:38.949> plus<00:00:39.430> 4<00:00:40.289> which<00:00:41.289> you'll

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
to the 4 plus 4 plus 4 which you'll

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.420 
to the 4 plus 4 plus 4 which you'll
notice<00:00:41.859> is<00:00:42.100> X<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.960> well<00:00:44.859> 4<00:00:45.430> times<00:00:45.730> 3<00:00:47.430> which

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
notice is X to the well 4 times 3 which

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.410 
notice is X to the well 4 times 3 which
equals<00:00:48.850> x<00:00:49.449> to<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:49.840> 12th<00:00:51.059> well<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.149> X<00:00:52.269> to<00:00:52.359> the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
equals x to the 12th well the X to the

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.580 
equals x to the 12th well the X to the
12th<00:00:52.690> is<00:00:52.780> the<00:00:52.899> answer<00:00:53.140> but<00:00:53.320> I'm<00:00:53.379> more

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
12th is the answer but I'm more

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.889 
12th is the answer but I'm more
interested<00:00:53.769> in<00:00:54.100> this<00:00:54.250> answer<00:00:54.550> here<00:00:55.030> because<00:00:55.870> I

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
interested in this answer here because I

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.590 
interested in this answer here because I
see<00:00:56.260> what<00:00:56.500> to<00:00:56.620> do<00:00:56.800> when<00:00:57.399> I<00:00:57.429> have<00:00:57.609> a<00:00:58.239> power

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
see what to do when I have a power

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.740 
see what to do when I have a power
raised<00:00:59.559> to<00:00:59.800> a<00:00:59.920> power<00:01:00.219> what<00:01:01.089> do<00:01:01.210> I<00:01:01.269> do<00:01:01.390> I

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
raised to a power what do I do I

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.979 
raised to a power what do I do I
multiply<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:03.100> powers<00:01:03.699> together<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.960> I

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
multiply the powers together so I

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.920 
multiply the powers together so I
multiply<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.620> 4<00:01:06.100> by<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.400> 3<00:01:06.790> and<00:01:07.060> I<00:01:07.210> get<00:01:07.450> 12

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
multiply the 4 by the 3 and I get 12

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.310 
multiply the 4 by the 3 and I get 12

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
equal a raise to the power M times n so

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.450 
equal a raise to the power M times n so
we<00:01:27.940> multiply<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.810> powers<00:01:29.410> when<00:01:30.130> in<00:01:30.280> fact

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
we multiply the powers when in fact

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.580 
we multiply the powers when in fact
we're<00:01:30.730> raising<00:01:30.970> one<00:01:31.600> power<00:01:31.900> to<00:01:32.260> another<00:01:32.470> power

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
we're raising one power to another power

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.620 
we're raising one power to another power
so<00:01:33.580> let's<00:01:33.700> try<00:01:34.270> this<00:01:35.850> with<00:01:36.850> this<00:01:37.120> little

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
so let's try this with this little

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.140 
so let's try this with this little
example<00:01:37.750> right<00:01:38.470> here

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.700 

so<00:01:43.720> let's<00:01:43.930> see<00:01:44.020> if<00:01:44.080> we<00:01:44.140> could<00:01:44.260> simplify<00:01:44.530> the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
so let's see if we could simplify the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.070 
so let's see if we could simplify the
expression<00:01:45.280> C<00:01:45.850> squared<00:01:46.300> all<00:01:46.600> cubed

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
expression C squared all cubed

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.640 
expression C squared all cubed
multiplied<00:01:47.830> by<00:01:48.010> C<00:01:48.370> to<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.730> fifth<00:01:48.940> squared

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
multiplied by C to the fifth squared

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.630 
multiplied by C to the fifth squared
well<00:01:50.650> what<00:01:50.770> I'm<00:01:50.860> going<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.010> do<00:01:51.160> here<00:01:51.370> is<00:01:51.460> deal

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
well what I'm going to do here is deal

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.980 
well what I'm going to do here is deal
with<00:01:51.760> the<00:01:51.850> parentheses<00:01:52.330> remember<00:01:52.630> orders<00:01:52.900> of

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
with the parentheses remember orders of

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.910 
with the parentheses remember orders of
operations<00:01:53.080> we're<00:01:53.530> gonna<00:01:53.620> deal<00:01:53.770> with<00:01:53.800> these

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
operations we're gonna deal with these

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.830 
operations we're gonna deal with these
parentheses<00:01:54.400> so<00:01:54.610> what<00:01:55.240> happens<00:01:55.510> here<00:01:55.570> well

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
parentheses so what happens here well

this term right here is going to be C to

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.220 
this term right here is going to be C to
the<00:01:59.710> and<00:01:59.980> I<00:02:00.280> can<00:02:00.460> use<00:02:00.640> this<00:02:00.820> fact<00:02:01.170> multiply<00:02:02.170> the

the and I can use this fact multiply the

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.890 
the and I can use this fact multiply the
2<00:02:02.500> by<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.740> 3<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:03.250> get<00:02:03.310> 6<00:02:04.140> times<00:02:06.090> C<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.420> again

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
2 by the 3 and I get 6 times C and again

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.690 
2 by the 3 and I get 6 times C and again
I<00:02:08.080> take<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.530> 5<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:08.950> multiply<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.310> by<00:02:09.430> the<00:02:09.490> 2

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
I take the 5 and multiply it by the 2

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.630 
I take the 5 and multiply it by the 2
and<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:09.910> get<00:02:10.060> 10<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:11.140> what<00:02:11.260> do<00:02:11.350> I<00:02:11.470> see<00:02:11.740> well<00:02:12.430> now<00:02:12.610> I

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
and I get 10 so what do I see well now I

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.460 
and I get 10 so what do I see well now I
can<00:02:12.880> use<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.120> other<00:02:13.210> property<00:02:13.660> we<00:02:13.780> saw<00:02:13.810> which

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
can use the other property we saw which

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.200 
can use the other property we saw which
is<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.680> have<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.980> same<00:02:15.280> base<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.000> I'm

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
is I have the same base and I'm

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.940 
is I have the same base and I'm
multiplying<00:02:16.570> what<00:02:17.260> do<00:02:17.380> i<00:02:17.410> do<00:02:17.530> do<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:17.770> multiply

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
multiplying what do i do do I multiply

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.650 
multiplying what do i do do I multiply
these<00:02:18.400> new<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:19.840> add<00:02:20.410> them<00:02:20.740> I've<00:02:21.250> got<00:02:21.310> 6<00:02:22.240> factors

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
these new I add them I've got 6 factors

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.100 
these new I add them I've got 6 factors
of<00:02:22.810> C<00:02:22.990> here<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.620> I've<00:02:24.400> got<00:02:24.460> 10<00:02:25.420> more<00:02:25.630> factors

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
of C here and I've got 10 more factors

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.810 
of C here and I've got 10 more factors
of<00:02:26.140> C<00:02:26.380> here<00:02:26.650> all<00:02:26.830> told<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.580> have<00:02:27.700> 16<00:02:28.180> factors<00:02:29.820> so

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
of C here all told I have 16 factors so

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.520 
of C here all told I have 16 factors so
I<00:02:30.850> add<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.330> 6<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.780> 10<00:02:31.990> and<00:02:32.140> this

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
I add the 6 and the 10 and this

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.390 
I add the 6 and the 10 and this
simplifies<00:02:32.800> down<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.250> C<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.450> 16th<00:02:35.400> pretty

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
simplifies down to C to the 16th pretty

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.230 
simplifies down to C to the 16th pretty
pretty<00:02:36.730> pretty<00:02:37.270> cool
