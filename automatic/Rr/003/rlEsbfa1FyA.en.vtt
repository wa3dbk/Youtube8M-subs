00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.490
 hello again my name is Alexey 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.929
 still in the usa in miami and in 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.220
 this episode would like to tell about 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:24.000
 car from the United States about the road and that's about 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.510
 we rented a parking lot 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.630
 I still don't know what the car is called 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.750
 brand but shurale very fast racing 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.579
 so about the road when I 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.399
 I was preparing for the trip I read a lot 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.899
 about america about roads to not all 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.420
 praised the roads here 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.070
 very good very wide at the very 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.870
 really only 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.469
 it's half really expensive 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.690
 many and they are very wide many interchanges 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.670
 without the traffic lights the roads just pour out 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.129
 concrete here is such a huge machine 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.120
 which is on rails that just pours 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.399
 concrete road and on the pillars of course 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.479
 true but the surface is not always 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.450
 good there are holes and potholes 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.400
 level differences are not something that of course 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.020
 roads in Russia between cities but let's say 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.130
 so not ideal in europe the road is much 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.500
 better also of course a big plus that in 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.320
 America have reached 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.229
 Parking thoughts are paid in all major 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.630
 cities parking fee to 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.890
 unload the city center from the cars you need 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.560
 use parking meters 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.250
 issued such a receipt which 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.220
 need to put under the windshield 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.710
 also paid some roads especially 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.299
 between cities here it is 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.460
 device car here can be seen 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.729
 will be on the windshield came under the clip 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.860
 it connects on the radio waves 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.479
 transferred to this car and then payment 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.549
 just come on a credit card then 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.120
 there is no need to slow down especially 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.460
 do not need to pay much 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.170
 cash take change also have 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.130
 separate gate for those who want 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.290
 pay in cash 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:09.650
 but you have to slow down for this by the way 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.300
 Speaking of gasoline in the United States inexpensive prices can 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.060
 compare with Russian hotel aqua 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.770
 the price per gallon is about 4 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.150
 liters but if lead per liter 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.840
 it turns out somewhere thirty to thirty five 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.090
 rubles liter 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.080
 Ie example as in Russia and cheaper 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.220
 than europe 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.420
 times in 3 it turns out so the Americans 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.550
 love to travel on their own 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.010
 hours from city to city 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.000
 making travels does not stop them 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.930
 the cost of gasoline 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.520
 because we will do the last thing 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.900
 I'll tell you about the car is a limitation 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.090
 road speeds 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.740
 state by state this is different with 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.650
 restrictions are usually 70 80 miles per hour this 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.560
 about 110 kilometers if translated 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.200
 on our metric system a lot 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.790
 worth the cops I didn't notice much 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.830
 surveillance cameras on highways 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.270
 but a lot of cops especially in 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.040
 those places where it is difficult to see them 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.780
 just worth the feeling waiting bye 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.090
 someone will accelerate because 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.800
 the machine is very powerful there is a click on 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.670
 the gas pedal accelerates very quickly 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.739
 few seconds 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.400
 literally up to a hundred kilometers per hour and 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.820
 therefore, it is imperative to comply 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.860
 speed limit try not to break 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.550
 Immediately large video by the way 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.880
 written by 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.950
 what will be his fine along the road 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.660
 marks put about this 100 200 300 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.280
 dollars speeding ticket 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:39.370
 if not of course this did not entail any 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.480
 significant loss of significant damage 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.420
 so even though the cars are powerful here 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.959
 they do not give them speed 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.959
 the rules
