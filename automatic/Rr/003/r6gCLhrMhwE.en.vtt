00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.230 
way we decide whether the change it is
once<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.140> established<00:01:58.469> drainage<00:01:59.430> we

once we have established drainage we

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.510 
once we have established drainage we
will<00:02:00.450> leave<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.380> 24<00:02:01.920> hours<00:02:02.340> and

this area with hoof testers if the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.949 
this area with hoof testers if the
drainage<00:02:11.310> has<00:02:11.520> stopped<00:02:11.910> we'll<00:02:12.420> manage<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
drainage has stopped we'll manage it

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.700 
drainage has stopped we'll manage it
with<00:02:13.140> an<00:02:13.230> annus

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
with an annus

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.220 
with an annus
take<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:14.070> 24<00:02:14.550> hours<00:02:14.910> if<00:02:15.270> it's<00:02:15.630> still<00:02:15.930> draining

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
take for 24 hours if it's still draining

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.650 
take for 24 hours if it's still draining
will<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:17.010> replace<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.820> poultice<00:02:18.210> for<00:02:18.270> another

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
will we replace the poultice for another

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.510 
will we replace the poultice for another
24<00:02:19.200> hours<00:02:19.230> okay<00:02:19.500> now<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:20.010> important<00:02:20.490> that

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
24 hours okay now it's important that

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.930 
24 hours okay now it's important that
the<00:02:20.700> poultice<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.210> hot<00:02:21.920> order<00:02:22.920> on<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.670> foot

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
the poultice is hot order on the foot

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.260 
the poultice is hot order on the foot
yes<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.690> because<00:02:25.140> hot<00:02:25.920> water<00:02:26.270> softens

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
yes it is is because hot water softens

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.590 
yes it is is because hot water softens
better<00:02:27.570> than<00:02:28.020> cold<00:02:28.830> water<00:02:28.950> obviously<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:30.000> one

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
better than cold water obviously and one

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.170 
better than cold water obviously and one
of<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> reasons<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:32.100> poultice<00:02:32.550> will<00:02:32.850> draw

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
of the reasons is the poultice will draw

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.720 
of the reasons is the poultice will draw
if<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.840> have<00:02:34.140> for<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:34.770> word<00:02:35.100> if<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.460> have

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
if you have for that word if you have

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.820 
if you have for that word if you have
drainage<00:02:36.090> established<00:02:36.750> but<00:02:37.200> one<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.620> main

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
drainage established but one of the main

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.410 
drainage established but one of the main
things<00:02:38.220> with<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.460> poultice<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.180> go<00:02:39.300> ahead

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
things with the poultice is to go ahead

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.780 
things with the poultice is to go ahead
and<00:02:39.780> soften<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.680> area<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.430> foot<00:02:41.670> in

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
there's two staple things I think that

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.290 
there's two staple things I think that
people<00:03:56.160> need<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.490> have<00:03:56.580> in<00:03:56.700> their<00:03:56.820> bond<00:03:57.030> which

people need to have in their bond which

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.870 
people need to have in their bond which
is<00:03:57.330> Vet<00:03:57.780> Wrap<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.260> corona<00:03:58.740> Ortman<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.760> know

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
is Vet Wrap and corona Ortman you know

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.460 
is Vet Wrap and corona Ortman you know

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
there's two things that I think any bond

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.920 
there's two things that I think any bond
should<00:04:05.310> have<00:04:05.400> grown<00:04:05.670> ointment<00:04:06.240> and<00:04:06.390> Vet<00:04:06.900> Wrap

bandage you'll see where it's cohesive
okay<00:06:32.100> it<00:06:32.430> goes<00:06:32.700> ahead<00:06:32.880> and<00:06:33.270> it<00:06:33.480> seals<00:06:34.290> itself

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
okay it goes ahead and it seals itself

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.610 
okay it goes ahead and it seals itself
and<00:06:35.130> then<00:06:35.729> on<00:06:35.910> the<00:06:36.030> bottom<00:06:36.510> of<00:06:36.660> this<00:06:36.810> we'll<00:06:37.320> put

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
and then on the bottom of this we'll put

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.279 
and then on the bottom of this we'll put
a<00:06:37.860> couple<00:06:38.400> roll<00:06:38.820> a<00:06:39.060> couple<00:06:39.450> strips<00:06:39.900> of<00:06:40.080> duct
