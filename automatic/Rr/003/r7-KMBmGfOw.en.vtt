of transportation means cars so there
was<00:00:18.210> an<00:00:18.330> obvious<00:00:18.510> connection<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:20.070> look<00:00:20.250> into

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
was an obvious connection we look into

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.420 
was an obvious connection we look into
the<00:00:20.670> design<00:00:21.030> of<00:00:21.060> golf<00:00:21.480> carts<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:24.920> was<00:00:25.920> very<00:00:25.980> much

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the design of golf carts I was very much

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.520 
the design of golf carts I was very much
carried<00:00:26.910> away<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.330> positively<00:00:27.930> surprised

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:28.530 
carried away and positively surprised

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.080 
carried away and positively surprised
about<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.070> amount<00:00:29.100> of<00:00:29.490> entries<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:30.060> received

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
about the amount of entries we received

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.619 
about the amount of entries we received
it<00:00:30.630> was<00:00:30.779> more<00:00:31.080> than<00:00:31.289> 400<00:00:32.129> with<00:00:32.699> all<00:00:32.969> sorts<00:00:33.329> of

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
it was more than 400 with all sorts of

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.869 
it was more than 400 with all sorts of
new<00:00:33.870> ideas<00:00:34.079> how<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.649> improve<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.280> idea<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
new ideas how to improve the idea of the

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.110 
new ideas how to improve the idea of the
golf<00:00:36.149> cart<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.070> somewhere<00:00:38.070> more<00:00:38.430> conceptual

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
golf cart and somewhere more conceptual

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.389 
golf cart and somewhere more conceptual
where<00:00:39.810> some<00:00:40.200> are<00:00:40.230> more<00:00:40.560> on<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.770> visual<00:00:41.130> side

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
where some are more on the visual side

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.520 
where some are more on the visual side
so<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.059> great<00:00:42.149> variety

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.760 

ideal<00:00:49.520> it<00:00:49.670> would<00:00:49.820> be<00:00:49.969> everything<00:00:50.239> from<00:00:50.770> air

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
ideal it would be everything from air

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.029 
ideal it would be everything from air
conditioning<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.960> refrigerator<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.379> music<00:00:54.829> or

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
conditioning to refrigerator to music or

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.759 
conditioning to refrigerator to music or
TV<00:00:56.140> that<00:00:57.140> would<00:00:57.320> be<00:00:57.530> very<00:00:57.800> luxurious<00:00:58.460> and

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
TV that would be very luxurious and

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.950 
TV that would be very luxurious and
obviously<00:01:00.769> you<00:01:01.760> know<00:01:01.879> battery-driven<00:01:02.420> if

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
obviously you know battery-driven if

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.200 
obviously you know battery-driven if
possible<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:03.769> it<00:01:04.070> wouldn't<00:01:04.339> make<00:01:04.430> much<00:01:04.489> noise

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.310 

first<00:01:08.210> thing<00:01:08.450> you've<00:01:08.570> got<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.750> add<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:09.080> a<00:01:09.110> golf

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
first thing you've got to add to a golf

first thing you've got to add to a golf

cart is a good sound system you've got

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.060 
cart is a good sound system you've got
to<00:01:12.110> have<00:01:12.200> music<00:01:12.619> when<00:01:12.799> you're<00:01:12.920> out<00:01:13.040> there

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
to have music when you're out there

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.580 
to have music when you're out there
playing<00:01:13.280> it's<00:01:14.240> good<00:01:14.390> for<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.630> rhythm<00:01:17.590> my

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
playing it's good for the rhythm my

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.040 
playing it's good for the rhythm my
perfect<00:01:19.130> golf<00:01:19.460> cart<00:01:19.790> or<00:01:20.060> them<00:01:20.240> definitely

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
perfect golf cart or them definitely

have a Mercedes styling and a lot of
horsepower<00:01:23.119> like<00:01:23.509> amg's<00:01:24.080> yeah<00:01:24.740> it's<00:01:24.890> got<00:01:25.009> to

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
horsepower like amg's yeah it's got to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.210 
horsepower like amg's yeah it's got to
be<00:01:25.190> fast<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:26.440> think<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.500> button<00:01:27.860> where<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.009> can

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
be fast I think a button where you can

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.620 
be fast I think a button where you can
go<00:01:28.369> where<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:28.759> can<00:01:28.880> lift<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.149> up<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.450> down

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
go where you can lift it up and down

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.180 
go where you can lift it up and down
that<00:01:29.899> would<00:01:30.020> be<00:01:30.110> cool<00:01:30.289> as<00:01:30.409> well<00:01:30.590> it's<00:01:30.920> got<00:01:31.100> to

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
that would be cool as well it's got to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.490 
that would be cool as well it's got to
be<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.670> nice<00:01:32.360> temperature<00:01:32.869> in<00:01:32.990> there<00:01:33.140> not<00:01:33.350> too

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
be a nice temperature in there not too

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.790 
be a nice temperature in there not too
hot<00:01:33.679> not<00:01:33.710> too<00:01:34.009> cold<00:01:34.210> with<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.240> sports<00:01:35.600> button<00:01:36.050> so

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
hot not too cold with a sports button so

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.430 
hot not too cold with a sports button so
we<00:01:36.830> go<00:01:37.069> from<00:01:37.310> zero<00:01:37.580> to<00:01:37.610> 100<00:01:38.060> in<00:01:38.119> like<00:01:38.440> three

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
we go from zero to 100 in like three

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.880 
we go from zero to 100 in like three
seconds<00:01:40.210> yeah<00:01:41.210> that's<00:01:41.479> my<00:01:41.659> dream<00:01:41.840> card

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
seconds yeah that's my dream card

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.660 
seconds yeah that's my dream card
I<00:01:46.340> was<00:01:47.340> very<00:01:47.610> inspired<00:01:47.940> by<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.479> idea<00:01:48.600> of

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
I was very inspired by the idea of

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.180 
I was very inspired by the idea of
designing<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:51.450> golf<00:01:51.840> cart<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.530> giving<00:01:53.010> it<00:01:53.159> a

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
designing a golf cart and giving it a

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.600 
designing a golf cart and giving it a
new<00:01:53.610> shape<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.330> maybe<00:01:54.750> also<00:01:55.170> new<00:01:56.010> sorts<00:01:56.520> of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
new shape and maybe also new sorts of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.790 
new shape and maybe also new sorts of
means

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.130 

well<00:02:01.370> I<00:02:01.400> know<00:02:01.580> golf<00:02:02.000> cars<00:02:02.240> how<00:02:02.420> they<00:02:02.630> are<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:02.990> I

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
well I know golf cars how they are and I

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.170 
well I know golf cars how they are and I
know<00:02:03.170> how<00:02:03.530> our<00:02:03.740> vehicles<00:02:04.280> are<00:02:04.490> so<00:02:04.790> there's

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
know how our vehicles are so there's

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.060 
know how our vehicles are so there's
certainly<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.720> big<00:02:05.990> gap<00:02:06.230> between<00:02:06.260> these<00:02:06.860> two

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
certainly a big gap between these two

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.100 
certainly a big gap between these two
worlds<00:02:07.100> so<00:02:07.670> we<00:02:08.180> want<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.390> give<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.660> more<00:02:08.810> shape

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
worlds so we want to give it more shape

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.320 
worlds so we want to give it more shape
we<00:02:09.260> want<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.530> give<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.740> more<00:02:09.890> meaning<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.550> we

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
we want to give it more meaning and we

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.300 
we want to give it more meaning and we
want<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.570> give<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.780> more<00:02:12.110> design<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.950> know<00:02:12.980> and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
want to give it more design you know and

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.790 
want to give it more design you know and
I<00:02:13.400> think<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:14.360> deserves<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.200> if<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.530> look<00:02:15.650> at

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
I think it deserves that if you look at

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.740
