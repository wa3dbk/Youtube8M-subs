00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
one question that I get asked all the

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.650 
one question that I get asked all the
time<00:00:02.730> is<00:00:03.290> how<00:00:04.290> come<00:00:04.710> my<00:00:05.279> photos<00:00:05.850> print<00:00:06.509> out<00:00:06.629> a

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
time is how come my photos print out a

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.540 
time is how come my photos print out a
little<00:00:06.990> darker<00:00:07.440> than<00:00:07.470> they<00:00:07.830> look<00:00:08.069> on<00:00:08.280> the

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
little darker than they look on the

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.820 
little darker than they look on the
screen<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:10.200> simple<00:00:10.620> answer<00:00:11.040> for<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.280> is

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
screen and the simple answer for that is

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.010 
screen and the simple answer for that is
we<00:00:13.830> have<00:00:14.009> these<00:00:14.099> beautiful<00:00:15.020> computer

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
we have these beautiful computer

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.800 
we have these beautiful computer
monitors<00:00:16.560> now<00:00:16.740> these<00:00:16.980> LED<00:00:17.580> backlit<00:00:18.270> monitors

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
monitors now these LED backlit monitors

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.590 
monitors now these LED backlit monitors
so<00:00:19.380> basically<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:20.100> we're<00:00:20.250> seeing<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.789> being

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
so basically what we're seeing is being

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.330 
so basically what we're seeing is being
a<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:22.050> photo<00:00:22.350> we're<00:00:22.560> seeing<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:22.920> screen<00:00:23.070> is

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
a that photo we're seeing on screen is

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.759 
a that photo we're seeing on screen is
being<00:00:23.519> illuminated<00:00:24.080> by<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.380> light<00:00:25.740> source

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
being illuminated by a light source

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.620 
being illuminated by a light source
there's<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.609> beautiful<00:00:27.240> light<00:00:27.390> source

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
there's this beautiful light source

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.279 
there's this beautiful light source
behind<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.590> our<00:00:28.740> photos<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:29.279> naturally<00:00:30.289> they

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
behind so our photos are naturally they

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.900 
behind so our photos are naturally they
just<00:00:31.470> look<00:00:31.619> amazing<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.309> bright<00:00:32.610> and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
just look amazing and bright and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.180 
just look amazing and bright and
beautiful<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.840> when<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.500> print<00:00:34.829> an<00:00:34.920> actually

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
beautiful but when you print an actually

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.790 
beautiful but when you print an actually
on<00:00:35.280> paper<00:00:35.550> paper<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.540> opaque<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.680> know

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
on paper paper is opaque you know

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.130 
on paper paper is opaque you know
there's<00:00:38.040> no<00:00:38.219> light<00:00:38.550> source<00:00:38.850> right<00:00:39.270> behind<00:00:39.840> it

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
there's no light source right behind it

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.930 
there's no light source right behind it
sort<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.590> help<00:00:40.800> brighten<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.399> image<00:00:41.700> up

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
sort of to help brighten that image up

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.069 
sort of to help brighten that image up
so<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> lot<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.989> times<00:00:43.200> our<00:00:44.149> prints<00:00:45.149> will<00:00:45.450> print

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
so a lot of times our prints will print

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.290 
so a lot of times our prints will print
out<00:00:46.170> slightly<00:00:46.980> darker<00:00:47.399> than<00:00:47.579> they<00:00:47.940> would<00:00:48.149> on

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
out slightly darker than they would on

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.500 
out slightly darker than they would on

calibrate your screen and your actual

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.880 
calibrate your screen and your actual
printer<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.390> your<00:01:15.869> printer<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.560> sort<00:01:16.830> of

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
printer so if your printer is sort of

printer so if your printer is sort of
adjusting<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.240> photo<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.810> lacking

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
adjusting if the photo is lacking

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.950 
adjusting if the photo is lacking
contrast<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.250> add<00:01:20.430> contrast<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.360> if

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
contrast you can add contrast here if

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.270 
contrast you can add contrast here if
it's<00:01:22.110> lacking<00:01:22.320> brightness<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.159> add

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it's lacking brightness you can add

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.520 
it's lacking brightness you can add
brightness<00:01:23.580> etc<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.259> helpful

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
brightness etc so this is helpful

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.830 
brightness etc so this is helpful
because<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.580> past<00:01:26.790> people<00:01:27.210> would

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
because in the past people would

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.890 
because in the past people would
basically<00:01:28.610> have<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.729> go<00:01:29.820> into<00:01:30.060> their<00:01:30.360> develop

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
basically have to go into their develop

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.380 
basically have to go into their develop
module<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.220> know<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:33.030> don't<00:01:33.180> want<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
module and you know you don't want to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.450 
module and you know you don't want to
have<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.720> make<00:01:33.990> two<00:01:34.290> different<00:01:34.439> versions<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
have to make two different versions of a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.780 
have to make two different versions of a
final<00:01:36.000> image<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.650> want<00:01:37.860> basically<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
final image you just want basically to

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.910 
final image you just want basically to
have<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:39.270> image<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.140> looks<00:01:40.320> awesome<00:01:40.500> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
have one image that looks awesome and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.219 
have one image that looks awesome and
then<00:01:41.310> now<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.850> case<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.420> can<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.049> in

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
then now in this case you can just in

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.270 
then now in this case you can just in
the<00:01:43.259> print<00:01:43.590> module<00:01:43.740> when<00:01:44.040> you're<00:01:44.159> actually

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the print module when you're actually

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.100 
the print module when you're actually
making<00:01:44.430> your<00:01:44.850> print<00:01:45.149> make<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> adjustment

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
making your print make the adjustment

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.069 
making your print make the adjustment
but<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.590> has<00:01:46.710> no<00:01:46.950> effect<00:01:46.979> over<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.079> actual

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
but it has no effect over the actual

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.200 
but it has no effect over the actual
develop<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.890> edit<00:01:50.549> settings<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.180> have

develop and edit settings that you have

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.600 
develop and edit settings that you have

in the develop module so there's a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.399 
in the develop module so there's a
little<00:01:53.820> quick<00:01:54.060> tidbit<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.689> how<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.380> help
