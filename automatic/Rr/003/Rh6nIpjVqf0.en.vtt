I like to be able to enjoy the game
instead<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.619> just<00:00:17.359> you<00:00:18.359> know<00:00:18.529> ranting<00:00:19.529> myself

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
instead of just you know ranting myself

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.519 
instead of just you know ranting myself
over<00:00:20.189> every<00:00:20.430> single<00:00:20.699> thing<00:00:20.730> they<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.660> if

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
over every single thing they have and if

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.220 
over every single thing they have and if
it's<00:00:22.710> there<00:00:22.949> why<00:00:23.130> not<00:00:23.160> right<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.660> key<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
it's there why not right it's a key and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.560 
it's there why not right it's a key and
I<00:00:25.769> guess<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.519> should<00:00:26.699> use<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.359> guys

I guess we should use it so you guys

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.120 
I guess we should use it so you guys
know<00:00:27.810> how<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:27.960> get<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.289> your<00:00:28.320> technique<00:00:28.769> folder

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
come on TP to the port enable yes so you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.649 
come on TP to the port enable yes so you
changed<00:01:25.049> from<00:01:25.200> zero<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.740> one<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:27.030> all<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.479> is

not scared of doing this is because with

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.020 
not scared of doing this is because with
computer<00:01:49.470> craft<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.070> need<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.340> enable<00:01:50.610> like
