 welcome to the table 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.420
 good morning gianfranco volpez former student 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.300
 and a full professor now 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.640
 of the Ipsar of mine and of the spar that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.440
 the month of February continues with this one 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.900
 very special week because you 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.969
 you have already prepared this week 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.559
 we dedicate the perfect funds then 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.370
 let's start with the first one today 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:58.020
 fontina valdostana fondue and ingredients 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:01.140
 fontina dop butter stale egg yolks 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.110
 we take black truffle from the world 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.309
 of the fontina dop 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.259
 obviously we peel it first 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.289
 we cut into cubes and put it in one 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:13.350
 separate bowl with a little milk is 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.810
 important that this rest phase with 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.729
 the milk lasts at least 5 or 6 hours 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.399
 I'll show you also in the two terrins 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.840
 and the product has just cut and the 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.840
 product that was a remittance and marie 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.209
 born last night then about 12 hours ago 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.780
 then we put a bit of 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:32.429
 butter in fondue carolina 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.830
 then add the cheese and milk 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.599
 which in the meantime has softened and not 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.810
 let the hard cooking melt 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:43.280
 about fifteen minutes is 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.989
 important that the cooking temperature 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.550
 is rather low we prepare gods 

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:51.340
 bread croutons removing it 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.440
 the bread crust by cutting it into cubes 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.960
 and going over the pan with a little 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.040
 butter until it takes a right one 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.990
 golden color 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.150
 now let's go to the final stage 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.940
 of the dish then we have ours 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:09.540
 toasted grottos that we go to 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.540
 disappoint in the two service kittens ok 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.610
 this is the classic recipe 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.910
 we can simply change the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.010
 flavor of panacea take it whole or 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.480
 the perfect fondue card in the meantime 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.640
 has melted center which grump but 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.770
 maybe we are too chance 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:33.460
 we add I am answered, I do not padova 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.440

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:02.020
 very little is obviously the failure is done 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.989
