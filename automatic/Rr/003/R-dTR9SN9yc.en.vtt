00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
textures these will both go into ultra

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.219

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
look what it looks like let's wait for

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.669 
look what it looks like let's wait for
the<00:02:08.369> game<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> pop<00:02:08.849> up<00:02:09.000> there<00:02:09.300> we<00:02:09.420> go<00:02:09.619> these<00:02:10.619> are

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
the game to pop up there we go these are

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.750

this<00:02:32.380> for<00:02:32.950> this<00:02:33.040> video<00:02:33.340> just<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:33.730> people<00:02:34.060> can

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
this for this video just so people can

setting this to high can result in

setting this to high can result in
problems<00:02:43.300> set<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.680> just<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.070> buffer<00:02:45.460> two

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670

frames<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:47.320> prefer<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.070> look<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:49.800> TxAA<00:02:50.800> times

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.660 
frames I prefer the look of TxAA times
two<00:02:52.110> but<00:02:53.110> it'll<00:02:53.560> knock<00:02:53.860> your<00:02:54.070> frames<00:02:54.400> per

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
two but it'll knock your frames per

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.770 
two but it'll knock your frames per
second<00:02:55.090> by<00:02:55.270> about<00:02:55.810> 3<00:02:56.170> or<00:02:56.200> 4<00:02:56.320> frames<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:58.480> for

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
second by about 3 or 4 frames so for

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.840 
second by about 3 or 4 frames so for
this<00:02:58.900> video<00:02:59.080> I'm<00:02:59.380> just<00:02:59.530> gonna<00:02:59.650> use<00:03:00.340> temporal

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
this video I'm just gonna use temporal

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.610

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
and ultra textures are fine there's not

possible<00:03:14.260> it's<00:03:14.440> just<00:03:14.770> to<00:03:15.930> stutter<00:03:16.930> II

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
possible it's just to stutter II

ultra shader high now let's have a look
what<00:03:45.610> it<00:03:45.730> looks<00:03:45.970> like<00:03:46.120> in<00:03:46.390> game<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:48.459> let<00:03:48.580> us

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
what it looks like in game so let us

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.080 
what it looks like in game so let us
have<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:48.970> drive<00:03:49.300> around

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
using to record does seem to be

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.300 
using to record does seem to be

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
affecting my frames per second slightly

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.199 
affecting my frames per second slightly
but<00:03:57.640> not<00:03:57.670> too<00:03:58.360> much<00:03:59.370> but<00:04:00.370> but<00:04:00.970> what's

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
but not too much but but what's

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.330

important sure is of course the
stuttering<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.680> let's<00:04:05.860> go<00:04:06.040> have<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.280> look<00:04:06.430> in

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
stuttering so let's go have a look in

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.360 
stuttering so let's go have a look in
the<00:04:06.610> city<00:04:08.760> now<00:04:10.260> not<00:04:11.260> very<00:04:11.500> cleverly<00:04:11.890> I've<00:04:12.100> made

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
the city now not very cleverly I've made

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.770

my push-to-talk button

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.410 
my push-to-talk button
caps<00:04:14.200> lock<00:04:14.530> so<00:04:14.740> it's<00:04:14.920> quite<00:04:15.250> tricky<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:16.030> drive

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420
