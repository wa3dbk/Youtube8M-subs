called a heartbeat and you could say

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.200 
called a heartbeat and you could say
this<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.740> this<00:00:13.740> rhythm<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.219> foundation<00:00:15.030> of

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
this is this rhythm is the foundation of

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.680 
this is this rhythm is the foundation of
many<00:00:16.170> many<00:00:17.000> traditional<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.119> celebration

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
many many traditional and celebration

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.220 
many many traditional and celebration
rhythms<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.260> Africa<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.630> when<00:00:21.630> when<00:00:21.990> they

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
rhythms in Africa and when when they

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.990 
rhythms in Africa and when when they
play<00:00:22.699> rhythms<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> drum<00:00:24.359> they<00:00:24.689> also<00:00:26.000> they

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
play rhythms on the drum they also they

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.790 
play rhythms on the drum they also they
also<00:00:27.180> when<00:00:27.630> they're<00:00:27.810> learning<00:00:27.990> they<00:00:28.380> can

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
also when they're learning they can

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.700 
also when they're learning they can
pronounce<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.580> vocally<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:30.990> example<00:00:31.439> each

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
pronounce it vocally so for example each

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.760 
pronounce it vocally so for example each
each<00:00:32.460> stripe<00:00:32.940> has<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> syllable<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.260> friends

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
each stripe has a syllable as friends

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.160 
each stripe has a syllable as friends
and<00:00:35.360> so<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.840> bass<00:00:37.739> note<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.670> Jambi<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.300> is

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
and so the bass note on the Jambi is is

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.740 
and so the bass note on the Jambi is is
known<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:40.920> go<00:00:41.340> there's<00:00:41.910> many<00:00:42.149> different<00:00:42.360> words

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
known as go there's many different words

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.720 
known as go there's many different words
use<00:00:43.200> depending<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> teachers<00:00:44.460> teaching

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
use depending on the teachers teaching

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
use depending on the teachers teaching
but<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.329> way<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.719> taught<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> bass<00:00:46.500> is

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
but the way I was taught as the bass is

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.840 
but the way I was taught as the bass is
gone<00:00:47.640> sometimes<00:00:48.480> boom<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.350> used<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.980> then<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
gone sometimes boom is used and then the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.189 
gone sometimes boom is used and then the
rim<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.899> right<00:00:52.890> hand<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.370> cut<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.600> left<00:00:54.899> hand

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
rim and right hand is cut and left hand

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.580 
rim and right hand is cut and left hand
is<00:00:55.410> done<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.370> car<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.059> duck<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.750> sometimes

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
is done so car and duck and sometimes

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.639 
is done so car and duck and sometimes
it's<00:00:58.859> go<00:00:59.789> under<00:01:00.270> depending<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> teachers

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
it's go under depending on the teachers

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.570 
it's go under depending on the teachers
so<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:03.480> heartbeat<00:01:03.960> very<00:01:04.260> simply<00:01:04.799> goes

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so the heartbeat very simply goes

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.450 
so the heartbeat very simply goes
Gong<00:01:06.420> Gong<00:01:08.270> Gong<00:01:09.270> Gong<00:01:09.979> that<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.250> you're

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
Gong Gong Gong Gong that and you're

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.420 
Gong Gong Gong Gong that and you're
starting<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:11.939> your<00:01:12.360> right<00:01:12.659> hand<00:01:13.400> on<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
bass and when you're playing the bass

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.490 
bass and when you're playing the bass
note<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.950> basically<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:18.060> want<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.540> press<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
drum so you get that deep tone so this

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:38.070 
drum so you get that deep tone so this
rhythm<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.590> heartbeat<00:01:26.009> very<00:01:26.340> simply<00:01:26.790> goes

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.090 

a<00:01:39.460> variation<00:01:40.460> of<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.730> heartbeat<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:42.100> there

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
a variation of the heartbeat and there

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.770 
a variation of the heartbeat and there
are<00:01:43.220> many<00:01:43.400> variations<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.450> heartbeat

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
are many variations to the heartbeat

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.550 
are many variations to the heartbeat
some<00:01:45.790> some<00:01:46.790> happy<00:01:47.479> rhythms<00:01:47.720> start<00:01:48.229> actually

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
some some happy rhythms start actually

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:57.660 
some some happy rhythms start actually
on<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.100> rim<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:49.490> we'll<00:01:49.790> actually<00:01:50.000> go<00:01:50.650> go<00:01:51.650> go<00:01:52.570> go

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.160 

and<00:01:59.650> there's<00:02:00.650> also<00:02:00.890> variation<00:02:01.720> whereby<00:02:02.720> the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
and there's also variation whereby the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.969 
and there's also variation whereby the
second<00:02:03.890> Gong<00:02:04.670> Gong<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.119> played<00:02:05.869> quicker<00:02:06.530> so

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
second Gong Gong is played quicker so

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.219 
second Gong Gong is played quicker so
quicker<00:02:07.369> concession<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.509> sounds<00:02:08.989> like

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
quicker concession and it sounds like

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:37.959 
quicker concession and it sounds like
this<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.880> that's<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.510> heartbeat
