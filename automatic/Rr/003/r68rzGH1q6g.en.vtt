 If you want to see how to make these spheres 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.529
 and then make the great lamp 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.059

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.210
 less of this one also and more to do 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.150
 our spheres what I 'm going to do 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.949
 is to ink how is our merchant 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.540
 that can be raw or you can 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.550
 put color to the amount that you 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.710
 you need for each ball and what you can 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:08.470
 use are ink for acrylic paint 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:11.530
 or vegetable paint as the pastures the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.880
 candid and here you get me you fixed as 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.770
 then then I start it to take the 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.660
 background color that took away more and I 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.520
 nothing more global is that he let him continue 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.800
 how to bathe and how long I have it 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.720
 to leave at 10-15 minutes and the time and 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.229
 with the keel but and the subject 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.390
 and good here is the balloon and tell me 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.550
 Your family is also the same, they are not 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.039
 whose vegans but they have incorporated 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.650
 much more fruit and vegetables your diet 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:39.140
 they no longer eat processed food 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.120
 and already eat more healthy it becomes like 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.290
 a more way of life is not exactly 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.270
 something very nice that's why I 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.290
 love everything natural and I love 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.920
 to be outside 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.960
 but it does not have to be all of the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.760
 overnight has changed that can 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.980
 be a process and without wanting to 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.250
 you start eating healthier 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.760
 look look at the water and then if now 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.920
 for example of being the guardians here 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.110
 there are piñatas with the date 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.179
 never says sir this does as a 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.770
 piñata although with paste or 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.660
 just glue things on 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.020
 white school dilutes it a little bit and 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.240
 gives you is nothing else is you put a little bit and 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.880
 you start that white color is going to see 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.530
 clear gift what is really transparent and 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.910
 well let's do about two million 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.130
 more balls to decorate your patio 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.390
 is ready and there are some little eggs 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.390
 all sizes very well 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.170
 that beautiful 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:49.220
 and these days are drying these lists to 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.220
 bust them away the 3 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.330
 Y 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.610
 I hope some good and published as 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.110
 you wait all around here and now 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.070
 tibás and some shadows 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.110
 let's look at it, that's why I made this 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.520
 with the hole at the time I wrapped it 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.210
 I completely wrapped it around and 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.210
 then we can 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.760
 what do you think if we go in we can 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.110
 for the bamboo because I need a 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.850
 little bit of the university to be able 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.850
 do it to the perfect part let's go for sure 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.280
 we make the base for I put the wire 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.800
 because if you can do anything else, tie it 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.870
 the base is left for the guard to feel 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.110
 that is the most beautiful if it looks like 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.930
 force we are going to heal this era now 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.490
 follow our unam perfumes very bamboo and 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.890
 here nothing else puts square nature 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.800
 aborta chump ok that the shock that has 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.100
 is it is or is not this really you see 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.560
 on the roof in your house 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.660
 although now with our waits that 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.390
 We made this woman, we left her like this 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.310
 if this is the truth in the end it is removed 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.010
 of the rudder and everyone with whom we close 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.799
 lamp and we start with this purple cloth 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.780
 can you open your love give it a little 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.560
 if you need to fit exactly 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.560
 in perfect 

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:39.059
 we already have the body of our lamp 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:39.059
 ok let's see 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.200
 what are you going through what are we going to do is 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.900
 important do not stick up down some 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.150
 turns and put it towards the part of 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.730
 upstairs it happens a little bit is from and 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.220
 is isolating let's go around and you 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.740
 short and here nothing happens 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.660
 super sordid shakhtar and we have to 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.460
 Do exactly the same with 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.530
 unilaterial what I love is that 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:12.650
 apart they are super mexican 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:15.490
 I loved in its colors perhaps 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.490
 Europe 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.660
 It is not very rich but is in play 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.610
 this big one liter size 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.490
 and now what we have to do here is 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.180
 just put it and secure it in our 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.180
 base and ignite 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.620
 I loved 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.160
 I hope you liked the 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.979
