00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.160 
and I've actually purposely made this
with<00:02:08.039> all<00:02:08.310> different<00:02:08.759> ones<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.330> looks<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
with all different ones it looks the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.910 
with all different ones it looks the
same

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
same

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.830 
same
I'm<00:02:12.760> really<00:02:12.970> not<00:02:13.150> sure<00:02:13.360> why<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:13.690> called

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
I'm really not sure why it's called

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.540 
I'm really not sure why it's called
different<00:02:14.200> things<00:02:14.440> maybe<00:02:14.860> just<00:02:15.190> because<00:02:15.430> of

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
different things maybe just because of

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.100 
different things maybe just because of
the<00:02:15.610> method<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:16.060> how<00:02:16.270> you're<00:02:16.510> performing<00:02:16.840> it

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
the method of how you're performing it

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.710 
the method of how you're performing it
but<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.380> comes<00:02:17.590> out<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.950> same<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:18.849> this<00:02:19.540> one

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
but it comes out the same so this one

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.720 
but it comes out the same so this one
right<00:02:19.810> here<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.830> show<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.190> did<00:02:21.459> all

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
right here just to show you I did all

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.910 
right here just to show you I did all
the<00:02:22.300> flat<00:02:22.569> stitch<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.410> I'll<00:02:23.500> show<00:02:23.709> you<00:02:23.770> here

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
the flat stitch and I'll show you here

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.729 
the flat stitch and I'll show you here
in<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.069> moment<00:02:24.190> how<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.489> do<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:26.500> one

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
in a moment how to do that and this one

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.490 
in a moment how to do that and this one
I<00:02:27.040> knitted<00:02:27.520> using<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.420> U<00:02:28.600> it's<00:02:28.959> just<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.260> little

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
I knitted using the U it's just a little

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.390 
I knitted using the U it's just a little
bit<00:02:29.590> looser<00:02:30.780> it's<00:02:31.780> when<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.680> use<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.130> flat

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
bit looser it's when you use the flat

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.790 
bit looser it's when you use the flat
knit<00:02:33.610> stitch<00:02:33.880> sometimes<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.600> becomes<00:02:34.930> really

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
knit stitch sometimes it becomes really

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.740 
knit stitch sometimes it becomes really
really<00:02:35.980> tight<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.760> people<00:02:37.090> can<00:02:37.450> tend<00:02:37.690> to

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
really tight and people can tend to

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.650 
really tight and people can tend to
break<00:02:38.019> off<00:02:38.350> their<00:02:38.650> yarn<00:02:39.489> trying<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.239> go<00:02:40.330> over

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
break off their yarn trying to go over

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.089 
break off their yarn trying to go over
their<00:02:40.810> peg<00:02:41.110> because<00:02:41.440> they<00:02:41.530> got<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.769> too<00:02:41.890> tight

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
their peg because they got it too tight

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.520 
their peg because they got it too tight
so<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.489> U<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.910> popular<00:02:43.750> for<00:02:43.989> that<00:02:44.140> but<00:02:44.380> it's

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
so the U is popular for that but it's

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.040 
so the U is popular for that but it's
much<00:02:44.830> faster<00:02:45.100> to<00:02:45.370> do<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.819> that<00:02:45.940> way<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:46.810> right

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
much faster to do it that way this right

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.050 
much faster to do it that way this right
here<00:02:47.319> is<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.709> twisted<00:02:48.040> knit<00:02:48.190> stitch<00:02:48.489> or<00:02:48.760> also

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
here is the twisted knit stitch or also

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.350 
here is the twisted knit stitch or also
called<00:02:49.269> through<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.600> back<00:02:49.780> loop<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:52.120> you<00:02:52.180> can

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
called through the back loop so you can

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.780 
called through the back loop so you can
see<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.630> has<00:02:52.810> kind<00:02:53.049> of<00:02:53.110> another<00:02:53.519> sort<00:02:54.519> of<00:02:54.580> look

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
see it has kind of another sort of look

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.449 
see it has kind of another sort of look
to<00:02:54.819> it<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.299> it's<00:02:55.420> twisted<00:02:55.870> up<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.830> that's<00:02:57.220> just

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
to it and it's twisted up so that's just

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.559 
to it and it's twisted up so that's just
to<00:02:57.640> show<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:57.880> what<00:02:58.000> those<00:02:58.150> different<00:02:58.480> ones

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
to show you what those different ones

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.120 
to show you what those different ones
let<00:02:58.840> me<00:02:58.930> show<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.200> what<00:02:59.440> they<00:02:59.560> look<00:02:59.739> like<00:02:59.769> on

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
let me show you what they look like on

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.610 
let me show you what they look like on
the<00:03:00.280> loom<00:03:00.459> I've<00:03:01.390> already<00:03:01.780> cast<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.140> on<00:03:02.230> here

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
the loom I've already cast it on here

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.080 
the loom I've already cast it on here
but<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:02.799> wanted<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.069> show<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.370> what<00:03:03.700> these<00:03:03.880> look

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
but I wanted to show you what these look
