00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.560 
years was better than none the next
trial<00:00:34.559> was<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> trial<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.399> five<00:00:35.670> years<00:00:36.059> versus

two years and five years turned out to
be<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> better<00:00:40.230> length<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.860> treatment<00:00:41.070> than<00:00:41.700> two

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
years the next trial they did was a

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.600 
years the next trial they did was a
trial<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.420> ten<00:00:45.720> years<00:00:45.750> versus<00:00:46.590> five<00:00:46.860> years<00:00:47.280> and

trial of ten years versus five years and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.110 
trial of ten years versus five years and
interestingly<00:00:48.390> ten<00:00:49.140> years<00:00:49.500> did<00:00:50.340> not<00:00:50.520> turn<00:00:50.940> out

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
interestingly ten years did not turn out

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.690 
interestingly ten years did not turn out
to<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.420> better<00:00:51.570> than<00:00:51.720> five<00:00:52.140> years<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
to be better than five years so the

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.490 
to be better than five years so the
standard<00:00:53.940> approach<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.870> point<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.260> time

standard approach at this point in time

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.389 
standard approach at this point in time
would<00:00:55.860> be<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.250> limit<00:00:56.840> tamoxifen<00:00:57.840> use<00:00:58.399> after

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
would be to limit tamoxifen use after

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.569 
would be to limit tamoxifen use after
primary<00:00:59.730> surgery<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.630> breast<00:01:00.750> cancer<00:01:01.579> 25

one can then ask the question whether

one can then ask the question whether
