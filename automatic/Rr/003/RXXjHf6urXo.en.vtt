were completely free and it also fixed

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.350 
were completely free and it also fixed
quite<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> lot<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.650> issues<00:00:23.060> most<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.239> these

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
quite a lot of issues most of these

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.909 
quite a lot of issues most of these
changes<00:00:24.599> are<00:00:24.840> pretty<00:00:25.140> straightforward<00:00:25.410> and

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
changes are pretty straightforward and

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.769 
changes are pretty straightforward and
easy<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.279> understand<00:00:26.759> but<00:00:27.359> that

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
easy to understand but that

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.870 
easy to understand but that
head-coaching<00:00:28.410> fix<00:00:28.679> seems<00:00:29.009> to<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.369> quite<00:00:29.849> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
head-coaching fix seems to have quite a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.060 
head-coaching fix seems to have quite a
big<00:00:30.089> part<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.419> the<00:00:30.539> community<00:00:30.660> confused<00:00:31.619> so

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
big part of the community confused so

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.549 
big part of the community confused so
since<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.879> see<00:00:33.030> an<00:00:33.120> endless<00:00:33.570> amount<00:00:33.720> of<00:00:34.050> posts

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
since I see an endless amount of posts

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.049 
since I see an endless amount of posts
on<00:00:34.710> battle<00:00:35.160> log<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.460> reddit<00:00:35.730> which<00:00:35.879> are

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
on battle log and reddit which are

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.819 
on battle log and reddit which are
filled<00:00:36.360> with<00:00:36.449> a<00:00:36.720> lot<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.900> false<00:00:37.230> informations

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
filled with a lot of false informations

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.040 
filled with a lot of false informations
and<00:00:37.980> misconceptions<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.970> decided<00:00:39.659> to<00:00:39.870> make<00:00:40.019> a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
and misconceptions I decided to make a

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.260 
and misconceptions I decided to make a
video<00:00:40.290> which<00:00:40.559> explains<00:00:40.710> what<00:00:41.190> exactly<00:00:41.270> thi'sl

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
video which explains what exactly thi'sl

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600 
video which explains what exactly thi'sl
a<00:00:42.390> changed<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.410> they<00:00:43.590> attempted<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.190> fix

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
a changed and what they attempted to fix

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.660 
a changed and what they attempted to fix
so<00:00:45.600> let's<00:00:45.930> start<00:00:46.230> at<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> beginning<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.460> is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
so let's start at the beginning what is

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.420 
so let's start at the beginning what is
that<00:00:47.940> head<00:00:48.270> glitching<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:49.559> my<00:00:49.829> visual<00:00:50.160> recoil

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that head glitching in my visual recoil

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.430 
that head glitching in my visual recoil
it's<00:00:50.910> all<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.210> your<00:00:51.329> head<00:00:51.539> video<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.140> showed<00:00:52.410> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
it's all in your head video I showed you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560 
it's all in your head video I showed you
that<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.129> bullets<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.760> fire<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.300> not

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
that the bullets that you fire do not

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.389 
that the bullets that you fire do not
come<00:00:54.870> out<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.289> barrel<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.649> your<00:00:55.859> weapon<00:00:56.219> as

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
come out of the barrel of your weapon as

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.139 
come out of the barrel of your weapon as
you<00:00:56.550> might<00:00:56.760> think

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you might think

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.720 
you might think
in<00:00:57.390> fact<00:00:58.170> they<00:00:58.410> originate<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.190> center<00:00:59.609> of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
in fact they originate in the center of

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.430 
in fact they originate in the center of
your<00:00:59.910> view<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.719> means<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.140> they<00:01:01.260> come

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
your view and that means that they come

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.049 
your view and that means that they come
out<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.859> eyes<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.219> your<00:01:02.370> soldier<00:01:02.760> model

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
out of the eyes of your soldier model

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.359 
out of the eyes of your soldier model
which<00:01:03.629> does<00:01:03.840> sound<00:01:04.170> quite<00:01:04.379> silly<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.039> to<00:01:05.250> be

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
which does sound quite silly but to be

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.550 
which does sound quite silly but to be
fair<00:01:05.610> most<00:01:06.149> first<00:01:06.509> person<00:01:06.960> shooters<00:01:07.380> work

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
fair most first person shooters work

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.130 
fair most first person shooters work
like<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.210> big<00:01:09.360> exceptions<00:01:09.929> are

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
like that one of the big exceptions are

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.440 
like that one of the big exceptions are
military<00:01:10.560> simulations<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.280> ARMA<00:01:11.820> where<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
military simulations like ARMA where the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.600 
military simulations like ARMA where the
projectile<00:01:13.110> actually<00:01:13.800> comes<00:01:14.070> out<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
projectile actually comes out of the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.020 
projectile actually comes out of the
barrel<00:01:14.759> of<00:01:14.940> your<00:01:15.030> gun<00:01:15.179> and<00:01:15.690> not<00:01:16.170> your<00:01:16.349> eyeballs

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
barrel of your gun and not your eyeballs

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.609 
barrel of your gun and not your eyeballs
so<00:01:18.030> what<00:01:18.300> this<00:01:18.390> means<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.899> the<00:01:19.410> player

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
so what this means is that the player

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.680 
so what this means is that the player
can<00:01:19.860> hide<00:01:20.099> behind<00:01:20.340> cover<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.060> only<00:01:21.360> expose

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
can hide behind cover and only expose

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.350 
can hide behind cover and only expose
his<00:01:21.929> eyes<00:01:22.170> since<00:01:23.160> the<00:01:23.490> bullets<00:01:23.940> come<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.209> of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
his eyes since the bullets come out of

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.699 
his eyes since the bullets come out of
the<00:01:24.479> center<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> his<00:01:25.020> view<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.410> not<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:25.709 
the center of his view and not the

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:27.499 
the center of his view and not the
barrel<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.099> his<00:01:26.220> gun<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.849> means<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.300> he<00:01:27.479> is

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
barrel of his gun this means that he is

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.930 
barrel of his gun this means that he is
able<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.989> shoot<00:01:28.200> over<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.800> object<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.429> hit

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
able to shoot over that object and hit

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.790 
able to shoot over that object and hit
other<00:01:30.179> players<00:01:30.599> that<00:01:30.780> he<00:01:30.899> can<00:01:31.080> see<00:01:31.289> from<00:01:31.560> top

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
other players that he can see from top

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.460 
other players that he can see from top
to<00:01:31.830> toe<00:01:32.039> while<00:01:32.970> he<00:01:33.179> is<00:01:33.330> very<00:01:33.599> hard<00:01:33.929> to<00:01:34.020> hit<00:01:34.259> as

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
to toe while he is very hard to hit as

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.350 
to toe while he is very hard to hit as
he<00:01:34.619> only<00:01:34.770> exposes<00:01:35.459> a<00:01:35.489> small<00:01:35.819> part<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.209> his

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
he only exposes a small part of his

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.080 
he only exposes a small part of his
player<00:01:36.599> model<00:01:36.989> so<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.190> learned<00:01:38.489> where<00:01:38.880> on

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
player model so if you learned where on

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.010 
player model so if you learned where on
the<00:01:39.209> map<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.509> had<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.840> perfect

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the map you had the perfect

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.260 
the map you had the perfect
headglitching<00:01:40.590> positions<00:01:41.280> then<00:01:41.819> you<00:01:42.090> could

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
headglitching positions then you could

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.479 
headglitching positions then you could
get<00:01:42.479> quite<00:01:42.780> an<00:01:42.989> advantage<00:01:43.319> but<00:01:44.099> not<00:01:44.280> just

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:44.489 
get quite an advantage but not just

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:46.339 
get quite an advantage but not just
depth<00:01:44.789> players<00:01:45.390> were<00:01:45.539> also<00:01:45.720> accused<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.319> be

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:46.349 
depth players were also accused to be

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:48.260 
depth players were also accused to be
hacking<00:01:46.890> because<00:01:47.310> from<00:01:47.489> the<00:01:47.640> perspective<00:01:48.149> of

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270

hit the player all I need to do now is

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.609 
hit the player all I need to do now is
make<00:02:02.910> one<00:02:03.209> little<00:02:03.539> step<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:04.080> then<00:02:04.289> I<00:02:04.379> will<00:02:04.500> hit

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
make one little step and then I will hit

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.880 
make one little step and then I will hit
him<00:02:04.679> just<00:02:04.860> fine<00:02:05.489> and<00:02:06.080> this<00:02:07.080> behavior<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.709> what

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
him just fine and this behavior is what

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.380 
him just fine and this behavior is what
confuses<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> lot<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.819> players<00:02:09.030> right<00:02:09.330> now

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
confuses a lot of players right now

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.390 
confuses a lot of players right now

because they are used to having the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.280 
because they are used to having the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
the bullet but it's also possible is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.180 
the bullet but it's also possible is
that<00:02:45.150> your<00:02:45.660> line<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.959> sight<00:02:45.989> intersects<00:02:46.739> two

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
that your line of sight intersects two

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.759 
that your line of sight intersects two

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.890 
like when about zero my gun at 180
meters<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.580> this<00:02:53.670> example<00:02:54.090> here<00:02:54.390> then<00:02:54.870> a

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
meters in this example here then a

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.690 
meters in this example here then a
projectile<00:02:55.560> will<00:02:55.739> hit<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.130> scent<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.489> my

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
projectile will hit the scent of my

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.979 
projectile will hit the scent of my
crosshair<00:02:57.239> at<00:02:57.420> 30<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.579> 180<00:02:59.579> meters<00:03:00.150> so

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
crosshair at 30 and 180 meters so

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.809 
crosshair at 30 and 180 meters so
spawning<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.590> bullet<00:03:01.890> inside<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.310> barrel

rather<00:03:03.150> than<00:03:03.360> your<00:03:03.480> eyes<00:03:03.660> means<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.470> you

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
rather than your eyes means that you

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.039 
rather than your eyes means that you

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
might be able to look over an object but

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.470 
might be able to look over an object but
if<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.440> fire<00:03:07.650> shots<00:03:08.099> then<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.760> will<00:03:09.000> end<00:03:09.239> up

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
if you fire shots then it will end up

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.960 
if you fire shots then it will end up
inside<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.319> object<00:03:10.440> as<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.310> directly<00:03:11.760> in

front of your barrel what you need here

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.220 
front of your barrel what you need here
is<00:03:14.310> parallel<00:03:14.670> wareness<00:03:15.360> which<00:03:15.629> means<00:03:15.870> that

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
is parallel wareness which means that

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.020 
is parallel wareness which means that
you<00:03:16.440> have<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.709> be<00:03:16.829> aware<00:03:17.069> for<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.489> directly

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030

just<00:05:20.830> lowering<00:05:21.370> the<00:05:21.669> few<00:05:22.029> of<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.270> player<00:05:22.509> down

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
just lowering the few of the player down

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.689 
just lowering the few of the player down
to<00:05:23.050> his<00:05:23.139> shoulders<00:05:23.379> so<00:05:24.250> that<00:05:24.430> he<00:05:24.550> would

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
to his shoulders so that he would

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.969 
to his shoulders so that he would
basically<00:05:25.060> look<00:05:25.719> through<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.379> barrel<00:05:26.740> of<00:05:26.830> the

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
basically look through the barrel of the

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.429 
basically look through the barrel of the
gun<00:05:27.240> while<00:05:28.240> that<00:05:28.449> would<00:05:28.629> have<00:05:28.750> indeed<00:05:29.050> fixed

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 
gun while that would have indeed fixed

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.929 
gun while that would have indeed fixed
the<00:05:29.529> headglitching<00:05:29.800> issue<00:05:30.129> it<00:05:30.610> would<00:05:30.849> have

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:30.939 
the headglitching issue it would have

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.499 
the headglitching issue it would have
introduced<00:05:31.449> two<00:05:31.719> new<00:05:31.750> issues<00:05:32.729> number<00:05:33.729> one<00:05:33.939> you

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
introduced two new issues number one you

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.540 
introduced two new issues number one you
would<00:05:34.659> feel<00:05:34.870> very<00:05:34.900> very<00:05:35.560> tiny<00:05:35.919> when<00:05:36.279> you<00:05:36.400> look

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
would feel very very tiny when you look

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.100 
would feel very very tiny when you look
at<00:05:36.699> other<00:05:36.849> players<00:05:37.150> because<00:05:37.389> since<00:05:37.900> you've

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
at other players because since you've

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.929 
at other players because since you've
you<00:05:38.379> is<00:05:38.529> stuck<00:05:38.830> between<00:05:39.099> the<00:05:39.370> shoulders<00:05:39.789> of

00:05:39.929 --> 00:05:39.939 
you is stuck between the shoulders of

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.420 
you is stuck between the shoulders of
your<00:05:40.090> player<00:05:40.300> you<00:05:40.870> would<00:05:41.020> have<00:05:41.259> to<00:05:41.440> look<00:05:41.589> up<00:05:41.919> to

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
your player you would have to look up to

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.129 
your player you would have to look up to
see<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.699> face<00:05:42.909> of<00:05:42.940> the<00:05:43.270> other<00:05:43.419> players<00:05:43.750> and

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
see the face of the other players and

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.619 
see the face of the other players and
the<00:05:44.949> second<00:05:45.310> issue<00:05:45.400> is<00:05:45.759> that<00:05:45.789> you<00:05:46.360> will<00:05:46.509> see

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:46.629 
the second issue is that you will see

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:48.540 
the second issue is that you will see
projectiles<00:05:47.259> pass<00:05:47.560> over<00:05:47.860> your<00:05:48.009> head<00:05:48.279> and

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
projectiles pass over your head and

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.610 
projectiles pass over your head and
think<00:05:48.789> that<00:05:49.029> they<00:05:49.210> missed<00:05:49.449> you<00:05:49.719> yet<00:05:50.349> you<00:05:50.469> will

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
think that they missed you yet you will

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.230 
think that they missed you yet you will
take<00:05:50.770> damage<00:05:50.949> from<00:05:51.219> a<00:05:51.370> headshot<00:05:51.699> because<00:05:52.060> the

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
take damage from a headshot because the

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.540 
take damage from a headshot because the
entire<00:05:52.539> head<00:05:52.960> of<00:05:53.169> your<00:05:53.349> player<00:05:53.560> model<00:05:53.979> is<00:05:54.250> on

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
entire head of your player model is on

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.760 
entire head of your player model is on
top<00:05:54.729> of<00:05:54.909> your<00:05:55.089> view<00:05:55.449> which<00:05:56.169> is<00:05:56.319> tucked<00:05:56.560> between

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
top of your view which is tucked between

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.980 
top of your view which is tucked between
the<00:05:57.039> shoulders<00:05:57.430> of<00:05:57.580> your<00:05:57.729> player<00:05:57.990> another

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
the shoulders of your player another

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.930 
the shoulders of your player another
suggestion<00:05:59.650> is<00:05:59.800> that<00:05:59.830> the<00:06:00.250> developer<00:06:00.759> should

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
suggestion is that the developer should

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.909 
suggestion is that the developer should
continue<00:06:01.479> to<00:06:01.629> spawn<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:01.990> projectile<00:06:02.589> inside

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
continue to spawn the projectile inside

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.369 
continue to spawn the projectile inside
the<00:06:03.069> barrel<00:06:03.400> of<00:06:03.520> the<00:06:03.699> gun<00:06:03.729> but<00:06:04.569> simply<00:06:05.080> zero

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.379 
the barrel of the gun but simply zero

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:08.730 
the barrel of the gun but simply zero
the<00:06:05.620> guns<00:06:05.860> to<00:06:06.129> zero<00:06:06.460> meters<00:06:07.169> now<00:06:08.169> when<00:06:08.500> we<00:06:08.620> look

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
the guns to zero meters now when we look

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.649 
the guns to zero meters now when we look
at<00:06:08.830> my<00:06:09.009> previous<00:06:09.339> graphic<00:06:09.610> then<00:06:10.150> this<00:06:10.509> would

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
at my previous graphic then this would

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.439 
at my previous graphic then this would
mean<00:06:10.810> that<00:06:10.990> you<00:06:11.110> have<00:06:11.319> to<00:06:11.529> do<00:06:11.710> this<00:06:12.419> which<00:06:13.419> is

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:13.449 
mean that you have to do this which is

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.709 
mean that you have to do this which is
obviously<00:06:13.960> not<00:06:14.199> going<00:06:14.409> to<00:06:14.560> work<00:06:14.889> either

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
obviously not going to work either

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.390 
obviously not going to work either
now<00:06:16.719> I<00:06:16.930> know<00:06:17.050> that<00:06:17.349> it<00:06:17.469> is<00:06:17.650> always<00:06:18.009> a<00:06:18.189> bit

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
now I know that it is always a bit

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.490 
now I know that it is always a bit
strange<00:06:18.699> when<00:06:19.029> something<00:06:19.779> suddenly<00:06:20.259> no

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
strange when something suddenly no

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.920 
strange when something suddenly no
longer<00:06:20.529> works<00:06:20.979> like<00:06:21.250> it<00:06:21.400> used<00:06:21.669> to<00:06:21.789> like<00:06:22.689> that

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
longer works like it used to like that

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.600 
longer works like it used to like that
you<00:06:22.990> can<00:06:23.439> shoot<00:06:23.620> bullets<00:06:23.860> with<00:06:24.279> your<00:06:24.490> eyes

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
you can shoot bullets with your eyes

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.730 
you can shoot bullets with your eyes
anymore<00:06:24.909> and<00:06:25.389> that<00:06:25.629> they<00:06:25.779> actually<00:06:25.990> originate

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
anymore and that they actually originate

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.429 
anymore and that they actually originate
inside<00:06:27.069> the<00:06:27.219> barrel<00:06:27.610> of<00:06:27.729> your<00:06:27.759> gun<00:06:28.289> but<00:06:29.289> this

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:29.439 
inside the barrel of your gun but this

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:31.050 
inside the barrel of your gun but this
change<00:06:29.680> is<00:06:29.800> really<00:06:30.129> easy<00:06:30.310> to<00:06:30.520> adapt<00:06:30.789> to

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
change is really easy to adapt to

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.909 
change is really easy to adapt to
because<00:06:31.539> it's<00:06:31.810> easy<00:06:32.050> to<00:06:32.229> understand<00:06:32.620> as<00:06:32.800> it

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
because it's easy to understand as it

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.159 
because it's easy to understand as it
works<00:06:33.129> like<00:06:33.310> in<00:06:33.460> real<00:06:33.669> life<00:06:33.969> it<00:06:34.539> removes<00:06:34.960> there

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
works like in real life it removes there

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:36.779 
works like in real life it removes there
how<00:06:35.409> the<00:06:35.469> hell<00:06:35.710> could<00:06:35.889> that<00:06:36.069> guy<00:06:36.250> shoot<00:06:36.580> me

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:36.789 
how the hell could that guy shoot me

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.059 
how the hell could that guy shoot me
through<00:06:36.819> that<00:06:37.300> object<00:06:37.479> moments<00:06:38.289> where<00:06:38.860> you

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:39.069 
through that object moments where you

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:40.740 
through that object moments where you
could<00:06:39.250> only<00:06:39.430> see<00:06:39.699> the<00:06:39.849> eyes<00:06:40.060> of<00:06:40.330> the<00:06:40.479> player

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
could only see the eyes of the player

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.929 
could only see the eyes of the player
and<00:06:41.050> it<00:06:41.560> increases<00:06:42.099> the<00:06:42.250> depth<00:06:42.520> of<00:06:42.789> the

00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:42.939 
and it increases the depth of the

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:44.999 
and it increases the depth of the
gameplay<00:06:43.300> and<00:06:43.599> you<00:06:44.110> are<00:06:44.229> literally<00:06:44.500> only

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:45.009 
gameplay and you are literally only

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.519 
gameplay and you are literally only
required<00:06:45.610> to<00:06:45.849> make<00:06:46.000> one<00:06:46.360> step<00:06:46.690> away<00:06:46.959> from<00:06:47.169> the

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:47.529 
required to make one step away from the

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:50.469 
required to make one step away from the
object<00:06:47.979> in<00:06:48.430> order<00:06:48.729> to<00:06:48.909> hit<00:06:49.120> the<00:06:49.180> player

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 
object in order to hit the player

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.299 
object in order to hit the player
