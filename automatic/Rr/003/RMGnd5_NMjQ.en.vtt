*sound of rock door opening*

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.500
FILSS: Please watch your step.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.460
FILSS: Director, since you have a new visitor with you today. Would you like me to run the tutorial program?

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.300
CABOOSE: Yes, always run that. No, seriously, you need to run that.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.300
No, it's- really you need to- you need to turn that--

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.620
EPSILON: Yeah okay shut up, dude.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.600
Yes, please run the tutorial program.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.200
CABOOSE: Oh, thank god.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.200
*ding ding*

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.240
FILSS: Hello, and welcome to the freelancer off-site storage facility.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.180
Project Freelancer is a state-of-the-art scientific endeavor with one goal in mind;

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.340
To ensure the security of humanity in a harsh and violent galaxy.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:51.580
This is bunker has been constructed to guarantee the continued operations of our program, in the event of a primary facility loss.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.700
This storage area archives all the components of our freelancer simulation bases.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.420
These outposts test our agents in realistic training scenarios.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.520
CABOOSE: Yeah, we're on the Blue Team!

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.000
FILSS: I am sorry. I do not recognize that term.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.000
Our simulation outposts are categorized into red and-- [entry missing].

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.280
Hmm. It seems as though I have a corrupted database.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.180
I will correct that when I have more time.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.600
CABOOSE: Oh-eh! There's all stuff! And there's the teleporter.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.800
Man, Tucker hates those.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.660
EPSILON: Don't interrupt.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.080
FILSS: When the equipment is not being used, it is stored here
EPSILON: C'mon, this way.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.920
FILSS: until it can be re-purposed for...

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.720
Oh. I Guess we are moving on.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.880
CABOOSE: Oh, what's this?

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.280
FILSS: I am sorry, this area is restricted. Only the Director himself may access this entry.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.840
I am sure you understand. The nature of our experiments is such that-

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.600
EPSILON: Open it.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.160
FILSS: Excuse me director?

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.040
EPSILON: I want you to open it.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.360
FILSS: Are you certain, Director? You never bring visitors in to this-

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.480
EPSILON: I said open it.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.660
FILSS: Alright.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.460
Unlocking. Would you like me to archive your...

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.800
... personal project?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.620
EPSILON: No.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.740
Let's see everything.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.700
FILSS: If you say so, Director.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.920
[*old school rvb guitar riff*]

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.600
SARGE: Simmons, what's the status report?

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.720
SIMMONS: Gumball McJones and Caboose went into that door.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.800
GRIF: What door? All I see is a wall.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.040
SIMMONS: It's a secret door.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.440
SARGE: Simmons, what did I tell you about using Dungeons &amp; Dragons references in combat situations?

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.360
SIMMONS: *sighs* Sorry, sir. It's a concealed door.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.120
SARGE: That's better.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.040
GRIF: How did they open it?

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.280
SIMMONS: They talked to that computer. They got it to open the door by posing as members of Project Freelancer.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.680
If we pose as agents, it'll probably let us in too.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.820
GRIF: Aren't agents, like, tough and good at things?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.040
SIMMONS: We all just pick a state name and call ourselves by that.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.940
Y'know, like, Agent Washington.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.680
Grif, name a state.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.080
GRIF: What is this? A pop quiz?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.680
Uhhh, let's see. eh-du- Manhattan.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.920
No? Uhhh. Europe.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.440
SIMMONS: Wow. Really?

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.100
GRIF: Pacific Ocean?

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.100
SIMMONS: Stop guessing. Just be Agent Alaska.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.440
How 'bout you, Sarge?

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.600
SARGE: I'll be Secret Agent Double O-hio.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.580
License to be tall in the middle and round on both ends.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.200
SIMMONS: And I'll be Agent Denial. *laughs* Get it? Because a state of denial, like the saying?

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.200
Y'know, it's like uh...

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.380
I was- you know. The whole state-state thing. Y'know it's a joke.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.460
GRIF: No, dude. Jokes are funny.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.060
SIMMONS: *sighs* Let's just go

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.320

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.360
WASHINGTON: The recovery beacon leads here.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.640
It's weak, but I can still pick it up.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.060
WASHINGTON: Here.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.880

WASHINGTON: Hey, I'm not gonna argue with you about this.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.700
You want a chance at that A.I.? I track, you dig.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.340
Otherwise, you can wander the desert by yourself and see if you find him on your own.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.360
META: *hisses*

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.160

WASHINGTON: Right. And other people's weight too.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.180
Just dig.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.220
DOC: Man, some people just can't take orders.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.380
Amirite?

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.600
WASHINGTON: Shut up. We're not friends.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.780
DOC: Can I at least get a drink of water?

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.500
WASHINGTON: Shut up.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.540
I already asked you if you were thirsty before we left.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.840
DOC: Yeah, we're in the desert. Thirsty should be assumed.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.360
WASHINGTON: You can drink later.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.220

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.880
WASHINGTON: I hate you.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.740

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.720
Is that CT?

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.100
That's impossible. What's she doing out here?

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.900
DOC: What are you lookin' at?

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.260
WASHINGTON: Don't bother. She didn't get an A.I. remember?

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.200

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.200

Hey, this is the greatest store ever! You can have your body back!

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.260
Which one do you want?

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.540
I wanna buy one.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.820

CABOOSE: Oh.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.430
Hello, everyone now that we have our own YouTube channel

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.300
I've taken the liberty of reorganizing everything for a streamlined viewing experience.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.380
Just hit subscribe to put it to use.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.160
GRIF: You're supposed convince them to subscribe, not put 'em to sleep. You loser.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.360
I hate him so much.
