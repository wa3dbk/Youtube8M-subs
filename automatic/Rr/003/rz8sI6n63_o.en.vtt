their<00:01:25.290> system<00:01:25.860> there's<00:01:26.490> been<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> little<00:01:26.909> bit

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
their system there's been a little bit

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.719 
their system there's been a little bit
confusion<00:01:27.710> especially<00:01:28.710> when<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> was<00:01:29.520> reading

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
confusion especially when I was reading

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.460 
confusion especially when I was reading
the<00:01:29.820> blog<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.240> believe<00:01:30.450> where<00:01:30.990> people<00:01:31.290> thought

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the blog I believe where people thought

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.200 
the blog I believe where people thought
that<00:01:31.530> rolls<00:01:32.100> meant<00:01:32.340> predetermined<00:01:33.030> roles

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
that rolls meant predetermined roles

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.109 
that rolls meant predetermined roles
that<00:01:33.750> us<00:01:33.930> as<00:01:34.079> developers<00:01:34.229> decided<00:01:35.119> basically

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that us as developers decided basically

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.550 
that us as developers decided basically
saying<00:01:36.540> well<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.990> what<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.229> guys<00:01:37.350> are

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
saying well this is what you guys are
going<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.159> want<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.119> install<00:01:39.630> that

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
going to want and we just install that

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.929 
going to want and we just install that
for<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.200> when<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.500> say<00:01:40.770> well<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.579> want<00:01:41.640> to
