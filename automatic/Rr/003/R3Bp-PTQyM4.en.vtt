that they threw it in there and here is

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.670

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
everything and I guess this is just a

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.660 
everything and I guess this is just a

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
complaining about that there was such a

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.440 
complaining about that there was such a

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
expensive cases I would expect extreme

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.480 
expensive cases I would expect extreme
amount<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.170> quality<00:02:23.380> but<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.740> actually<00:02:23.950> really

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.330 
of your pockets or in a purse all the
time<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:32.020> don't<00:02:32.230> expect<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.710> for<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.040> $10

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
time but I don't expect that for a $10

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.280 
time but I don't expect that for a $10
case<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.910> like<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.510> change<00:02:34.690> up<00:02:34.870> what<00:02:35.020> I've<00:02:35.110> got
