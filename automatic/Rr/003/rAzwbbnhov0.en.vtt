00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
and the analogy will not really an

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.620 
and the analogy will not really an
analogy<00:02:33.040> but<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.370> actual<00:02:33.850> scenario<00:02:34.450> that

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
analogy but the actual scenario that

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.520 
analogy but the actual scenario that
happened<00:02:34.990> with<00:02:35.110> me

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
happened with me

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.590 
happened with me
I<00:02:35.560> was<00:02:36.100> almost<00:02:36.310> discouraged<00:02:37.000> by<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.210> guitar

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
I was almost discouraged by the guitar

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.170 
I was almost discouraged by the guitar
now<00:02:37.870> my<00:02:38.290> mom<00:02:38.500> had<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.890> belief<00:02:39.160> which<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.790> lot<00:02:40.150> of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
now my mom had the belief which a lot of

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.960 
now my mom had the belief which a lot of
people<00:02:40.540> do<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:41.470> well<00:02:41.740> if<00:02:41.920> he's<00:02:42.130> serious<00:02:42.370> then

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
people do that well if he's serious then

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.610 
people do that well if he's serious then
we'll<00:02:43.180> get<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.390> more<00:02:43.630> expensive<00:02:43.930> one<00:02:44.200> later<00:02:44.440> and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
we'll get a more expensive one later and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.490 
we'll get a more expensive one later and
that's<00:02:44.740> what<00:02:44.920> I'm<00:02:45.040> happening<00:02:45.490> but<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:47.410> the

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
that's what I'm happening but for the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.450 
that's what I'm happening but for the
most<00:02:47.620> part<00:02:47.770> you<00:02:48.640> don't<00:02:48.820> want<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.240> go<00:02:49.390> too<00:02:49.900> cheap

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
most part you don't want to go too cheap

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.740 
most part you don't want to go too cheap
but<00:02:51.460> you<00:02:51.610> also<00:02:51.820> don't<00:02:52.180> have<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.450> go<00:02:52.690> too

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
but you also don't have to go too

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.430 
but you also don't have to go too
expensive

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
expensive

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.080 
expensive
