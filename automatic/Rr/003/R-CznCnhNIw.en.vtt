00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530

we never as you know it always takes a

we never as you know it always takes a
couple<00:01:08.509> of<00:01:08.659> years<00:01:08.810> for<00:01:09.020> us<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:09.170> build<00:01:09.439> a<00:01:09.530> war

game<00:01:10.070> set<00:01:10.400> yells<00:01:11.240> because<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:11.960> can't<00:01:12.140> just

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
game set yells because you can't just

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.780 
game set yells because you can't just
rush<00:01:12.500> him<00:01:12.650> out<00:01:12.799> if<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.040> do<00:01:13.189> they<00:01:13.400> end<00:01:13.490> up<00:01:13.640> being

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
rush him out if you do they end up being

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.490 
rush him out if you do they end up being
unbalanced<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:14.509> you<00:01:15.170> don't<00:01:15.320> get<00:01:15.409> the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
unbalanced and you don't get the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.100 
unbalanced and you don't get the
feedback<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.159> community<00:01:16.759> everything<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:18.020> I

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
feedback and community everything and I

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.499 
feedback and community everything and I
think<00:01:18.290> when<00:01:18.380> we<00:01:18.500> launched<00:01:18.770> warpath<00:01:19.509> with

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
think when we launched warpath with

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.230 
think when we launched warpath with
hindsight<00:01:20.900> it's<00:01:21.259> probably<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.560> little<00:01:21.680> bit<00:01:21.890> to

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
hindsight it's probably a little bit to

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.480 
hindsight it's probably a little bit to
house<00:01:23.240> style<00:01:23.630> we<00:01:24.409> purposely<00:01:24.799> kept<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:25.220> kind<00:01:25.369> of

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
house style we purposely kept it kind of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.450 
house style we purposely kept it kind of
sad<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.790> familiar<00:01:26.270> feel<00:01:26.509> with<00:01:26.799> kings<00:01:27.799> of<00:01:27.920> war<00:01:28.159> it

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
sad a familiar feel with kings of war it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.280 
sad a familiar feel with kings of war it
would<00:01:28.549> probably<00:01:28.729> too<00:01:29.030> close<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.750> that<00:01:29.930> meant

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
would probably too close and that meant

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.050 
would probably too close and that meant
that<00:01:30.380> as<00:01:30.620> a<00:01:30.650> sci-fi<00:01:31.250> game<00:01:31.550> it<00:01:31.729> didn't<00:01:31.940> have<00:01:32.030> the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
that as a sci-fi game it didn't have the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.240 
that as a sci-fi game it didn't have the
dynamism<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:32.960> it's<00:01:33.530> all<00:01:33.650> about<00:01:33.800> shooting

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
dynamism and it's all about shooting

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.550 
dynamism and it's all about shooting
it's<00:01:34.400> all<00:01:34.490> about<00:01:34.610> movement<00:01:34.940> yeah<00:01:35.780> we<00:01:36.350> should

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
it's all about movement yeah we should

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.920 
it's all about movement yeah we should
have<00:01:36.650> marked<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:36.979> out<00:01:37.159> so<00:01:37.729> we<00:01:38.300> got<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.570> attribs

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
have marked it out so we got the attribs

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.480 
have marked it out so we got the attribs
out<00:01:39.140> because<00:01:39.350> I<00:01:39.409> think<00:01:39.560> statically<00:01:40.280> we<00:01:40.370> know

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490

one<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.440> things<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.650> was<00:03:00.770> missing<00:03:01.100> I

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
one of the things that was missing I

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.540 
one of the things that was missing I
think<00:03:01.730> from<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.210> from<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.540> launch<00:03:03.160> big<00:03:04.160> tad<00:03:04.370> I

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
think from the from the launch big tad I

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.220 
think from the from the launch big tad I
mean<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.790> think<00:03:05.000> we've<00:03:05.270> thought<00:03:05.810> long<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.080> hard

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
mean I think we've thought long and hard

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.200 
mean I think we've thought long and hard
about<00:03:06.530> what<00:03:07.160> is<00:03:07.340> mantic<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:07.940> what<00:03:08.030> are<00:03:08.120> we

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
about what is mantic and what are we

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.250 
about what is mantic and what are we
going<00:03:08.330> to<00:03:08.420> do<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.630> way<00:03:08.750> we're<00:03:08.900> going<00:03:08.990> to<00:03:09.110> go

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
going to do the way we're going to go

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
going to do the way we're going to go

whole gamut so you know I think we've

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.240 
whole gamut so you know I think we've
taken<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.810> resin<00:03:33.080> plastic<00:03:33.470> beautiful<00:03:34.070> nice

big footprint kicks but essentially
infantry<00:03:36.350> support<00:03:36.740> so<00:03:37.670> we're<00:03:37.970> now

infantry support so we're now

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.449 
infantry support so we're now

a<00:03:43.760> good<00:03:43.940> few<00:03:44.150> ideas<00:03:44.860> will<00:03:45.860> be<00:03:45.890> able<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.190> put

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
a good few ideas will be able to put

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.699 
a good few ideas will be able to put
probably<00:03:47.030> put<00:03:47.180> out<00:03:47.480> those<00:03:47.690> first<00:03:48.019> four<00:03:48.290> armies

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.400 
probably put out those first four armies
and<00:03:49.040> when<00:03:49.400> we<00:03:49.519> put<00:03:49.700> warpath<00:03:50.290> three-point<00:03:51.290> over

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
and when we put warpath three-point over

and when we put warpath three-point over
our<00:03:51.620> book<00:03:52.010> out<00:03:52.250> will<00:03:52.850> at<00:03:52.970> least<00:03:53.060> have<00:03:53.269> two<00:03:53.480> more

of<00:04:37.910> mine<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:39.290> think<00:04:39.500> we<00:04:39.620> could<00:04:39.740> see<00:04:39.919> all

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
of mine and I think we could see all

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.250 
of mine and I think we could see all
those<00:04:40.310> coming<00:04:40.700> together<00:04:40.820> with<00:04:41.600> our<00:04:41.630> but<00:04:42.050> book

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
those coming together with our but book

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.510 
those coming together with our but book
was<00:04:42.440> a<00:04:42.470> big<00:04:42.710> gaming<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:44.060> know<00:04:44.180> kind<00:04:44.419> of<00:04:44.450> bump

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
was a big gaming you know kind of bump

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.330 
was a big gaming you know kind of bump
so<00:04:46.520> where<00:04:47.450> are<00:04:47.570> we<00:04:47.600> now<00:04:47.840> we've<00:04:48.289> got<00:04:48.470> this<00:04:48.560> as<00:04:48.919> a

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
so where are we now we've got this as a

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.129 
so where are we now we've got this as a
16-page<00:04:49.940> it's<00:04:50.180> actually<00:04:50.450> 30<00:04:50.690> page

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
16-page it's actually 30 page

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.300 
16-page it's actually 30 page
because<00:04:51.289> that<00:04:51.409> takes<00:04:51.590> that<00:04:51.770> much<00:04:51.949> to<00:04:52.189> write

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310

cool<00:05:04.340> warpath<00:05:04.669> 2.0<00:05:05.529> specifically<00:05:06.529> a<00:05:06.560> reason

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
cool warpath 2.0 specifically a reason

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.459 
cool warpath 2.0 specifically a reason
it<00:05:07.639> is<00:05:07.909> not<00:05:07.939> an<00:05:08.449> upgrade<00:05:08.930> of<00:05:08.960> one<00:05:09.259> we've

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 
it is not an upgrade of one we've

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.290 
it is not an upgrade of one we've
changed<00:05:09.710> it<00:05:09.949> and<00:05:10.129> I<00:05:10.490> suspect<00:05:11.029> we<00:05:11.210> will

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
changed it and I suspect we will

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.540 
changed it and I suspect we will
probably<00:05:11.569> change<00:05:11.900> it<00:05:12.110> again<00:05:12.229> before<00:05:13.039> we<00:05:13.279> go

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
probably change it again before we go

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.610 
probably change it again before we go
into<00:05:13.759> the<00:05:13.969> final<00:05:14.509> this<00:05:15.110> is<00:05:15.259> what<00:05:15.409> it's<00:05:15.560> going

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
into the final this is what it's going

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.670 
into the final this is what it's going
to<00:05:15.770> be<00:05:16.360> but<00:05:17.360> we've<00:05:17.479> just<00:05:17.659> gone<00:05:18.289> around<00:05:18.529> the

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
to be but we've just gone around the

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.339 
to be but we've just gone around the
squad<00:05:19.039> sighs<00:05:19.310> we've<00:05:19.580> gone<00:05:19.789> within

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
squad sighs we've gone within

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.860 
squad sighs we've gone within
alternative<00:05:21.349> activation<00:05:21.830> right<00:05:22.550> so<00:05:22.999> I<00:05:23.029> go<00:05:23.360> a

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
alternative activation right so I go a

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.350 
alternative activation right so I go a
unit<00:05:24.650> I<00:05:24.830> can<00:05:25.279> then<00:05:25.400> try<00:05:25.639> and<00:05:25.669> go<00:05:25.849> a<00:05:25.879> second

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
unit I can then try and go a second

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.469 
unit I can then try and go a second
maybe<00:05:26.930> a<00:05:27.110> third<00:05:27.349> to<00:05:28.129> get<00:05:28.279> a<00:05:28.310> flanking<00:05:29.060> maneuver

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
maybe a third to get a flanking maneuver

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.689 
maybe a third to get a flanking maneuver
but<00:05:29.689> it<00:05:29.779> becomes<00:05:29.960> riskier<00:05:30.409> right<00:05:30.830> okay<00:05:31.430> and

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
but it becomes riskier right okay and

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.189 
but it becomes riskier right okay and
then<00:05:31.819> you'll<00:05:32.029> do<00:05:32.210> yours<00:05:32.479> and<00:05:32.750> so<00:05:32.870> it<00:05:32.990> will<00:05:33.080> go

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
then you'll do yours and so it will go

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.890 
then you'll do yours and so it will go
back<00:05:33.409> and<00:05:33.590> forth<00:05:33.800> so<00:05:34.069> deadly<00:05:34.849> with<00:05:35.150> the

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
back and forth so deadly with the

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.570 
back and forth so deadly with the
