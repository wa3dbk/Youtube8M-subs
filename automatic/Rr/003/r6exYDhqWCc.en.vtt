noticed<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:18.299> our<00:01:18.479> wall<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.720> don't<00:01:18.869> have

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
noticed on our wall we don't have

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.350 
noticed on our wall we don't have
anymore<00:01:19.439> revolvers<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.580> that's<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.030> we

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
anymore revolvers but that's because we

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.359 
anymore revolvers but that's because we
are<00:01:21.390> discontinuing<00:01:22.380> our<00:01:22.560> revolvers<00:01:23.040> because

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
are discontinuing our revolvers because

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.300 
are discontinuing our revolvers because
we<00:01:23.520> feel<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.479> design<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> them<00:01:25.590> wasn't

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
we feel like the design of them wasn't

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.580 
we feel like the design of them wasn't
strong<00:01:26.640> enough<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.659> sizes<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.810> 100

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
strong enough so we have sizes of 100

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.590 
strong enough so we have sizes of 100
and<00:01:32.360> 110<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:34.130> personally<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.340> 110<00:01:36.000> because

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and 110 I personally like 110 because

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600 
and 110 I personally like 110 because
they<00:01:37.409> last<00:01:37.650> longer<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> they're<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.400> lot

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
they last longer and they're a lot

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.539 
they last longer and they're a lot
faster<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.159> feel<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.369> them

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
faster and I just like the feel of them

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.020 
faster and I just like the feel of them
better

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.660 

so<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.630> people<00:01:45.810> used<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.860> say<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.369> what<00:01:47.520> our

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
so what people used to say and what our

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.550 
so what people used to say and what our
riders<00:01:48.090> used<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.540> say<00:01:48.750> where<00:01:48.990> our<00:01:49.110> wheels<00:01:49.380> were

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
riders used to say where our wheels were

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.520 
riders used to say where our wheels were
really<00:01:49.860> slow<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:51.180> completely<00:01:51.630> redesigned

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
really slow but we completely redesigned

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.620 
really slow but we completely redesigned
them<00:01:53.009> like<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> whole<00:01:53.520> shape<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.270> found

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
them like the whole shape and we found

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.469 
them like the whole shape and we found
new<00:01:54.990> urethane<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.729> changed<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
new urethane and we just changed the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.030 
new urethane and we just changed the
whole<00:01:57.509> design<00:01:57.810> completely<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.590> they're<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> lot

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
whole design completely so they're a lot

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.910 
whole design completely so they're a lot
faster<00:01:59.070> now<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.729> really<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.509> them<00:02:00.920> they're

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
faster now I really like them they're

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.649 
faster now I really like them they're
really<00:02:02.579> good<00:02:02.759> for<00:02:02.969> park<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.420> they're<00:02:03.509> also

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
really good for park and they're also

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
really good for park and they're also
good<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:04.110> street<00:02:04.560> our<00:02:04.829> newer<00:02:05.219> ones<00:02:05.490> don't

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
good for street our newer ones don't

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.150

Chunk<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.390> easy<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.079> they've<00:02:08.039> been

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
Chunk is easy and they they've been

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.430 
Chunk is easy and they they've been
lasting<00:02:08.520> mayorly<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> long<00:02:09.060> time<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.599> they

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
lasting mayorly a long time so they

are all the same hardness they're all 86

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.450 
are all the same hardness they're all 86
and<00:02:17.520> then<00:02:18.390> as<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:19.110> see<00:02:19.170> only<00:02:19.710> our<00:02:20.070> black

and white wheels have anodized core
colors<00:02:24.620> but<00:02:25.620> soon<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.490> one<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.820> is

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
colors but soon like this one this is

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.990 
colors but soon like this one this is
just<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.210> little<00:02:27.330> prototype<00:02:27.710> desire<00:02:28.820> green<00:02:29.820> on

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
just a little prototype desire green on

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.110 
just a little prototype desire green on
green<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:31.740> greens<00:02:32.040> will<00:02:32.430> have<00:02:32.610> all<00:02:32.910> different
