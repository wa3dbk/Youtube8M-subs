 Credo we have been much better off or people have been affected 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.189
 I'm surprised about the tapes the horror of falling behind 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.739
 go in 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.779
 the youngest and oldest inhabitants are too young 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.769
 Jochen Bruhn 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.520
 the view is can Lyons 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.340
 something else lied 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 was informed professional musician 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.520
 but I die 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.520
 to mix it with kEur simply celebrated 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.100
 too much for both Verdi 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.100
 the sliding door 4 4 in the lead 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.950
 but since I can overcome GM relatively quickly I'm having it at the moment 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.090
 not really known 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.280

 used for moments 5 fifth time will be postponed 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
 after waking up 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.970
 hard that they all wore them temporarily on the but it is because 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.480
 that I actually know the moment why now, and so do I. 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.620
 has to go right back 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.150
 and therefore 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.280
 As soon as possible and admired he had spa treatments and landings in Frankfurt 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.350

 seen fiscal policy over Amy and always looks a bit like that 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.150
 mine lives there 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.820
 for which it is actually the reason why 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.210
 Hetkamp they bucked on which people mean to their edge

 Michael and I still hope I have to say it honestly 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.319
 I can definitely shed such light on it 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:20.119
 then the leaf 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:21.819
 as in all points 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.639
 it stops flying 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:24.629

 Fox train ride 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.869
 it was never to be advised 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:36.169
 Fit in Schlebusch 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.969
