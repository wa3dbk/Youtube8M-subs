of keep working on them as though the
process<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.630> kind<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.840> continued<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.470> while

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
process it kind of continued so while

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.019 
process it kind of continued so while
the<00:00:26.099> three<00:00:26.310> races<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.849> original

starcraft were very different from one
another<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:29.039> wondered<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.820> could<00:00:29.880> make

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
another we wondered if we could make

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.370 
another we wondered if we could make
them<00:00:30.210> even<00:00:30.420> more<00:00:30.539> different<00:00:30.990> from<00:00:31.140> one

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
them even more different from one

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.420 
them even more different from one
another<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.800> make<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.009> feel<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.219> these<00:00:32.369> are

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
another and make it feel like these are

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.280 
another and make it feel like these are
radically<00:00:33.420> different<00:00:33.719> approaches<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
radically different approaches to

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.560 
radically different approaches to
fighting<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.280> out<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:36.059> real-time<00:00:36.239> strategy

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570

about<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.960> with<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> technology<00:01:34.380> available

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
about it with the technology available

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.060 
about it with the technology available
to<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.549> all<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:36.540> units<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.140> screen<00:01:37.500> one

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
to do all of these units on screen one

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.770 
to do all of these units on screen one
of<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> key<00:01:38.460> decisions<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.329> made<00:01:39.509> based

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
of the key decisions that you made based

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.990 
of the key decisions that you made based
on<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.200> version<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:41.189> being<00:01:41.460> shown<00:01:41.759> here

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
on the version that's being shown here

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.539 
on the version that's being shown here
at<00:01:42.090> blizzcon<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.680> decision<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.280> remove

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
at blizzcon is the decision to remove

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.210 
at blizzcon is the decision to remove
the<00:01:44.820> 12<00:01:45.180> Union<00:01:45.540> control<00:01:45.930> cap<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.829> must<00:01:47.130> have

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the 12 Union control cap that must have

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.620 
the 12 Union control cap that must have
made<00:01:47.310> dramatic<00:01:47.610> changes<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> game

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
made dramatic changes to the game

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.510 
made dramatic changes to the game
strategy<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> withered<00:01:49.649> late<00:01:49.920> could<00:01:50.460> you

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
strategy in the withered late could you

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.219 
strategy in the withered late could you
discuss<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> minute<00:01:51.479> why<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.899> made

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
discuss that for a minute why you made

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.990 
discuss that for a minute why you made
that<00:01:52.409> decision<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.040> how<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.700> affects

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
that decision and how it affects

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.389 
that decision and how it affects
starcraft<00:01:54.479> 2<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.560> definitely<00:01:55.740> removed<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
starcraft 2 so we definitely removed the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.069 
starcraft 2 so we definitely removed the
control<00:01:57.090> limit<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.509> how<00:01:57.540> many<00:01:57.689> units<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.020> can

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
control limit on how many units you can

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.569 
control limit on how many units you can
control<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.500> starcraft<00:01:58.920> 2<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.219> our<00:01:59.280> thinking

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
control in starcraft 2 and our thinking

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.649 
control in starcraft 2 and our thinking
on<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.729> ones<00:02:00.000> who<00:02:00.060> wanted<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> game<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.540> be

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
on that ones who wanted the game to be

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.149 
on that ones who wanted the game to be
as<00:02:00.810> easy<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.140> play<00:02:01.409> as<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.619> could<00:02:01.770> possibly

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
as easy to play as we could possibly

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.160 
as easy to play as we could possibly
make<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.579> now<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.329> course<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.630> still<00:02:03.960> want

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
make it now of course we still want

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.179 
make it now of course we still want
players<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.590> able<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> show<00:02:04.890> off<00:02:05.040> their

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
players to be able to show off their

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.440 
players to be able to show off their
skill<00:02:05.490> level<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.759> we<00:02:05.909> still<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.299> game

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
skill level and we still want the game

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.880 
skill level and we still want the game
to<00:02:06.479> be<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.689> very<00:02:06.930> challenging<00:02:06.960> game<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.829> you

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
to be a very challenging game and you

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.190 
to be a very challenging game and you
can<00:02:08.039> continue<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.520> get<00:02:08.610> better<00:02:08.819> at<00:02:08.940> year<00:02:09.810> after

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
can continue to get better at year after

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.360 
can continue to get better at year after
year<00:02:10.229> after<00:02:10.709> year<00:02:10.890> which

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
year after year which

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.890 
year after year which
would<00:02:11.549> be<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.790> original<00:02:11.909> starcraft<00:02:12.360> one<00:02:12.810> of

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
would be the original starcraft one of

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.460 
would be the original starcraft one of
the<00:02:12.959> things<00:02:13.049> that<00:02:13.170> made<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.379> original

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the things that made the original

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.470 
the things that made the original
starcraft<00:02:13.769> so<00:02:14.159> great<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:15.150> we've<00:02:15.269> definitely

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
starcraft so great so we've definitely

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.240 
starcraft so great so we've definitely
removed<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.260> cap<00:02:16.500> we<00:02:16.680> made<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.950> interface

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
removed that cap we made the interface

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.680 
removed that cap we made the interface
to<00:02:17.400> use<00:02:17.519> in<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.879> way<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.269> number<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.569> other

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
to use in that way in a number of other

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.240 
to use in that way in a number of other
ways<00:02:18.900> as<00:02:18.930> well<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.470> can<00:02:19.590> rally<00:02:19.769> point<00:02:20.099> your

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
ways as well you can rally point your

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.640 
ways as well you can rally point your
peons<00:02:20.580> directly<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> resources<00:02:22.379> there's

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
peons directly to the resources there's

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.009 
peons directly to the resources there's
lots<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:23.010> innovations<00:02:23.519> in<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.659> interface

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
lots of innovations in in the interface

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.360 
lots of innovations in in the interface
that<00:02:25.290> make<00:02:25.409> the<00:02:25.500> interface<00:02:25.769> each<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.129> people

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
that make the interface each of people

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.610 
that make the interface each of people
to<00:02:26.459> use<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.239> same<00:02:27.480> time<00:02:27.720> all<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.290> our<00:02:28.379> unit

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620

designs are set up so that anybody can
just<00:02:31.019> use<00:02:31.140> them<00:02:31.319> with<00:02:31.409> a<00:02:31.440> simple<00:02:31.769> attack<00:02:32.010> move

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
just use them with a simple attack move

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.009 
just use them with a simple attack move
command<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:32.730> something<00:02:33.090> useful<00:02:33.510> will<00:02:33.629> happen

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
command and something useful will happen

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.500 
command and something useful will happen
but<00:02:34.440> skilled<00:02:34.829> players<00:02:35.099> can<00:02:35.370> absolutely<00:02:35.879> micro

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
these units in just horrifically

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.670 
these units in just horrifically
interesting<00:02:38.670> ways<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:39.659> really<00:02:40.230> tear<00:02:40.470> up<00:02:40.560> the

deck and the thinking that you have to
do<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.709> sort<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:52.980> stay<00:02:53.519> ahead<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.970> game<00:02:54.120> so

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
do to sort of stay ahead of the game so

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.479 
do to sort of stay ahead of the game so
for<00:02:55.049> us<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.319> goal<00:02:55.470> was<00:02:55.500> make<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.129> interface

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
for us the goal was make the interface

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.430 
for us the goal was make the interface
simple<00:02:57.480> easy<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.840> use<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:58.170> should<00:02:58.290> be<00:02:58.349> the
