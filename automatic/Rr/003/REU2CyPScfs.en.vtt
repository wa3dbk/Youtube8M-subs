dual<00:00:43.500> moonroof<00:00:43.739> here<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.520> dual<00:00:44.730> sunroof

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
dual moonroof here the dual sunroof

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.610 
dual moonroof here the dual sunroof
really<00:00:45.510> stood<00:00:45.719> out<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> positive<00:00:46.469> feature

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
really stood out as a positive feature

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.790 
really stood out as a positive feature
what<00:00:46.890> else<00:00:47.040> we're<00:00:47.969> balancing<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.290> input<00:00:49.770> that

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
what else we're balancing the input that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.220 
what else we're balancing the input that
we<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.309> because<00:00:50.790> everyone<00:00:51.629> has<00:00:51.840> an<00:00:51.960> opinion

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
we get because everyone has an opinion

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.170 
we get because everyone has an opinion
right<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.340> again<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.789> goes<00:00:53.910> back<00:00:53.969> to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
right but I think again it goes back to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.930 
right but I think again it goes back to
who<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> vehicle<00:00:55.289> designed<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.370> if

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
who is the vehicle designed for and if

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.260 
who is the vehicle designed for and if
you<00:00:57.180> stay<00:00:57.780> true<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.320> then<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.730> end<00:01:00.059> up

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you stay true to that then you end up

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.700 
you stay true to that then you end up
with<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> vehicle<00:01:00.750> that's<00:01:01.140> gonna<00:01:01.289> meet<00:01:01.530> their

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
with a vehicle that's gonna meet their

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.830 
with a vehicle that's gonna meet their
needs<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.280> was<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.730> surprised<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.329> was<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> Ford

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840

transition<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.180> think<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.870> way<00:02:22.990> to<00:02:23.020> do<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.800> is<00:02:23.950> a

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
transition I think the way to do it is a

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.950 
transition I think the way to do it is a
very<00:02:24.160> important<00:02:24.700> launch<00:02:24.880> for<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.330> this<00:02:25.600> year

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
very important launch for for this year

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.440 
very important launch for for this year

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
but it's also a signal of what's to come

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.630 
but it's also a signal of what's to come
from<00:02:28.780> North<00:02:29.110> because<00:02:29.650> breakthrough<00:02:30.190> products

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
from North because breakthrough products

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.440 
from North because breakthrough products
