server out mostly everyone knows that we
can<00:00:15.150> dismantle<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.320> server<00:00:16.680> by<00:00:16.920> taking<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
can dismantle a server by taking the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.380 
can dismantle a server by taking the
screws<00:00:17.580> off<00:00:17.789> I'll<00:00:18.240> do<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:19.010> fastly<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
screws off I'll do it fastly this is the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.070 
screws off I'll do it fastly this is the
easy<00:00:21.539> part

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
easy part

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.310 
easy part
the<00:00:22.800> next<00:00:23.070> easy<00:00:23.279> part<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.789> taking<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:25.080> gear

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the next easy part is taking the gear

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.070 
the next easy part is taking the gear
section<00:00:25.740> off<00:00:26.689> now<00:00:27.740> this<00:00:29.840> electronic<00:00:30.840> board

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
section off now this electronic board

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.770 
section off now this electronic board
cannot<00:00:31.650> be<00:00:31.890> removed<00:00:32.700> easily<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.600> there

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
cannot be removed easily because there

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.180 
cannot be removed easily because there
are<00:00:33.870> two<00:00:34.110> screws<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:35.600> that<00:00:36.710> keep<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.950> in

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
are two screws that that keep this in

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.840 
are two screws that that keep this in
place<00:00:39.110> so<00:00:40.110> how<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.980> take<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.399> out<00:00:41.610> without

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
place so how do we take it out without

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.709 
place so how do we take it out without
breaking<00:00:42.450> it

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
breaking it

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.119 
breaking it
break<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.350> easy<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:44.579> take<00:00:44.789> out<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.120> gears

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
break it is easy we take out the gears

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.549 
break it is easy we take out the gears
firstly<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.280> take<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.820> gears<00:00:48.090> with

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
firstly we take out the gears with

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.439 
firstly we take out the gears with
taking<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> axles<00:00:50.039> off<00:00:53.270> okay

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
taking the axles off okay

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.479 
taking the axles off okay
these<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:55.140> easy<00:00:55.289> things<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.949> try<00:00:56.190> them<00:00:56.340> by

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
these are easy things we can try them by

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.279 
these are easy things we can try them by
yourselves<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.840> these<00:00:58.710> two<00:00:58.949> screws<00:00:59.280> here

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
yourselves but these two screws here

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.709 
yourselves but these two screws here
keep<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.500> motor<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.550> place<00:01:02.789> it's

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
keep the motor on in place it's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.050 
keep the motor on in place it's
underneath<00:01:04.080> I'm<00:01:04.439> taking<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.400> motor<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.880> show

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
underneath I'm taking this motor to show

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.460 
underneath I'm taking this motor to show
you<00:01:06.500> so<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:09.150> reason<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.689> take<00:01:10.020> these<00:01:10.229> screws

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you so the reason I take these screws

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.039 
you so the reason I take these screws
off<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.299> for<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:13.640> board<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.909> slip<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> on

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
off is for this board to slip on the on

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.859 
off is for this board to slip on the on
the<00:01:16.380> left<00:01:16.590> over<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.220> right<00:01:17.430> side<00:01:17.630> just<00:01:18.630> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the left over the right side just to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.160 
the left over the right side just to
take<00:01:19.080> off<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> screws<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.040> keep<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.549> on

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
take off the screws that keep this on

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.690 
take off the screws that keep this on
there's<00:01:22.170> no<00:01:22.409> other<00:01:22.590> way<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.189> take<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.549> off

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
there's no other way you can take it off

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.050 
there's no other way you can take it off
so<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:25.290> take<00:01:25.470> these<00:01:25.650> screws<00:01:26.610> off<00:01:26.930> very<00:01:27.930> easy

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.969 

let's<00:01:33.060> take<00:01:33.270> him<00:01:33.390> off

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
let's take him off

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
okay so now we can take the bulb and

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.529 
okay so now we can take the bulb and
twist<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.539> little<00:01:39.600> bit<00:01:39.979> just<00:01:40.979> enough<00:01:41.539> to

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
twist it a little bit just enough to

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.999 
twist it a little bit just enough to
take<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.679> make<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.759> take<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.149> screws<00:01:45.360> off

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
which are underneath this so I have to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.029 
which are underneath this so I have to
go<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:52.039> take<00:01:53.039> the<00:01:53.189> screws<00:01:53.429> off<00:01:53.810> or

go in here and take the screws off or
the<00:01:56.039> other<00:01:56.159> side<00:01:57.079> see<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.380> board<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:59.310> be

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the other side see the board can be

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.859 
the other side see the board can be
twisted<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.780> take<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.469> board<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:02.640> space<00:02:03.299> to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
twisted so take this board this space to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.719 
twisted so take this board this space to
take<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.200> screws<00:02:04.649> off<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.100> cannot<00:02:05.520> show<00:02:05.700> you

the screws you can see them there very

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.339 
the screws you can see them there very
deep<00:02:07.830> inside<00:02:08.069> if<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:09.780> don't<00:02:09.989> take<00:02:10.200> these

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
deep inside if you don't take these

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.830 
deep inside if you don't take these
screws<00:02:10.590> off<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.069> try<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.430> pull<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.849> these

this this this is like a potato meter
let's<00:02:43.260> say<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:44.400> shows<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:44.940> motor<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
let's say it shows the motor the the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.099 
let's say it shows the motor the the
step<00:02:45.989> there<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.829> is<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.359> goes<00:02:48.359> in<00:02:48.660> here<00:02:48.989> and

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
step there that is in goes in here and

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.110 
step there that is in goes in here and
you<00:02:49.829> see<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.370> section<00:02:50.670> with<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.880> two

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
you see that the section with the two

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.940 
you see that the section with the two
screws<00:02:52.609> if<00:02:53.609> you<00:02:53.940> try<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.269> take<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.950> board

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
screws if you try to take this board

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.490 
screws if you try to take this board
without<00:02:56.430> taking<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.150> screws<00:02:57.389> off<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:58.319> will

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
without taking the screws off you will

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.920 
without taking the screws off you will
break<00:02:59.690> you<00:03:00.690> will<00:03:00.840> break<00:03:01.019> these<00:03:01.230> pins<00:03:01.560> from<00:03:01.859> the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
break you will break these pins from the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.960 
break you will break these pins from the
from<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.230> switch<00:03:05.010> whatever<00:03:05.549> you<00:03:05.700> call<00:03:05.850> it

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
from the switch whatever you call it

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.479 
from the switch whatever you call it
potatio<00:03:06.150> meter<00:03:06.799> maybe<00:03:07.799> it's<00:03:08.010> about<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.280> so

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
potatio meter maybe it's about the so

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.080 
potatio meter maybe it's about the so
meter<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:09.359> is<00:03:09.510> how<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:09.690> dismantle<00:03:11.090> the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
meter this is how you dismantle the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.099 
meter this is how you dismantle the
motor<00:03:12.709> next<00:03:13.709> step<00:03:13.889> is<00:03:14.069> how<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.519> see<00:03:15.030> if<00:03:15.690> the

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
motor next step is how to see if the

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.629 
motor next step is how to see if the
motor<00:03:16.350> is<00:03:16.530> burnt<00:03:16.920> or<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.579> board<00:03:18.150> if<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:19.650> use

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
motor is burnt or the board if you use

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.460 
motor is burnt or the board if you use
this<00:03:21.739> multimeter<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:23.549> can<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:24.239> cannot<00:03:24.510> find

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
this multimeter you can you cannot find

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.509 
this multimeter you can you cannot find
out<00:03:25.680> at<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.400> stage<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:27.450> will<00:03:27.569> have<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:28.519> take

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
out at this stage you will have to take

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.180 
out at this stage you will have to take
the<00:03:29.700> motor<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.120> board<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.950> meter<00:03:31.950> it

I have here no I have somewhere else

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.199 
I have here no I have somewhere else
another<00:03:50.580> motor<00:03:50.880> oh<00:03:51.180> here<00:03:51.720> we<00:03:51.840> are

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
another motor oh here we are

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.589 
another motor oh here we are
well<00:03:54.209> here<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.290> pond<00:03:56.030> here<00:03:57.030> is<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.209> modern

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
well here is the pond here is the modern

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.170 
well here is the pond here is the modern
this<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.590> ground<00:03:58.890> and<00:03:59.250> these<00:03:59.700> are<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.030> two

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
this is the ground and these are the two

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.589 
this is the ground and these are the two
pins

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
pins

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.910 
pins
now<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.470> can<00:04:01.680> meter<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:04.440> can<00:04:04.590> check<00:04:04.800> if

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
now you can meter it you can check if

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.600 
now you can meter it you can check if
it's<00:04:05.069> burnt

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
it's burnt

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:13.580 
it's burnt
or<00:04:05.730> not<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:08.400> its<00:04:09.200> users<00:04:10.310> you<00:04:11.310> use<00:04:11.519> this<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:13.380> see

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
or not and its users you use this to see

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.490 
or not and its users you use this to see
if<00:04:13.739> we<00:04:14.400> have<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.880> connection<00:04:15.750> break<00:04:16.139> out<00:04:16.320> over

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
if we have a connection break out over

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.140 
if we have a connection break out over
here<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:17.730> is<00:04:18.049> plus<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.910> minus

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
here this is plus and minus

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.040 
here this is plus and minus
you<00:04:21.479> see<00:04:21.690> it's<00:04:21.959> dead<00:04:22.290> this<00:04:22.950> motor<00:04:23.220> is<00:04:23.610> dead<00:04:24.120> if

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
you see it's dead this motor is dead if

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.340 
you see it's dead this motor is dead if
it<00:04:25.530> sounds<00:04:26.250> like<00:04:26.460> this<00:04:26.810> that<00:04:27.810> means<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.169> motor

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
it sounds like this that means the motor

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.890 
it sounds like this that means the motor
is<00:04:28.560> okay<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.100> your<00:04:29.370> board<00:04:29.610> has<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:29.850> problem<00:04:30.180> so

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
is okay and your board has a problem so

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.680 
is okay and your board has a problem so
you<00:04:30.930> can<00:04:31.169> see<00:04:31.350> if<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.770> have<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:33.030> motor<00:04:33.330> burned

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
you can see if you have the motor burned

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.210 
you can see if you have the motor burned
all<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:35.820> board<00:04:36.090> burnt<00:04:36.960> this<00:04:37.860> is<00:04:37.979> the<00:04:38.070> main

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
all the the board burnt this is the main

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.590 
all the the board burnt this is the main
thing<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.669> can<00:04:39.240> have<00:04:39.389> you<00:04:39.870> can<00:04:39.930> switch<00:04:40.590> change

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
thing you can have you can switch change

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.780 
thing you can have you can switch change
motors<00:04:42.600> and<00:04:43.080> you<00:04:43.830> serve<00:04:44.040> several<00:04:44.460> will<00:04:44.639> be

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
motors and you serve several will be

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.710 
motors and you serve several will be
okay<00:04:45.710> that's
