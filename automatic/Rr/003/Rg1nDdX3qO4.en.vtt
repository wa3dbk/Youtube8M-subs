below<00:01:04.300> on<00:01:04.480> my<00:01:04.629> back<00:01:04.839> so<00:01:05.140> then<00:01:05.290> you<00:01:05.440> can't<00:01:05.710> see

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
below on my back so then you can't see

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.980 
below on my back so then you can't see
the<00:01:06.010> bra<00:01:06.190> straps<00:01:06.490> at<00:01:06.640> all<00:01:06.790> so<00:01:07.210> then<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.690> belt<00:01:07.870> I

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
the bra straps at all so then the belt I

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.170 
the bra straps at all so then the belt I
have<00:01:08.230> on<00:01:08.410> is<00:01:08.560> from<00:01:08.710> forever<00:01:08.950> 21<00:01:09.100> as<00:01:09.640> well<00:01:09.880> and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
have on is from forever 21 as well and

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.720 
have on is from forever 21 as well and
it's<00:01:10.300> kind<00:01:10.900> of<00:01:10.990> braided<00:01:11.680> and<00:01:11.920> roped<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.490> gold

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
it's kind of braided and roped and gold

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.400 
it's kind of braided and roped and gold
and<00:01:12.970> I<00:01:13.060> think<00:01:13.210> it's<00:01:13.330> really<00:01:13.600> nice<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:14.050> adds<00:01:14.230> a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
and I think it's really nice and adds a

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.050 
and I think it's really nice and adds a
nice<00:01:14.590> accent<00:01:15.040> I<00:01:15.250> think<00:01:15.550> that<00:01:15.640> out<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:15.880> belt

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
nice accent I think that out the belt

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.910 
nice accent I think that out the belt
the<00:01:16.240> dress<00:01:16.450> just<00:01:16.660> looks<00:01:16.810> too<00:01:17.110> plain<00:01:17.440> and<00:01:17.590> black

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
the dress just looks too plain and black

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.310 
the dress just looks too plain and black
so<00:01:18.190> I<00:01:18.220> like<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.580> way<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.820> belt<00:01:18.970> you<00:01:19.210> know

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
so I like the way the belt you know

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.110 
so I like the way the belt you know
accessorized<00:01:20.320> it<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.800> then<00:01:21.160> for<00:01:21.520> shoes<00:01:21.820> I

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
accessorized it and then for shoes I

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.360

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.770 
21 and I'm gonna go ahead and zoom on
these<00:01:26.500> so<00:01:26.680> you<00:01:26.800> guys<00:01:26.950> can<00:01:27.190> see<00:01:27.430> them<00:01:27.610> so<00:01:28.420> that

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
these so you guys can see them so that

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.390 
these so you guys can see them so that
is<00:01:28.930> what<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.260> shoes<00:01:29.560> look<00:01:29.830> like<00:01:30.040> they<00:01:30.190> almost

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
is what the shoes look like they almost

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.190 
is what the shoes look like they almost
look<00:01:30.730> like<00:01:30.760> a<00:01:30.910> sandal<00:01:31.420> but<00:01:31.570> then<00:01:31.750> they<00:01:32.050> are<00:01:32.170> a

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
look like a sandal but then they are a

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.470 
look like a sandal but then they are a
flat<00:01:32.500> at<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.800> same<00:01:33.010> time<00:01:33.340> so<00:01:34.000> I<00:01:34.030> think<00:01:34.210> they're

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
flat at the same time so I think they're

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.880 
flat at the same time so I think they're
really<00:01:34.510> cute<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.110> they<00:01:35.200> just<00:01:35.410> made<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.710> dress

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
really cute and they just made the dress

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.130 
really cute and they just made the dress
a<00:01:35.920> little<00:01:36.190> bit<00:01:36.340> fancier<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:36.940> more<00:01:37.390> mature<00:01:37.540> so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
a little bit fancier and more mature so

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.450 
a little bit fancier and more mature so
that<00:01:38.260> is<00:01:38.380> why<00:01:38.470> I<00:01:38.500> went<00:01:38.770> ahead<00:01:38.830> and<00:01:39.070> more<00:01:39.250> these

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
that is why I went ahead and more these

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.660 
that is why I went ahead and more these
and<00:01:39.940> then<00:01:40.240> for<00:01:40.630> my<00:01:40.750> arm<00:01:41.020> candy<00:01:41.440> I<00:01:41.620> have<00:01:42.070> on<00:01:42.280> my
