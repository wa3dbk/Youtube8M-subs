00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
really like that shotgun a whole lot the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.060 
really like that shotgun a whole lot the
s12<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.390> probably<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.050> worst<00:00:52.350> shotgun<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
s12 is probably the worst shotgun in the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.160 
s12 is probably the worst shotgun in the
game<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:54.030> first<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.449> definitely<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> tac-19

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170

video for you guys and you can see
they're<00:03:03.740> actually<00:03:04.040> at<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.250> bowel<00:03:04.460> 27<00:03:05.210> inferno

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
they're actually at the bowel 27 inferno

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.870 
they're actually at the bowel 27 inferno
and<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.350> got<00:03:06.500> really<00:03:06.860> really<00:03:07.040> happy<00:03:07.460> about<00:03:07.550> that

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
and I got really really happy about that

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.580 
and I got really really happy about that
but<00:03:08.360> then<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:08.630> realized<00:03:08.960> to<00:03:09.050> also<00:03:09.320> have<00:03:09.470> the

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
but then I realized to also have the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.070 
but then I realized to also have the
obsidian<00:03:10.070> Steve<00:03:10.310> from<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.550> prior<00:03:10.880> video<00:03:11.120> and

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
obsidian Steve from a prior video and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.990 
obsidian Steve from a prior video and
the<00:03:12.590> inferno<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.250> really<00:03:13.640> good<00:03:13.850> but

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
the inferno is really good but

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.430 
the inferno is really good but
personally<00:03:14.480> I<00:03:14.540> think<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.780> BAL<00:03:14.990> obsidian

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
personally I think the BAL obsidian

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.860 
personally I think the BAL obsidian
steed<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:15.890> better<00:03:16.580> than<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.910> inferno<00:03:17.420> but

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
steed is better than the inferno but

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.240 
steed is better than the inferno but
that's<00:03:18.110> really<00:03:18.350> all<00:03:18.440> good<00:03:18.800> you<00:03:18.950> can't
