00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.260
 Y 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:14.920
 Now I have lived today that I recommend in 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.630
 three animes of terror 2 though we would be 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.220
 these almost all the time and for that reason so 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.220
 that we are going to learn light is so 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.599
 normal and have better indication as they 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.190
 I said in stereo I will recommend you three 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.420
 animes of terror since it is difficult 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.340
 find the anime something that is 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.230
 exclusively of terror always ends 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.730
 being a goal or becomes unanimous 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.630
 science fiction and a lot of action 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.630
 so let's start 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.400
 the first recommended food is 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.540
 another another is a 2002 level and we 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.280
 tells the story of a classroom that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.110
 appears is haunted the story we 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.910
 account that 26 years ago in that classroom 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.070
 There was a young mixed call 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.410
 I had very good sports very nice 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.540
 from all sides but one day she died 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.280
 and his Indian companions so sad for 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.629
 their loss they decided to follow 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.489
 attending classes as if she 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.140
 I was alive or they were going to class 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.629
 they imagined that the bank was 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.220
 to misaki but to everyone's surprise 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.320
 when they graduated there was a photograph 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.790
 where we could see the presence of 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.290
 someone else apart from the members of the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.119
 class all assume that this was the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.800
 ghost of my here all the time 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.899
 he was among them but the real one 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.190
 problem in the series is not that but 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.130
 in this hour we have a chain of 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.020
 deaths when there is an extra person there 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.729
 there is another to die because that bank 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.830
 that is empty actually does not seem to 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.350
 it's empty so maybe the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.149
 next and our protagonist let's continue 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.830
 with the so-called koichi who is a new 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.210
 student in this class and it will not take 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.399
 a lot in realizing that something weird 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.830
 happens since a young woman with a patch 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.920
 of the eye all his companions ignore her 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.380
 and they seem not to see it, I recommend them 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.369
 in addition they are only 12 chapters so not 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.369
 it will take a long time 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.979
 but for some strange reason that a 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.979
 little afraid to look at it 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.100
 for the throne 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.420
 gs1 to my mind I will recommend you is 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.520
 cat did not fall or also known as 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.200
 ghost story in the days that 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.550
 cartoon network to a good channel what 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.440
 they passed every night and even made 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.330
 marathons is a classic of the classics 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.649
 sometimes there have not been but at least 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.210
 the whole story is of ghost 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.980
 classic this anime does not find the 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.510
 story of that goat plea ones 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.610
 brothers that after the death of his 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.380
 mother moved from Tokyo to the village 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.330
 natal of her but in this village 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.680
 discovered an abandoned school in 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.760
 where they appear they inhabit spirits and 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.080
 evil demons 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.640
 at the beginning the series is not wanted 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.320
 involve too much as we are 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.480
 realistic we do not all like to get involved 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.820
 with the beyond however your cat its 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.380
 pet is captured so it's not going to 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.060
 be another to go save the school 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.709
 haunted and that way start the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.090
 true unanimous adventure is very 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.070
 known maybe they have not seen of 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.660
 guys if you want to see it again or not 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.230
 they have seen him win now we could 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.230
 will regret 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.970
 and the third anime that I'm going to 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.769
 recommend is coronary figuration if the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.510
 name is a little long this anime we 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.739
 tells the story that he is a young man 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.810
 who moves to a villa called 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.640
 Shirakawa is a very nice place very 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.409
 quiet, classes begin 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.760
 get good partners and 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.709
 you share club activities after 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.989
 of classes like playing board games to 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.239
 the letters and all that all very peaceful 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.069
 great until there is a certain festival in 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.459
 where people are healing hinge 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.459
 local 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.400
 it may well be that the issue is that that 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.709
 festival is not normal because a lot 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.569
 people disappear mysteriously and if not 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.390
 they are found dismembered 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.890
 one of fac a cielos pacific days is 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.330
 have finished since these young people 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.950
 they will try to find out what is 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.720
 happening and well they will get into 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.340
 different problems prepare for two 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.290
 they are in this anime because it is something 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.000
 inevitably this series so loved 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.440
 is the super recommend and good would be 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.090
 the three recommended angels of terror 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.320
 for this time I await your comments to 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.970
