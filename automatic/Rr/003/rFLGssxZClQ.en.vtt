and you got to get it done so at home is

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
and you got to get it done so at home is
the<00:01:31.140> best<00:01:31.320> place<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.770> prepare<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.490> I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the best place to prepare for that and I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.700 
the best place to prepare for that and I
think<00:01:32.969> kids<00:01:33.210> learned<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.259> an<00:01:34.409> early<00:01:34.680> age

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
think kids learned that at an early age

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.980 
think kids learned that at an early age
that<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> harder<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:35.729> work<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:36.090> home<00:01:36.299> both

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
that the harder they work at home both

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.380 
that the harder they work at home both
