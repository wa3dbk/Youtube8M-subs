00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.040
 new 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.510

 there are several this year we look like chivas 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.370
 from mexico in much of our 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.830
 music because it only sounds music from 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.170
 Central America to a large extent but 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.670
 well sometimes I have my moment and I can 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.920
 enter and then we also put a 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.450
 arán saw little of yesterday and all 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.200
 these people who also make music 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.729
 good 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.360
 what are you doing during a day of 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.360
 concentration 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.080
 well 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.490
 and exploited it with the applications of 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.230
 mobile with the playstation in the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.870
 room and only buy magazines from 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.700
 present and I try to do 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.740
 that to do that and coexistence with my 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.940
 companions as a joke to pass the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.230
 little while 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.230
 A musical group 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.679
 there are many but one that called me the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.440
 attention last year and really liked it 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.920

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.090

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.090
 who is the most joker 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.050
 like a deer and codina diego castro is 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.120
 one 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.720
 three adjectives that define you as 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.720
 soccer player 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.190
 sober I do not do many paraphernalia 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.290
 especially over the other and saw the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.730
 videogame in fixed that we put already type 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.840
 of classic stretched 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.870
 he was not a classical military acrobat 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.430
 of a sober goalie I try so 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.530
 I really like playing with my foot, so 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.720
 I have no problems and I do it in 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.730
 I try sometimes to fix it well and 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.350
 be well placed because you have to 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.450
 explode at the end then the virtues 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.459
 I'm not the most agile goalkeeper in the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.050
 world without also having reflections but 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.050
 well I think it's good 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.140
