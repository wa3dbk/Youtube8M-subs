didn't<00:02:39.989> pan<00:02:40.200> out<00:02:41.120> but<00:02:42.120> we<00:02:42.329> did<00:02:42.510> create<00:02:42.900> kind<00:02:43.260> of

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
didn't pan out but we did create kind of

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.920 
didn't pan out but we did create kind of
a<00:02:43.380> new<00:02:43.530> partnership<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.510> we<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.720> waited

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
a new partnership that we just waited

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.240 
a new partnership that we just waited
for<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.170> right<00:02:46.290> opportunity<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.860> come<00:02:47.010> about

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
for the right opportunity to come about

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.640 
for the right opportunity to come about
finally<00:02:48.180> funding<00:02:48.599> came<00:02:48.690> available<00:02:48.930> for<00:02:49.380> us<00:02:49.470> to

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
finally funding came available for us to

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.039 
finally funding came available for us to
build<00:02:49.829> an<00:02:50.069> unmanned<00:02:50.370> aircraft<00:02:50.849> to<00:02:51.569> be<00:02:51.690> dropped

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
build an unmanned aircraft to be dropped

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.589 
build an unmanned aircraft to be dropped
into<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.829> storm<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.940> rather<00:02:54.090> than<00:02:54.269> flying

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
into the storm so rather than flying

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.590 
into the storm so rather than flying
from<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.109> coast<00:02:55.400> for<00:02:56.400> hours<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:56.910> end<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.450> get

from the coast for hours on end to get

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.110 
from the coast for hours on end to get
to<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> storm<00:02:58.109> we<00:02:58.709> put<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.220> same<00:02:59.459> p3

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
to the storm we put it on the same p3

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.229 
to the storm we put it on the same p3
that<00:03:00.510> scientists<00:03:01.140> use<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.680> drop<00:03:02.609> sensors<00:03:03.060> into

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
that scientists use to drop sensors into

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.759 
that scientists use to drop sensors into
the<00:03:03.329> storm<00:03:03.630> but<00:03:04.290> instead<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.620> dropping

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
the storm but instead of dropping

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.129 
the storm but instead of dropping
sensors<00:03:05.310> we're<00:03:05.579> dropping<00:03:05.910> an<00:03:06.000> aircraft<00:03:06.420> this

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
sensors we're dropping an aircraft this

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.620 
sensors we're dropping an aircraft this
aircraft<00:03:07.620> uses<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.310> same<00:03:08.519> sensor<00:03:08.970> payload<00:03:09.420> as

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
aircraft uses the same sensor payload as

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.809 
aircraft uses the same sensor payload as
those<00:03:10.319> droppable<00:03:10.709> sensors<00:03:11.160> but<00:03:11.489> instead<00:03:11.700> of

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
those droppable sensors but instead of

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.970 
those droppable sensors but instead of
just<00:03:11.940> falling<00:03:12.209> straight<00:03:12.540> down<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:13.560> instead

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
just falling straight down it instead

real-time data transmitting it back to
the<00:03:18.299> aircraft<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.049> then<00:03:19.829> later<00:03:20.100> allowing

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
the aircraft and then later allowing

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.750 
the aircraft and then later allowing
them<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.209> basically<00:03:22.170> use<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.889> data<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.190> build

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
them to basically use that data to build

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.699 
them to basically use that data to build

new scientific models for hurricanes

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.710 
new scientific models for hurricanes
well<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.519> allows<00:03:26.639> us<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:27.000> be<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.420> storm

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
well it allows us to be in the storm

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.539 
well it allows us to be in the storm
collecting<00:03:28.200> data<00:03:28.290> for<00:03:28.620> up<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:28.950> an<00:03:29.069> hour<00:03:29.190> as

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
opposed to previously you know basically

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.390 
opposed to previously you know basically
just<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.180> was<00:03:33.299> driven<00:03:33.600> by<00:03:33.870> how<00:03:34.170> long<00:03:34.410> gravity

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
just it was driven by how long gravity

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.340 
just it was driven by how long gravity
and<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.519> wind<00:03:35.790> kept<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.569> kept<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.049> sensor

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
and the wind kept the kept the sensor

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.830 
and the wind kept the kept the sensor

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
also been active right now with a

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.650 
also been active right now with a
project<00:04:27.870> where<00:04:28.050> we're<00:04:28.229> taking<00:04:28.410> a<00:04:28.940> dsb<00:04:29.940> it's<00:04:30.479> a

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
project where we're taking a dsb it's a

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.180 
project where we're taking a dsb it's a
technology<00:04:31.169> that<00:04:31.200> goes<00:04:31.440> on<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.740> manned

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
technology that goes on the manned

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.090 
technology that goes on the manned
aircraft<00:04:32.539> let's<00:04:33.650> controllers<00:04:34.650> know<00:04:34.860> where

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
aircraft let's controllers know where

aircraft let's controllers know where
that<00:04:35.250> aircraft<00:04:35.580> is<00:04:36.830> anywhere<00:04:37.830> during<00:04:38.100> its

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
that aircraft is anywhere during its

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.250 
that aircraft is anywhere during its
flight<00:04:38.669> well<00:04:39.570> we're<00:04:39.690> trying<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:39.960> take<00:04:40.080> that

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
flight well we're trying to take that

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.230 
flight well we're trying to take that
same<00:04:40.440> technology<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:41.220> put<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:41.490> onto<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:41.729> rocket

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
same technology and put it onto a rocket

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.090 
same technology and put it onto a rocket
that<00:04:42.660> way<00:04:42.900> as<00:04:43.199> we<00:04:43.350> move<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.680> commercial

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
that way as we move to commercial

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.490 
that way as we move to commercial
stretch<00:04:44.370> space<00:04:44.729> transportation<00:04:45.320> we<00:04:46.320> can

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
stretch space transportation we can

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.370 
stretch space transportation we can
track<00:04:46.830> as<00:04:47.070> Rockets<00:04:47.639> go<00:04:47.850> up<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:48.330> down<00:04:48.510> or<00:04:48.900> later

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
track as Rockets go up and down or later

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.490 
track as Rockets go up and down or later
no<00:04:49.919> space<00:04:50.850> planes<00:04:51.210> go<00:04:51.450> up<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:51.900> down<00:04:52.080> where

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
no space planes go up and down where

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.690 
no space planes go up and down where
they're<00:04:52.680> at<00:04:52.860> within<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.220> National<00:04:53.550> Airspace

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
they're at within the National Airspace

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.940 
they're at within the National Airspace
System<00:04:54.080> so<00:04:55.080> it's<00:04:55.229> an<00:04:55.320> exciting<00:04:55.710> project

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
System so it's an exciting project

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.000 
System so it's an exciting project
involves<00:04:56.729> taking<00:04:57.690> existing<00:04:58.110> technology<00:04:58.800> and

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
involves taking existing technology and

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.270 
involves taking existing technology and
adapting<00:04:59.460> it<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.760> a<00:04:59.910> new<00:05:00.090> application
