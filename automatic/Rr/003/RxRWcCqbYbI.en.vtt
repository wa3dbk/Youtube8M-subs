00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello people and welcome to ours 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.799
 first lenz back or let's go box so 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.440
 I'll show you like you here today 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.210
 Hidden rest can build the no 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.369
 other players should find or 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:21.390
 You can find and here you will find power here 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.760
 a blog of the two is wide so two 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:32.489
 blocks wide three years and then that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:35.910
 Three more, then you do it here 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.660
 in the middle of a slope and here 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.550
 on the right a button in front of the blog below 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.660
 with machine the rail should be on 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.520
 at the beginning 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.149
 He made a rail here with it 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.219
 I finally put it on so turns 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.219
 the rhine-main card and smashed here 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.610
 down in the block the box falls down 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:00.480
 and you 're practically hiding eggs 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.629
 So here's the block to add the kiss to the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.890
 crate of the list should be and 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.110
 Keep crushing everything up here 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.159
 So you smash the block here 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.479
 so that the box comes out so and so 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.930
 then you can do that from the front here as well 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.040
 do and put your blocks like that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.430
 you now imagine this is yours 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:32.280
 house something lex have no idea why 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:41.520
 that just such a great from the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:44.189
 The creature or the pet comes here 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.110
 and then you mark them 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.420
 small border look click on it 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.030
 a box and you can do everything 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.689
 throw it in so we have it in true 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.560
 We still have blood diamonds I know 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:03.030
 that they just purely to get out now 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.159
 sets on the tour here comes 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.610
 again and thinks I have to go to the box 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.489
 there is and so except someone smashes 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.470
 it came out top behind the wall then he would 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.790
 see but I say makes me that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.590
 just a double wall hung on the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.010
 since or does something behind that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.280
 can not see anymore and that's one thing 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.069
 hidden box as you see from the inside 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.629
 really not to see 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.910
 and you can, for example, here the 58th 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.940
 Do diamond blocks purely without them 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.500
 Anyone will ever find the whole thing 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.870
 works on servers as well 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.360
 These are so hedged against bugs 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.340
 that is not much but it should be normal 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.480
 function 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.069
 yes that was it then what I was 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.090
 wanted to show you until the next one 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.090
 follow thanks for
