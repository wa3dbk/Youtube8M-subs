then it's because I have a really fast
metabolism<00:02:08.860> because<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.820> have<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.119> like<00:02:10.240> work

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
metabolism because I have to like work

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.680 
metabolism because I have to like work
harder<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.680> do<00:02:11.860> stuff<00:02:12.160> which<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.610> cool<00:02:12.910> but

harder to do stuff which is cool but

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.320 
harder to do stuff which is cool but
it's<00:02:13.750> kind<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.800> because<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.610> don't<00:02:16.090> like<00:02:16.300> my

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
it's kind of because I don't like my
