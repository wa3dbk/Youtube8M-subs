00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
distinguish that's not exactly easy to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.090 
distinguish that's not exactly easy to

for the regular golden fish it's

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.820 
for the regular golden fish it's
honestly<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.930> lot<00:01:25.170> easier<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.650> of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
honestly just a lot easier because of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.960 
honestly just a lot easier because of
something<00:01:26.040> called<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.400> golden<00:01:26.610> fish<00:01:26.729> bait

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
something called the golden fish bait

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.789 
something called the golden fish bait
clone<00:01:27.570> fish<00:01:27.750> bait<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.080> an<00:01:28.229> item<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.590> use

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
clone fish bait is an item that you use

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.620 
clone fish bait is an item that you use
while<00:01:29.009> fishing<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.430> spawns<00:01:29.700> only<00:01:30.270> golden

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
while fishing that spawns only golden

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.179 
while fishing that spawns only golden
fish<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.409> very<00:01:31.650> useful<00:01:31.979> if<00:01:32.040> you're

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
fish it's very useful if you're

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.649 
fish it's very useful if you're
searching<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.670> full-size<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.479> fish

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
searching for full-size going fish

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.460 
searching for full-size going fish
because<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:33.990> don't<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> worry<00:01:34.409> about

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
because you don't have to worry about

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.679 
because you don't have to worry about
sushi<00:01:34.920> fish<00:01:35.040> stealing<00:01:35.549> your<00:01:35.640> bait<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.479> you

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
sushi fish stealing your bait and you

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.270 
sushi fish stealing your bait and you
can<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:36.930> make<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.290> gold<00:01:37.500> fish<00:01:37.680> by<00:01:37.890> combining

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
can just make the gold fish by combining

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.100 
can just make the gold fish by combining
mega<00:01:38.579> fishing<00:01:38.970> flies<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.390> snake<00:01:39.600> bee<00:01:39.750> larvae

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
mega fishing flies and snake bee larvae

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.780 
mega fishing flies and snake bee larvae
both<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.680> which<00:01:40.740> are<00:01:40.920> very<00:01:41.189> common<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.729> you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
both of which are very common and you

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.399 
both of which are very common and you
probably<00:01:41.939> already<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.509> most<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
probably already have most of the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.170 
probably already have most of the
fishing<00:01:43.680> quests<00:01:43.979> come<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.310> flies<00:01:44.610> already

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
fishing quests come with flies already

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.880 
fishing quests come with flies already

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
in the supply chest too so you just take

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.069 
in the supply chest too so you just take
those<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.520> don't<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.850> any<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.930> don't

just have to look for them at their

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.719 
just have to look for them at their
natural<00:01:51.780> spawns<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.649> can<00:01:53.040> find<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> spawns

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
natural spawns you can find the spawns
