00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.670
 youtube people how are you this time 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.000
 I bring the pipe to the laboratory 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.830
 dexter and let's start I have to admit 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.830
 that as a child I was very fanatical about this 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.980
 series but those times and to think was 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.140
 I believe the year 2005 I had only nine 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.119
 years I saw a lot the cartoon channel 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.429
 networks I always thought that those 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.529
 cartoons were too cool and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.200
 that I would never lose interest in them 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.180
 until the fateful day I went to sleep 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.370
 in a friend's house he had all the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.830
 collection of series on dvd which will 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.660
 they had just bought between these series 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.450
 I was dexter was my favorite series 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.880
 until the channel stopped passing it I did not 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.950
 I know why then I asked him almost 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.900
 begging him to give them I never 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.970
 had seen the last episodes of 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.670
 this series opened the movie package 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.100
 which was new and put it in its 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.530
 television we watched several episodes and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.360
 we were all entertained the truth 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.450
 it was very fun to 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.890
 moment when we saw the extra material 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.960
 came an episode that had not been seen 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.630
 we got excited and put it on the air 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.030
 immediately the title of this r 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.250
 dexter is viniste lic the episode 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.680
 it started normal with a normal intro 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.780
 normal music and so on in the first 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.060
 scene was in his room reading a 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.369
 book on advanced robotics then 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.880
 Diddy played at his door and she said 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.530
 dexter why are you so bored at 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.149
 What did Esther answer 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.039
 is that my stupid sister you have to 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.409
 know that my fun is in 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.509
 the science then dexter took a 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.189
 book and went to his lab once 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.409
 in his laboratory dexter was 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.240
 working on an acid apparently 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.709
 explosive when I entered diddy and you 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.009
 ask again 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:52.170
 dexter why are you so bored at 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.450
 that this replica already that 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.140
 I answered and he leaves his job to 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.939
 socks 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.130
 dexter was trying to work in others 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.439
 projects and you always asked what 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.450
 same dexter simply ignored it and 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.280
 with a gesture of anger he went to 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.340
 khedira and question mockingly 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.229
 where was your fun then 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.569
 exter turned in an aggressive way 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.790
 then he smiled in a macabre way and 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.489
 I said maybe I did not tell you that I lost my 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.230
 fun in the first experiment at 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.750
 I lived, I answered no 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.090
 tell me more about it dexter took it 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.489
 to a panel where there was a red button and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.370
 he told you if you press this button 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.500
 you will find fun then I say 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.480
 he squeezed innocently and a 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.970
 claw that took diddy's arms and 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.760
 dexter said well do not bother to sen a 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.980
 good time after a while and tried to 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.049
 get away by making the twin claw 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.329
 throw the acid in the face afterwards 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.819
 he saw a black screen and he heard a 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.310
 heartbreaking scream I got too scared 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.440
 then the image returns and dexter flips 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.510
 startled while saying 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.280
 yells desperately, dexter goes 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.440
 running to see what happened when 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.390
 he finds his sister taken by hands and 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.829
 feet with full facial skin 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.489
 corruption diddy yelled 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.489
 desperately 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.040
 dexter tried to save her but when 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.650
 I was about to press the button to 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.230
 release her a macabre smile showed in 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.720
 your face and said well you will not go back to 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.640
 to bother me again I will say then 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.740
 'number three' of the claws leaving 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.900
 dirie trapped by an arm to what 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.030
 dexter took the control panel and started 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.730
 to whip the cidh and screaming in a way 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.310
 desperate dexter was beginning to put 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.080
 red and he looked like maniac went out 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.410
 monkey to defend diddy to what 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.270
 dexter screams do not get you but stupid and 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.670
 press a button that puts sleeping to 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.010
 chimp diddy kept screaming and he 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.290
 I was still faceless taking a 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.390
 smile more than macabre dexter put it 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.280
 on a laboratory table he took out a 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.950
 sample of hair and put it in a 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.110
 test tube thereafter 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.970
 dexter proceeded to finish adapting it 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.520
 the face with a medical scalpel 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.650
 Dexter took some boxing gloves and started 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.890
 to hit the torn face of diddy 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.930
 while it moaned and shouted after 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.180
 externally he loved one of his robots and 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.520
 I ordered to be a saw with that 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.620
 dexter took bibi and began to 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.080
 the legs after his legs 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.970
 mutilated I take them and threw them to himself 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.550
 corrosive acid which is lived 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.350
 He tore his face after exter 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.570
 ripped the vocal cords to diddy 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.060
 while exclaiming I will get rid of your 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.220
 stupid questions after exter 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.440
 I took the mountain again and opened the 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.970
 thorax adif and removing the heart and 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.220
 killing the instantly 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.470
 Dexter was on his knees and crying 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.690
 while he laughing turned to Esther Lopez 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.880
 one of his computers while opening 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.130
 a kind of vault where a clone of 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.230
 Diddy was beginning to develop dexter 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.720
 caressed the tube where he was 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.050
 the clone and said wait I just want 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.000
 to be quiet if yes after that 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.130
 dexter destroyed most of his 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.380
 inventions with impressive anger 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.460
 when suddenly the horn of the 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.710
 car of his parents 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.600
 dexter quickly climbed into the room and 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.940
 he greeted his parents his parents 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.250
 they asked where your sister is and 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.470
 dexter answered I guess it's in the 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.960
 library may now want to be more 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.300
 quiet and the credits came out I could not 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.700
 believe it that was the most disturbing thing that 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.620
 I had seen in my life I let myself cry 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.260
 we all call my friend's mom 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.660
 screaming while my friend took the dvd and 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.630
 he broke the disc then threw it by the 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.120
 window I only saw terrified after 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.280
 these years I walked away from all that though 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.470
 I live with the trauma I heard that 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.540
 friend committed suicide recently when the 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.150
 psychologist showed him a photograph of 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.130
 that series suddenly record all this 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.110
 anecdote that left us dismayed at 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.810
 all that spoiled my psychology 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.910
 child had to take this out of me 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.640
 chest I hope I did not cause the same 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.500
 effect on another good person friends 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.750
 that was the creepy pasta from the lab 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.090
