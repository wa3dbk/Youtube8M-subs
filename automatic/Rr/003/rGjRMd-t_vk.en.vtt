00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.930
 Y 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.930
 ah 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:17.390
 he just said hello to everyone today I'll show you 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:21.920
 how to prepare glutinous rice or meat or 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:25.670
 a type of rice very typical of the northeast 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.000
 from thailand we will prepare it from a 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.070
 very simple way and another more 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.219
 traditional we started 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:42.010
 ingredients for four people half 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:46.000
 kilo of glutinous rice and water 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.260
 in a bowl we put the rice and cover it 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.260
 with plenty of water 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:04.530
 let it sit for about 8 hours 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:08.300
 after this time the rice stays 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.640
 soft here you can see that part 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.450
 easily 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.440
 before cooking, we wash it gently 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:23.979
 with enough water we repeat two or three 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.979
 times until the water comes out clear 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:33.430
 to cook with the steamer we put 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.210
 half a liter of water in the pot you 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.060
 we put the basket and a white cloth and 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.920
 fine above 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.090
 we put the rice 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.670
 we cover it well we cover the pot and 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.670
 we leave cooking about 30 minutes 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:00.020
 to cook it in the traditional way 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.570
 we will need a bamboo basket that 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.960
 we will have to wet well for all 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.960
 sides 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.840
 we put the rice inside the basket and 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.400
 we try not to want the grain of 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.400
 rice by the sides 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.340
 just like before we put half a liter 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.569
 of water in the pot we put the basket 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.700
 we cover it and let it cook about 15 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.660
 minutes 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.830
 after this time we give it a spin 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.069
 to the rice and we leave cooking another 15 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.069
 minutes 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.510
 once cooked we put it in a 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:00.050
 tray and we separated it a little so that 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.300
 steam go is important that the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:07.500
 rice keep warm 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:11.330
 then we form a ball and already 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.330
 is ready to serve 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:29.450

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:32.810
