00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
so using the same wok do not need to

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.620 
so using the same wok do not need to
clean<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.479> am<00:02:04.960> just<00:02:05.320> going<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.530> add<00:02:05.650> water

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.300 

and<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:10.989> supposed<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.410> boil<00:02:11.739> this<00:02:12.160> is

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
and this is supposed to boil this is

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.229 
and this is supposed to boil this is
where<00:02:12.520> we<00:02:12.610> are<00:02:12.700> going<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:12.910> add<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.120> vegetables

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
where we are going to add the vegetables

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.390 
where we are going to add the vegetables
in<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.290> just<00:02:14.530> add<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:16.350> stems<00:02:17.350> because<00:02:17.980> they

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
in so just add in the stems because they

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.790 
in so just add in the stems because they
take<00:02:18.610> longer<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.970> cook<00:02:19.239> 20<00:02:19.989> seconds<00:02:20.410> later<00:02:20.530> you

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
take longer to cook 20 seconds later you

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.590 
take longer to cook 20 seconds later you
can<00:02:20.980> add<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.250> vegetables<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:22.060> put<00:02:22.300> everything

in vegetables do not take long to cook
so<00:02:25.900> we<00:02:25.989> just<00:02:26.200> need<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.440> just<00:02:26.830> blanch<00:02:27.100> them<00:02:27.400> with

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
so we just need to just blanch them with

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.780 
so we just need to just blanch them with
hot<00:02:27.850> water<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.560> as<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.620> see<00:02:30.010> now<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.489> color

green<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:35.500> next<00:02:35.739> step<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:35.950> we<00:02:36.100> are<00:02:36.220> going<00:02:36.310> to

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
green the next step that we are going to

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.600 
green the next step that we are going to
do<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.150> click<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.510> noodles<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.400> while<00:02:39.400> this

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
do is to click the noodles so while this

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.070 
do is to click the noodles so while this
is<00:02:39.670> cooking<00:02:39.940> for<00:02:40.120> two<00:02:40.420> minutes<00:02:40.750> I'm<00:02:40.870> just

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
is cooking for two minutes I'm just

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.850 
is cooking for two minutes I'm just
going<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.260> add<00:02:41.410> all<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:42.190> topsoil<00:02:42.670> sauce<00:02:43.860> soy

sauce some sesame oil
in<00:02:48.760> Chapman<00:02:49.630> is<00:02:50.849> one<00:02:51.849> tablespoon<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.480> water

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
in Chapman is one tablespoon of water

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.100 
in Chapman is one tablespoon of water
because<00:02:54.610> all<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:54.940> sauces<00:02:55.270> are<00:02:55.420> slightly<00:02:55.690> tip

because all the sauces are slightly tip

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.650 
because all the sauces are slightly tip
so<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.590> won't<00:02:56.800> want<00:02:56.950> everything<00:02:57.489> to<00:02:57.520> be

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
so you won't want everything to be

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.390 
so you won't want everything to be
watery<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.959> that's<00:02:59.140> why<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.500> added<00:02:59.950> costs

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400
