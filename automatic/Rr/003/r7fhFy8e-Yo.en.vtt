00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:08.090
 and I'm with Claudia 11 in the house of 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.520
 beatriz that we are really fascinated 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.510
 with this turquoise and red Christmas that 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.039
 we have also done to marry them and that 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.080
 really this production that we have 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.689
 fact is incredible the truth I would like 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.949
 part had a great time this is something 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.689
 relaxed to do with little time already 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.179
 because it 's like putting together because you saw for 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.429
 small spaces for more environments 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.860
 modern we are going to put together a tree that 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.840
 be seen with branches with branches on branches 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.059
 are the ones that were on my block like this 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.710
 I painted them white and went to barely 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.510
 some ornaments and a detail for 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.010
 someone young for someone who does not have 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.079
 the traditional tree or does not want it 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.750
 put I always think my daughter the greatest 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.289
 that she is going to her apartment 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.149
 so something distinguished or something 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.219
 someone who has a written for that 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.469
 also the painted boxes that you 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.800
 they are seeing that they are in turquoise and red 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.550
 with stencil with words with crowns 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.650
 good with these spectacular reindeer the 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.330
 boxes or books or whatever type 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.210
 little tree and those little trees 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.490
 have something specifically of the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.320
 reality 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.670
 design is more good than anything else 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.350
 and of course we want to thank to 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.810
 rosary to the child plant our friends 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.660
 of rosary that so much really 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.160
 they support year after year year after year I give them 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.370
 I especially thank the families 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.830
 tours and that every year they trust in 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.350
 I can do something with you so 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.530
 thank you very much and send them a kiss 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.970
 great to the whole rosary family 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.920
 great now that there are also fish 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.290
 are the cables in society that 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.780
 They are grandparents like me have told me 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.090
 that I have changes that is nothing big 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.340
 families so a huge kiss for 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.800
 we are all going to do the step to 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.170
 let's make the wooden myth donor 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.860
 what can you do at home without last 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.440
 minute 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.229
 good the birth of a figure of 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.630
 simple fibromÃ¡cil lightbulbs edited 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.240
 a perfectly white white base 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.310
 ligerito and some are turquoise and others 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.050
 they are red and that we do a little bit 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.790
 I'm going to show you how 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.830
 works when one does many in 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.620
 reality is working in series I put them 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.019
 well because I have left like 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.629
 in that hand we are going to float 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.180
 so you have a volume of little bombs 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.650
 little lamps with a little bit more 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.909
 dark that burgundy red we do there 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.220
 shots shots shot him a little bit of 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:34.190
 water and there we go we're going to run there 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.110
 and this only one detail the truth 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.070
 that if someone is starting can 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.070
 leave the visits too 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.850
 in the case of the part of the gray thread 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.000
 of paint on white that is perfect 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.730
 I did all of them on one side first 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.200
 all on one side then all on the other 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.420
 I'm going to run forward a 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.120
 little bit and once they are both 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.810
 dry sides perfectly dry let's 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.810
 give a line 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.090
 and once everything is dry one side 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.260
 the other in the thread I do the volume of 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.800
 the thread of the lamp and there 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:32.470
 we were there let's go we get one are three 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.470
 I take out the volume of the part of the base 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.370
 there we are was the little bomb 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.050
 spectacular divine clear the truth that 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.630
 I loved it because they are also ideas 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.060
 quick and easy and quick to do in a 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.250
