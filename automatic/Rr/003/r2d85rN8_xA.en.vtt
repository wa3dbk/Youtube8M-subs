all<00:02:21.370> right<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.640> let<00:02:21.760> me<00:02:21.850> contribute<00:02:24.000> example

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
all right so let me contribute example

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.910 
all right so let me contribute example
or<00:02:25.270> tell<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.600> what<00:02:25.750> coils<00:02:26.260> happening<00:02:26.680> so

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
or tell you what coils happening so

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.910 
or tell you what coils happening so
corals<00:02:27.280> happening<00:02:27.610> is<00:02:27.970> when<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:29.380> take<00:02:29.620> a

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
corals happening is when you take a

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.670 
corals happening is when you take a
corner<00:02:30.900> just<00:02:31.900> like<00:02:32.020> one<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.170> these<00:02:32.320> which<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.530> a

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
corner just like one of these which is a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.680 
corner just like one of these which is a
single<00:02:33.040> coil<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:34.830> cut<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.950> signal<00:02:36.690> and

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
single coil and you cut the signal and

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.110 
single coil and you cut the signal and
half<00:02:37.900> pretty<00:02:38.350> much<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.730> kind<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.780> like<00:02:42.120> heavy

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
half pretty much so kind of like heavy

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.840 
half pretty much so kind of like heavy
ordering<00:02:43.930> up<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.380> tone<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.950> what<00:02:45.460> it<00:02:45.580> sounds

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
ordering up the tone is what it sounds

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.050 
ordering up the tone is what it sounds
like<00:02:45.910> when<00:02:46.210> you<00:02:46.330> do<00:02:46.450> this<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:48.040> I'll<00:02:48.400> get<00:02:48.730> into

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
like when you do this and I'll get into

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.460 
like when you do this and I'll get into
that<00:02:49.150> more<00:02:49.300> in<00:02:49.600> depth<00:02:49.780> in<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:49.960> second<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:50.380> how

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
that more in depth in a second but how

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
that more in depth in a second but how
you<00:02:50.530> do<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:50.830> is<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.130> pull<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:52.540> volume

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
you do that is you pull the volume

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.340 
you do that is you pull the volume
control<00:02:54.490> up<00:02:54.940> I'll<00:02:55.630> show<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:55.990> right<00:02:56.140> here

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
so you're gonna take your volume control

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.720 
so you're gonna take your volume control
and<00:02:58.210> pull<00:02:58.870> up<00:02:58.990> this<00:02:59.380> one<00:02:59.560> does<00:02:59.710> it<00:02:59.830> do<00:02:59.920> right

will so if you just like just change the
tone<00:04:15.110> off<00:04:15.319> both<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.680> them<00:04:16.389> that's<00:04:17.389> it<00:04:17.600> all<00:04:18.380> the

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
tone off both of them that's it all the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.270 
tone off both of them that's it all the
way<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.590> ten<00:04:20.260> real<00:04:21.260> nice<00:04:21.500> clean<00:04:21.799> sound<00:04:22.040> out<00:04:22.250> of

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
way to ten real nice clean sound out of

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.840 
way to ten real nice clean sound out of
there<00:04:24.400> so<00:04:25.400> we<00:04:26.330> can<00:04:27.039> switch<00:04:28.039> to<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.370> bridge

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
there so we can switch to the bridge

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:38.950 
there so we can switch to the bridge
pickup<00:04:37.479> obviously<00:04:38.479> what<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.690> was<00:04:38.840> playing

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
pickup obviously what I was playing

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.320 
pickup obviously what I was playing
before<00:04:39.169> it's<00:04:39.440> both<00:04:39.789> and<00:04:40.789> you<00:04:40.880> can<00:04:40.940> switch<00:04:41.300> to

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
before it's both and you can switch to

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.320 
before it's both and you can switch to
the<00:04:41.570> bridge<00:04:41.840> or<00:04:42.199> the<00:04:42.380> neck<00:04:42.560> pickup<00:04:42.889> around

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
the bridge or the neck pickup around

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.129 
the bridge or the neck pickup around
which<00:04:44.330> is<00:04:44.680> kind<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.850> dirtier<00:04:46.850> and<00:04:47.180> crisper

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
which is kind of dirtier and crisper

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:57.219 
which is kind of dirtier and crisper
than<00:04:48.169> it<00:04:48.919> was<00:04:49.729> just<00:04:54.729> so<00:04:55.729> you<00:04:56.660> can<00:04:56.810> let's<00:04:57.110> see

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
than it was just so you can let's see

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.379 
than it was just so you can let's see
what<00:04:57.380> happens<00:04:57.710> when<00:04:57.950> we<00:04:58.130> add<00:04:58.220> some<00:04:58.430> crunch<00:04:58.729> on

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
what happens when we add some crunch on

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.330
