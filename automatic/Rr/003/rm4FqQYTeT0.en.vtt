00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.670
 St St 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.850
 and the euro under pressure 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.339
 high 2 Chambers that can lead to consequences 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.819
 that can be more expensive 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.819
 the mirror quotes it used here another restaurant 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:17.960
 for the same reasons with her singer but already called that that 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.019
 new marketing concept and what comes from others 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.179
 Falk Marco currently has a lot to play and has to play 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.109
 When and if you come then you can hardly escape pilots 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.040
 no matter is completely alien to me 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.040
 or is played is then just the third strongest hand 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.690
 but you have to protect them a bit against them 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.690
 Speyer Kasprzak costs 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.170
 since the Martens our are already in the last episode Haberlander 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.050
 obeys 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.910
 AZ 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.630
 we have little history, so to speak 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.000
 should be sorted internet 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.320
 The goal was dealt out verbally and fly Markus already 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.500
 bit addressed 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.400
 Although very amusing 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.880
 the knee 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.820
 in foreplay ready for Markus Kolke 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.000
 Netzer coach Manuel 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 the question of whether the euro can raise more 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.440
 Of course, the Euromed knows that Markus, I'm a little bit on him as well 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.510
 I absolutely must now oil giant hand says of the Gulf 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.740
 we have to get to the point 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.870
 Collective agreement was APA century 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.179
 With 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.179
 yes does not think much time 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
 calls as last point 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.480
 so it became him to speak 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.640
 after that it acts 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.690
 we promise them 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.350
 that is getting worse and worse 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.480
 for the routes Johann Christof Spannhoff 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.660
 less is dead next to Ernst 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.660
 I was 2 8 percent lately 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:12.959
 They have 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.959
 close to ten 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:26.369
 the brief draw exactly what Markus Golser wants to have from Jochen suggestion 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.369
 12 15 clock from 2008 has 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.869
 It will be hard for young goal to get away from the hand 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.519
 have you thrown about the same height 2 2 in 2 Madame 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:41.799
 at the Qashqai 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.999
 here determines Euro 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.319
 there is quite a situation but nothing with this purpose is not me 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.479
 I do not think that's why I would not go there anymore, mostly male zoo animals 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.039
 Protests tens of thousands plus 6000 backs behind it 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.529
 but still under 10,000 points worried 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.039
 Bertels heavy 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.099
 very difficult, above all, that the contest is in circulation 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.959
 Porsche also laid some good hands over »Städtebaus Königer 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.959
 Cut the boom stifled the tens 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.509
 I would also be surprised that I am now to have it 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:22.289
 Markus Golser wants to repay my stupid sayings from me 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.849
 Last time at the program the occurrence of "bleus" someday 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.629
 show that he is the better player 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.399
 Look at the golden coffin under form 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.399
 Outstanding was outstanding world class 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:39.169
 that certainly gold leaf 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.379
 absolutely and somewhere the indispensable sponsored episode of getting out so that's it 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.940
 possible 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.170
 that is very heavily pressed percent league the weather is causing frustration 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.139
 I hope you do not come in kicking yourself for security and 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.749
 highest performance 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:56.109
 helpful 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:56.419
