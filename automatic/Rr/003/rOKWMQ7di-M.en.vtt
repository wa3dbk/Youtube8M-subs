eight o'clock yeah I would get rid of
that<00:00:21.189> for<00:00:22.000> the<00:00:22.060> demo<00:00:22.390> I'm<00:00:22.540> going<00:00:22.570> to<00:00:22.810> proceed

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
that for the demo I'm going to proceed

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.800 
that for the demo I'm going to proceed
but<00:00:23.590> I<00:00:23.650> don't<00:00:23.890> even<00:00:23.950> like<00:00:24.220> that<00:00:24.570> that's<00:00:25.570> not

but I don't even like that that's not
good<00:00:26.669> these<00:00:27.669> capsules<00:00:28.300> are<00:00:28.450> important<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
good these capsules are important the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.710 
good these capsules are important the
cleanliness<00:00:31.259> for<00:00:32.259> the<00:00:32.349> oil<00:00:32.559> retention<00:00:33.309> and

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
cleanliness for the oil retention and

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.340 
cleanliness for the oil retention and
for<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:34.980> amplitude<00:00:35.980> and<00:00:36.250> so<00:00:36.460> forth<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.930> get

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
for the amplitude and so forth so get

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.040 
for the amplitude and so forth so get
rid<00:00:38.559> of<00:00:38.590> all<00:00:38.829> any<00:00:40.079> imperfection<00:00:41.079> there<00:00:43.050> make

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
sure you mirrored finish on the whole

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.700 
sure you mirrored finish on the whole
jewel<00:00:46.150> as<00:00:46.390> well<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:50.140> one's<00:00:50.320> that<00:00:50.650> one's

jewel as well that one's that one's
pretty<00:00:51.010> good<00:00:51.130> B<00:00:53.370> sometimes<00:00:54.370> now<00:00:54.760> you<00:00:55.510> know<00:00:55.630> we

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
pretty good B sometimes now you know we

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.870 
pretty good B sometimes now you know we
don't<00:00:56.170> want<00:00:56.410> it<00:00:56.530> flooded<00:00:57.040> right<00:00:57.250> if<00:00:57.400> the<00:00:57.550> oils

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
don't want it flooded right if the oils

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.160 
don't want it flooded right if the oils
the<00:00:57.940> whole<00:00:58.210> way<00:00:58.360> to<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.570> outer<00:00:58.840> diameter

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
the whole way to the outer diameter

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.960 
the whole way to the outer diameter
that's<00:00:59.739> no<00:00:59.920> good<00:01:00.190> you<00:01:00.310> have<00:01:00.430> to<00:01:00.550> start<00:01:00.850> over

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
that's no good you have to start over

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.439 
that's no good you have to start over
it's<00:01:01.780> going<00:01:01.930> to<00:01:02.020> seep<00:01:02.230> out<00:01:02.380> no<00:01:02.890> good<00:01:03.130> and<00:01:04.089> then

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
it's going to seep out no good and then

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.480 
it's going to seep out no good and then
the<00:01:04.600> C<00:01:04.809> shape<00:01:05.140> right<00:01:05.500> that's<00:01:05.890> not<00:01:06.159> good<00:01:06.460> either

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
the C shape right that's not good either

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.789 
the C shape right that's not good either
we<00:01:07.329> don't<00:01:07.509> want<00:01:07.689> the<00:01:07.810> C<00:01:08.020> shape<00:01:08.290> we<00:01:08.500> don't<00:01:08.649> want

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
we don't want the C shape we don't want

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.319 
we don't want the C shape we don't want
the<00:01:08.890> oil<00:01:08.920> cuz<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.430> oils<00:01:09.729> going<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:09.970> be<00:01:10.090> away

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
the oil cuz the oils going to be away

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.960 
the oil cuz the oils going to be away
from<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.659> pivot<00:01:10.899> and<00:01:11.619> inform<00:01:12.250> if<00:01:12.460> it's

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
from the pivot and inform if it's

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.240 
from the pivot and inform if it's
installed<00:01:13.420> like<00:01:13.659> on<00:01:14.350> an<00:01:14.470> angle<00:01:14.770> or<00:01:14.860> something

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
installed like on an angle or something

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.179 
installed like on an angle or something
can<00:01:15.700> cause<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.119> be<00:01:16.390> C<00:01:16.929> shaped<00:01:17.259> right<00:01:17.950> if<00:01:18.069> we

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
can cause it to be C shaped right if we

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.480 
can cause it to be C shaped right if we
get<00:01:18.369> one<00:01:18.579> I'll<00:01:18.729> show<00:01:18.939> you<00:01:20.009> I'm<00:01:21.009> going<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.280> put

I<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:39.360> find<00:01:39.570> my<00:01:39.600> boiler

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.880 

okay<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.850> then<00:01:53.539> you<00:01:53.810> can<00:01:53.840> but<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:54.500> don't<00:01:54.530> have

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
to put some on on the whole jewel the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.569 
to put some on on the whole jewel the
capillary<00:01:57.469> action<00:01:57.679> is<00:01:57.920> going<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.159> grab<00:01:58.340> it

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
capillary action is going to grab it

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.969 
capillary action is going to grab it
either<00:01:59.000> either<00:01:59.420> way<00:01:59.689> if<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.530> feel<00:02:00.679> like<00:02:00.859> you

either either way if you feel like you
need<00:02:01.100> more<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.369> can<00:02:01.520> you<00:02:01.850> can<00:02:02.000> put<00:02:02.179> more<00:02:02.359> on

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
need more you can you can put more on

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.330 
need more you can you can put more on
the<00:02:02.509> whole<00:02:02.659> tote<00:02:02.869> that's<00:02:03.200> not<00:02:03.409> necessary<00:02:07.810> sure

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
the whole tote that's not necessary sure

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.910 
the whole tote that's not necessary sure
and<00:02:10.510> before<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.540> do<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.200> one<00:02:12.379> thing<00:02:12.650> I

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
and before I do that the one thing I

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.949 
and before I do that the one thing I
would<00:02:13.580> note<00:02:13.819> that<00:02:13.849> you<00:02:14.269> couldn't<00:02:14.599> see<00:02:14.750> under

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
would note that you couldn't see under

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.039 
would note that you couldn't see under
the<00:02:15.049> microscope<00:02:15.500> is<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:16.640> used<00:02:17.150> like<00:02:17.690> these<00:02:17.870> two

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
the microscope is I used like these two

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.990 
the microscope is I used like these two
fingers<00:02:18.319> my<00:02:18.650> thumb<00:02:18.890> in<00:02:19.099> the<00:02:19.220> middle<00:02:19.250> finger<00:02:19.670> on

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
fingers my thumb in the middle finger on

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.150 
fingers my thumb in the middle finger on
the<00:02:20.390> bench<00:02:20.629> top<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.230> use<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.470> like<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.620> seesaw

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
the bench top and use it like a seesaw

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.839 
the bench top and use it like a seesaw
so<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:22.970> can<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:23.330> control<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:25.250> know<00:02:25.370> where<00:02:25.700> I'm

so I can just control you know where I'm

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.970 
so I can just control you know where I'm
placing<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.390> oil<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:27.079> know<00:02:27.170> just<00:02:27.709> there's

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
placing the oil you know just there's

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.490 
placing the oil you know just there's
like<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.160> little<00:02:28.640> balance<00:02:29.480> same<00:02:29.930> thing<00:02:30.110> with

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
like a little balance same thing with

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
making sure that my whole jewel is is

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.160 
making sure that my whole jewel is is
parallel<00:04:19.790> to<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:20.090> bench<00:04:20.299> top<00:04:20.570> making<00:04:21.020> sure

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
parallel to the bench top making sure

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.350 
parallel to the bench top making sure
it's<00:04:21.320> flat<00:04:21.590> it's<00:04:21.860> not<00:04:22.040> crooked<00:04:22.460> so<00:04:23.060> that<00:04:23.210> that

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
it's flat it's not crooked so that that

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.330 
it's flat it's not crooked so that that
way<00:04:23.540> when<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:23.780> put<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:24.230> on<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.590> capsule<00:04:25.160> I

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
way when I put it on to the capsule I

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.630 
way when I put it on to the capsule I
have<00:04:25.730> a<00:04:25.760> better<00:04:26.120> chance<00:04:26.660> of<00:04:27.050> getting<00:04:27.740> it<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:28.490> go

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
have a better chance of getting it to go

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.910 
have a better chance of getting it to go
on<00:04:28.910> centered<00:04:29.420> and<00:04:29.660> then<00:04:30.140> it<00:04:30.440> doesn't<00:04:30.740> cause

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
on centered and then it doesn't cause

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:39.029 
on centered and then it doesn't cause
that<00:04:31.160> C<00:04:31.460> shape<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:31.970> I<00:04:32.030> have<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.240> start<00:04:32.510> over

also I'd like to get it close can you
see<00:04:41.409> that<00:04:41.580> yep<00:04:43.979> so<00:04:44.979> I<00:04:45.039> tap<00:04:45.339> it<00:04:45.550> here

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.430 

see<00:05:02.290> they<00:05:02.410> already<00:05:03.030> know<00:05:04.030> all<00:05:04.180> right<00:05:04.300> now<00:05:04.450> and

then before I pick it up just to make
sure<00:05:08.700> I'm<00:05:09.700> gonna<00:05:09.820> push<00:05:10.120> it<00:05:10.270> down<00:05:10.450> some<00:05:10.750> more

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
sure I'm gonna push it down some more

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.380 
sure I'm gonna push it down some more
make<00:05:11.140> sure<00:05:11.170> it's<00:05:11.410> centered<00:05:12.270> hopefully<00:05:13.270> it's

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
make sure it's centered hopefully it's

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.030 
make sure it's centered hopefully it's
good<00:05:13.600> let's<00:05:13.930> take<00:05:14.170> a<00:05:14.200> look<00:05:14.470> then<00:05:14.770> I'm<00:05:14.890> going<00:05:15.010> to

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
good let's take a look then I'm going to

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:24.410 
good let's take a look then I'm going to
flip<00:05:15.250> the<00:05:15.400> whole<00:05:15.520> unit<00:05:15.910> over<00:05:18.870> not<00:05:19.870> bad<00:05:22.110> okay<00:05:23.110> so

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
flip the whole unit over not bad okay so

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:38.850 
flip the whole unit over not bad okay so
how<00:05:25.420> much<00:05:25.690> is<00:05:27.150> it

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.950 

so<00:05:39.400> now<00:05:39.520> you<00:05:39.580> can<00:05:39.850> see<00:05:40.060> this<00:05:40.210> amount<00:05:40.630> let's<00:05:40.840> say

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
so now you can see this amount let's say

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.900 
so now you can see this amount let's say
you<00:05:41.080> want<00:05:41.320> to<00:05:41.410> put<00:05:41.590> more<00:05:41.800> in<00:05:42.040> I'm<00:05:42.460> not<00:05:42.640> sure<00:05:42.790> if

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
you want to put more in I'm not sure if

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.340 
you want to put more in I'm not sure if
you<00:05:43.000> get<00:05:43.150> that<00:05:43.330> showing<00:05:43.600> up<00:05:43.750> too<00:05:43.960> well<00:05:44.140> on<00:05:44.260> the

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
you get that showing up too well on the

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.860 
you get that showing up too well on the
screen<00:05:44.620> yeah<00:05:45.370> we<00:05:45.970> see<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.270> TV<00:05:46.660> screen<00:05:46.930> okay<00:05:47.590> good

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
screen yeah we see a TV screen okay good

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.120 
screen yeah we see a TV screen okay good
so<00:05:49.870> let's<00:05:50.050> see<00:05:50.170> if<00:05:50.260> our<00:05:50.410> capillary<00:05:50.920> action

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
so let's see if our capillary action

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.800 
so let's see if our capillary action
tricks<00:05:51.550> going<00:05:51.730> to<00:05:51.820> work<00:05:51.940> let's<00:05:52.150> just<00:05:52.330> say<00:05:52.510> it's

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
tricks going to work let's just say it's

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.510 
tricks going to work let's just say it's
not<00:05:53.050> ideal<00:05:53.290> I<00:05:53.470> think<00:05:53.710> that<00:05:53.830> was<00:05:53.980> okay

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
not ideal I think that was okay

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.760 
not ideal I think that was okay
maybe<00:05:55.150> add<00:05:55.330> a<00:05:55.360> little<00:05:55.450> bit<00:05:55.810> more<00:05:56.020> yeah<00:05:56.320> you

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
maybe add a little bit more yeah you

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.110 
maybe add a little bit more yeah you
know<00:05:56.890> we<00:05:57.010> say<00:05:57.190> two<00:05:57.250> thirds<00:05:57.670> you're<00:05:57.880> saying

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
know we say two thirds you're saying

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.100 
know we say two thirds you're saying
fifty<00:05:58.750> sixty<00:05:59.410> percent<00:05:59.620> or<00:05:59.890> whatever<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:01.960> know

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
fifty sixty percent or whatever you know

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.070 
fifty sixty percent or whatever you know
I<00:06:02.350> would<00:06:02.620> get<00:06:02.890> so<00:06:03.250> hung<00:06:03.970> up<00:06:04.120> on<00:06:04.300> that<00:06:04.510> you<00:06:04.900> need

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
I would get so hung up on that you need

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.770 
I would get so hung up on that you need
an<00:06:05.230> oil<00:06:05.350> circle<00:06:05.920> right<00:06:06.610> you<00:06:07.300> don't<00:06:07.480> want<00:06:07.660> it<00:06:07.750> so

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
an oil circle right you don't want it so

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.840 
an oil circle right you don't want it so
big<00:06:08.200> that<00:06:08.410> a<00:06:08.440> shock<00:06:08.800> would<00:06:09.010> cause<00:06:09.280> it<00:06:09.520> to<00:06:09.640> go<00:06:09.790> to

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
big that a shock would cause it to go to

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.520 
big that a shock would cause it to go to
the<00:06:09.940> outer<00:06:10.180> diameter<00:06:10.450> and<00:06:11.020> you<00:06:11.050> don't<00:06:11.260> want<00:06:11.440> it

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
the outer diameter and you don't want it

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.020 
the outer diameter and you don't want it
too<00:06:11.650> small<00:06:11.860> that<00:06:12.220> it's<00:06:12.340> going<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.580> dry<00:06:12.850> up

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
too small that it's going to dry up

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.180 
too small that it's going to dry up
right

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
right

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.030 
right
two-thirds<00:06:15.390> seems<00:06:16.390> to<00:06:16.570> be<00:06:16.690> a<00:06:16.720> good<00:06:17.040> benchmark

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
two-thirds seems to be a good benchmark

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.670 
two-thirds seems to be a good benchmark
for<00:06:18.490> that
