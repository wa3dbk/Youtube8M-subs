00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.220
 and hi to all and mustang and we get 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.990
 found today for the continuation of the 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.450
 raid of croo pta solo mode 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.820
 hardcore and today I'm going to you 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.300
 show how to pass the second part 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.680
 of the raid 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.330
 as I did with monty time 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.760
 besides I will put you the link of the 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.960
 video with titan in description 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.399
 you have to know that I'm going much 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.719
 galley since my character and level 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.239
 31 as you can see 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.859
 and suddenly it's going to be a lot of galleys 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.449
 but it's not a feasible I you 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.550
 advise to do this technique in 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.960
 hardcore mode with a 32 personal but 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.190
 otherwise the technique works very well in 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.899
 doing their normal help and that's 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.030
 much simpler too if your 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.789
 perso and level 31 so after at level 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.519
 of the doctrine you take of course the 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.350
 flight balance the rebirth and that's 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.899
 in case you die exactly like 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.600
 in the first tutorial there you take everything 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.769
 which gives you agility by 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.180
 against I do not know why the in the 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.460
 last column I changed I had 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.690
 removed the last thing I know more of the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.310
 everything is called here we are 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.960
 passed quickly over the angel of light 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.340
 so apparently you do not have to 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.350
 to put it but put it that makes you 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.479
 always more agility and 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.759
 today unlike the video 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.950
 with the titan you saw with the titan 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.210
 Ségéga izee 2 passes and unlike 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.649
 what's behind it's weird about 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.450
 destiny everyone believes that the 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.280
 character who flies the highest for 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.259
 do some things to explore it from 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.640
 high places all that is the bow 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.320
 to nice the easiest but not at all 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.479
 it's really titan it's super easy 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.649
 to do things like that with my 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.600
 short today we are with the bow to 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.009
 nice so you operate the bridge that's 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.109
 exactly the same as the first 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.759
 method goal all enemies spawn a 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.060
 everywhere to be safe you 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.219
 get high and there you fuck 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.929
 knight who come back and there you 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.119
 already see first difference with the 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.070
 video I had done with the titan there 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.350
 the knight goes to the left so 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.520
 it's really the perfect place here 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.439
 see it's clear it can not be 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.170
 hide and in addition we are right next 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.149
 of the rock where you have to jump so a 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.380
 once you've smashed it up you see 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.020
 it's exactly the same technique with 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.460
 the titan has some small differences 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.780
 see there I'd like to right on the 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.400
 rock and this time the viewfinder at 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.280
 instead of being in the middle of the two rounds I 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.319
 put it on the right tower game 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.120
 planas do so there I have spamit montceau 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.550
 again you jump you do 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.860
 tac tac jumping off the rock to have 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.690
 your the maximum of your direct sauce 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.620
 and you plan the longest 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.420
 possible 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.590
 so here I'll show you in slow motion 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.530
 so in fact you see I put myself on 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.819
 the rock the viewfinder so take it as 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.500
 landmark the viewfinder you see I 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.000
 am on the right tower while with 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.910
 the titan I could put in the middle of 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.290
 two laps there I soar flat false 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.780
 carried out anyway long enough you 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.520
 see I fly almost I'm almost at 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.320
 middle of the bridge and there sword to the 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.750
 right sword stroke to the right I'm 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.850
 put in alignment and normally that 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.630
 pass judge just so with the titan 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.100
 once again I'm wide and suddenly 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.840
 well it's impeccable if you arrive 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.360
 to do that you are quiet but 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.920
 for the big bad I'll go 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.450
 show another technique I do not 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.620
 jokes I find you a little but you 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.150
 go see it was another try where 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.980
 I missed you can still 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.569
 come on so you see there get done 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.209
 exactly the same as a game but the viewfinder 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.319
 on the right tower I jump I fly 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.610
 except that I made an error 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.140
 see I have not enough planes and actually 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.550
 I left too early so that 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.110
 I did not go far enough and suddenly 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.820
 I miss a sword blow to pass 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.200
 and ben there it's okay you continue 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.060
 at spa but you stop especially 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.930
 you go to the left and watch it 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.430
 by putting sword strokes one can 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.930
 climb on the rock so there by 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.040
 against I made the con see I wanted 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.150
 move forward but actually the idea that you 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.410
 have a foot on the rock 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.540
 as soon as you see that your character 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.880
 smooth not you do a double jump and 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.040
 you go back to the same point you 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.570
 hide here so I'll get you back 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.299
 you clearly see the difference 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.920
 so here I am aiming at the same place with my 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.760
 viewfinder game spam right away the double 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.250
 tac tac jump 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.510
 so here I stay hovering and in fact you 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.220
 see unlike the first video 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.480
 here I put my sword stroke too early 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.060
 so that I have a sword stroke of 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.650
 delay of the blow I can not pass 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.000
 so there it does not matter you see I 'm 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.470
 fed up is not especially with the sword when 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.660
 I see that I am stuck I continue to 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.090
 put sword shots I'm moving 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.040
 to the left and once you're 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.750
 on the rock ben there it's a little bit 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.400
 it's up to you to see see I'm beating 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.600
 sword in the rock to propel me 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.709
 a little bit so there you see by 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.850
 example where I walk but then I 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.530
 I'm kidding I wanted to continue 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.180
 running and suddenly I slipped and I 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.650
 nearly bankrupt did me happily 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.030
 I put another sword stroke even though they 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.739
 could climb and there now as soon as 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.870
 I see walking there I walk I hop 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.830
 a double jump if you see that you 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.180
 galerate you see 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.639
 there is art is a little bit of rock 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.949
 you can skip of course before on 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.229
 the ridge of the rock to get here 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.969
 then the technique is roughly 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.830
 the same but again with my 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:40.400
 personal level 31 it will be much more 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.050
 hard so I kill all the acolytes because 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.430
 that's what's pulling away so he 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.180
 will have to kill them all one those who 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.159
 are on the left 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.259
 again I advise you to 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.250
 stay on the left a go fishing 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.479
 call it once again my hiding place 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.490
 but stayed on the left of my 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.050
 hiding did not go too far towards 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.580
 right otherwise the friends are going to charge you 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.979
 on it and can kill you 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.440
 So I'll finish the colitis I 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.690
 will skip one more time on this 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.550
 small column to kill the slave 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.620
 explosive that he really can you 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.990
 surprise and you in shot so then 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.599
 the jolt is exactly the same here 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.490
 you killed an indeterminate number 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:15.229
 slaves and acolytes until 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.819
 the ogre appear and there unlike 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.159
 to the video I did with the titan 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.629
 loeb had not appeared before 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.610
 priestesses but it's the priestess who 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.560
 is better before that if that's it 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.610
 happen do not hesitate you put him 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.199
 everything in the mouth see 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.669
 rocket launchers and all because in addition 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.039
 since I am level 31 must know that 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.300
 the priestess with the titan I can I 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.460
 believe I can hold three four balls 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.599
 of the priestess but here we are at level 30 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.699
 will you go but two balls and you 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.409
 what are you really putting him all 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.849
 so here I 'm going to speed up you see 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.039
 it still takes a while 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:47.120
 no obsa and I believe that there I am going 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:48.830
 finally fuck her here is a man is 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.029
 like that you're a painter there it's 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.979
 really actually the priestess it's 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:53.360
 really the tricky thing really needs to 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.919
 so everything puts him there by cons I you 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.629
 did a montage so well done 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.190
 that he had not seen anything but 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:59.870
 know that genius you're still a 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.900
 twenty slaves before the ogre 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.069
 brings back the device I make you 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.569
 mounting in fact I saw all of you 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.680
 shown in the video with the titan I 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:07.150
 encourage you once again to the 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.229
 to have 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.400
 the ogre fuck you stay you 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.139
 stashed you wait who are you pulling 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.779
 more on you come out wanted to shoot 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.400
 above and there look it goes into mode 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:17.539
 rage and I'm level 30 and again a 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.250
 times I'm not going to have enough damage for the 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:20.509
 smash so he can get closer and 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.979
 in rage mode actually if there is a blow of 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.710
 fist on the ground they will you one shot 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.240
 so to be safe enough you go back 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.229
 so there on the other hand I took damage 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.000
 but it does not come from the ogre it's a 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.339
 little acolytes who had come back from that 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.779
 aside I do not really know why 

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:34.520
 kim did damage is actually 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:35.899
 now every time I pull him 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.680
 on it will go into rabies mode then 

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:41.039
 So you really have to stay 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.539
 in the left corner really do not have to 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:44.729
 too move too much and we like that the ogre 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:47.009
 can not touch you and smash it 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.150
 quiet or so after I hit me 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:49.650
 made me the acolytes there he 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.479
 was starting a case it's a little bit 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.580
 the balls and you do not have any more 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:55.620
 that the last ogre who is the most 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.600
 easy the right one so there for 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.280
 the right ogre is simple 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.720
 really go to the left of the 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.190
 hiding place and you see you can get the 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.870
 on top of the viewer there 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.430
 had the big blue knight in front 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.530
 loeb was not shooting at it so I was able to 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.699
 still does it a lot of damage 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.020
 but frankly it's salt more 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:11.280
 simple you did the hardest you 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.979
 stay hidden you expect them to 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.949
 shoot over it and you finish it it's 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:18.000
 to have the loot our clubs see up 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:20.250
 but I'm going to take risks 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.570
 rock had nearly died if I say no 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.889
 of bullshit the valves fired to follow 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.490
 a kiss all my life at a rate almost 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:25.949
 watch europe 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.570
 I was able to live but the last one shoot the 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:29.310
 actually kill because the icebreaker in 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.810
 flames a little bit the enemies of the shot 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.460
 I tasted the little boots that 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.710
 I already had but it does not matter 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.680

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.240

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.229
 I repeat it for the video with the titan 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.030
 is in the description 

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:43.590
