00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hello and this video from the discharge 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.160
 useful tips we will be with you 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.330
 take apart 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:15.170
 how to sharpen a knife and sharpen it 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.170
 matchbox 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.260
 often there is a problem that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.180
 no small bars and bring 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:29.400
 cutting edge is quite difficult 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.090
 in rude Russian, that is, how are we talking about 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.090
 counterflow 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.370
 on the cutting edge will not move 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.980
 our olesya will still us 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.789
 forming a burr so here's how 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.980
 way we can get rid of house heart 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:51.110
 any matchbox 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:55.550
 has such a draw another surface 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:59.699
 it contains exactly small 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:05.220
 glass sand glass dust can 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:09.030
 even say which can be corrected 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.689
 and make up for that state almost 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.409
 blades 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.409
 any cutting edge 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.640
 i.e 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:32.700
 sharpness increases significantly after 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:36.570
 refinement about the matchbox and so 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.880
 it is possible, in principle, have to grind off 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.880
 able to breton to the state of a razor 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.580
 we had this small scalpel 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:59.400
 with a big knife the same thing only 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:08.039
 the only thing is that the long box is not 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:12.570
 enough with us and therefore accounted for 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:17.209
 several such passes advance along 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:21.209
 the whole length of our lisia 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:26.220
 naturally heavily submerged knife we are about 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.500
 boxes never sharpened with you why 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.090
 because if already badly damaged 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.630
 cutting edge then you need a matchstick bar 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.420
 boxes 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:43.050
 he is used for what for in order 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:49.590
 to bring the knife to the cutting edge of the knife to 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:55.410
 the state we need , that is, remove 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:59.280
 first burr and so that cutting 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.549
 the edge acquired some such mirror 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.160
 brilliance 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:08.670
 which improves cutting performance 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.890
 any knife for this we can 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.079
 use a matchbox with his 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:20.340
 such a spike on the brain and how 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:25.190
 see the burr he's outta here 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.850
 the side of everything you can knock a couple of times 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.330
 passing on 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.100
 the surface is an ordinary bar yes and then 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:40.980
 make a match accordingly 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:43.090
 a box so that there is no burr
