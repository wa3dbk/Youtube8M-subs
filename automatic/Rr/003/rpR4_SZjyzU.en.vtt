00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.870 
oh and I just wanted to show you one
last<00:04:31.480> thing<00:04:31.690> seeing<00:04:32.560> how<00:04:32.770> it's<00:04:33.040> usually<00:04:33.400> a

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
last thing seeing how it's usually a

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.120 
last thing seeing how it's usually a
driver<00:04:34.389> related<00:04:34.930> issue<00:04:35.139> if<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:35.710> need<00:04:35.950> to

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
driver related issue if you need to

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.460 
driver related issue if you need to
update<00:04:36.340> a<00:04:36.580> driver<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:37.720> do<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.080> by<00:04:38.229> taking

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
update a driver you do that by taking

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.800 
update a driver you do that by taking
your<00:04:38.770> curser<00:04:39.160> top<00:04:39.460> right<00:04:39.700> hand<00:04:39.790> corner<00:04:39.940> let's

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
your curser top right hand corner let's

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.420 
your curser top right hand corner let's
do<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:40.960> search<00:04:41.350> and<00:04:41.650> we're<00:04:41.860> going<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.070> search

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
do a search and we're going to search

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.640 
do a search and we're going to search
for<00:04:42.870> settings<00:04:43.870> and<00:04:44.169> we're<00:04:44.290> going<00:04:44.410> to<00:04:44.440> search

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
for settings and we're going to search

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.120 
for settings and we're going to search
for<00:04:44.680> Device<00:04:45.430> Manager<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:47.590> should<00:04:47.800> be<00:04:47.950> one

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
for Device Manager and it should be one

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.530 
for Device Manager and it should be one
of<00:04:48.160> these<00:04:48.310> results<00:04:48.790> over<00:04:48.970> here<00:04:49.180> device

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
of these results over here device

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.290 
of these results over here device
manager<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.460> this<00:04:51.460> is<00:04:51.669> where<00:04:51.820> you<00:04:51.970> would<00:04:52.090> go

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
manager and this is where you would go

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.140 
manager and this is where you would go
to<00:04:52.330> update<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.080> driver<00:04:53.260> so<00:04:54.010> let's<00:04:54.610> say<00:04:54.850> it<00:04:55.000> is<00:04:55.090> a

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
to update a driver so let's say it is a

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.600 
to update a driver so let's say it is a
driver<00:04:55.600> you're<00:04:55.930> able<00:04:56.229> to<00:04:56.260> somehow<00:04:57.010> download

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
driver you're able to somehow download

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.640 
driver you're able to somehow download
that<00:04:57.760> driver<00:04:58.150> and<00:04:58.540> let's<00:04:59.290> say<00:04:59.440> it's<00:04:59.560> a

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
that driver and let's say it's a

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.770 
that driver and let's say it's a
wireless<00:04:59.919> driver<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:01.180> would<00:05:01.300> go<00:05:01.479> into<00:05:01.660> your

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
wireless driver you would go into your

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.020 
wireless driver you would go into your
network<00:05:02.110> adapters<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.100> you<00:05:03.580> would<00:05:03.729> click<00:05:03.850> on

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
network adapters and you would click on

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.210 
network adapters and you would click on
your<00:05:04.210> wireless<00:05:04.570> driver<00:05:04.900> click<00:05:05.560> on<00:05:05.710> drivers

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
your wireless driver click on drivers

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.130 
your wireless driver click on drivers
and<00:05:06.490> then<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:06.850> click<00:05:07.060> on<00:05:07.180> update<00:05:07.630> driver<00:05:07.900> and

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
and then you click on update driver and

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.450 
and then you click on update driver and
you<00:05:08.229> would<00:05:08.320> browse<00:05:08.560> your<00:05:08.800> computer<00:05:08.860> for<00:05:09.370> that

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
you would browse your computer for that

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.790 
you would browse your computer for that
driver<00:05:09.760> that<00:05:09.970> you<00:05:10.090> just<00:05:10.330> downloaded<00:05:10.720> so<00:05:11.440> if

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
driver that you just downloaded so if

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.990 
driver that you just downloaded so if
you<00:05:11.979> have<00:05:12.070> any<00:05:12.190> questions<00:05:12.580> leave<00:05:12.820> in<00:05:12.940> the
