at 200 miles an hour plus and some of
our<00:02:30.720> audio<00:02:30.990> designers<00:02:31.470> have<00:02:31.590> been<00:02:31.620> very

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
our audio designers have been very

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.170 
our audio designers have been very
scared<00:02:32.190> by<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.430> experience<00:02:32.820> but<00:02:33.000> they<00:02:33.090> were

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
scared by this experience but they were

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.120 
scared by this experience but they were
driving<00:02:33.480> alongside<00:02:33.660> them<00:02:34.110> but<00:02:34.560> what<00:02:34.680> we<00:02:34.800> do<00:02:34.920> we

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130

driving alongside them but what we do we
might<00:02:35.370> cup<00:02:35.580> all<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.850> cars<00:02:36.180> inside<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:37.170> out

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
might cup all the cars inside and out

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.310
