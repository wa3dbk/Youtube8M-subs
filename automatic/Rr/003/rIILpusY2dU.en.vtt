00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:11.230
 I saw the English cry twice 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.580
 Yes I know that you saw him at Maradona 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.950
 kid yes and I admit that it was the best 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.790
 but I saw another thing that very few 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:25.029
 they were lucky to see know I saw a 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.860
 the English cry twice clear that 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.890
 one was with the diego and the goals in the 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.230
 86 but not everyone remembers the origin of 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.180
 all that and again I speak of those who 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.940
 they entered Buenos Aires by the river of 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.320
 silver the resistance to hot oil 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.199
 the pebbles and the sea by car, not that 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.949
 I 'm talking about the conflict, it's really 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.199
 well what of Falklands came after and that 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.809
 he is also hateful kid but I tell you 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.390
 another thing of course that the quarrel 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.000
 it came from before it is obvious the English 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.699
 crying twice hatred does not start in 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.239
 82 and the drunk of any and if not 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.409
 before the British saw up 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.149
 the islands to take revenge 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:13.340
 if friends with that face do not lie to you 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.069
 pirates those came with thirst for 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.670
 revenge as well as usurping our 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:22.479
 territory violate our sovereignty 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.679
 you know why because in the year 66 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.349
 happened a historical fact that goes to 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:30.439
 be engraved in the retina of all of 

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:33.349
 ours with some rejoicing in the one of 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.079
 them with total hostility 

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:38.810
 that day he kidnaps that day we assault him 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:42.709
 crown the empire understood understand what 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.450
 I tell you what that means, nobody 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:47.090
 has never been animated 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.739
 to despise your majesty was like 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.200
 steal the bone a dog set as 

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:57.349
 make a goal with your hand you do not give 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.709
 an idea what that means that asks and that 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:02.179
 it hurt them more than everything you know clear to the 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.789
 guys got their butts off when they 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.969
 they saw the rat sitting in the very same 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.880
 carpet of the queen you imagine that is 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.510
 they went crazy 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.270
 and if you understand that they could not believe ask 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.030
 the queen just retired when she saw 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.820
 that a boy in a blue shirt and 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.920
 white and with the 10 on the back was 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.470
 expelled in wimbledon and it would be for 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.260
 satisfied those in the audience shouted 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.900
 of everything and the rat watched them provoking 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.280
 even more for a while 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.100
 they wanted to throw I saw them cry kid 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.830
 above on kid when you live on the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.950
 court by the corner squeezed with 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.870
 Despres and rage the flag that fluttered 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.140
 with the colors of them 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.379
 more anger he gave them because they cried 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.860
 Anger they had fucking feasible 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.680
 they shouted and the rat greeted him 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.349
 raising the middle finger 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.410
 the insults in English and go to know 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:09.440
 one in which other language 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.440
 how do we get that party 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.430

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.850
 but they did not take it from above not no 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.750
 because the rat let them know in the face 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:28.910

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:35.190
