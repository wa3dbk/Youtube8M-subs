00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.609
 so what starts from people and sincerely 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.500
 Welcome to the gameplay com terry 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.450
 my channel in the background looks on 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.080
 trip in nuclear falls on the map 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.690
 turbine released at 94 and will have to 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.340
 say that there fell the thing I times 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.260
 was pretty unnecessary because i still had it 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.609
 over a minute the stairs 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.500
 I still needed to reach nuclear 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.660
 nine or ten kills and then he has 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.150
 I help myself by his goal I shit 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.039
 use the help but with me 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.630
 It does not look so sick now 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.610
 really the aim of all the work 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.110
 and he really did that through me 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.360
 wall or through leaks he has me 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.370
 somehow on my streak to the stairs 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.530
 Nuclear killed as would be in any case 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.989
 really sick gameplay has been at me 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.930
 So say the standard trip in nuclear 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.670
 Maps are so slums overflow externally 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.899
 but such small maps but so on 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.570
 I have never really had a map 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.070
 a triple nuclear can also be seen 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.750
 that I overlooked you or something 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.890
 but I've never really got one up 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.180
 seen this map that we on each 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.120
 quite nice if I have you now 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.949
 managed would have there are pretty hard 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.559
 is on its web too so a gameplay 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.000
 I say to earn 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.439
 and yes, I actually wanted to briefly 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.400
 say to the gameplay and then again 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.350
 the am 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.180
 By the way, the first nuclear reached here 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.090
 then again to because in any case 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.430
 yes yes all yes a 94 so yes 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.890
 everyone that such a weapon but look 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.930
 guys I wanted to say in mp3 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.580
 reach your first murder then play 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.380
 yes the npd dollar approx 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.610
 and that's the same with the triple 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.259
 you really want to learn the loop 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.000
 reach nuclear and that's why 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.890
 if you play the strongest weapon if 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.189
 but then you have reached the first one 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.780
 times 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.759
 then you can do that with the essential 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.590
 kh but that one time you want to play 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.570
 they definitely achieve that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.680
 you still play the strongest weapon and 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.140
 you can not hurt that either 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.759
 just up to or whatever you want, yes 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.930
 say your first time on your first 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.369
 Nuclear and there uses the synonymous 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.229
 strongest weapon so that's the 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.670
 same as with the triple nuclear that 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.130
 I just wanted to mention at the edge of time 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.540
 not a bad one again is a 490 again 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.979
 But with such a gameplay I say 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.840
 times it can definitely times 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.640
 let the next flight instructor or say 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.259
 I see if I teach the door enough 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.850
 have reached after that on the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.560
 In any case, there will be no next ones 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.229
 the 490 plays his I will 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.340
 try the msm c / o the kh or others 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.569
 weapons but here's the first one 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.250
 you definitely want to finally 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.500
 reach and that's why you still take 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.260
 the strongest weapon on the edge of a short time 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.120
 mentioned and then to the people who me 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.500
 on facebook have the knowledge already 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.840
 but those who have not done it yet 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.790
 I have with the protégé project 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.650
 at the vista 96 what made it so 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.989
 at the anton and there I can ever 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.120
 advance I've got to take the victory after 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.250
 I would say home and say so 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.900
 I was really really excited 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.209
 that I definitely won there 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.680
 and the animal will keep most likes 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.629
 to get and the best ratio 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.060
 then I'd say I'd definitely 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.069
 case against the others I had 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.780
 Clearly the best ratio has me 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.519
 very happy without fucking there I want 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.440
 First of me really blatant with you 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.660
