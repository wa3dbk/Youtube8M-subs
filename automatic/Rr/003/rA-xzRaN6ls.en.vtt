things<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.540> I'm<00:02:00.630> known<00:02:00.869> for<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.500> when<00:02:02.130> I

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
things that I'm known for is when I

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.569 
things that I'm known for is when I
flipped<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> table<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.799> was<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:04.979> oh<00:02:05.130> my<00:02:05.340> god<00:02:05.549> I

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
flipped the table I was like oh my god I

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.730 
flipped the table I was like oh my god I
came<00:02:05.939> home<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.299> day<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:06.720> what<00:02:06.900> did<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.079> do

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
came home that day as like what did I do

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.440 
came home that day as like what did I do
because<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.429> never<00:02:08.489> did<00:02:08.820> something<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.239> that

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
because I never did something like that

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.800 
because I never did something like that
before<00:02:09.679> but<00:02:10.679> everyone<00:02:11.310> else<00:02:11.570> seemed<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.690> love

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
before but everyone else seemed to love

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.289 
before but everyone else seemed to love
it<00:02:13.019> so<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.560> guess<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.100> was<00:02:14.190> my<00:02:14.370> big<00:02:14.549> aha<00:02:14.760> moment

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
it so I guess that was my big aha moment

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.210 
it so I guess that was my big aha moment
and<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:16.110> couldn't<00:02:16.470> believe<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.799> I<00:02:17.010> actually

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.449
