hi<00:00:05.880> everyone<00:00:06.330> today<00:00:06.750> I'm<00:00:06.930> doing<00:00:07.110> a<00:00:07.290> review<00:00:07.590> of

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
hi everyone today I'm doing a review of

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.180 
hi everyone today I'm doing a review of
three<00:00:08.040> cases<00:00:08.580> for<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:08.970> HTC<00:00:09.390> Desire<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.800> cases

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
three cases for the HTC Desire the cases

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.860 
three cases for the HTC Desire the cases
that<00:00:11.220> I've<00:00:11.430> got<00:00:11.640> here<00:00:11.850> is<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.330> leather<00:00:12.630> one

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
that I've got here is this leather one

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.950 
that I've got here is this leather one
it's<00:00:13.650> kind<00:00:14.010> of<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.190> regular<00:00:14.610> leather<00:00:14.880> one<00:00:15.150> this

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
it's kind of a regular leather one this

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.649 
it's kind of a regular leather one this
silicon<00:00:16.740> one<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.220> not<00:00:17.699> as<00:00:17.939> hard<00:00:18.210> as<00:00:18.480> your

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:18.659 
silicon one it's not as hard as your

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.749 
silicon one it's not as hard as your
regular<00:00:19.050> crystal<00:00:19.470> ones<00:00:19.650> but<00:00:20.130> it's<00:00:20.429> a<00:00:20.550> little

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
regular crystal ones but it's a little

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.489 
regular crystal ones but it's a little
bit<00:00:20.880> more<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.269> little<00:00:21.300> bit<00:00:21.659> less<00:00:21.900> flexible<00:00:22.439> than

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:22.499 
bit more a little bit less flexible than

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.669 
bit more a little bit less flexible than
your<00:00:23.489> regular<00:00:23.640> silicon<00:00:24.300> ones<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.749> also<00:00:25.319> this

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:25.679 
your regular silicon ones and also this

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.519 
your regular silicon ones and also this
aluminium<00:00:25.890> case<00:00:26.550> which<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.060> quite<00:00:27.269> robust<00:00:27.720> so

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
aluminium case which is quite robust so

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.050 
aluminium case which is quite robust so
we'll<00:00:28.739> start<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.220> leather<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.640> here

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
we'll start with the leather one here

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.349 
we'll start with the leather one here
I'll<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.720> put<00:00:30.989> the<00:00:31.140> phone<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.669> fits<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:33.359 
I'll just put the phone in it fits the

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.459 
I'll just put the phone in it fits the
phone<00:00:33.930> quite<00:00:34.289> nicely<00:00:35.059> it's<00:00:36.059> got<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.269> space<00:00:37.199> for

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
phone quite nicely it's got a space for

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.860 
phone quite nicely it's got a space for
the<00:00:37.530> camera<00:00:37.859> there<00:00:38.039> and<00:00:38.309> also<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.539> bottom

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the camera there and also on the bottom

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.330 
the camera there and also on the bottom
for<00:00:40.559> USB<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> top<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:41.969> your<00:00:42.059> headphones

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
for USB and the top for your headphones

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.099 
for USB and the top for your headphones
the<00:00:44.340> big<00:00:44.519> drawback<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.149> one<00:00:45.510> though<00:00:45.719> is

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
the big drawback of this one though is

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.880 
the big drawback of this one though is
you<00:00:46.739> find<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.609> can't<00:00:47.940> get<00:00:48.300> your<00:00:48.420> finger<00:00:48.780> up

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
you find you can't get your finger up

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.529 
you find you can't get your finger up
because<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.550> pull<00:00:51.239> down<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
because of this to pull down the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.509 
because of this to pull down the
notification<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.320> did<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:52.800> but

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
notification like I did it then but

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.840 
notification like I did it then but
usually<00:00:53.999> you<00:00:54.660> miss<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.640> gotta

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
usually you miss it so you kind of gotta

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.169 
usually you miss it so you kind of gotta
stick<00:00:57.120> your<00:00:57.269> finger<00:00:57.570> under<00:00:57.929> there<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:59.179> not

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
stick your finger under there and not

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.810 
stick your finger under there and not
you<00:01:00.390> see<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.839> you<00:01:01.649> are<00:01:01.829> dragged<00:01:02.280> your<00:01:02.460> widgets

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
you see it you are dragged your widgets

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.840 
you see it you are dragged your widgets
around<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.269> whatnot<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.070> that<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.580> real

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
around and whatnot so that is a real

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.700 
around and whatnot so that is a real
drawback<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.300> that<00:01:06.570> other<00:01:06.750> than<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.470> though

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
drawback to that other than that though

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.520 
drawback to that other than that though
it<00:01:08.040> fits<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.730> it<00:01:09.240> feels<00:01:09.450> quite<00:01:09.660> nice<00:01:09.870> in<00:01:10.470> your

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
it fits the it feels quite nice in your

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.640 
it fits the it feels quite nice in your
hand<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.160> case<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.630> imagine<00:01:13.230> it<00:01:13.530> does

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
hand in the case and I imagine it does

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.520 
hand in the case and I imagine it does
offer<00:01:13.890> quite<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.490> good<00:01:14.820> amount<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.120> protection

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
offer quite a good amount of protection

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.300 
offer quite a good amount of protection
there<00:01:16.730> okay<00:01:17.730> so<00:01:18.540> now<00:01:18.720> we'll<00:01:19.020> try<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.770> one

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
there okay so now we'll try this one

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.460 
there okay so now we'll try this one
here<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.940> the<00:01:20.970> silicon<00:01:21.840> case<00:01:22.050> as<00:01:22.320> I

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
here this is the silicon case as I

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.430 
here this is the silicon case as I
mentioned<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.580> little<00:01:23.820> bit<00:01:23.910> flexible

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
mentioned it's a little bit flexible

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.830 
mentioned it's a little bit flexible
it's<00:01:25.440> a<00:01:25.620> little<00:01:25.830> bit<00:01:25.950> tricky<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.310> put<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.910> you

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it's a little bit tricky to put in you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.810 
it's a little bit tricky to put in you
kind<00:01:28.050> of<00:01:28.170> gotta<00:01:28.320> push<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.280> phoning<00:01:29.700> around

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
kind of gotta push the phoning around

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.990 
kind of gotta push the phoning around
the<00:01:30.030> edges<00:01:30.300> there<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.340> fits<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.760> phone

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the edges there but it fits the phone

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.750 
the edges there but it fits the phone
very<00:01:33.360> very<00:01:33.660> well<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.230> it<00:01:34.800> feels<00:01:35.040> very<00:01:35.160> nice<00:01:35.550> in

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
very very well and it feels very nice in

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.640 
very very well and it feels very nice in
your<00:01:35.790> hand<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.600> got<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.870> cut<00:01:37.080> out<00:01:37.200> there<00:01:37.380> for

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
your hand it's got the cut out there for

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.070 
your hand it's got the cut out there for
the<00:01:37.740> camera<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:38.460> speakers<00:01:39.060> also<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
the camera and speakers also the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.010 
the camera and speakers also the
headphone<00:01:40.440> at<00:01:40.620> the<00:01:40.680> top<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.190> your<00:01:41.910> USB<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
headphone at the top and your USB at the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.620 
headphone at the top and your USB at the
bottom<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:44.040> sides<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:45.060> top<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
bottom on the sides and the top for the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.330 
bottom on the sides and the top for the
power<00:01:45.870> button<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.410> volume<00:01:46.470> button<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
power button and the volume button it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.190 
power button and the volume button it
isn't<00:01:47.730> actually<00:01:47.850> open<00:01:48.480> like<00:01:48.660> the<00:01:48.780> other<00:01:48.900> cases

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
isn't actually open like the other cases

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.920 
isn't actually open like the other cases
but<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.610> still<00:01:50.790> quite<00:01:51.090> easy<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.510> press<00:01:51.870> down

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
but it's still quite easy to press down

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.340 
but it's still quite easy to press down
there<00:01:52.530> as<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:52.980> see<00:01:53.190> and<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:54.420> leaves<00:01:54.690> kind<00:01:55.170> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
there as you see and it leaves kind of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.470 
there as you see and it leaves kind of
around<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.950> digitizer<00:01:56.490> open<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.300> can

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
around the digitizer open so you can

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.060 
around the digitizer open so you can
easily<00:01:57.660> pull<00:01:58.020> down<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> drop<00:01:58.590> down<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
easily pull down the drop down the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.090

this one is is unfortunately they're the

this one is is unfortunately they're the
because<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.240> whole<00:02:06.450> wear<00:02:06.690> for<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.020> headphone

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
because the whole wear for the headphone

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.490 
because the whole wear for the headphone
isn't<00:02:07.650> big<00:02:07.770> enough<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.490> put<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> headphone

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
isn't big enough if you put a headphone

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.170 
isn't big enough if you put a headphone
jack<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.710> there<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.250> doesn't<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:11.850> you<00:02:12.000> put<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
jack in there it doesn't if you put a

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.490 
jack in there it doesn't if you put a
headphone<00:02:12.480> plug<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.200> does

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
headphone plug in that it does

headphone plug in that it does
actually<00:02:13.860> allowed<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.520> all<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.730> way<00:02:14.790> down

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
actually allowed to go all the way down

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.530 
actually allowed to go all the way down
she<00:02:16.020> sees<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.410> little<00:02:16.500> space<00:02:17.280> there<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.820> it

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
she sees a little space there and it

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.540 
she sees a little space there and it
doesn't<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.590> got<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.800> really<00:02:19.950> push<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.370> down

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
doesn't you got to really push it down

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.690 
doesn't you got to really push it down
for<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.420> show<00:02:21.450> up<00:02:21.740> if<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.980> don't<00:02:23.220> push<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:23.490> all

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
for it to show up if I don't push it all

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.160 
for it to show up if I don't push it all
the<00:02:23.730> way<00:02:23.790> down<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:24.630> kind<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.900> set<00:02:25.080> it

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
the way down so I just kind of set it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.610 
the way down so I just kind of set it
there<00:02:25.460> it<00:02:26.460> doesn't<00:02:27.270> usually<00:02:27.930> see<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.500> just

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
there it doesn't usually see it just

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.800 
there it doesn't usually see it just
flicks<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.220> off<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.640> i<00:02:29.880> might<00:02:30.450> look<00:02:30.600> into

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
flicks on and off so i might look into

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.750 
flicks on and off so i might look into
drilling<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.380> bigger<00:02:31.590> hole<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:32.190> allow<00:02:32.310> a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
drilling a bigger hole to allow a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.250 
drilling a bigger hole to allow a
headphone<00:02:33.120> jack<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.570> fit<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:33.870> there<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.080> bit

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
headphone jack to fit in there a bit

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.220 
headphone jack to fit in there a bit
more<00:02:34.410> nicely<00:02:35.660> now<00:02:36.660> we're<00:02:36.780> going<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.930> move<00:02:36.990> on

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
more nicely now we're going to move on

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.680 
more nicely now we're going to move on
to<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.440> aluminium<00:02:37.650> one<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:39.300> was<00:02:39.420> quite

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
to this aluminium one it was quite

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.830 
to this aluminium one it was quite
expensive<00:02:40.140> this<00:02:40.680> one<00:02:40.890> here<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.000> think<00:02:42.750> it

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
expensive this one here but I think it

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.960 
expensive this one here but I think it
offers<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.110> most<00:02:43.260> protection<00:02:44.070> out<00:02:44.520> of<00:02:44.850> the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
offers the most protection out of the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.130 
offers the most protection out of the
three<00:02:45.240> cases<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.230> have<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.660> put<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.989> in

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
three cases that I have so to put it in

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.500 
three cases that I have so to put it in
just<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.620> little<00:02:49.770> class<00:02:50.130> pier<00:02:50.489> I<00:02:50.700> was<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.270> little

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
just a little class pier I was a little

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.210 
just a little class pier I was a little
bit<00:02:51.630> disappointed<00:02:52.260> by<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.380> clasp<00:02:52.830> it

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
bit disappointed by that clasp it

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.180 
bit disappointed by that clasp it
doesn't<00:02:53.489> seem<00:02:53.700> as<00:02:53.730> firm<00:02:54.209> as<00:02:54.290> maybe<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.470> hope<00:02:55.860> but

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
doesn't seem as firm as maybe I hope but

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.820 
doesn't seem as firm as maybe I hope but
it<00:02:56.940> seems<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.330> do<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.480> job<00:02:57.750> all<00:02:57.870> right<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
it seems to do the job all right so the

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.640 
it seems to do the job all right so the
phone<00:02:59.100> goes<00:02:59.489> it's<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.480> quite<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.840> firm<00:03:01.080> fit<00:03:01.410> it's

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
phone goes it's a quite a firm fit it's

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.190 
phone goes it's a quite a firm fit it's
got<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> little<00:03:01.950> bit<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.270> foam<00:03:03.270> around<00:03:03.600> all<00:03:04.050> the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
got a little bit of foam around all the

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.650 
got a little bit of foam around all the
edges<00:03:04.230> in<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.920> back<00:03:05.100> in<00:03:05.400> there<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.540> does

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
edges in the back in there so it does

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.229 
edges in the back in there so it does
offer<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.989> bit<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.200> protection<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.980> also<00:03:08.910> the

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
offer a bit of protection and also the

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.910 
offer a bit of protection and also the
aluminium<00:03:09.450> case<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:10.050> obviously<00:03:10.410> very<00:03:10.500> hard

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
aluminium case is obviously very hard

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.530 
aluminium case is obviously very hard
and<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.280> fits<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.610> phone<00:03:11.790> very<00:03:12.090> well<00:03:12.300> as<00:03:12.420> you

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
and it fits the phone very well as you

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.000 
and it fits the phone very well as you
can<00:03:12.630> see<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> perfect<00:03:13.350> cutout<00:03:13.680> for<00:03:13.950> the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
can see is a perfect cutout for the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
can see is a perfect cutout for the
camera<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.030> speaker's<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:16.530> flash<00:03:17.250> as<00:03:17.820> well

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
camera the speaker's the flash as well

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.300 
camera the speaker's the flash as well
as<00:03:18.120> your<00:03:18.239> headphones<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:19.019> your<00:03:19.590> USB<00:03:20.070> there

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
as your headphones and your USB there

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.860 
as your headphones and your USB there
and<00:03:21.110> also<00:03:22.110> on<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.500> front<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.390> unlike<00:03:24.390> this

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
and also on the front and unlike this

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.380 
and also on the front and unlike this
one<00:03:25.080> here<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:25.500> got<00:03:25.680> this<00:03:25.769> little<00:03:26.150> it's<00:03:27.150> got

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
one here it's got this little it's got

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.940 
one here it's got this little it's got
this<00:03:27.480> little<00:03:27.540> cutout<00:03:28.110> up<00:03:28.290> there<00:03:28.500> which<00:03:28.680> allows

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
this little cutout up there which allows

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.100 
this little cutout up there which allows
you<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.130> pull<00:03:29.280> down<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.549> notification<00:03:30.209> bar<00:03:30.239> so

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
you to pull down the notification bar so

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.050 
you to pull down the notification bar so
that's<00:03:31.350> quite<00:03:31.830> handy<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.519> fixes<00:03:32.880> that

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
that's quite handy and it fixes that

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.800 
that's quite handy and it fixes that
problem<00:03:33.920> it's<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:35.040> little<00:03:35.250> bit<00:03:35.370> fat<00:03:35.810> which

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
problem it's a little bit fat which

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.690 
problem it's a little bit fat which
means<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.410> in<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.739> little<00:03:37.890> bit<00:03:38.070> heavy<00:03:38.280> as<00:03:38.489> well

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
means you in a little bit heavy as well

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.460 
means you in a little bit heavy as well
so<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.000> probably<00:03:39.390> wouldn't<00:03:39.810> carry<00:03:40.080> this<00:03:40.290> one

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
so you probably wouldn't carry this one

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.490 
so you probably wouldn't carry this one
around<00:03:40.799> every<00:03:41.340> day<00:03:41.519> unless<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:42.570> are<00:03:42.780> on<00:03:43.470> a

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
around every day unless you are on a

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.009 
around every day unless you are on a
construction<00:03:43.829> site<00:03:44.340> or<00:03:44.519> something<00:03:44.910> but<00:03:45.570> if

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
construction site or something but if

the time it's a good balance between

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.860 
the time it's a good balance between
protection<00:04:04.320> and<00:04:04.560> being<00:04:04.920> too<00:04:05.130> bulky<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:06.660> this
