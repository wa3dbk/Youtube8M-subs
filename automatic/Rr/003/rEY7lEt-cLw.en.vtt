00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
wrapped with a graphite so it's a real

fast recoil and the black steel is a
very<00:00:55.450> very<00:00:55.690> good<00:00:55.899> tool<00:00:56.170> it's<00:00:56.620> also<00:00:56.739> a<00:00:56.890> little

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
very very good tool it's also a little

very very good tool it's also a little
shorter<00:00:57.460> rod<00:00:57.670> because<00:00:58.180> we're<00:00:58.329> fishing<00:00:58.600> a

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
shorter rod because we're fishing a

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.880 
shorter rod because we're fishing a
little<00:00:58.750> closer<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.350> boat<00:00:59.500> we<00:00:59.649> don't<00:00:59.800> need

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
little closer to the boat we don't need

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.819 
little closer to the boat we don't need
to<00:01:00.010> make<00:01:00.130> that<00:01:00.310> long<00:01:00.550> cast<00:01:00.940> now<00:01:01.630> on<00:01:02.380> a<00:01:02.410> jig<00:01:02.800> like

to make that long cast now on a jig like
this<00:01:03.220> which<00:01:03.370> is<00:01:03.489> a<00:01:03.520> mega<00:01:03.790> bait<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:05.320> act<00:01:05.439> a

this which is a mega bait they act a
little<00:01:05.649> different<00:01:06.070> than<00:01:06.189> the<00:01:06.540> popular<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
baits like them will flutter as they go

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.010 
baits like them will flutter as they go
down<00:01:15.609> they<00:01:15.819> flutter<00:01:16.060> very<00:01:16.359> effectively<00:01:16.810> they

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
down they flutter very effectively they

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.870 
down they flutter very effectively they
don't<00:01:17.170> drop<00:01:17.380> fast<00:01:17.740> they<00:01:18.069> flutter<00:01:18.369> in<00:01:18.549> dart<00:01:18.759> in

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
don't drop fast they flutter in dart in

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.459 
don't drop fast they flutter in dart in
different<00:01:19.149> directions<00:01:19.569> so<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:20.020> lot<00:01:20.170> of<00:01:20.259> times

wind down to that fish obviously you
know<00:01:44.289> you're<00:01:44.380> gonna<00:01:44.499> bite<00:01:44.740> right<00:01:44.979> down<00:01:45.159> to<00:01:45.310> it

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
know you're gonna bite right down to it

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.160 
know you're gonna bite right down to it
you<00:01:45.490> swing<00:01:45.909> because<00:01:46.329> that<00:01:46.509> fish<00:01:46.749> has<00:01:46.929> picked

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
you swing because that fish has picked

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.129 
you swing because that fish has picked
it<00:01:47.289> up<00:01:47.380> on<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:48.069> drop<00:01:48.310> now<00:01:49.090> another<00:01:49.659> effective

it up on the drop now another effective

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:51.160 
it up on the drop now another effective
way<00:01:50.289> to<00:01:50.349> do

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
way to do

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.920 
way to do
a<00:01:51.229> vertical<00:01:51.710> yoyo<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.299> go<00:01:53.420> ahead<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:53.750> take

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
a vertical yoyo is to go ahead and take

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.859 
a vertical yoyo is to go ahead and take
the<00:01:54.080> jig<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:54.710> pinch<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.580> jig<00:01:55.850> on<00:01:56.180> out<00:01:56.600> away

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
the jig and pinch the jig on out away

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.090 
the jig and pinch the jig on out away
from<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.110> boat<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.380> little<00:01:57.500> ways<00:01:57.740> if<00:01:58.009> you're

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
from the boat a little ways if you're

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.219 
from the boat a little ways if you're
gonna<00:01:58.250> pitch<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.729> jig<00:01:58.939> out<00:01:59.090> far<00:01:59.450> enough<00:01:59.659> to

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
gonna pitch the jig out far enough to

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.679 
gonna pitch the jig out far enough to
where<00:02:00.259> it's<00:02:00.530> coming<00:02:00.799> letter<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.460> down<00:02:01.640> a

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
where it's coming letter it down a

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.870 
where it's coming letter it down a
little<00:02:02.689> more<00:02:02.840> flutter<00:02:06.369> if<00:02:07.369> you're<00:02:07.520> not<00:02:07.670> really

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
little more flutter if you're not really

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.729 
little more flutter if you're not really
comfortable<00:02:08.179> with<00:02:08.450> underhanded<00:02:09.289> or<00:02:09.410> pitch<00:02:09.590> in

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
comfortable with underhanded or pitch in

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.530 
comfortable with underhanded or pitch in
a<00:02:09.800> jig<00:02:10.009> an<00:02:10.280> overhand<00:02:10.670> cast<00:02:10.910> one<00:02:11.239> like<00:02:11.390> this

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
a jig an overhand cast one like this

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.910 
a jig an overhand cast one like this
it's<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.810> little<00:02:12.050> harder<00:02:12.290> with<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.470> shorter<00:02:12.770> rod

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
it's a little harder with a shorter rod

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.820 
it's a little harder with a shorter rod
but<00:02:13.760> another<00:02:14.660> easy<00:02:14.900> way<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.140> do<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.650> fish

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
but another easy way to do it is to fish

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.949 
but another easy way to do it is to fish
with<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.130> wind<00:02:16.340> in<00:02:16.459> your<00:02:16.489> face<00:02:16.610> very<00:02:17.120> rarely

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
with the wind in your face very rarely

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.540 
with the wind in your face very rarely
when<00:02:18.230> you're<00:02:18.380> out<00:02:18.470> tuna<00:02:18.769> fishing<00:02:18.980> or<00:02:19.220> sliding

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
when you're out tuna fishing or sliding

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.250 
when you're out tuna fishing or sliding
up<00:02:19.640> on<00:02:19.760> Paddy's<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.300> ever<00:02:20.450> drop<00:02:20.690> an<00:02:20.840> anchor<00:02:20.959> and

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
up on Paddy's to ever drop an anchor and

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.960 
up on Paddy's to ever drop an anchor and
just<00:02:21.590> simply<00:02:21.800> cuz<00:02:22.010> you're<00:02:22.190> into<00:02:22.459> deep<00:02:22.640> water

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
just simply cuz you're into deep water

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.430 
just simply cuz you're into deep water
so<00:02:23.510> if<00:02:23.569> you<00:02:23.660> keep<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.959> wind<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.290> your<00:02:24.319> face

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
so if you keep the wind in your face

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.920 
so if you keep the wind in your face
with<00:02:25.069> no<00:02:25.190> angles<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.760> no<00:02:25.850> tangles<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.720> want

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
with no angles and no tangles you want

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.320 
with no angles and no tangles you want
to<00:02:26.989> make<00:02:27.110> sure<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.069> drop<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.489> jig<00:02:28.730> with

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
to make sure that you drop that jig with

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.640 
to make sure that you drop that jig with
the<00:02:29.420> wind<00:02:29.630> in<00:02:29.720> your<00:02:29.750> face<00:02:30.049> because<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.410> boat

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
the wind in your face because the boat

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.530 
the wind in your face because the boat
is<00:02:30.680> gonna<00:02:30.950> be<00:02:31.160> drifting<00:02:31.400> over<00:02:31.700> downwind<00:02:32.299> and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
is gonna be drifting over downwind and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.479 
is gonna be drifting over downwind and
that's<00:02:33.019> gonna<00:02:33.230> naturally<00:02:33.470> carry<00:02:34.069> your<00:02:34.220> jig

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
that's gonna naturally carry your jig

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.570 
that's gonna naturally carry your jig
out<00:02:34.640> away<00:02:34.970> from<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.920> boat<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.310> it's<00:02:37.459> gonna

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
out away from the boat so it's gonna

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.979 
out away from the boat so it's gonna
cover<00:02:37.819> more<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.209> water<00:02:38.420> column<00:02:38.780> as<00:02:38.870> it

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
cover more of the water column as it

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.300 
cover more of the water column as it
flutters<00:02:39.200> down<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.799> you're<00:02:39.920> gonna<00:02:40.010> bring<00:02:40.220> it

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
flutters down and you're gonna bring it

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.890 
flutters down and you're gonna bring it
back<00:02:40.489> on<00:02:40.730> an<00:02:40.850> angle<00:02:41.209> as<00:02:41.299> opposed<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.750> straight

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
back on an angle as opposed to straight

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.170 
back on an angle as opposed to straight
up<00:02:42.040> sometimes<00:02:43.040> fish<00:02:43.280> will<00:02:43.430> hit<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.610> jig<00:02:43.850> coming

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
up sometimes fish will hit a jig coming

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.650 
up sometimes fish will hit a jig coming
straight<00:02:44.450> up

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
straight up

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.059 
straight up
sometimes<00:02:45.380> they'll<00:02:45.530> hit<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.769> on<00:02:45.830> an<00:02:45.950> angle

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
sometimes they'll hit it on an angle

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.100 
sometimes they'll hit it on an angle
sometimes<00:02:46.970> they'll<00:02:47.150> hit<00:02:47.299> it<00:02:47.330> on<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.569> sink<00:02:47.870> so

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
sometimes they'll hit it on the sink so

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.870 
sometimes they'll hit it on the sink so
you<00:02:48.140> got<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.410> be<00:02:48.500> aware<00:02:48.590> at<00:02:48.950> all<00:02:49.100> times<00:02:49.400> now

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
you got to be aware at all times now

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.490 
you got to be aware at all times now
when<00:02:50.060> you're<00:02:50.180> gonna<00:02:50.269> wind<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.720> Jacob<00:02:51.140> you

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
when you're gonna wind that Jacob you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.050 
when you're gonna wind that Jacob you
don't<00:02:51.650> want<00:02:51.769> to<00:02:51.860> just<00:02:52.010> turn<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.250> handle<00:02:52.549> you

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
don't want to just turn the handle you

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.460 
don't want to just turn the handle you
want<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.269> go<00:02:53.330> ahead<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.600> bounce<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:54.049> jig<00:02:54.290> up

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
want to go ahead and bounce that jig up

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.560 
want to go ahead and bounce that jig up
like<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.459> bounce<00:02:55.850> it<00:02:56.000> up<00:02:56.120> in<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.359> you<00:02:56.510> know

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
like this and bounce it up in a you know

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.690 
like this and bounce it up in a you know
yo-yo<00:02:57.019> manner<00:02:57.350> so<00:02:57.650> where<00:02:57.829> it's<00:02:57.950> darting<00:02:58.430> and

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
yo-yo manner so where it's darting and

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.000 
yo-yo manner so where it's darting and
skittering<00:02:59.540> through<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.049> water<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.920> it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
skittering through the water so it

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.210 
skittering through the water so it
appears<00:03:01.459> so<00:03:01.579> I<00:03:01.640> could<00:03:01.850> say<00:03:02.049> it's<00:03:03.049> a<00:03:03.260> bait<00:03:04.040> fish

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
appears so I could say it's a bait fish

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.340 
appears so I could say it's a bait fish
trying<00:03:04.579> to<00:03:04.700> escape<00:03:04.940> attack<00:03:05.450> or<00:03:05.780> it's<00:03:05.900> wounded

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
trying to escape attack or it's wounded

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.349 
trying to escape attack or it's wounded
and<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:07.100> lot<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.280> times<00:03:07.579> you'll<00:03:07.730> draw<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:07.970> strike

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
and a lot of times you'll draw a strike

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.539 
and a lot of times you'll draw a strike
from<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.720> fish<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.590> normally<00:03:10.070> wouldn't<00:03:10.370> hit<00:03:10.519> a

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
from a fish that normally wouldn't hit a

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.190 
from a fish that normally wouldn't hit a
bait<00:03:10.790> because<00:03:11.150> it's<00:03:11.420> reactionary<00:03:12.049> it's

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
bait because it's reactionary it's

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.690 
bait because it's reactionary it's
instinctive<00:03:12.799> they<00:03:12.980> see<00:03:13.040> something<00:03:13.549> that's

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
instinctive they see something that's

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.970 
instinctive they see something that's
it's<00:03:14.269> in<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.870> panic<00:03:15.290> or<00:03:15.440> something<00:03:15.799> that's

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
it's in a panic or something that's

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.800 
it's in a panic or something that's
trying<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:16.640> get<00:03:16.790> away<00:03:17.000> in<00:03:17.120> an<00:03:17.239> erratic<00:03:17.660> manner

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
trying to get away in an erratic manner

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.330 
trying to get away in an erratic manner
and<00:03:18.230> they'll<00:03:18.530> hit<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:18.829> just<00:03:19.070> kind<00:03:19.280> of

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
and they'll hit it just kind of

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.520 
and they'll hit it just kind of
reactively<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.239> that's<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.989> good<00:03:21.170> effective

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
reactively so that's a good effective

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.870 
reactively so that's a good effective
way<00:03:21.739> to<00:03:21.799> get<00:03:22.010> some<00:03:22.190> fish<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.519> bite<00:03:22.670> that

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
way to get some fish to bite that

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.009 
way to get some fish to bite that
normally<00:03:23.239> wouldn't<00:03:23.450> it's<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.810> little

normally wouldn't it's a little

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.330 
normally wouldn't it's a little
different<00:03:24.170> technique<00:03:24.500> than<00:03:24.709> fishing<00:03:25.250> the

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340

long rod for the surface iron but very

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.080 
long rod for the surface iron but very
very<00:03:27.680> effective<00:03:28.160> at<00:03:28.280> times<00:03:28.489> so<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:28.850> needs<00:03:29.000> to

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
very effective at times so it needs to

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.539
