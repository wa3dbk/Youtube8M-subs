in<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:33.239> breeders<00:00:33.690> box<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.230> comes<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.180> box

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
in a breeders box that comes in a box

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.030 
in a breeders box that comes in a box
that<00:00:36.600> normally<00:00:37.020> which<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:37.800> big<00:00:38.010> enough

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
that normally which is just big enough

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.410 
that normally which is just big enough
for<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.760> something<00:00:39.239> little<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.750> this

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
for it something little like this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.639 
for it something little like this
manageable<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.570> as<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.620> wider<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.489> grid<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
manageable so as a wider and a grid and

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.779 
manageable so as a wider and a grid and
they're<00:00:46.649> good<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.219> see<00:00:47.399> through<00:00:47.610> them

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
they're good you can see through them

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.220 
they're good you can see through them
they<00:00:47.940> float<00:00:48.270> easy<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.840> clean<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.170> everything

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
they float easy to clean and everything

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.400 
they float easy to clean and everything
like<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.670> second<00:00:50.670> thing<00:00:51.079> and<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.379> think

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
like that second thing and this I think

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.709 
like that second thing and this I think
is<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.829> little<00:00:52.980> bit<00:00:53.160> bigger

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
is a little bit bigger

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.000 
is a little bit bigger
I<00:00:55.219> just<00:00:56.219> got<00:00:56.460> both<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.030> them<00:00:57.270> net<00:00:57.690> breeder

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
I just got both it's them net breeder

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
quite flimsy breaks pretty easily and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.120

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.550 
just got to fake plastic plants and the
reason<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.780> them<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:30.990> there<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.470> so

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
reason I have them in there is just so

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.960 
reason I have them in there is just so
they<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.740> hide<00:01:32.040> from<00:01:32.189> my<00:01:32.369> other<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.729> bigger

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
they can hide from my other like bigger

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.469 
they can hide from my other like bigger
fish<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.450> my<00:01:33.570> Barb's<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.290> sore<00:01:34.619> tail<00:01:35.479> so

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
fish like my Barb's and sore tail so

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.550 
fish like my Barb's and sore tail so
just<00:01:36.659> basically<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.409> and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
just basically have it like that and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.960 
just basically have it like that and
also<00:01:37.680> gives<00:01:37.950> them<00:01:38.070> something<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.490> sleep<00:01:38.700> palms

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
also gives them something to sleep palms

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.730 
also gives them something to sleep palms
and<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.270> interact<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> chase<00:01:40.439> them

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
and it's interact with and to chase them

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.039 
and it's interact with and to chase them
around<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> good<00:01:41.490> time<00:01:41.930> that's<00:01:42.930> what

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
around and have a good time that's what

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.100 
around and have a good time that's what
I<00:01:43.079> recommend<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.869> keep<00:01:45.960> their

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
I recommend and I just keep their

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.850 
I recommend and I just keep their
annoying<00:01:46.229> community<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.009> check<00:01:47.899> okay<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
annoying community to check okay the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.469 
annoying community to check okay the
temperature<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> same<00:01:50.729> probable<00:01:51.240> you

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
temperature is the same probable you

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.740 
temperature is the same probable you
know<00:01:51.770> eighty<00:01:52.770> degrees<00:01:53.340> Fahrenheit<00:01:53.970> or<00:01:54.390> that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
know eighty degrees Fahrenheit or that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.600 
know eighty degrees Fahrenheit or that
would<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.049> twenty<00:01:55.290> six<00:01:55.470> degrees<00:01:55.610> roughly

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
would be like twenty six degrees roughly

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.100 
would be like twenty six degrees roughly
