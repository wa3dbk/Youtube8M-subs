anyway as our first question comes in

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.529 
anyway as our first question comes in
from<00:00:15.929> Metallica's<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.920> he<00:00:17.400> asks<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.240> class

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
from Metallica's and he asks what class

coop<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.410> think<00:00:19.590> demon<00:00:19.980> hunters<00:00:20.340> will

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
coop do you think demon hunters will

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.010 
coop do you think demon hunters will
have<00:00:20.699> thought<00:00:21.090> about<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.330> one<00:00:21.600> quite<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> bit

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
have thought about this one quite a bit

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.900 
have thought about this one quite a bit
myself<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.710> they<00:00:22.980> think<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.310> will<00:00:23.430> have<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.880> be

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
myself and they think it will have to be

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.330 
myself and they think it will have to be
green<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.750> even<00:00:25.410> though<00:00:25.500> hunters<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.010> monks

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
green and even though hunters and monks

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.640 
green and even though hunters and monks
kind<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.760> overlap<00:00:27.150> already<00:00:27.599> hunters<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
kind of overlap already hunters have a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.359 
kind of overlap already hunters have a
kind<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.070> faded<00:00:29.849> or<00:00:30.000> limey<00:00:30.689> green<00:00:31.560> well<00:00:32.070> monks

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
kind of faded or limey green well monks

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.950 
kind of faded or limey green well monks
a<00:00:32.430> little<00:00:32.640> bit<00:00:32.759> closer<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.180> turquoise<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.780> think

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
a little bit closer to turquoise I think

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.049 
a little bit closer to turquoise I think
demon<00:00:34.200> hunters<00:00:34.500> will<00:00:34.829> be<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> kind<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.340> toxic

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
demon hunters will be a kind of toxic

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.420 
demon hunters will be a kind of toxic
green<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.780> similar<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> warlocks<00:00:38.040> green

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
green and similar to a warlocks green

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.160 
green and similar to a warlocks green
fire<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.149> only<00:00:39.329> other<00:00:39.360> alternatives<00:00:39.989> are<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
fire the only other alternatives are a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.990 
fire the only other alternatives are a
different<00:00:40.410> kind<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.890> pair<00:00:41.129> for<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> wallet<00:00:41.850> so

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
different kind of pair for the wallet so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.720 
different kind of pair for the wallet so
maybe<00:00:42.180> some<00:00:42.390> kind<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.719> dark<00:00:43.379> gray<00:00:43.860> yeah<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.640> if

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
maybe some kind of dark gray yeah but if

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.729 
maybe some kind of dark gray yeah but if
I<00:00:44.820> had<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.120> bet<00:00:45.270> I'd<00:00:45.510> probably<00:00:46.050> still<00:00:46.260> go<00:00:46.440> green

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
I had to bet I'd probably still go green

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.440 
I had to bet I'd probably still go green

competitive in PvP again when it comes
to<00:01:13.979> best<00:01:14.220> damage<00:01:14.640> I'd<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.810> have

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
to best damage I'd so that we have

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
to best damage I'd so that we have
enough<00:01:16.049> already<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.979> me<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> problem<00:01:17.369> is

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
enough already for me the problem is

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.730 
enough already for me the problem is
that<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.150> nothing<00:01:18.689> outside<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.560> all

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that we have nothing outside of all

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.350 
that we have nothing outside of all
bears<00:01:19.979> damage<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.850> we're<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> point

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
bears damage and we're at the point

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.850 
bears damage and we're at the point
where<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.810> don't<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.080> off<00:01:22.200> our<00:01:22.290> case<00:01:22.590> falls

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
where if we don't get off our case falls

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.520 
where if we don't get off our case falls
we<00:01:23.369> basically<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.939> nothing<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.960> jump<00:01:25.200> around

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
we basically do nothing we jump around

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.260 
we basically do nothing we jump around

it'll<00:05:24.090> be<00:05:24.180> interesting<00:05:24.390> to<00:05:24.570> see<00:05:24.660> if<00:05:24.780> they

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
it'll be interesting to see if they

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.590 
it'll be interesting to see if they
bring<00:05:25.170> in<00:05:25.290> cosmetic<00:05:25.770> pvp<00:05:26.190> gear<00:05:26.510> especially<00:05:27.510> if

bring in cosmetic pvp gear especially if

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.600 
bring in cosmetic pvp gear especially if
they<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:28.050> know<00:05:28.080> introduce<00:05:28.590> it<00:05:28.770> with<00:05:29.160> rating

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
they you know introduce it with rating

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.850 
they you know introduce it with rating
requirements<00:05:29.760> on<00:05:30.300> each<00:05:30.480> piece<00:05:30.750> I<00:05:31.050> really<00:05:31.710> like

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
requirements on each piece I really like

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.530 
requirements on each piece I really like
the<00:05:32.010> idea<00:05:32.040> of<00:05:32.340> that<00:05:32.520> but<00:05:32.820> getting<00:05:33.150> back<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.330> the

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
the idea of that but getting back to the

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.150 
the idea of that but getting back to the
point<00:05:33.570> I<00:05:33.900> would<00:05:33.990> imagine<00:05:34.170> that<00:05:34.410> item<00:05:34.860> levels

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
point I would imagine that item levels

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.610 
point I would imagine that item levels
will<00:05:35.400> be<00:05:35.580> capped<00:05:35.850> in<00:05:36.090> PvP<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:36.660> so<00:05:37.320> that<00:05:37.470> once

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
will be capped in PvP and so that once

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.170 
will be capped in PvP and so that once
you<00:05:37.680> have<00:05:37.830> your<00:05:37.920> basic<00:05:38.160> gear<00:05:38.700> equipped<00:05:39.060> you
