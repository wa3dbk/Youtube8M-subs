to work a little bit harder

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.990 
to work a little bit harder
that<00:02:32.049> means<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.439> milk<00:02:32.860> is<00:02:33.069> hid<00:02:33.640> in<00:02:33.790> there

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
thing so now we're going to cover the

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.580 
thing so now we're going to cover the
cake<00:04:30.100> with<00:04:30.130> our<00:04:30.520> buttercream<00:04:31.500> starting<00:04:32.500> out

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
cake with our buttercream starting out

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.580 
cake with our buttercream starting out
by<00:04:32.770> putting<00:04:33.040> I<00:04:33.430> like<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:34.480> put<00:04:34.630> Lots<00:04:35.080> on<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.380> top

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
by putting I like to put Lots on the top

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.170 
by putting I like to put Lots on the top
and<00:04:35.860> just<00:04:35.890> grab<00:04:36.250> four<00:04:36.550> there<00:04:36.669> from<00:04:36.940> there<00:04:37.150> I

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
and just grab four there from there I

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.640 
and just grab four there from there I
find<00:04:37.510> that's<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.810> little<00:04:37.960> bit<00:04:38.169> easier<00:04:38.560> than

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
find that's a little bit easier than

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.920 
find that's a little bit easier than
grabbing<00:04:39.640> from<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.090> bowl<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.480> it<00:04:40.540> also<00:04:40.660> keeps

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
grabbing from the bowl and it also keeps

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.659 
grabbing from the bowl and it also keeps
your<00:04:41.110> bowl<00:04:41.320> clean<00:04:41.650> so<00:04:42.310> I'm<00:04:42.370> just<00:04:42.520> going<00:04:42.640> to

just<00:05:14.450> moving<00:05:14.810> around<00:05:14.930> slowly<00:05:15.910> so<00:05:16.910> when<00:05:17.090> I've

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
just moving around slowly so when I've

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.070 
just moving around slowly so when I've

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
top and also what's helpful is if you

overlap<00:05:30.350> on<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.680> edge<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.860> little<00:05:31.220> bit<00:05:31.370> it

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
overlap on the edge a little bit it

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.290 
overlap on the edge a little bit it
gives<00:05:32.120> you<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.270> cleaner<00:05:32.660> line<00:05:32.990> when<00:05:33.710> you<00:05:34.300> go
