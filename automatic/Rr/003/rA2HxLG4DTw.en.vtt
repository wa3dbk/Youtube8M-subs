00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
the best class setup for stuff and

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.940 
the best class setup for stuff and
before<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.570> get<00:00:09.780> started<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:10.320> want<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.710> let<00:00:10.830> you

before I get started I want to let you
guys<00:00:11.070> know<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:12.030> class<00:00:12.269> can<00:00:12.509> work<00:00:12.870> both

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
guys know that the class can work both

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.560 
guys know that the class can work both
stealth<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.889> loud<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.610> basically<00:00:14.969> depends<00:00:15.450> on

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
stealth and loud it basically depends on

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.390 
stealth and loud it basically depends on
what<00:00:15.690> type<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.870> player<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.170> are<00:00:16.320> but<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.250> have

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
what type of player you are but you have

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.070 
what type of player you are but you have
to<00:00:17.550> act<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:18.090> different<00:00:18.390> situations<00:00:18.900> at<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
to act on different situations at the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.920 
to act on different situations at the
outcome<00:00:19.439> I'll<00:00:19.590> get<00:00:19.859> more<00:00:20.279> into<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.720> get<00:00:21.720> more

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
outcome I'll get more into that get more

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.290 
outcome I'll get more into that get more

gives<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.820> guys<00:00:30.000> stats<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.480> weapon<00:00:30.810> damage

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
gives you guys stats on weapon damage

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.560 
gives you guys stats on weapon damage
fire<00:00:31.410> rate<00:00:31.740> etc<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.640> let's<00:00:32.850> get<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.180> start<00:00:33.450> it

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
fire rate etc so let's get to start it

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.670 
fire rate etc so let's get to start it
and<00:00:33.690> little<00:00:33.870> go<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.079> get<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.260> start<00:00:34.469> with

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
and little go and get to start with

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.049 
and little go and get to start with
we'll<00:00:34.920> start<00:00:34.980> off<00:00:35.250> with<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.460> 9-millimeter

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
we'll start off with the 9-millimeter

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.389 
we'll start off with the 9-millimeter
pistol<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.110> 9-millimeter<00:00:37.739> pistol<00:00:37.770> has<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
pistol so the 9-millimeter pistol has a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.389 
pistol so the 9-millimeter pistol has a
really<00:00:38.760> good<00:00:38.879> fire<00:00:39.450> rate<00:00:39.780> compared<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
really good fire rate compared to the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.630 
really good fire rate compared to the
revolver<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.059> fire<00:00:42.270> rate<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.860> 73<00:00:43.860> loads<00:00:44.070> p26

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
revolver the fire rate is 73 loads p26

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.160 
revolver the fire rate is 73 loads p26
and<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> damage<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.420> too<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.750> accuracy<00:00:46.079> is

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and the damage is too and accuracy is

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.760 
and the damage is too and accuracy is
for<00:00:47.059> duh<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.539> 9-millimeter<00:00:49.050> isn't<00:00:49.620> as

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
for duh it's the 9-millimeter isn't as

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.910 
for duh it's the 9-millimeter isn't as
powerful<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.420> revolver<00:00:52.350> revolver<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
powerful as the revolver revolver is a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.250 
powerful as the revolver revolver is a
little<00:00:53.219> bit<00:00:53.370> more<00:00:53.489> powerful<00:00:53.969> than<00:00:54.270> then

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
little bit more powerful than then

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.959 
little bit more powerful than then
actually<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> 9-millimeter<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
actually the 9-millimeter but the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.760 
actually the 9-millimeter but the
9-millimeter<00:00:57.449> pistol<00:00:57.510> has<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.109> greater<00:00:58.440> fire

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
9-millimeter pistol has a greater fire

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.189 
9-millimeter pistol has a greater fire
rate<00:00:59.010> which<00:00:59.460> has<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.149> better<00:01:00.239> impact<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.079> you

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
rate which has a better impact if you

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.130 
rate which has a better impact if you
get<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> kill<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.070> also<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.270> also<00:01:04.049> you

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
get in the kill and also have also you

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.870 
get in the kill and also have also you
can<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.680> better<00:01:04.920> understanding<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.610> how<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
can get a better understanding on how it

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.780 
can get a better understanding on how it
works<00:01:06.119> also<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> cliq<00:01:07.290> capacity<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.920> six<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
works also the cliq capacity of six that

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.670 
works also the cliq capacity of six that
max<00:01:09.000> em<00:01:09.180> was<00:01:09.510> 20<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.170> upgrade<00:01:10.590> two

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
max em was 20 but if you upgrade two

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.679 
max em was 20 but if you upgrade two
Clips<00:01:10.890> capacity<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.460> goes<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.540> that

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
Clips capacity it goes up for so that

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.539 
Clips capacity it goes up for so that
means<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.080> know<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.409> said<00:01:13.590> cody<00:01:14.040> max<00:01:14.310> ammo

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
means you know like I said cody max ammo

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.960 
means you know like I said cody max ammo
goes<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.479> 20<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.350> upgrade<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.130> gun<00:01:17.520> as

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
goes up to 20 as you upgrade your gun as

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.940 
goes up to 20 as you upgrade your gun as
you<00:01:18.090> upgraded<00:01:18.570> come<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.780> progressively<00:01:19.290> but

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you upgraded come on progressively but

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.020 
you upgraded come on progressively but
like<00:01:20.040> i<00:01:20.130> said<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.460> 9-millimeter

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
like i said the 9-millimeter

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
like i said the 9-millimeter
nine-millimeter<00:01:21.810> pistol<00:01:22.110> pistol<00:01:22.439> compared

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
nine-millimeter pistol pistol compared

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.550 
nine-millimeter pistol pistol compared
to<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.850> magnum<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.630> i<00:01:24.659> say<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.320> just

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
to the magnum like i say it all just

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.700 
to the magnum like i say it all just
varies<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.600> magnum<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.689> much<00:01:27.990> powerful

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
varies but the magnum is much powerful

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.240 
varies but the magnum is much powerful
when<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.159> comes<00:01:29.310> down<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> shooting<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:31.250> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
when it comes down to shooting but the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.130 
when it comes down to shooting but the
9-millimeter<00:01:32.820> pistol<00:01:32.850> has<00:01:33.270> its<00:01:33.479> own<00:01:33.659> damage

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
9-millimeter pistol has its own damage

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.810 
9-millimeter pistol has its own damage
but<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> said<00:01:34.860> they're<00:01:35.070> all<00:01:35.189> works<00:01:35.460> different

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
but I said they're all works different

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.490 
but I said they're all works different
ways<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.180> body<00:01:36.360> damage<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.960> gun<00:01:37.290> is

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
ways the body damage of the gun is

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
know the stats for that bum has to look

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.200 
know the stats for that bum has to look
more<00:03:25.050> into<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.290> but<00:03:25.680> Alex<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.520> was<00:03:26.700> kind<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.090> in

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
more into that but Alex I was kind of in

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.280 
more into that but Alex I was kind of in
a<00:03:27.300> rush<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.510> make<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:27.780> video<00:03:27.960> because<00:03:28.050> I'm

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
a rush to make this video because I'm

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.990 
a rush to make this video because I'm
three<00:03:28.500> weeks<00:03:28.650> behind<00:03:28.770> so<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.340> don't<00:03:29.700> actually

three weeks behind so I don't actually

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.820 
three weeks behind so I don't actually
have<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.210> time<00:03:30.240> to<00:03:30.540> actually<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.990> know<00:03:31.020> show

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830

have the time to actually you know show
you<00:03:31.890> guys<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.400> gives<00:03:32.520> you<00:03:32.610> guys<00:03:32.790> like<00:03:33.240> the

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
you guys and gives you guys like the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.900 
you guys and gives you guys like the
heads<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.990> how<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.290> works<00:03:34.560> but<00:03:35.190> like<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.490> said<00:03:35.550> to

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
heads of how it works but like I said to

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.700 
heads of how it works but like I said to
come<00:03:36.030> by<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.210> fire<00:03:36.570> rate<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.840> for<00:03:37.050> real<00:03:37.260> oh<00:03:37.350> for

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
come by the fire rate is for real oh for

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.560 
come by the fire rate is for real oh for
damages<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.640> actually<00:03:39.090> is<00:03:39.180> five<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:39.450> think

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
damages to and actually is five I think

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.990 
damages to and actually is five I think
the<00:03:39.780> accuracy<00:03:40.230> goes<00:03:40.410> down<00:03:40.710> a<00:03:41.040> little<00:03:41.550> bit<00:03:41.730> more

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
the accuracy goes down a little bit more

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.150 
the accuracy goes down a little bit more
since<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.990> silencer<00:03:43.380> is<00:03:43.500> on<00:03:43.650> but<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.950> fire

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
since the silencer is on but the fire

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.500 
since the silencer is on but the fire
ray<00:03:44.310> probably<00:03:44.700> goes<00:03:44.850> up<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.090> little<00:03:45.300> bit<00:03:45.390> more

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
ray probably goes up a little bit more

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.210 
ray probably goes up a little bit more
it's<00:03:45.720> all<00:03:45.900> just<00:03:46.110> depends<00:03:46.410> but<00:03:46.530> as<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.800> upgrade

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
it's all just depends but as you upgrade

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.950 
it's all just depends but as you upgrade
and<00:03:47.430> progressive<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.210> will<00:03:48.450> become<00:03:48.750> better

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
and progressive it it will become better

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.320 
and progressive it it will become better
and<00:03:49.140> better<00:03:49.290> at<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.530> time<00:03:49.770> the<00:03:50.370> clip<00:03:50.790> capacity

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
and better at the time the clip capacity

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.870 
and better at the time the clip capacity
is<00:03:51.420> 12<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.900> max<00:03:52.080> mmos<00:03:52.440> 20<00:03:52.830> upgraded<00:03:53.400> capacity

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
is 12 to max mmos 20 upgraded capacity

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.570 
is 12 to max mmos 20 upgraded capacity
is<00:03:53.970> six<00:03:54.270> which<00:03:54.990> which<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.010> upgraded<00:03:56.490> the

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
is six which which you upgraded the

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.970 
is six which which you upgraded the
accuracy<00:03:56.940> comes<00:03:57.360> goes<00:03:58.050> up<00:03:58.230> six<00:03:58.500> which

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
accuracy comes goes up six which

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.110 
accuracy comes goes up six which
actually<00:03:59.190> gives<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.550> a<00:03:59.580> greater<00:03:59.880> greater

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
actually gives you a greater greater

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.610 
actually gives you a greater greater
advantage<00:04:00.600> when<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.750> comes<00:04:00.840> down<00:04:01.110> to<00:04:01.170> disney

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620
