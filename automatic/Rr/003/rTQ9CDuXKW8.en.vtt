you<00:00:00.870> think<00:00:01.110> nothing<00:00:01.260> exciting<00:00:01.979> would<00:00:02.190> happen

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
you think nothing exciting would happen

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.710 
you think nothing exciting would happen
you<00:00:02.550> think<00:00:02.790> it<00:00:02.850> would<00:00:02.939> just<00:00:03.090> go<00:00:03.210> like<00:00:03.360> this

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
you think it would just go like this

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.999 
you think it would just go like this
but<00:00:04.140> what<00:00:04.290> we'll<00:00:04.440> see<00:00:04.589> as<00:00:04.680> much<00:00:04.830> more

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
but what we'll see as much more

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.500 
but what we'll see as much more
interesting<00:00:06.049> all<00:00:07.049> right<00:00:08.120> what<00:00:09.120> we've<00:00:09.300> got

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
interesting all right what we've got

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.970 
interesting all right what we've got
here<00:00:09.780> are<00:00:09.990> water<00:00:10.290> droplets<00:00:12.740> which<00:00:13.740> look

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
here are water droplets which look

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.640 
here are water droplets which look
pretty<00:00:14.009> ordinary<00:00:14.910> at<00:00:15.059> normal<00:00:15.509> speed<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.379> at

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
pretty ordinary at normal speed but at

mathematician<00:00:25.140> John<00:00:25.470> Bush<00:00:25.830> can<00:00:26.340> explain<00:00:26.730> to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
mathematician John Bush can explain to

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.030 
mathematician John Bush can explain to
us<00:00:26.970> just<00:00:27.180> how<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.630> dropped<00:00:28.130> 10<00:00:29.130> bells<00:00:32.719> that<00:00:34.040> is

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
us just how I dropped 10 bells that is

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740 
us just how I dropped 10 bells that is
so<00:00:35.250> cool<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.790> that's<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.180> gonna<00:00:36.329> float<00:00:36.570> all

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
so cool and that's just gonna float all

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.389 
so cool and that's just gonna float all
the<00:00:36.870> way<00:00:36.960> over<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:39.379> okay<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:41.250> you're

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the way over to you okay so you're

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.250 
the way over to you okay so you're
saying<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.790> happens<00:00:42.270> all<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.020> time

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
saying that that happens all the time

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.619 
saying that that happens all the time
that's<00:00:43.920> right<00:00:44.160> every<00:00:44.370> time<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.610> water<00:00:45.000> drop<00:00:45.360> but

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
that's right every time a water drop but

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.479 
that's right every time a water drop but
coalesce<00:00:45.960> into<00:00:46.230> water<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:47.070> every<00:00:47.280> time<00:00:47.430> it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
coalesce into water so every time it

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.790 
coalesce into water so every time it
rains<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.629> rain<00:00:48.750> droplets<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> parade<00:00:49.530> that's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
rains the rain droplets a parade that's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.350 
rains the rain droplets a parade that's
rain<00:00:50.039> drops<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> puddle<00:00:50.640> yeah<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.180> that's

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
rain drops in a puddle yeah so that's

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:04.060 
rain drops in a puddle yeah so that's
billions<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.870> times

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.430 

why<00:01:05.070> does<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.370> droplet<00:01:05.790> sit<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.390> out<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:07.140> so

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
why does the droplet sit it out just so

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.930 
why does the droplet sit it out just so
there's<00:01:07.740> an<00:01:07.830> air<00:01:07.980> layer<00:01:08.190> in<00:01:08.310> between<00:01:08.370> the<00:01:08.760> two

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
there's an air layer in between the two

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.910 
there's an air layer in between the two
and<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.240> basically<00:01:09.750> wait<00:01:10.080> it'll<00:01:10.380> coalesce

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and it's basically wait it'll coalesce

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160 
and it's basically wait it'll coalesce
as<00:01:11.280> soon<00:01:11.520> as<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.970> drop<00:01:12.510> makes<00:01:12.750> contact<00:01:13.080> with

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
as soon as the drop makes contact with

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.660 
as soon as the drop makes contact with
the<00:01:13.260> bath<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.950> takes<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.340> finite

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the bath but it takes this is finite

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.770 
the bath but it takes this is finite
amount<00:01:14.910> of<00:01:14.940> time<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.360> air<00:01:15.450> layer<00:01:15.630> to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
amount of time for the air layer to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.090 
amount of time for the air layer to
drain<00:01:16.400> or<00:01:17.400> for<00:01:17.820> non<00:01:18.060> phd's<00:01:18.930> there's<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.740> thin

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
drain or for non phd's there's a thin

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.070 
drain or for non phd's there's a thin
layer<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.370> air<00:01:20.670> separating<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.510> drop<00:01:21.750> from

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
layer of air separating the drop from

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.550 
layer of air separating the drop from
the<00:01:22.229> water<00:01:22.910> but<00:01:23.910> as<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> air<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.540> pushed<00:01:24.810> aside

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the water but as the air is pushed aside

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.320 
the water but as the air is pushed aside
most<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.160> the<00:01:26.220> droplet<00:01:26.580> connects<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
most of the droplet connects with the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.250 
most of the droplet connects with the
water<00:01:27.510> below<00:01:28.490> but<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.670> happens<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.390> fast<00:01:30.690> the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
water below but this happens so fast the

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.350 
water below but this happens so fast the
connection<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.890> actually<00:01:32.130> pinched<00:01:32.640> off<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
connection is actually pinched off and a

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.889 
connection is actually pinched off and a
smaller<00:01:33.720> droplet<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.350> formed<00:01:35.540> but<00:01:36.540> why<00:01:36.840> do

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
smaller droplet is formed but why do

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.320 
smaller droplet is formed but why do
some<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> drops<00:01:38.070> leap<00:01:38.490> up<00:01:38.700> into<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> air

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
some of the drops leap up into the air

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.080 
some of the drops leap up into the air
when<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.229> closes<00:01:40.800> waves<00:01:41.250> are<00:01:41.490> generated<00:01:41.610> at

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
when it closes waves are generated at

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.580 
when it closes waves are generated at
the<00:01:42.180> point<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.509> contact<00:01:42.660> and<00:01:43.229> they<00:01:43.350> sweep

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the point of contact and they sweep

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.920 
the point of contact and they sweep
upwards<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.520> apply<00:01:44.729> force<00:01:45.119> which<00:01:45.509> lifts<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
upwards the apply force which lifts the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.540 
upwards the apply force which lifts the
drop<00:01:46.110> off<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.410> surface<00:01:46.800> and<00:01:47.009> then<00:01:47.100> once<00:01:47.280> again

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
drop off the surface and then once again

drop off the surface and then once again
it's<00:01:47.729> surface<00:01:48.060> tension<00:01:48.360> has<00:01:48.509> enough<00:01:48.780> force<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
it's surface tension has enough force to

it's surface tension has enough force to
repulse<00:01:49.500> itself<00:01:49.830> back<00:01:50.009> there's<00:01:50.640> an<00:01:50.850> attempt

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
repulse itself back there's an attempt

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.250 
repulse itself back there's an attempt
to<00:01:51.180> decide

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
to decide

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.070 
to decide
this<00:01:53.920> surface<00:01:54.310> tension<00:01:54.910> is<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.390> quality<00:01:55.960> of<00:01:56.020> a

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
this surface tension is the quality of a

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.170 
this surface tension is the quality of a
liquid<00:01:56.470> that<00:01:56.650> causes<00:01:57.370> the<00:01:57.490> surface<00:01:57.700> layer<00:01:58.150> of

liquid that causes the surface layer of
that<00:01:58.390> liquid<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.870> behave<00:01:59.290> like<00:01:59.530> an<00:01:59.650> elastic

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
that liquid to behave like an elastic

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.170 
that liquid to behave like an elastic
sheet<00:02:02.400> it's<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.580> effect<00:02:03.910> that<00:02:04.000> allows

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
sheet it's the effect that allows

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.160 
sheet it's the effect that allows
insects<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:05.050> walk<00:02:05.260> on<00:02:05.410> water<00:02:05.620> and<00:02:06.840> water<00:02:07.840> drops

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
insects to walk on water and water drops

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:19.400 
insects to walk on water and water drops
to<00:02:08.500> hold<00:02:08.710> together

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.280 

this<00:02:20.040> cycle<00:02:20.580> happens<00:02:20.790> again<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.420> again<00:02:21.630> until

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
this cycle happens again and again until

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.230 
this cycle happens again and again until
the<00:02:22.800> droplet<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.400> small<00:02:23.760> enough<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.060> be
