00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.970
 the best information of motorsport you find the Corsican magazine 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.470
 every Tuesday at your kiosk 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.670
 And every day 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.080
 the 'triple-double' point with Latin flavor 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.080
 dot com 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.509
 for me the usurpers a fifty-year-old labor 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.929
 much encouragement 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:30.129
 suzuka as well as eight kilometers 53 laps 308 kilometers in total 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.020
 four fast sections 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.040
 three slow curves two points and up to the lift maximum speed 313 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.370
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.140
 let's go around the subject 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.140
 suzuka cto 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.820
 we reached the first curve 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.040
 is done thoroughly in seventh speed until the second curve to be made in 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.120
 fourth speed 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.160
 we will arrive to the area in the center room 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.860
 this area is one of the most complicated because 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.200
 the first is made by the mother and the sickles all more therefore 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 you have to the mayor to make them all in a statement 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.820
 after the close behind and we got two left curves 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 very fast in depth 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.520
 until the first curve that will be more right-wing is done in fifth speed 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.340
 you have to try to throw it away because it's a mockery where there's a lot 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.590
 time difference but aerodynamics 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.340
 in this circuit of Japanese is the most important thing of the sepad 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.100
 to invite to sign as fast as possible because all the curves are very 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 fast of this type 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.550
 and we were at two doubles and left 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.240
 quedada legend speeds some very fast curves 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.120
 the 130r is a mockery that that fund is where we have more people in all the 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.940
 world formula one 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.900
 being I had the famous deficit last year 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.040
 we call 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.940
 coupled to one of the slowest corners of the sundance circuit and cannes to a 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.359
 speed 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.519
 and we are going to the goal straight 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.519
 in suzuka 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:26.549
 with information from the motorist 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.439
 you found the Corsican magazine 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.939
 every Tuesday at your kiosk 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.169
 And every day 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.229
 the 'triple-double' point with Latin flavor
