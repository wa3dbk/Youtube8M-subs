of YouTube would is up today we're going

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.249 
of YouTube would is up today we're going
to<00:00:01.680> be<00:00:01.800> discussing<00:00:02.220> some<00:00:03.140> offensive<00:00:04.140> and

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
to be discussing some offensive and

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.889 
to be discussing some offensive and
defensive<00:00:04.799> strategy<00:00:05.220> for<00:00:05.899> headquarters

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
defensive strategy for headquarters

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.610 
defensive strategy for headquarters
level<00:00:07.290> six<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:09.200> personally<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.290> think<00:00:10.349> this

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
level six and personally I think this

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.200 
level six and personally I think this
could<00:00:10.830> help<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:11.130> if<00:00:11.280> you're<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.519> beginner<00:00:11.969> or

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
could help you if you're a beginner or

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.629 
could help you if you're a beginner or
intermediate<00:00:12.719> player<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.530> don't<00:00:13.639> initially

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
intermediate player you don't initially

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.710 
intermediate player you don't initially
have<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.800> headquarters<00:00:16.800> level<00:00:17.160> six<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.480> why

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
have to be headquarters level six so why

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.029 
have to be headquarters level six so why
let's<00:00:19.020> get<00:00:19.170> started<00:00:19.619> with<00:00:19.800> defense<00:00:21.769> the<00:00:22.769> first

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
let's get started with defense the first

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.650 
let's get started with defense the first
thing<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.369> want<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> point<00:00:23.789> out<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> have

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
thing I want to point out is that I have

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.470 
thing I want to point out is that I have
all<00:00:24.990> my<00:00:25.019> buildings<00:00:25.740> spread<00:00:25.980> out<00:00:26.189> now<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.300> is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
all my buildings spread out now this is

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.169 
all my buildings spread out now this is
so<00:00:27.720> if<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:29.070> your<00:00:29.279> two<00:00:29.550> buildings<00:00:30.060> to

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
so if you have your two buildings to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.359 
so if you have your two buildings to
clump<00:00:30.449> together<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:32.009> enemy

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
clump together like this the enemy

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.160 
clump together like this the enemy
artillery<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:33.149> hit<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.540> between<00:00:33.870> those

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
artillery can hit in between those

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.139 
artillery can hit in between those
buildings<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.770> view<00:00:34.950> dish<00:00:35.460> out<00:00:35.640> some<00:00:35.730> Splash

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
buildings and view dish out some Splash

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.049 
buildings and view dish out some Splash
Damage<00:00:36.649> affecting<00:00:37.649> both<00:00:37.800> buildings<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
Damage affecting both buildings the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.760 
Damage affecting both buildings the
second<00:00:39.390> reason<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:42.770> attacking

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
second reason is so that the attacking

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.450 
second reason is so that the attacking
troops<00:00:44.040> will<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.320> pick<00:00:46.320> one<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
troops will have to pick one of the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.880 
troops will have to pick one of the
targets<00:00:47.910> maybe<00:00:48.840> two<00:00:49.170> they<00:00:49.379> won't<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.680> able<00:00:49.800> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
targets maybe two they won't be able to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.939 
targets maybe two they won't be able to
attack<00:00:50.219> multiple<00:00:51.210> targets<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.500> thing<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.800> like

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
attack multiple targets the thing I like

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.569 
attack multiple targets the thing I like
about<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.340> base<00:00:53.579> design<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.949> it<00:00:55.949> basically

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
about this base design is it basically

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.790 
about this base design is it basically
covers<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> whole<00:00:57.480> base<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.170> machine<00:00:58.559> guns

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
covers the whole base the machine guns

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.580 
covers the whole base the machine guns
I'm<00:00:59.570> usually<00:01:00.570> hit<00:01:00.750> first<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
I'm usually hit first and then the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.529 
I'm usually hit first and then the
cannon<00:01:01.949> will<00:01:02.100> take<00:01:02.340> out<00:01:02.520> there<00:01:02.789> they're<00:01:03.329> heavy

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
cannon will take out there they're heavy

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.399 
cannon will take out there they're heavy
guys<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.489> in<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.000> midst<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.360> everything<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
guys and in the midst of everything the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.440 
guys and in the midst of everything the
mortar<00:01:07.740> will<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.070> hitting<00:01:08.909> them<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
mortar will be hitting them and the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.010 
mortar will be hitting them and the
sniper<00:01:10.049> towers<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.710> will<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.820> covering<00:01:12.360> most

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
sniper towers here will be covering most

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.520 
sniper towers here will be covering most
of<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.290> base<00:01:13.560> including<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.580> back<00:01:14.820> here

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
of the base including this one back here

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.850 
of the base including this one back here
so<00:01:16.530> it'll<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.100> pretty<00:01:17.670> covered<00:01:18.350> as<00:01:19.350> far<00:01:19.560> as<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
so it'll be pretty covered as far as the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.460 
so it'll be pretty covered as far as the
defenses<00:01:20.430> go<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.909> with<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> mines<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.810> want

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
defenses go and with the mines you want

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.780 
defenses go and with the mines you want
to<00:01:22.530> space<00:01:22.740> them<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:22.979> too<00:01:23.189> because<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.640> they

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
to space them out too because if they

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.450 
to space them out too because if they
hit<00:01:24.350> if<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.619> your<00:01:25.740> minds<00:01:26.040> bunched<00:01:26.369> up

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
hit if you have your minds bunched up

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.510 
hit if you have your minds bunched up
and<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:26.759> hit<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.119> between<00:01:27.479> them<00:01:27.740> it'll<00:01:28.740> blow

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and they hit in between them it'll blow

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.640 
and they hit in between them it'll blow
up<00:01:29.640> all<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.210> mines<00:01:30.450> we've<00:01:31.110> talked<00:01:31.350> about<00:01:31.470> some

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
up all the mines we've talked about some

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.100 
up all the mines we've talked about some

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
this could be optional you could put

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.469 
this could be optional you could put
some<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:51.899> zookas<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:52.770> or<00:01:53.479> whatever

we're<00:01:59.549> attacking<00:02:00.210> online<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:01.140> want<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.409> look

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
we're attacking online we want to look

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.789 
we're attacking online we want to look
for<00:02:02.540> bases<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:03.930> their<00:02:04.320> buildings

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
for bases that have their buildings

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.889 
for bases that have their buildings
clump<00:02:05.100> together<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:06.240> right<00:02:06.390> here<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.600> see<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
clump together and right here I see the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.900 
clump together and right here I see the
machine<00:02:07.259> gun<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> mortar<00:02:08.340> together<00:02:08.700> so

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
machine gun and the mortar together so

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.420 
machine gun and the mortar together so
we<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.119> hit<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.330> with<00:02:09.599> our<00:02:09.750> artillery<00:02:10.430> see

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
we can hit that with our artillery see

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.410 
we can hit that with our artillery see
the<00:02:11.640> right<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.110> snake

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
the right of the snake

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.960 
the right of the snake
first<00:02:13.540> hour<00:02:13.720> in<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.400> headquarters<00:02:15.400> together

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
first hour in the headquarters together

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.750 
first hour in the headquarters together
that'll<00:02:16.300> help<00:02:16.420> us<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.890> actually<00:02:18.190> all<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.640> the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
that'll help us and actually all in the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.729 
that'll help us and actually all in the
mortar<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.660> sniper<00:02:19.930> tower<00:02:20.200> are<00:02:20.500> together

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
mortar and the sniper tower are together

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.040 
mortar and the sniper tower are together
here<00:02:21.099> now<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.730> machine-gun<00:02:22.120> nest<00:02:22.510> being<00:02:22.840> over

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
here now the machine-gun nest being over

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.380 
here now the machine-gun nest being over
here<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.700> think<00:02:24.700> we<00:02:24.849> can<00:02:25.030> just<00:02:25.060> avoid<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:26.130> and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
here I think we can just avoid that and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.110 
here I think we can just avoid that and
hopefully<00:02:28.390> just<00:02:28.420> drive<00:02:29.489> drive<00:02:30.489> in<00:02:30.730> through

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
hopefully just drive drive in through

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.410 
hopefully just drive drive in through
here<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:36.010> now<00:02:36.190> beginning<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:36.790> attack<00:02:37.150> we

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
here so now beginning this attack we

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.920 
here so now beginning this attack we
will<00:02:38.430> find<00:02:39.430> where<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.940> two<00:02:40.239> defenses<00:02:40.780> are

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
will find where the two defenses are

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.190 
will find where the two defenses are
connected<00:02:41.849> and<00:02:42.849> we'll<00:02:43.120> hit<00:02:43.330> right<00:02:44.050> between

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
connected and we'll hit right between

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.040 
connected and we'll hit right between
them<00:02:44.530> you<00:02:44.739> can<00:02:44.890> see<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.099> does<00:02:45.250> damage<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.730> both

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
them you can see it does damage to both

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.280 
them you can see it does damage to both
we'll<00:02:47.050> hit<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.350> again<00:02:48.959> all<00:02:49.959> right

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
we'll hit it again all right

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.640 
we'll hit it again all right
and<00:02:50.730> we'll<00:02:51.730> go<00:02:51.910> here<00:02:52.299> damage<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.410> sniper

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
and we'll go here damage to the sniper

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.900 
and we'll go here damage to the sniper
tower<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:55.150> taking<00:02:55.630> out<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.900> mortar<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.910> think

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
tower and taking out the mortar I think

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.280 
tower and taking out the mortar I think
for<00:02:58.030> our<00:02:58.060> last<00:02:58.330> one<00:02:58.480> we'll<00:02:58.780> just<00:02:58.989> get<00:02:59.140> some

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
for our last one we'll just get some

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.960 
for our last one we'll just get some
more<00:02:59.319> points<00:02:59.799> destroying<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.549> vault<00:03:00.760> and

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
more points destroying the vault and

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.360 
more points destroying the vault and
damaging<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:02.010> all<00:03:03.010> right

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
damaging that all right

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.360 
damaging that all right
like<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.150> said<00:03:04.360> I'm<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.510> last<00:03:04.720> one<00:03:05.220> pull<00:03:06.220> your

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.400 
like I said I'm the last one pull your
heavies<00:03:06.610> first<00:03:06.880> followed<00:03:07.720> by<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.870> rifleman

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
heavies first followed by the rifleman

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.550 
heavies first followed by the rifleman
wait<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.010> little<00:03:09.190> while<00:03:09.750> then<00:03:10.750> let<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.200> zookas

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
wait a little while then let the zookas

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.979 
wait a little while then let the zookas
reign<00:03:14.700> all<00:03:15.700> right<00:03:15.819> we'll<00:03:15.970> just<00:03:16.150> be<00:03:16.299> trying<00:03:16.750> to

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
take out that last night per tower and

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:29.760 
take out that last night per tower and

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.950 

make<00:03:30.400> sure<00:03:30.550> you<00:03:30.820> take<00:03:31.330> advantage<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
make sure you take advantage of the

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.010 
make sure you take advantage of the
flares<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:33.010> keep<00:03:33.220> your<00:03:33.370> troops<00:03:34.020> actively

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
flares to keep your troops actively

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.020 
flares to keep your troops actively
pursuing<00:03:35.380> pursuing<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.310> position<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.850> want

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
pursuing pursuing the position you want

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:45.690 
pursuing pursuing the position you want
to<00:03:37.120> take<00:03:37.660> out

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.130 

alright<00:03:46.420> now<00:03:46.540> what<00:03:46.660> you<00:03:46.810> could<00:03:47.020> have<00:03:47.050> done

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
alright now what you could have done

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.370 
alright now what you could have done
better<00:03:47.530> than<00:03:47.890> I<00:03:48.130> did<00:03:48.370> is<00:03:48.840> probably<00:03:49.840> taking<00:03:50.260> out

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
better than I did is probably taking out

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.250 
better than I did is probably taking out
one<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.920> two<00:03:51.310> sniper<00:03:51.640> towers<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.300> would

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
one of the two sniper towers I would

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.710 
one of the two sniper towers I would
probably<00:03:53.770> help<00:03:53.860> keep<00:03:54.550> a<00:03:54.670> couple<00:03:55.180> more<00:03:55.450> troops

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
probably help keep a couple more troops

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.850 
probably help keep a couple more troops
alive<00:03:56.050> but<00:03:56.410> we<00:03:57.069> didn't<00:03:57.280> lose<00:03:57.430> too<00:03:57.700> many<00:03:58.860> so

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
alive but we didn't lose too many so

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.670
