00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.129
 present you today a new 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.020
 exclusive on the game in famous second 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.760
 sounds that my videos are happening in 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.020
 the chronological order this one happens 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.940
 a little further and pay two 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.230
 previous when you come from 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.420
 drain the nuclei relay that 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.940
 find at the very beginning of the bridge you do 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.589
 turn around and thanks for using this 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.510
 freshly acquired power saw us 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.500
 jump x when you're on a car 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.540
 for your propulsed in the air 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.339
 and well you will use this clean 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.640
 newly acquired power to be able to 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.049
 go up to the bridge to be at 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.900
 the tunnel entrance and when you are 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:09.110
 in front of the tunnel entrance you re 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.790
 use a car using 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.560
 other new times where you 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.750
 propelling in the air and there you go 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.280
 to be propelled to where I am 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.590
 currently ie in fact 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.780
 you are above the tunnel in the 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.369
 little mountains to puteaux is there you 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.619
 try to make your way through 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.380
 using your smoke power for 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.659
 to be able to go above 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.439
 the entrance to the tunnel is so once 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:30.860
 you are above the entrance to the 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.600
 tunnel 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.329
 here it's not textures and you're going 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.039
 so be able to roll over the mountain 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.990
 to be above the bridge but to 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.149
 inside of it and so next 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.429
 you have a beautiful surface to explore 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.979
 so this surface does not lead everything leads 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.929
 nothing since if you ever go too much 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.729
 far it makes you start again and where you 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.990
 so were we starting over to the point of 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.939
 account 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.020
 and if you do not go further 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:59.259
 here it is really all black and if 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.020
 I'll never shift you a little 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.399
 too far right or left of the tunnel well 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.840
 you will simply fall in 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.340
 water and it will be over but that's it 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.899
 even a very nice job prÃ©gent I 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.310
 offers you in exclusivity I hope 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.380
 that you will like it so here are the friends 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.430
