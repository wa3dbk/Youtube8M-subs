00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.210
 very good everyone I'm a dealer jon and today 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:10.030
 I bring you news about the 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.780
 spanish translation of elite dangers 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.840
 you do not exist too much because I'm going to pass 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.760
 to explain the subject in good agreement 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.090
 let's say that the intention of the company 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:26.020
 frontin is to translate and dangerous to 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:30.010
 Spanish but with the support of the 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.529
 community that is to say they are creating from 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.899
 official form is to say the community 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.329
 Frontier manager is creating in 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.929
 elite forums jr is a group of 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.269
 translation for the in the news but it's 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:47.350
 translation by the community 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.629
 only that it will be included in the 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.719
 engineer is officially but it is not 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:56.589
 a translation let's say it comes from 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:59.500
 professional way this is partly true 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.630
 there are many you will be happy I know that to others 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.850
 it will leave a little weird and me 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.810
 personally it leaves me a little 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.970
 misplaced by the fact that we are going to 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.720
 see we're not talking about a game of 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.910
 agreement in which it is translated once and 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.410
 and it is such as translations 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.270
 that makes clan of the net cÃ©tera not 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.850
 we are talking about a game that 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.460
 regularly going to get a new 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.979
 content therefore my concern 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.930
 is that every time that new content 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.440
 appear 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.110
 not being a translation let's say done 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.880
 officially by the company I'm afraid 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.240
 that this content is left without 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.550
 translate for a few months I do not know if I 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.479
 you understand, I try to explain more or less 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.360
 in a clear way because I already tell you if we 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.790
 we put in the position of a translation 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.950
 official as this is done from the 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.660
 next form the company designs 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.479
 content content that is good 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.240
 then that content is sent to the 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.190
 company they have to translate a 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.380
 The company will translate it into 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.040
 English good English is the base language 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.660
 that is Russian Polish I do not care and then 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.340
 once the translation is completed 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.989
 content is released to the public but at 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.910
 be talking about a translation not 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.280
 official to a translation that is made 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.430
 for the community and I tell you that fear 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.180
 What I get is that this content is released 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.070
 and stay untranslated during X 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.210
 time because you also have to understand 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.860
 the next 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:39.380
 I do not think that these translators 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.380
 of the community they are going to pay something 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.270
 and this is something that blows me up and 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.930
 I doubt very much that they are going to pay 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.640
 because this is a maneuver, let's say 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.670
 by frontier to save 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.870
 money on the topic of translations 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.970
 but fine then yes 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.580
 some people who are not charging are 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.459
 they are obviously in charge of the translation 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.450
 they will not dedicate a priority 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.610
 absolute does not charge money for the same 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.269
 imagine I get to translate 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.690
 eliden jr like spend a few months leave 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:19.209
 new content and they send me that new 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.579
 content so that I translate it equally 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.140
 I do not feel like it, I do not have time 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.269
 it's my job I'm doing it in a way 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.530
 I selfless therefore I stay a 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:33.060
 little with that 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.250
 doubt how fluid will work 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.130
 subject of that translation by the 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.819
 community and I tell you that this translation 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.300
 yes that will be included within the 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.290
 Voucher game will not be a translation 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.709
 external that we will have to download 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.270
 apart and install not this let's say then 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.090
 I already tell you it 's frontier that's going to catch 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.010
 that translation made by the community and 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.170
 will apply it to the game as it has happened in 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.200
 other cases also happened in windows 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.840
 has also happened in in the games of 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.310
 tale they'll in the walking dead that 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.530
 true the translations of the walking 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.220
 dead are atrocious it's better to play it in 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.610
 English 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.410
 and I stayed and I tell you 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:20.090
 mainly I'm a little unhappy 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.380
 with the frontier vagrancy since 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.530
 let's say that in the message they have put 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:28.300
 in the forums they imply that 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:31.370
 they call Spanish a language that 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.900
 minority within the community of 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.320
 elite 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.360
 I think this is absurd is ridiculous 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.450
 because it's not that the users 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.760
 Spanish speakers we are a minority in the 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.680
 idh dangerous is that precisely the 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.750
 Spanish-speaking users we are a minority 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.900
 in the in the news because the game does not 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.570
 is in Spanish is that that's a bit 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.030
 absurd this not that that game comes out is 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.930
 in Spanish and that's when you can already 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.040
 say then if there is a minority within 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.540
 Spanish-speaking minority within the 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.100
 interest is worth what I understand the game is 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.230
 in Spanish but they do not play 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.630
 Spanish speakers and then they 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.210
 I would understand would not have coherence but I 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.520
 it seems a very absurd excuse to say 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.650
 that there are no Spanish-speaking players 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.120
 when the game is not translated it is that 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.440
 it's normal that there are not people who do not 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.680
 has to speak English there are people 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.670
 what 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.880
 Can speak English 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:27.480
 and they're not just going to buy this, it 's that 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:30.030
 I say it's 11 it's common sense not a little 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.420
 of overwhelming logic 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.960
 then I will not keep reporting too 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.780
 tell you what 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.930
 the group today is being formed 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:44.129
 this translation group therefore not 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.929
 you wait to see a translation 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:50.429
 I believe that in a month or two 

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:52.709
 I would even dare to say that more 

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:56.759
 I know this is already an assumption of mine in 

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:58.589
 base to other amateur translations that 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:01.050
 have made different games because it is 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:02.909
 very difficult to translate is more difficult what 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.709
 that many think of agreeing 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.050
 translate a game mostly on a level 

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:10.499
 amateur is not just catch a line and 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.589
 translate it is to translate it in a way that 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:16.159
 phrases fit inside the pictures 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:19.409
 Dialogs pre-assigned by the game 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:22.349
 that this happens a lot and it's something that you should 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:23.550
 know when a game translates many 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.939
 Sometimes it is caught and translated 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.759
 literally or translated but what happens 

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:33.089
 that same phrase in English is like that and 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.619
 in Spanish it 's like that therefore let's say 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:38.590
 what is left out 

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:40.810
 the box or in the assigned part 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.630
 for that apple to appear is 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.820
 infinitely smaller than it is 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:49.570
 the phrase translated from Spanish so 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:52.990
 so much must be translated to omit certain 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:57.310
 things to shorten the phrase and adapt it 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:59.380
 to the said cubicle no and I already tell you 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.070
 that same translation will take 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:05.520
 you know so this is all I 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.520
 I stayed a little 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:12.680
 misplaced dislocated I did not expect 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:16.070
 this vagrancy on the part of the company and 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:19.039
 least when he has announced his game that 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:21.470
 is going to jump to consoles because I think 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:24.710
 that when a game jumps consoles is a 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:27.410
 So a good sales symptom 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:30.380
 a symptom of good acceptance by part 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:33.710
 from the community but good we'll see to see 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.940
 how is the thing anyway anyway 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.820
 true 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:41.090
 and I wish you lots of luck and about 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.800
 all thanks also to the community 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.480
 that group of translators of which 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.040
 we'll talk again later when 

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.350
 they are showing a little bit what they have 

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.300
 done and really thank you very much 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.870
 you are going to do a great job I know 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:56.840
 sure you are some cracks so everything 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.430
 my support and a very big greeting and nothing 

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:04.270
 more than saying this is all and see you 

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:04.270
 in the next video see you later
