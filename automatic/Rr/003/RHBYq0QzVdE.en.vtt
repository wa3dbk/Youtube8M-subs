 morakot 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.440
 on Playstation 3 the port is the first to have a beta test open to the public 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:12.229
 even though with a 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:15.029
 the district of participants 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.760
 the lucky ones who had the opportunity to test the game 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.400
 among them the writing of a flight games 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.340
 saw a version with a lot of content on more than 20 machines 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.010
 coca was born on playstation move 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.180
 in 1995 as a means of combat between aircraft 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.840
 these aircraft that give name to the game still plays an important role in the 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.820
 playstation 3 edition 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.269
 but this time 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.350
 the war is much wider 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.500
 say the game is for the video game 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.050
 as well as the forest to the pc 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.580
 the style is quite similar plus a back has its peculiarities 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.710
 it is essentially a title 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.480
 the brother 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.480
 which accepts up to 32 players at the same time 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.850
 the angel remembered 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.930
 in online games for pc 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.770
 here you can choose games created by sony or other users 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.510
 the course 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.750
 owners of sesau since the modality the number of players 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.170
 and the newbies 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.679
 perhaps because the demonstration is still written 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.650
 performance is excellent 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.360
 no sign of connection delays 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.979
 when walking by the mallets 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.979
 some characters are doing 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.530
 or even paralyzed 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.430
 but the problem may be in the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.810
 the Fed decision 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.150
 there were some problems to enter the matches but once inside the action 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.200
 almost everything went well 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.549
 as said the style reminds a lot of the butler woods 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.450
 ie is a third-person shooter game the controls on foot 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.540
 function as in 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.049
 the line of first-person shooter titles 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.079
 it has a directional is daring to move around 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:15.979
 2nd to command the session 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:20.749
 the default setting was more complicated for example fifteen 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.129
 perhaps by the effect of inertia 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.470
 for most players it will be necessary to move the sensitivity up to 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.489
 to find a satisfactory equilibrium between velocity and 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.499
 accuracy of sight 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:34.980
 Speaking of miracles 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.760
 The wine has a mechanism to help us keep talking about the enemy. 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.700
 this may please less experienced users 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.599
 but who already is fan of the old one of this type of game must twist the nose 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.019
 because it takes part of mercosul 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.560
 voting becomes a lot of fun if the player manages to raise 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.940
 this seriousness thinking - in competition and getting carried away by the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.889
 intense action pitimbu 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.639
 we kill ourselves and die 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.789
 on a frenetic frequency 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:08.839
 roque offers many combat options 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.220
 the most basic is to do everything on foot 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.629
 the floor of scattered weapons 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.389
 created by senai 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.069
 the player starts with a knife and a simple pistols 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.640
 but to equipment like machine guns 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.309
 Levels Of Precision Rocket Launchers Illan Your Weapons 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:29.399
 but there are also several types of fujii vehicles that allows a 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:31.019
 player who has a steering wheel 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.049
 on the other side 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.769
 the corinthians have great 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.149
 and it is also possible to fight in the air 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:40.299
 piloting the zon chords 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.320
 these noses may have helicopter controls 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.469
 when in several directions but slowly 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:48.430
 or to act as an airplane 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.929
 with more speed but - maneuverable 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:56.519
 thanks to cqc text the control of the playstation 3 I will send the vehicle 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.899
 is more free chemistry 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:02.379
 there is a configuration in which the movement is made by the sensor 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.169
 inclination of the sea in the interior 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:08.189
 the two directional ones respectively adding the direction and the 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.599
 position of the living 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.819
 it's complicated damn 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.819
 but allows for a freedom never seen before 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:20.380
 there are a lot of artillery 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.800
 from my tough face from disaster to missile launchers 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.960
 there is a balance of forces between the various attack options 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.180
 it's not because you're dead 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.620
 I want the advantage 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.749
 other noses can haunt me and argue that way 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.120
 I have a passion 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.980
 and who is in one of those fixed posts that we have today in the 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.150
 is moving around 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.710
 the residents are part 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.550
 if the equilibrium situation 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.630
 there is good sense in the distribution of vehicular and 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.409
 terrain and topography allows for various types of 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.039
 the game has four types of rules 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.129
 tavares 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.129
 quinho interpreter who shoots flag 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:07.299
 are only classic modalities tested and approved 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.260
 the visual is not the best for the playstation 3 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.640
 but it is within the quality standard that is expected for a billionaire to 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.029
 thirty-two people simultaneously say 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.869
 the title runs like speed without bumping into digital 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.949
 the characters are not exactly detail 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.029
 to 2 and animation is still explicit 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:32.939
 another thing that bothers is the slow action button 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:34.889
 efe ac / an 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.780
 or access stairs 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.120
 the answer he enters 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.100
 learning music excites me but the noise of the shots is still 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.129
 impact 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.150
 the worst is the grenade which despite being efficient 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.050
 has a visual and audible effect the size of a June party bomb 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.720
 the new demonstration of a rumor is already much better than the version shown 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.309
 in the game photo 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:04.309
 last year 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.210
 which turned out to be Croatian 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.820
 now with the implementation of a greater number of landmarks 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.349
 and more elaborate 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:16.319
 in addition to deploying a consistent balanced weaponry yesterday shows 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:19.319
 rear potential 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.110
 devoted to playstation 3 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.419
 development was turbulent 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.960
 still about its format 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.100
 or download 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.620
 more to the club through shows 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.039
 the story may have a happy ending 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.190
 the launch of a new ceiling planned for the third quarter of this year
