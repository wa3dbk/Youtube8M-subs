00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 very from 2 we socialized in mainquÃ© 1.6 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.020
 point 4 let's see a mod a mod that 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.910
 he's pretty cool 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.160
 if we are in some points 2.4 already 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.089
 when you see that they go out like this 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.130
 your catches for the 1,712 since ya 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.100
 we will be doing an exciting but 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.990
 well let's see this mode and we have 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.550
 the fretting the two castles there 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.550
 to catch this first 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.020
 it's pretty cool in case for me 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.750
 example if it would come very difficult because 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.200
 I am quite mine has up achievements or 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.090
 I am quite a package so we are going to 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.010
 lie to be discouraged often kill 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.170
 many times this what it does is that 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.820
 add an experience chest 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.630
 to start the animation is super 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.230
 cool and I loved this that goes like 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.620
 circling 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.890
 It's silly but I like it 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.970
 very cool reference but simply to 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.379
 your pace 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.390
 ruth in case they do not take away my 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.780
 experience formally experience 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.509
 that we want to submit to all are 194 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.160
 first positions but good and so on 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.590
 we can go quietly and if we 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.240
 we die we die of the same or not 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.550
 we lose the experience that I overcome 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.610
 I lose because I am pretty paquetÃ³n 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.619
 as you know but it's cool it was there 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.630
 with this we simply rotate it and the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.470
 we go back to pick up step more and we put it 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.210
 all and break 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.880
 you see 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.820
 as if it were a normal chest which 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.640
 the truth is very cool and then there is 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.430
 this here that is the same but with the 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.020
 casket of ender 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.600
 of diamond that yes 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.580
 the casket of ender 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.450
 and with this it is simply the same as 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.210
 the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.210
 that the normal box we have here 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.960
 we put the 194 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.100
 already came out is the radware achievement and then in 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.770
 the other one we also have follow 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.110
 having the 194 the tenth one appeared a 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.340
 pretty cool way pretty cool about 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.979
 everything if you usually die as is my case 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.290
 and the truth is that this is very good 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.720
 the experience chests that I was already 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.209
 just add this the nickname actually but 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.340
 as I came out here and I always have 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.710
 the curiosity of looking at these two things 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.530
 shapes 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.080
 you do not see the experience or is there the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.020
 seed 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.970
 and these are the coordinates because there 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.250
 many times I am the one who normally 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.750
 always step but there are many times 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.880
 People tell me what the seed is 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.200
 so also that always from me 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.390
 forget even if the map is 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.910
 pretty cool but diamond you already have 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.860
 to make the casket the diamond and 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.860
 the obsidian gold and that 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.340
 this is the mod 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:03:00.069
 the experience I 'm going to put nothing 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.599
 I hope you liked it since I 'm 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.370
 thinking to see if I make a series 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:08.409
 survival in 1.7 points I'm still 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.079
 I'm thinking about what to see thiago but 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:15.939
 Well I hope you liked disney 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:18.150
 favorites in the bunch is like this already is 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.150
 bye 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.200
 ah
