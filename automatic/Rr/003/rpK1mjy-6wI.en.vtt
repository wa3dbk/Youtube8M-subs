footage<00:00:05.940> was<00:00:06.029> taken<00:00:06.180> from<00:00:06.540> beta<00:00:06.870> after<00:00:07.259> the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
footage was taken from beta after the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.629 
footage was taken from beta after the
beta<00:00:07.500> had<00:00:07.680> stabilized<00:00:08.130> enough<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.550> be

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
beta had stabilized enough to be

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.459 
beta had stabilized enough to be
suitable<00:00:09.000> for<00:00:09.059> filming<00:00:09.540> but<00:00:09.900> beta<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.290> still

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
suitable for filming but beta is still

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.140 
suitable for filming but beta is still
beta<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.280> game<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.580> nowhere<00:00:11.820> near<00:00:11.969> done

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
beta and the game is nowhere near done

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.700 
beta and the game is nowhere near done
in<00:00:12.480> fact<00:00:12.750> most<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.080> certifications

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
in fact most of the certifications

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.470 
in fact most of the certifications
aren't<00:00:13.889> even<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.250> game<00:00:14.400> yet<00:00:14.639> but<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.299> far

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
aren't even in the game yet but so far

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.359 
aren't even in the game yet but so far
from<00:00:15.660> my<00:00:15.809> observations<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.590> class<00:00:16.800> roles<00:00:17.070> at

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
from my observations the class roles at

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.189 
from my observations the class roles at
least<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:17.940> certain<00:00:18.180> classes<00:00:18.600> have<00:00:19.170> been

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
least for certain classes have been

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.230 
least for certain classes have been
mostly<00:00:19.529> fleshed<00:00:19.830> out<00:00:19.949> already<00:00:20.250> one<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.119> those

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
mostly fleshed out already one of those

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.390 
mostly fleshed out already one of those
is<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.420> light<00:00:21.660> assault<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.619> that's<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:23.310> this

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
is the light assault so that's what this

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.189 
is the light assault so that's what this
video<00:00:23.670> we'll<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.820> covering<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.300> goal<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.080> that

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
video we'll be covering the goal is that

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.540 
video we'll be covering the goal is that
by<00:00:25.260> watching<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.769> video<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.189> should<00:00:26.220> have<00:00:26.519> a

by watching this video you should have a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.950 
by watching this video you should have a
decent<00:00:26.730> idea<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.330> how<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.539> play<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> light

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
video will have the word theta in the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.030 
video will have the word theta in the

title if we reach launch in the video is
still<00:00:35.130> valid<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.090> word<00:00:36.239> beta<00:00:36.480> will<00:00:36.719> be

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
still valid the word beta will be

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.110 
still valid the word beta will be
removed<00:00:37.140> from<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> title<00:00:37.579> now<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:38.879> does<00:00:39.059> a
