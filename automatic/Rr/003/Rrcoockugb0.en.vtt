00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.590
 guys here you can do today we'll do 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.619
 see another our fraction like 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.060
 make headphones with little money spent 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.939
 are normal headphones from 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.210
 mason and now we explain to you how 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.210
 do 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.930
 ok first when you buy these 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.350
 relative headphones there will be same kind of 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.769
 sponge that there are two you need 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.100
 remove two departments in all 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.780
 here then to pass the thread that 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.460
 later I'll explain everything you have to do 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.780
 out here below does n't matter 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.420
 where was the important thing 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.730
 gets a puncture the membrane doesn't 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:58.000
 but nothing is bad to see now 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.379
 to make hole used or heated this 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.700
 screwdriver made the hole but you 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.030
 you can use it very well in a trap 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.060
 because I am the only one at home and then I am 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.340
 I arranged a little here after having 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.890
 made the hole 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.860
 you have to take some headphones 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.490
 I recommend that they work and we will have to 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.130
 cut these headphones in half and 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.619
 insert it in. Now I'll do it 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.450
 see how to do ok guys and ours 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.250
 headphones are cut off 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.810
 now I don't know if you know how 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.990
 be made into these headphones 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.710
 but inside there is like saying there are gods 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.390
 tiny threads that this is not 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.869
 maybe a professional way to do it 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.650
 but let's say that more functional is enough 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.610
 burning sites will all add up 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.610
 only those already made will succeed 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.940
 now you see that no children have come out 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.700
 I know if I can show 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.119
 just clean them which helps the paint 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.860
 carbonized and are ready for use 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.350
 after releasing these two cables 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.640
 from all four ends there 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.640
 all that remains is to apply them in here 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.880
 already see one I've already applied and I have to 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.080
 say that I feel pretty good now 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.000
 I show you how to connect them then well 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.240
 a very simple thing is to combine two 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.280
 children only thing I recommend e 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.660
 that is, to try the other with one Hebrew 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.080
 before mounting it make sure that 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.090
 the audio arrives as you can see if 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.010
 it should also hear its own sound 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.150
 the lawn the bonnet inside and for 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.590
 safety to make it move even less 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.720
 things that headphones are not needed i 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.550
 we removed the exact protection the 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:59.940
 I put a thread of Scotland 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:59.940
 now you only need to reassemble it once 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.560
 another how it works first 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.330
 And that's it 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.330
 now let's hear 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.959
 you have to feel the textures less 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.239
 well this is the other our 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.599
 project and see you at the next hello 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.599
 boys
