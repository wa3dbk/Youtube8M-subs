00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:56.390
 we will be able to break it 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.430
 and let's see what has touched us in the 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.810
 armor boxes wey this is power 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.580
 from idol to a crystal that emits a light 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.650
 tenuous whose molecules seem to want to be 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.900
 something else to scare you can feel 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.760
 your strength without rest you can accumulate 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.190
 74 these crystals and combine them a 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.900
 artifact of the fusion interface is not 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.400
 can exchange 100 when investigating in the 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.540
 villa of the guild to obtain that a 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.460
 artifact 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.780
 I do not know how this works 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.470
 I will investigate for the next video guys 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:24.000
 to see the armor boxes boots 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:26.370
 increases the damage but we lose critical 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.820
 it seems much better to see these others 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.530
 gloves this yes it is much better not good 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.880
 we increase the experience but games 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.009
 which otherwise is much better 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.340
 guys come on let's go inside 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:39.050

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.250
 with gamers environments we could have their 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.919
 tooth I hope you liked the
