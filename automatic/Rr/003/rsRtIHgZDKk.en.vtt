00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.660
 doubts about the program then we 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.760

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.220
 the program sing record of eight then 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.260
 hence start this extra video series 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.119
 in the studio pitcher we will go 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.060
 then start showing how 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.579
 saving your audio and videos from 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.800
 recordings then you did then you 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.980
 recorded an enchanted studio video you 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.050
 want to edit this audio is from this video in 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.960
 another program then you might be 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.090
 separating the audio from your video, right? 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.489
 and you can edit it and if someone in 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.890
 any program you want as it is 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.219
 What do you do then separate the audio from 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.250
 video and save that audio in that video 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.539
 it's on your computer it 's simple folks 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.640
 You may be doing this. 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.500
 procedure in two ways first 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.100
 so come on let's import who 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.189
 has projected media support and here is a 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.860

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.790
 right click to play for online games 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.770
 I'll give you an okay and then I'll go 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.640
 pressing the right button involves 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.430
 option to separate audio from video and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.979
 with this option and separated with you can 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.380
 see the video audio then that part 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.750
 top is the audio that the bottom 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.240
 It's the video so we can already be 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.040
 excluding the part here of the river leaving 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.350
 only from above so we tightens 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.979
 right click and came here in the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.350
 led 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.270

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.399
 trek 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.460

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.110
 I tested this feature aquino qantas 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.670
 studio to export the audio in my 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.650

 Let's cancel that the second method is 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.130
 very simple too personal the first 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.740

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.150
 ok only really for demonstration to 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.980
 That when we got salt, it's going to go 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.440
 be something that does not take too long 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.100
