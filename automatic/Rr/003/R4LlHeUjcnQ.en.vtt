00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
tiring but I've been working on creating

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.420 
tiring but I've been working on creating
some<00:00:14.750> magic<00:00:15.050> tricks<00:00:15.260> and<00:00:15.380> this<00:00:15.710> is<00:00:15.830> one<00:00:16.040> of<00:00:16.070> a

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
some magic tricks and this is one of a

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.470 
some magic tricks and this is one of a
couple<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:18.400> this<00:00:19.400> is<00:00:19.580> basically<00:00:19.820> a<00:00:20.060> variation

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
couple and this is basically a variation

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.290 
couple and this is basically a variation
of<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.140> everywhere<00:00:21.680> and<00:00:22.040> nowhere<00:00:22.550> a<00:00:22.760> country

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
of the everywhere and nowhere a country

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.779 
of the everywhere and nowhere a country
and<00:00:23.570> I<00:00:23.840> think<00:00:24.050> it's<00:00:24.170> pretty<00:00:24.320> visual<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.550> I'll

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
and I think it's pretty visual and I'll

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.050 
and I think it's pretty visual and I'll
post<00:00:26.000> it<00:00:26.180> tutorial<00:00:26.690> how<00:00:26.869> it's<00:00:27.050> done

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
post it tutorial how it's done

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.580 
post it tutorial how it's done
so<00:00:29.060> that<00:00:29.360> further<00:00:29.570> ado<00:00:29.810> here<00:00:30.110> it<00:00:30.199> is<00:00:30.320> so

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
so that further ado here it is so

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.010 
so that further ado here it is so

gonna try to test our luck we're gonna
select<00:00:48.260> three<00:00:48.649> random<00:00:49.130> cards<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:49.670> hopefully

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
select three random cards and hopefully

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.590 
select three random cards and hopefully
these<00:00:51.860> three<00:00:51.920> cards<00:00:52.579> that<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.180> spectator

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
these three cards that the spectator

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.889 
these three cards that the spectator
touch<00:00:54.010> just<00:00:55.010> one<00:00:55.850> of<00:00:55.969> them<00:00:56.180> will<00:00:56.390> be<00:00:56.540> your

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
touch just one of them will be your

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.930 
touch just one of them will be your
selection<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.160> let's<00:00:58.280> see<00:00:58.460> if<00:00:58.610> the<00:00:58.730> spectators

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
selection so let's see if the spectators

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.459 
selection so let's see if the spectators
have<00:00:59.420> good<00:00:59.660> hands<00:01:00.610> so<00:01:01.610> firstly<00:01:02.000> we<00:01:02.510> have<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:03.079> two

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
have good hands so firstly we have a two

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:04.199 
have good hands so firstly we have a two
diamonds

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:04.209 
diamonds

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.980 
diamonds
Jack<00:01:05.209> of<00:01:05.389> Hearts<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:06.350> Jack's<00:01:06.709> face<00:01:07.689> close<00:01:08.689> I

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
Jack of Hearts and Jack's face close I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.179 
Jack of Hearts and Jack's face close I
guess<00:01:09.170> but<00:01:09.619> no<00:01:09.950> cigar<00:01:10.340> well<00:01:11.439> it's<00:01:12.439> actually<00:01:12.950> a

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
guess but no cigar well it's actually a

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.730 
guess but no cigar well it's actually a
pretty<00:01:13.600> difficult<00:01:14.600> task<00:01:14.929> given<00:01:15.319> that<00:01:15.560> there's

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
pretty difficult task given that there's

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.499 
pretty difficult task given that there's
so<00:01:15.920> many<00:01:16.039> cards<00:01:16.369> in<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.579> deck<00:01:16.609> and<00:01:17.029> you

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
so many cards in the deck and you

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.480 
so many cards in the deck and you
randomly<00:01:17.959> just<00:01:18.079> selected<00:01:18.709> three<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.130> chances

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
randomly just selected three the chances

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.149 
randomly just selected three the chances
of<00:01:19.579> finding<00:01:19.759> a<00:01:19.999> card<00:01:20.240> are<00:01:20.420> very<00:01:20.689> slim<00:01:20.990> but<00:01:21.889> your

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
of finding a card are very slim but your

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.010 
of finding a card are very slim but your
card<00:01:22.399> is<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.549> very<00:01:22.880> special<00:01:23.329> card<00:01:23.569> it<00:01:23.719> tends<00:01:23.929> to

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
card is a very special card it tends to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.129 
card is a very special card it tends to
pop<00:01:24.319> out<00:01:24.619> in<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.700> strangest<00:01:26.090> places<00:01:26.209> and<00:01:26.810> in

pop out in the strangest places and in

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:29.050 
pop out in the strangest places and in
the<00:01:27.229> most<00:01:27.439> unexpected<00:01:27.770> ways<00:01:28.399> you<00:01:28.789> see<00:01:28.819> the

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
the most unexpected ways you see the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.419 
the most unexpected ways you see the
three<00:01:29.270> random<00:01:29.599> selections<00:01:30.079> Oddie<00:01:30.740> do<00:01:31.099> is<00:01:31.159> give

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
three random selections Oddie do is give

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.679 
three random selections Oddie do is give
it<00:01:31.459> a<00:01:31.929> sort<00:01:32.929> of<00:01:32.959> little<00:01:33.549> jolts<00:01:34.549> like<00:01:34.729> that<00:01:34.939> and

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
it a sort of little jolts like that and

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.980 
it a sort of little jolts like that and
you<00:01:35.840> can<00:01:35.990> actually<00:01:36.139> see<00:01:37.599> one<00:01:38.599> of<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.810> random

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
you can actually see one of the random

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.690 
you can actually see one of the random
cards<00:01:39.380> actually<00:01:39.499> turn<00:01:39.920> into<00:01:40.069> your<00:01:40.279> selection

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
cards actually turn into your selection

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.260 
cards actually turn into your selection
but<00:01:41.569> of<00:01:41.689> course<00:01:41.929> your<00:01:42.109> eyes<00:01:42.409> must<00:01:43.069> be<00:01:43.270> playing

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
but of course your eyes must be playing

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.149 
but of course your eyes must be playing
tricks<00:01:44.389> on<00:01:44.749> you<00:01:44.959> that<00:01:45.319> can't<00:01:45.590> happen

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
tricks on you that can't happen

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.239 
tricks on you that can't happen
so<00:01:46.579> we<00:01:46.759> got<00:01:46.939> our<00:01:47.149> two<00:01:47.689> cards<00:01:48.349> remaining<00:01:48.619> let's

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
so we got our two cards remaining let's

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:52.899 
so we got our two cards remaining let's
see<00:01:49.520> if<00:01:49.899> they<00:01:50.899> can<00:01:51.259> do<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.409> trick<00:01:51.679> watch<00:01:52.099> onion

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
see if they can do a trick watch onion

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.929 
see if they can do a trick watch onion
use<00:01:53.119> this<00:01:53.299> wave<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.899> couple<00:01:54.200> of<00:01:54.259> times<00:01:54.499> wait

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
use this wave a couple of times wait

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.760 
use this wave a couple of times wait
wait<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:57.409> that<00:01:58.399> Jack<00:01:58.729> turns<00:01:59.329> into<00:01:59.770> your
