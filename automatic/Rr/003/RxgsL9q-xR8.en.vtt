the<00:00:00.719> vector<00:00:01.050> k10<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.800> high<00:00:02.129> fire<00:00:02.550> rate

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
the vector k10 is a high fire rate

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.089

and<00:00:27.510> at<00:00:27.689> long<00:00:27.810> range<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.260> very<00:00:28.529> hard<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.949> see

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
and at long range it's very hard to see

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.250 
and at long range it's very hard to see
the<00:00:29.130> target<00:00:29.609> especially<00:00:29.760> if<00:00:30.179> you're<00:00:30.480> reticles

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
the target especially if you're reticles

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.280 
the target especially if you're reticles
are<00:00:31.380> moving<00:00:31.679> about<00:00:31.769> with<00:00:31.949> under<00:00:32.660> Rico<00:00:33.660> so

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
are moving about with under Rico so

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.700 
are moving about with under Rico so
remember<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.860> submachine<00:00:35.430> head<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.059> don't

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
remember it's a submachine head so don't

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.530 
remember it's a submachine head so don't
try<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:38.129> train<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.000> see<00:00:39.180> some<00:00:39.390> boat

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
try a train so if you see some boat

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.020 
try a train so if you see some boat
language<00:00:39.960> try<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> use<00:00:40.800> cover<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.640> closer

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
language try to use cover to get closer

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.240 
language try to use cover to get closer
maybe<00:00:42.450> serve<00:00:42.719> right<00:00:42.989> make<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.800> round<00:00:43.980> though

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
maybe serve right make it round though

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.520 
maybe serve right make it round though
it<00:00:44.399> usually<00:00:44.550> don't<00:00:44.940> expect<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:46.410> usually

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
it usually don't expect it they usually

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.670 
it usually don't expect it they usually
expect<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.309> go<00:00:47.489> behind<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.910> cover<00:00:48.120> cut<00:00:48.360> out

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
expect you to go behind to cover cut out

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.410 
expect you to go behind to cover cut out
again<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.460> very<00:00:50.670> good<00:00:50.820> strategy<00:00:51.090> in

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
again so it's a very good strategy in

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.790 
again so it's a very good strategy in
general<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.930> see<00:00:52.079> someone<00:00:52.559> with<00:00:52.649> an

more<00:01:01.469> trouble<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.850> vector<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.780> good<00:01:04.439> at

for hip fire but if you are at very

close range

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.420

it<00:01:08.939> pays<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:10.159> use<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.369> hipfire<00:01:11.820> spray<00:01:12.299> and

it pays to use the hipfire spray and

it pays to use the hipfire spray and
it's<00:01:14.430> likely<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.000> very<00:01:15.420> hard<00:01:15.689> to

don't use hipfire exclusively because

you don't have trouble with them because

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.530 
you don't have trouble with them because
it's<00:01:33.300> going<00:01:33.510> to<00:01:33.690> miss<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> lot<00:01:34.610> then<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.940> does

semtex<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:54.080> think<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.590> better<00:02:54.740> option

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
semtex I think is the better option

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.480 
semtex I think is the better option
because<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:56.150> are<00:02:56.660> in<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.050> close<00:02:57.490> quarters

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
because you are in a close quarters

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.990 
because you are in a close quarters
situation<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.709> semtex<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:01.070> fern<00:03:01.400> forget<00:03:01.790> the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
situation and semtex is fern forget the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.120 
situation and semtex is fern forget the
explode<00:03:02.450> that's<00:03:02.630> one<00:03:02.900> reason<00:03:03.650> I<00:03:03.830> was<00:03:03.950> using

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
explode that's one reason I was using

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.940 
explode that's one reason I was using
shock<00:03:04.550> charge<00:03:04.970> was<00:03:05.270> because<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:06.320> was<00:03:06.590> playing

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
shock charge was because I was playing

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.850 
shock charge was because I was playing
got<00:03:07.820> hard<00:03:08.090> points<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.690> shock<00:03:09.380> tiles<00:03:09.650> are

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
pretty powerful in that physique you

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.680 
pretty powerful in that physique you
must<00:03:11.840> put<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.080> into<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.470> doorway<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.459> then<00:03:14.090> when

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
must put it into a doorway and then when

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.360 
must put it into a doorway and then when

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
an enemy runs through you know and they

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.440 
an enemy runs through you know and they
also<00:03:16.550> get<00:03:16.850> stunned

secondary pistol whatever nothing weedy

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.880 
secondary pistol whatever nothing weedy
it's<00:03:22.250> just<00:03:22.550> there<00:03:22.820> so<00:03:23.390> in<00:03:24.290> case<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:24.680> run<00:03:24.830> out

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
it's just there so in case you run out

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.600 
it's just there so in case you run out
of<00:03:25.130> bullets<00:03:26.350> magazine<00:03:27.350> so<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:28.160> can<00:03:28.340> switch<00:03:28.580> to

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
of bullets magazine so you can switch to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.479 
of bullets magazine so you can switch to
it<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.150> finish<00:03:29.510> enemies<00:03:29.870> off<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:31.160> recently

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
used laser sight is because at close

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.520 
used laser sight is because at close
range<00:03:34.850> hip<00:03:35.180> firing<00:03:35.480> is<00:03:35.750> very<00:03:35.989> important

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
range hip firing is very important

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.780 
range hip firing is very important
especially<00:03:37.070> if<00:03:37.519> you're<00:03:37.700> playing<00:03:38.110> hard<00:03:39.110> points

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.890 
especially if you're playing hard points
there's<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:40.880> lot<00:03:41.030> of<00:03:41.150> close<00:03:41.420> quarters

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
there's a lot of close quarters

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.949 
there's a lot of close quarters

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
situation in that and laser sight helps

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.750 
situation in that and laser sight helps
you<00:03:45.080> have<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.560> lot<00:03:45.769> as<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.040> decreases<00:03:46.670> you
