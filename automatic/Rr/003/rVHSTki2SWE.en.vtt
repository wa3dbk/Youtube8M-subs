00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
model working in five volts so you can

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.179

use it and I guess you will also feature

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.789 
use it and I guess you will also feature
out<00:01:48.399> on<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.850> interferences<00:01:49.509> ok<00:01:50.259> so<00:01:50.320> this

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
out on the interferences ok so this

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.270 
out on the interferences ok so this
cable<00:01:51.219> also<00:01:51.460> can<00:01:52.329> be<00:01:52.359> a<00:01:53.700> lighting<00:01:54.700> but<00:01:55.479> it's<00:01:55.869> a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
cable also can be a lighting but it's a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.779 
cable also can be a lighting but it's a
scanning<00:01:57.280> five<00:01:57.609> dot<00:01:57.820> dot<00:01:58.719> 4<00:01:59.680> grams<00:02:00.009> so<00:02:00.340> maybe

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
scanning five dot dot 4 grams so maybe

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.590 
scanning five dot dot 4 grams so maybe
it<00:02:01.450> can<00:02:01.719> be<00:02:02.020> for<00:02:02.380> very<00:02:02.409> teeny<00:02:03.039> a<00:02:03.340> few<00:02:04.179> system

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
it can be for very teeny a few system

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.639 
it can be for very teeny a few system
this<00:02:05.560> one<00:02:05.740> can<00:02:05.950> be<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.990> can<00:02:08.140> reduce<00:02:08.289> weight

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
this one can be a we can reduce weight

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.190 
this one can be a we can reduce weight
for<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.070> one<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.460> finally<00:02:10.240> what<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.869> find

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
for this one and finally what you find

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.240 
for this one and finally what you find
you<00:02:11.380> will<00:02:11.590> find<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:11.950> stick<00:02:13.380> antenna<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.710> think

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
you will find a stick antenna I think

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.160 
you will find a stick antenna I think
it's<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.580> 5dbi

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
it's a 5dbi

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.839 
it's a 5dbi
gain<00:02:17.560> one<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:19.750> little<00:02:20.440> bit<00:02:20.680> more<00:02:21.550> hair

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
gain one so a little bit more hair

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.990 
gain one so a little bit more hair
longer<00:02:22.090> than<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.750> 5am<00:02:23.650> pox<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:24.430> order<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.849> give

you<00:02:35.110> can<00:02:35.290> see<00:02:35.440> on<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.739> antenna<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:37.270> mo<00:02:37.600> one<00:02:37.840> is

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
you can see on the antenna the mo one is

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.920 
you can see on the antenna the mo one is
a<00:02:38.410> little<00:02:38.860> bit<00:02:38.950> router<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.670> maybe<00:02:39.970> it's<00:02:40.540> little

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
a little bit router so maybe it's little

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.900 
a little bit router so maybe it's little
bit<00:02:41.020> a<00:02:41.260> good<00:02:41.590> good<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.100> have<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> higher<00:02:42.610> gain

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
bit a good good to have a higher gain

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.160 
bit a good good to have a higher gain
with<00:02:43.209> this<00:02:43.330> one<00:02:43.540> but<00:02:44.050> of<00:02:44.200> course<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:46.390> have<00:02:47.140> to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
with this one but of course you have to

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.800 
with this one but of course you have to
use<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:48.150> more<00:02:49.830> efficient<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:50.980> Jenna<00:02:51.220> are

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
use a more efficient and Jenna are

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.740 
use a more efficient and Jenna are
cleverly<00:02:52.810> for<00:02:52.959> example<00:02:53.290> oh<00:02:53.610> one<00:02:54.610> point<00:02:54.910> this

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
cleverly for example oh one point this

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.080 
cleverly for example oh one point this
one<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.170> using<00:02:56.530> AC<00:02:57.040> male<00:02:57.190> connector<00:02:57.640> ok

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
one is using AC male connector ok

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.650 
one is using AC male connector ok
compared<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.840> ggs<00:02:59.440> that<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:00.459> 23<00:03:01.120> which<00:03:01.269> is<00:03:01.480> a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
compared to ggs that I 23 which is a

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.890 
compared to ggs that I 23 which is a
piece<00:03:01.900> email<00:03:02.290> ok<00:03:02.590> so<00:03:02.650> be<00:03:03.640> sure<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.850> after<00:03:04.480> the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
piece email ok so be sure to after the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.580 
piece email ok so be sure to after the
right<00:03:05.140> end<00:03:05.470> connector<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:07.650> will<00:03:08.650> escape<00:03:08.890> the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
right end connector I will escape the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.960 
right end connector I will escape the
the<00:03:11.590> harm<00:03:11.920> way<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:15.069> close<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:16.980> 17<00:03:17.980> gram<00:03:18.220> ok

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
the harm way and is close to 17 gram ok

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:28.949 
the harm way and is close to 17 gram ok
versus<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:23.700> gs5<00:03:25.620> 823<00:03:26.620> which<00:03:26.799> is<00:03:27.040> seven<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.630> two

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959
