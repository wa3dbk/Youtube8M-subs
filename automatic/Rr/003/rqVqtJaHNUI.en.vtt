Gary guys a song from a bloody garden
calm<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.990> what<00:00:19.980> I'm<00:00:20.100> actually<00:00:20.250> planning<00:00:20.580> out

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
calm and what I'm actually planning out

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.970 
calm and what I'm actually planning out
today<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> bit<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.689> corn<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:22.859> in

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
today is a bit of corn but it's in

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.980 
today is a bit of corn but it's in
preparation<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:23.910> what<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:24.269> call<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> three

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
preparation for what they call a three

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.290 
preparation for what they call a three
sisters<00:00:25.470> garden<00:00:25.830> or<00:00:26.189> three<00:00:26.430> sisters<00:00:26.789> planting

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
sisters garden or three sisters planting

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.769 
sisters garden or three sisters planting
and<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.410> concept<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.570> grow

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
and the concept of that is that you grow

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.430 
and the concept of that is that you grow
corn<00:00:31.170> beans<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.540> cucumbers<00:00:33.540> squash<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
corn beans and cucumbers squash in the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.650 
corn beans and cucumbers squash in the
same<00:00:34.710> garden<00:00:35.219> bed<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:36.239> amongst<00:00:36.570> each<00:00:36.809> other<00:00:37.430> um

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
same garden bed in amongst each other um

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.000 
same garden bed in amongst each other um
now<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.050> want<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.379> give<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.739> try<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
now I just want to give this a try and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.010 
now I just want to give this a try and
see<00:00:41.160> how<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.550> goes<00:00:41.840> hopefully<00:00:42.840> it'll<00:00:42.960> be

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
see how it goes hopefully it'll be

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.709 
see how it goes hopefully it'll be
successful<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.950> think<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> key<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.510> is

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
successful I think the key to it is

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.100 
successful I think the key to it is
obviously<00:00:46.530> starting<00:00:46.950> with<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> good<00:00:47.340> rich<00:00:47.969> soil

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
obviously starting with a good rich soil

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.400 
obviously starting with a good rich soil
because<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.559> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.800> be<00:00:50.090> fairly<00:00:51.410> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
because this is going to be fairly a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.920 
because this is going to be fairly a
fairly<00:00:53.010> hungry<00:00:53.309> crop<00:00:53.699> although<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
fairly hungry crop although one of the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.590 
fairly hungry crop although one of the
benefits<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.100> beans<00:00:56.430> will<00:00:56.760> fix

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
benefits is that the beans will fix

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.689 
benefits is that the beans will fix
nitrogen<00:00:57.840> into<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> soil<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.579> going

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
nitrogen into the soil so that's going

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.660 
nitrogen into the soil so that's going
to<00:00:59.760> be<00:01:00.140> one<00:01:01.140> thing<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.649> will<00:01:01.770> work<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.399> my

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
to be one thing that will work for my

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.410 
to be one thing that will work for my
favor<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:05.369> idea<00:01:05.700> behind<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.180> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
favor but the idea behind it is you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.950 
favor but the idea behind it is you
plant<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> corn<00:01:06.990> first<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:08.280> let<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.490> grow

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
plant the corn first you let that grow

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.899 
plant the corn first you let that grow
about<00:01:09.960> 30<00:01:10.260> centimeters<00:01:10.470> high<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.790> you

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
about 30 centimeters high and then you

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.450 
about 30 centimeters high and then you
plant<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> beans<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:13.380> get<00:01:13.560> let<00:01:14.040> them<00:01:14.250> get

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
plant the beans you get let them get

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.120 
plant the beans you get let them get
started<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.119> then<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.080> plant<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.530> cucumber

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
started and then you plant the cucumber

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.060 
started and then you plant the cucumber
or<00:01:17.159> squash<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:19.049> corn<00:01:19.320> obviously

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
or squash and the corn obviously

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.370 
or squash and the corn obviously
provides<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> with<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.610> corn<00:01:20.880> crop<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> gives

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
provides you with a corn crop and gives

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.020 
provides you with a corn crop and gives
you<00:01:22.470> an<00:01:22.590> upright<00:01:23.009> for<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> beans<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.670> climb<00:01:24.000> up

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
you an upright for the beans to climb up

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.810 
you an upright for the beans to climb up
the<00:01:24.780> beans<00:01:25.080> help<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.070> fix<00:01:26.220> nitrogen<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the beans help to fix nitrogen in the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.399 
the beans help to fix nitrogen in the
soil<00:01:26.939> which<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.509> something<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.110> those

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
soil which is something that all those

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.060 
soil which is something that all those
plants<00:01:28.829> are<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.220> need<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.490> grow<00:01:30.020> and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
plants are going to need to grow and

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.010 
plants are going to need to grow and
provides<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.220> with<00:01:32.310> beans<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.020> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
provides you with beans and the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.719 
provides you with beans and the
cucumbers<00:01:34.590> squash<00:01:34.710> provides<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
cucumbers squash provides you with a

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.210 
cucumbers squash provides you with a
living<00:01:36.060> mulch<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.110> it'll<00:01:37.560> prevent<00:01:37.920> weeds

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
living mulch so it'll prevent weeds

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.300 
living mulch so it'll prevent weeds
coming<00:01:38.729> up<00:01:39.170> in<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.350> garden<00:01:40.710> bed<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
coming up in the garden bed and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.370 
coming up in the garden bed and
obviously<00:01:41.850> also<00:01:42.090> provides<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:42.990> good

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
obviously also provides you with good

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.190 
obviously also provides you with good
food<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.829> well<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.149> fairly<00:01:45.659> intense

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
food as well so it's a fairly intense

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.350 
food as well so it's a fairly intense
well<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> think<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.369> could<00:01:47.759> be<00:01:47.850> fairly<00:01:48.060> intense

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
well I think it could be fairly intense

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.460 
well I think it could be fairly intense
i<00:01:48.659> think<00:01:48.899> it's<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.290> fairly

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
i think it's going to be a fairly

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.109 
i think it's going to be a fairly
thirsty<00:01:50.070> planting<00:01:50.490> because<00:01:50.610> you've<00:01:50.880> got<00:01:50.970> all

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
thirsty planting because you've got all

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.270 
thirsty planting because you've got all
those<00:01:51.270> three<00:01:51.630> different<00:01:52.020> plants<00:01:52.350> growing<00:01:53.100> in

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
those three different plants growing in

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.850 
those three different plants growing in
such<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> small<00:01:53.729> area<00:01:54.350> probably<00:01:55.350> pretty<00:01:55.619> hungry

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
such a small area probably pretty hungry

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.030 
such a small area probably pretty hungry
so<00:01:56.159> i'm<00:01:56.280> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.549> keep<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.270> UM<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
so i'm going to keep the UM the

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.649 
so i'm going to keep the UM the
nutrients<00:01:59.040> up<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.399> it<00:02:00.110> but<00:02:01.110> yeah<00:02:01.409> i'm<00:02:01.590> just

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
nutrients up to it but yeah i'm just

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.639 
nutrients up to it but yeah i'm just
setting<00:02:03.659> yourself<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:04.049> bit<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.290> challenge<00:02:04.469> i

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
setting yourself a bit of a challenge i

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.440 
setting yourself a bit of a challenge i
know<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.040> be<00:02:05.070> done<00:02:05.280> all<00:02:05.460> I've<00:02:05.640> seen<00:02:06.119> lots

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
know it can be done all I've seen lots

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.690 
know it can be done all I've seen lots
of<00:02:07.200> other<00:02:07.320> examples<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.920> people<00:02:08.069> doing<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.580> so

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
of other examples of people doing it so

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.339 
of other examples of people doing it so
