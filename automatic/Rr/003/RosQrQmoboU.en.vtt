again<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:05.339> just<00:00:05.640> wanted<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.180> talk<00:00:07.170> through<00:00:07.350> a

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
again I just wanted to talk through a

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.140 
again I just wanted to talk through a
bit<00:00:07.589> more<00:00:07.740> about<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.130> shuffling<00:00:08.820> knee<00:00:08.940> on

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
bit more about this shuffling knee on

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.049 
bit more about this shuffling knee on
the<00:00:09.179> last<00:00:09.450> video<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.990> showed<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.710> basic

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
the last video I showed you the basic

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.900 
the last video I showed you the basic
sort<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.120> shuffle<00:00:12.300> which<00:00:12.540> was<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:16.880> what<00:00:17.880> I

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
sort of shuffle which was this what I

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.029 
sort of shuffle which was this what I
didn't<00:00:18.240> cover<00:00:18.359> was<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.660> high<00:00:18.930> cord<00:00:19.289> and

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
didn't cover was the high cord and

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.140 
didn't cover was the high cord and
there's<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.310> many<00:00:20.369> different<00:00:20.699> ways<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.029> play

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
there's so many different ways to play

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.029 
there's so many different ways to play
that<00:00:21.390> high<00:00:21.570> chord<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.140> thought<00:00:22.650> I'm<00:00:22.740> doing<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
that high chord I thought I'm doing a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.910 
that high chord I thought I'm doing a
completely<00:00:23.369> different<00:00:23.550> video<00:00:23.990> so<00:00:24.990> obviously

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
completely different video so obviously

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.960 
completely different video so obviously
the<00:00:26.099> obvious<00:00:26.369> thing<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:26.880> you're

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the obvious thing to do if you're

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.609 
the obvious thing to do if you're
following<00:00:27.800> the<00:00:28.800> rhythm<00:00:28.980> you're<00:00:29.189> doing<00:00:29.490> here

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
following the rhythm you're doing here

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.690 
following the rhythm you're doing here
you<00:00:31.619> could<00:00:31.800> borrow<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.160> here<00:00:32.399> which<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
you could borrow it here which is a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.250 
you could borrow it here which is a
little<00:00:32.940> bit<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.149> stretch<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:34.079> work

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
little bit of a stretch but can work

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:44.470 
little bit of a stretch but can work
really<00:00:34.440> well<00:00:38.480> or<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.780> slide<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.440> it

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.910 

instead<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.600> playing<00:00:45.809> this

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.540 

you<00:00:50.920> can<00:00:51.070> play<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:52.000> B<00:00:52.180> here<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:54.100> can<00:00:54.250> play<00:00:54.460> it

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
you can play the B here you can play it

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.660 
you can play the B here you can play it
here<00:00:55.290> which<00:00:56.290> is<00:00:56.440> a<00:00:56.470> much<00:00:56.650> bigger<00:00:57.220> faster

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
here which is a much bigger faster

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.250 
here which is a much bigger faster
chunkier<00:00:58.270> way<00:00:58.360> of<00:00:58.480> playing<00:00:58.690> it<00:00:58.900> so<00:00:59.050> you<00:00:59.140> can

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
chunkier way of playing it so you can

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:09.800 
chunkier way of playing it so you can
play

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.000 

let<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.930> obviously<00:01:11.200> work<00:01:11.350> any<00:01:11.530> we<00:01:11.650> can<00:01:11.800> put<00:01:11.920> it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
let the obviously work any we can put it

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.060 
let the obviously work any we can put it
up<00:01:12.070> Annie

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.740 

all<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.250> very<00:01:16.490> very<00:01:16.579> lazy<00:01:16.939> way<00:01:17.270> of<00:01:17.299> doing<00:01:17.659> it

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
all the very very lazy way of doing it

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.440 
all the very very lazy way of doing it
is<00:01:17.840> actually<00:01:18.079> just<00:01:18.200> playing<00:01:18.530> like<00:01:19.369> a<00:01:19.399> b7<00:01:20.149> here

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
is actually just playing like a b7 here

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.300 
is actually just playing like a b7 here
which<00:01:20.719> is<00:01:20.869> it<00:01:21.320> doesn't<00:01:21.560> I<00:01:21.799> don't<00:01:21.979> think<00:01:22.189> it's

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
which is it doesn't I don't think it's

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.429 
which is it doesn't I don't think it's
the<00:01:22.640> best<00:01:22.850> sounding<00:01:23.240> one<00:01:23.450> but<00:01:23.630> if<00:01:24.289> you're

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
the best sounding one but if you're

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:37.810 
the best sounding one but if you're
feeling<00:01:24.770> lazy<00:01:24.890> if<00:01:25.220> it<00:01:25.369> works

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.340 

okay<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> other<00:01:39.150> way<00:01:39.330> which<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.720> quite<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.140> is

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
okay the other way which I quite like is

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.410 
okay the other way which I quite like is
actually<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.800> playing<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.430> similar<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> b7

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
actually is playing is similar to the b7

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.830 
actually is playing is similar to the b7
chord<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:43.260> you<00:01:43.440> play<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.450> second

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
chord but you play the on the second

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.280 
chord but you play the on the second
fret<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.170> play<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:48.270> would<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> f-sharp

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
fret you play it would be the f-sharp

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.730 
fret you play it would be the f-sharp
so<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.790> could<00:01:50.970> start<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.510> seven

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.620 

finger<00:01:55.740> down<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.400> on<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.330> second

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
finger down on to the on to the second

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.010 
finger down on to the on to the second
fret<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> E<00:01:58.020> string

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
fret on the E string

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:09.010 
fret on the E string
so<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.229> play<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.530> this

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.050 

so<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:09.980> kind<00:02:10.190> of<00:02:10.250> play<00:02:10.400> a<00:02:10.430> little<00:02:10.610> shuffle

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
so you kind of play a little shuffle

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.780 
so you kind of play a little shuffle
rhythm<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.450> there

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.949 

what<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.909> can<00:02:18.150> do<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.629> up<00:02:20.000> just<00:02:21.000> like<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.810> you

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
what you can do is up just like like you

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.119 
what you can do is up just like like you
were<00:02:22.049> playing<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.349> bar<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:22.769> you<00:02:22.860> actually

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
were playing a bar but you actually

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:30.460 
were playing a bar but you actually
leave<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.579> open

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.720 

so<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.620> again

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.180 

which<00:02:38.510> works<00:02:38.720> quite<00:02:38.960> well<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.890> other<00:02:40.040> way<00:02:40.130> you

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
which works quite well the other way you

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.190 
which works quite well the other way you
can<00:02:40.400> just<00:02:40.580> play<00:02:40.760> straight<00:02:40.820> notes<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:42.140> can

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
can just play straight notes so you can

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.550 
can just play straight notes so you can
go

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.650 

again<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.739> can<00:02:49.830> work<00:02:50.040> quite<00:02:50.220> well<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:51.510> can

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
again that can work quite well you can

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.370 
again that can work quite well you can
play<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> straight<00:02:52.140> cord

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.490 

or<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:59.030> kind<00:02:59.360> of<00:02:59.420> lightning<00:02:59.780> Hopkins<00:02:59.930> thing<00:03:00.380> to

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
or a kind of lightning Hopkins thing to

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.500 
or a kind of lightning Hopkins thing to
do<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:00.920> actually<00:03:01.130> play<00:03:01.490> a<00:03:01.520> basically<00:03:02.210> play<00:03:02.390> the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
do is actually play a basically play the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:12.809 
do is actually play a basically play the
bass<00:03:02.690> line

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.640 

which<00:03:13.819> is<00:03:14.030> which<00:03:14.750> sounds<00:03:15.050> really<00:03:15.170> cool

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
which is which sounds really cool
