land the roll it all comes down to
placement<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.610> lot<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:17.030> people<00:02:17.300> do<00:02:17.450> them<00:02:17.569> out

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
placement a lot of people do them out

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.229 
placement a lot of people do them out
here<00:02:18.110> you've<00:02:18.890> got<00:02:19.100> to<00:02:19.220> actually<00:02:19.400> bottom<00:02:20.000> turn

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
here you've got to actually bottom turn

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.350 
here you've got to actually bottom turn
and<00:02:20.630> hit<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.440> lip<00:02:21.700> vertical<00:02:22.700> if<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.090> can<00:02:23.239> hit

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
and hit the lip vertical if you can hit

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.910 
and hit the lip vertical if you can hit
it<00:02:23.420> vertical<00:02:23.959> then<00:02:24.170> you're<00:02:24.470> going<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.620> do<00:02:24.769> all

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
it vertical then you're going to do all

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.670 
it vertical then you're going to do all
your<00:02:25.069> rotation<00:02:25.610> out<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.180> above<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.170> wave<00:02:27.380> and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
your rotation out and above the wave and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.800 
your rotation out and above the wave and
that<00:02:28.250> will<00:02:28.400> get<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.580> momentum<00:02:29.000> around<00:02:29.330> for

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
that will get the momentum around for

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.720 
that will get the momentum around for
your<00:02:29.930> spinner<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.410> land<00:02:30.650> forward<00:02:31.220> instead<00:02:31.580> of

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
your spinner to land forward instead of

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.970 
your spinner to land forward instead of
landing<00:02:32.000> backwards<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:33.110> just<00:02:33.560> remember<00:02:33.799> when

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
landing backwards so just remember when

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.160 
landing backwards so just remember when
you<00:02:34.190> bottom<00:02:34.489> turning<00:02:34.940> not<00:02:35.510> here<00:02:35.810> here<00:02:36.650> okay

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
you bottom turning not here here okay

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.530 
you bottom turning not here here okay
but<00:02:39.170> with<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.500> IRS<00:02:39.799> is<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.489> come<00:02:40.700> down<00:02:40.940> bottom

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
but with the IRS is you come down bottom

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.960 
but with the IRS is you come down bottom
turn<00:02:41.750> hit<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.110> lip<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.470> people<00:02:43.400> tend<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.670> fall

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
turn hit the lip and people tend to fall

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.600 
turn hit the lip and people tend to fall
backwards<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:44.959> their<00:02:45.140> legs<00:02:45.350> are<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:45.980> if

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
backwards so their legs are like that if

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.140 
backwards so their legs are like that if
you<00:02:46.819> do<00:02:47.060> what<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.109> do<00:02:48.290> is<00:02:48.530> land<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.459> stay<00:02:49.880> flat

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
you do what you do is land it stay flat

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.300 
you do what you do is land it stay flat
on<00:02:50.209> your<00:02:50.450> board<00:02:50.660> dig<00:02:51.049> one<00:02:51.260> leg<00:02:51.500> in<00:02:51.739> spin<00:02:52.190> around

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
on your board dig one leg in spin around

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
on your board dig one leg in spin around
with<00:02:52.700> your<00:02:52.850> flipper<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.390> keep<00:02:53.930> going
