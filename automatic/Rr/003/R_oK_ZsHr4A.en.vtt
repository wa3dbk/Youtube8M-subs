00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.180
 hello how about friends from facebook and from 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.689
 youtube my name is jonathan de yo al 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.070
 studies and because this video is a mere 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.980
 excuse for 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.590
 to inaugurate the channel that now 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.259
 we are premiering where we will go 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.720
 uploading some videos explaining 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.510
 our way of working how to apply 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.140
 the color good many things 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.690
 we will be going up 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.059
 this time I come to show you the new 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.980
 version of sweet pain that will come out 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.530
 for the other year that until now is in 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.800
 its 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.510
 in its beta phase because then I'm going 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.480
 to show as for example to hunt in a 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.670
 little of 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.670
 of good letters symbols I do not know 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.570
 the country 62 the next version 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.700
 as you will see, not even the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.159
 complete tools we see the 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.159
 I do not see the other bookmarks 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.110
 color palettes and all that kind of 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.810
 things that is that has the sweet bread and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.850
 normal 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.740
 I'm going to talk to you then about the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.070
 new things that we will see for the new 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.060
 paintball 6 2 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.060
 as we see 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.570
 the brushes this time are going to be up 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.870
 5000 then a great advantage for 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.840
 those who work large canvases that 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.720
 Well, as far as my work is concerned 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.710
 smaller canvases out there of 5,000 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.070
 by 3000 something like this smaller 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.320
 you will see then it is huge because the size of 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.570
 those brushes that came before 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.210
 500 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.730
 another of the new things that I saw in this 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.820
 sweet country 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.860
 It is the vanishing point tool as 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.410
 I think it seems excellent to me 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.020
 they work manga and all this kind of 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.130
 things because they can make lines of 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.130
 easier movement 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.219
 here 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.030
 movement lines more easily 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.750
 it shows that there are still some errors 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.620
 because that line here that came out health is 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.770
 winds should not come out like this but these 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.960
 they come out very well 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.690
 and of course that 's a great advantage because 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:48.220
 Well, those who did not have, for example, 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:52.720
 manga studio on 5 or 4 where is 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.060
 option is therefore much easier 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.070
 much easier to work to work 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.650
 lines of movement by 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.530
 three point perspectives we can 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.800
 work here 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.810
 the prospects with this tool already 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.460
 that the vanishing points then by 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.880
 example 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.630
 what do I know I'm going to locate 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.630
 next to here 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.819
 for example to make the houses of that 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.230
 way then it's very good that 's a 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.230
 pretty good tool for 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.600
 to work to work funds 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.690
 constructions I do not know all that kind of 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.690
 things 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.100
 so much easier 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.080
 One thing that had lacked the 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.030
 paint a 6 in its previous version and that 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.000
 the truth seems to me 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.980
 the best thing they can do is placed is 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.819
 the text tool 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.480
 as you can see, they know the different types 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.480
 from sources 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:07.090
 the different types of sources 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.090
 I want to place this 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.620
 many sources know a lot 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.480
 that we have installed and because this is 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.090
 tool is excellent since 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.320
 to edit text many people I 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.490
 ask for example as an edict 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.830
 text in paint tools 6 because the only 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.220
 would render the text in photoshop 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.979
 because I know and I did not accept that style of 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.350
 layer then it was not impossible to work 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.620
 but then in the new version that as 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:41.810
 we are seeing so magnificent can not 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.810
 work text directly there 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.820
 that would be the main thing I have not seen it 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.130
 I have seen something newer that they have taken 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.780
 as it was then it shows that the version 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.460
 beta because I do not even see the 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.600
 the other tools the tool 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.140
 the selectivity marker 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.860
 of blurring then you can wait for the 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.890
 another year to get the version then 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.040
 new of the program and then anything 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:15.390
 if it is environment to my channel just 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.540
 just take out the paint version 16 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.730
 I'll be uploading it so that several 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.320
 people download it and they can 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.400
 enjoy it because this program the 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.980
 truth is that it is very good is the 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.500
 program that more than anything that I use 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.120
 jonathan bracelet 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.699
 that I use to work because 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.449
 I find it very easy to use and 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.449
 tools are 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.210
 they are easy to use they do not have much 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.810
 complicate more with a digital tablet and 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.840
 it is very easy to access this 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:53.540
 to the ease that this has 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.820
 program to illustrate for 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.590
 to do and then now for example with 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.890
 the context one can already do 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.300
 make texts in an easier way not 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.740
 be going to programs like 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.790
 photoshop 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.910
 the studio sleeve 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:13.010
 then you know if they are pending 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.500
 anything on the channel subscribe if 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:19.040
 they like we will be going up as they 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.540
 said to other types of videos where we're going 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.600
 to explain the way we work 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.610
 us the color the line the way in 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.910
 that we work the different effects of 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.380
 light in the illustrations and then if you 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.200
 they like, they can leave us their 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.720
 comments and well I do not think that would be 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.830
 everything then thank you so much for watching 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.830
 the video and until next time
