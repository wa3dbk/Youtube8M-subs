00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 when playing the second edition we can 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.360
 find us many mysteries in the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.849
 game one of them is the disappearance of 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.330
 one of the figures of the dishes in the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.260
 room 4 of said game at the beginning 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:24.029
 we can see that there are three one looks like 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.330
 Fred and another bonnie but the last one 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.420
 It looks like girl continuing the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.059
 sequence looks more like balloon boy 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:39.840
 that girl so let's say it's the 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:44.129
 now the latter appears sweetened in 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:49.350
 some time but like this one comes up 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:53.280
 there good some fans says it's balloon 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.070
 boy but I think it's ruled out since 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.030
 balloon boy in no time appears in 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.809
 that room now the only one that appears there 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.940
 She is a girl but some will ask 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.180
 how can she be 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.080
 if she does not have arms remember that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.350
 there's duct tape there on the walls 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.630
 well this can bring the figure in its 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:25.620
 back stuck at the moment this 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:29.250
 I am in your room and attack you and you 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.310
 You're wearing the Freddy mask. 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.650
 put in the room where you are in the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.960
 game now because they do some say 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.760
 what is a camera 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:50.340
 this time I think I'm 50% 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:53.900
 agreement and another 50% disagreement since the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.390
 be put this figure the animatronics 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.659
 they start arriving very often trying 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.380
 t to kill and it becomes more difficult to 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.700
 game now for the other part I think that 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.819
 it can not be true 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.670
 because the only thing in the figure that 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.599
 could I make a camera I think it would be 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:21.250
 his eye either of the two but this 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:24.550
 it's not why I say this is good 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.670
 history is located in the 80s in 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.819
 which the micro cameras still do not 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.120
 existed until the 2000s in 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:38.319
 conclusion girl takes the figure up 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.830
 your room but the function of this is still 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.620
 a mystery if the video liked you for 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.930
