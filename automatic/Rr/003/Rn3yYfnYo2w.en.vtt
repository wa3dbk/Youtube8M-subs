00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:02.100
 Well, here we have our 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.290
 Rubik's Cube 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.100
 and nothing with this one 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.330
 I would say what happens is interested to solve in a 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.899
 love you fame 

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:10.840
 simple 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.919
 the cube 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.250
 lie operations steps also asks pretty simple then 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.109
 first of all explain bouquets 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.199
 the one that I'm going to take as a reference the white face and good and people who say that 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.699
 is by difficult issue the easiest thing is the uneven combat zones are 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.429
 Derived by the sticker 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.890
 in December as a reference 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.420
 it will not serve as 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.820
 as reference 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.240
 For 100 styles you also think that go 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.830
 the color of the medium from face to face indicates the 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.340
 the one that the color that is going to have in the whole face I explain myself percent is in 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.700
 white all this is white here are all prints after having borrowed 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.910
 and so for the rest 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.130
 the first goal the first step 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.170
 the one to overcome the cube is to get a cross 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.960
 this case we get a cross 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.070
 White color 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.280
 and not only that, but you have to have a cross and then you have to have 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.470
 the same color here 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.640
 the mec 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.430
 you have white here you have to have a target here to get the cross 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.359
 and then you will have to have farm and orange culture because they indicate you from the middle 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:17.170
 so many 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.070
 we throw 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.840
 I found out 'white-white' blue blue 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.110
 recently the 'white-white' red red 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.110
 here white white green green 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.640
 White White 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.740
 The NASA 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.020
 the base is more specific to the moment because it is the last 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.000
 which is to solve 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.090
 then n here borges 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.680
 tell you 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.179
 how do you get that 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.810
 lie that something rhythms 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.060
 higuey in a clear simple way 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.070
 what we have to look at from the base and at the bottom this is the 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.500
 sixth bottom and peace 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.150
 and there look for plan 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
 we have here a white that is on the bottom 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.260
 This case can serve us because we have to look 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.480
 a target 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.600
 this the bottom on any of the faces 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.689
 it was the base 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.689
 but important that it is in the center 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.739
 So these first stops are quite simple and what 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:18.899
 you will get 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:20.739
 in shape 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.219
 this for example this side I have no resolved but suppose I do not have 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.219
 determined I will train a little more the cobos 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.189
 perfect 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.329
 here we have in this case called watching him 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.779
 We had the bank down here and it's right in the center seeing what we're looking for 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.729
 it is the color 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:41.189
 has not done anything at the moment the color 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.099
 that indicates us below 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.970
 so we want a white in the lower part as I said and in the part 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:48.709
 below we have 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.029
 a blue but 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:54.400
 then it's not what we want to upload it to you and that it matches 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:55.400
 are you to this one 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.329
 this tab here below is worth 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.639
 then it's capitals and salmon 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.139
 base said what you need to do is search with the target is that search 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:05.810
 the one the color that tells you anything 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.760
 then applicable and that we work the bottom part looking at it so the part 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.579
 down 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.089
 we turn it 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:15.409
 what is this part 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.339
 and finally 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:19.889
 we will have 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.189
 our blue color 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.969
 perfect let's get 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.059
 we are looking for 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:30.519
 we just have the white color in the part of the base and in the center 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:32.789
 in the middle 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:34.299
 d will highlight 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.129
 and then what you have to do is 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.279
 get the white to come up to you and the orange cumbia with this one but that 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:41.049
 Go here 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.900
 this case is simpler than the previous one since in the previous one we had 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.459
 interspersed with color 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.530
 in total this case the only thing that needs to be done 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.959
 we have two colors and then the white here 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.369
 it's true twice 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:55.279
 and then we have it 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:56.759
 I repeat again 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:58.229
 we have here this 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:02.009
 we signed harris we already have the blue colors 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:03.599
 on the rise 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.379
 and white and white to 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.599
 do it statut 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.409
 if not 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.569
 we have this 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.079
 irak and the green therefore like for the face of this April 3 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:16.650
 this case 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.720
 It is not fat to lose points but it is composed of white 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.340
 Apply 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.090
 the algorithm 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.090
 keep going so 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:29.389
 we have 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.659
 this one white white oranges 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.059
 blue is left 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:35.689
 the last 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:38.639
 how did he get it I do not have to breach with 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.100
 in the lower part, yes, but it will not work because it has to be 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.229
 in the parts 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:45.639
 medium 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.680
 so 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.110
 What I do is 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.219
 I lower it so that this one 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:53.629
 where I want 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.520
 perfect and I have it in the passion part 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.150
 and with the two colors 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.309
 sets what we do is 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:05.569
 twice and then we will have our cross 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.219
 with all colors 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.110
 perfect slope 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.110
 will allow the first part to solve in which 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.559
 second part 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.909
 you have to get 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.080
 3 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.229
 on each side of the color that indicates na 'the piece of the month' 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.349
 you have to have green blatter 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.130
 here pure technique do not here a blue art 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.529
 and finally an art 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:41.439
 perfect 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:44.439
 how this is done because we keep focusing 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.150
 simoes watching 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.559
 the base and from yesterday to 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:52.909
 the color 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:54.039
 we have 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.589
 a red on this side 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:57.499
 we played the expected 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:00.189
 this one followed floats that followed blue face 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:03.580
 It entices that getting a file this appeal 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.580
 you have to get a file 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.860
 Red 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.139
 a poster that has the three colors in which it is placed 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.210
 we look for it on the part of the base on the inside 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.699
 let's see if we find it 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.009
 ok it's not 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.139
 that also as it can happen others that is not sure that I am looking for 

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:31.050
 in this case what we do is mouth another that may be 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.589
 we have the green 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:34.779
 red and white there 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.819
 should go a card that has bbc 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:39.819
 that has red that we have 

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:46.119
 or as if you upload this piece here 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:52.719
 the movement would have to be tels this 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:56.680
 to get the red on this side and the green on this side 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.990
 I lost pilar ramírez from the opera cent this movement 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.990
 we would lose the pizaña 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:07.759
 keep 'the piece of the month' 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:10.469
 How to keep piece of the medium 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:14.399
 and so that it keeps saved as it has been said so that they are makes this 

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:17.149
 movement 

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:19.619
 let's not lose this white 

00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:22.759
 then what we do is save the middle 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.590
 and now
