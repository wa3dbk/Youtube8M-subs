00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.040 
this kind of off-white beige cream color
the<00:00:34.190> armor<00:00:34.580> is<00:00:34.730> slightly<00:00:35.269> different<00:00:35.660> color

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
the armor is slightly different color

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.890 
the armor is slightly different color
than<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:36.879> under<00:00:37.879> suit<00:00:38.120> or<00:00:38.239> at<00:00:38.330> least<00:00:38.480> it<00:00:38.660> looks

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
than the under suit or at least it looks

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.259 
than the under suit or at least it looks
like<00:00:39.080> it<00:00:39.290> if<00:00:39.410> it's<00:00:39.620> just<00:00:40.010> in<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.640> optical

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
like it if it's just in the optical

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:42.700 
like it if it's just in the optical
illusion<00:00:41.360> because<00:00:41.750> of<00:00:42.019> the<00:00:42.170> sculpt<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:42.559> the

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
illusion because of the sculpt of the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.979 
illusion because of the sculpt of the
armor<00:00:43.010> then<00:00:43.280> that's<00:00:43.970> still<00:00:44.210> really<00:00:44.510> cool<00:00:44.720> but

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
armor then that's still really cool but

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.630 
armor then that's still really cool but
to<00:00:45.110> me<00:00:45.260> it<00:00:45.409> looks<00:00:45.650> like<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.040> under<00:00:46.309> suit<00:00:46.489> is<00:00:46.610> a

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
to me it looks like the under suit is a

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.090 
to me it looks like the under suit is a
different<00:00:47.059> color<00:00:47.269> on<00:00:47.870> camera<00:00:48.710> it<00:00:48.799> looks<00:00:48.860> like

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
different color on camera it looks like

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.280 
different color on camera it looks like
maybe<00:00:49.250> it's<00:00:49.489> not<00:00:49.610> I<00:00:49.940> don't<00:00:50.360> know<00:00:50.600> but<00:00:51.049> if

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
maybe it's not I don't know but if

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.710 
maybe it's not I don't know but if
that's<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:51.680> case<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:52.100> still<00:00:52.250> looks<00:00:52.460> good<00:00:52.720> so

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
that's the case it still looks good so

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.960 
that's the case it still looks good so
maybe<00:00:54.440> it's<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.710> happy<00:00:54.979> accident<00:00:55.519> I<00:00:55.610> don't<00:00:55.879> know

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
maybe it's a happy accident I don't know

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.119 
maybe it's a happy accident I don't know

only kind of about half way in and then

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.920 
only kind of about half way in and then

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
so I'm not sure what's up with that I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.480 
so I'm not sure what's up with that I
don't<00:01:50.480> know<00:01:50.630> if<00:01:50.750> it's<00:01:50.870> a<00:01:50.960> Miss<00:01:51.200> mold<00:01:51.530> or<00:01:52.010> what

don't know if it's a Miss mold or what

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.399 
don't know if it's a Miss mold or what

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.010 
but that's as far in as I can get it to
go<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:54.800> that's<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:54.979> little<00:01:55.190> disappointing<00:01:56.020> it's

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
go so that's a little disappointing it's

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.420 
go so that's a little disappointing it's
like<00:01:57.260> I<00:01:57.380> said<00:01:57.440> before<00:01:57.620> it's<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.070> exact<00:01:58.400> same

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
like I said before it's the exact same

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.610 
like I said before it's the exact same
figure<00:01:58.970> maybe<00:01:59.570> I<00:01:59.659> didn't<00:01:59.900> say<00:02:00.050> it's<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.409> exact

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
figure maybe I didn't say it's the exact

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.440 
figure maybe I didn't say it's the exact
same<00:02:00.650> figure<00:02:01.100> as<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.280> regular<00:02:01.760> release<00:02:02.150> fat

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
same figure as the regular release fat

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.030 
same figure as the regular release fat
just<00:02:02.690> with<00:02:02.840> different<00:02:02.870> colors<00:02:03.440> so

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
just with different colors so

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.190 
just with different colors so
articulations<00:02:04.729> all<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.150> same<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.720> didn't<00:02:06.110> have

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
articulations all the same I didn't have

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.960 
articulations all the same I didn't have
any<00:02:06.350> issues<00:02:06.530> with<00:02:06.770> any<00:02:07.070> of<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.370> joints<00:02:07.760> being

stuck or too loose he still comes with

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.420

I<00:02:19.310> didn't<00:02:19.670> think<00:02:19.819> I<00:02:19.970> was<00:02:20.060> gonna<00:02:20.209> actually<00:02:20.450> care

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
I didn't think I was gonna actually care

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.660 
I didn't think I was gonna actually care
for<00:02:21.110> this<00:02:21.230> version<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.770> Fett<00:02:22.010> but<00:02:22.220> it's

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
for this version of Fett but it's

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.010 
for this version of Fett but it's
actually<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.030> pretty<00:02:23.240> nice<00:02:23.480> looking<00:02:23.840> figure

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
actually a pretty nice looking figure

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.530 
actually a pretty nice looking figure
what<00:02:24.260> you

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
imposed I do like it a lot and he still

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.690 
imposed I do like it a lot and he still
has<00:02:27.269> what<00:02:27.629> I<00:02:27.659> think<00:02:28.310> somebody<00:02:29.310> told<00:02:29.459> me<00:02:29.579> these

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700

has what I think somebody told me these
are<00:02:29.790> supposed<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.060> be<00:02:30.120> wookie<00:02:30.480> scalps<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.989> never

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
are supposed to be wookie scalps I never

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.630 
are supposed to be wookie scalps I never
really<00:02:31.439> noticed<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.950> before

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
really noticed that before

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.550 
really noticed that before
I<00:02:32.670> remember<00:02:33.239> reading<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.659> I<00:02:33.750> think<00:02:34.019> once<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:34.530> I

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
I remember reading it I think once but I

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.140 
I remember reading it I think once but I
don't<00:02:34.799> know<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.340> these<00:02:35.489> are<00:02:35.670> molded<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.090> a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
don't know but these are molded in a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.610 
don't know but these are molded in a
different<00:02:36.480> color<00:02:36.629> plastic<00:02:37.140> no<00:02:37.290> paint

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
different color plastic no paint

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.500 
different color plastic no paint
application<00:02:38.340> unfortunately<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:39.329> at<00:02:39.420> least

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
application unfortunately but at least

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.690 
application unfortunately but at least
they're<00:02:39.810> molded<00:02:40.319> in<00:02:40.469> a<00:02:40.980> different<00:02:41.340> color<00:02:41.489> so

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
they're molded in a different color so

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.339 
they're molded in a different color so
he's<00:02:41.819> pretty<00:02:42.060> cool<00:02:42.269> definitely<00:02:42.840> could<00:02:43.319> have

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
he's pretty cool definitely could have

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.289 
he's pretty cool definitely could have
used<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.709> little<00:02:43.859> bit<00:02:44.099> more<00:02:44.370> paint<00:02:44.670> for<00:02:45.180> like

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
used a little bit more paint for like

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.599 
used a little bit more paint for like
buckles<00:02:45.689> and<00:02:45.870> things<00:02:46.079> but<00:02:46.650> he<00:02:46.829> does<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:47.220> some

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
buckles and things but he does have some

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.059 
buckles and things but he does have some

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
on him and it's Boba Fett so I imagine

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.500 
on him and it's Boba Fett so I imagine
most<00:02:50.370> people<00:02:50.609> are<00:02:50.700> gonna<00:02:50.790> want<00:02:51.060> him<00:02:51.180> anyway

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
most people are gonna want him anyway

most people are gonna want him anyway

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
screwed up the other ones but if you

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.030 
screwed up the other ones but if you
look<00:03:27.269> we<00:03:27.870> still<00:03:28.079> have<00:03:28.169> the<00:03:28.290> ball<00:03:28.470> peg<00:03:28.709> we<00:03:28.859> still

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
look we still have the ball peg we still

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.589 
look we still have the ball peg we still
have<00:03:29.129> the<00:03:29.220> hinge<00:03:29.400> here<00:03:29.669> so<00:03:29.879> that's<00:03:30.090> fine<00:03:30.359> it's

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
have the hinge here so that's fine it's

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.780 
have the hinge here so that's fine it's
the<00:03:30.629> same<00:03:30.870> type<00:03:31.139> of<00:03:31.169> articulation<00:03:32.099> we<00:03:32.549> can<00:03:32.699> go

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
the same type of articulation we can go

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.789 
the same type of articulation we can go
ahead<00:03:32.879> and<00:03:33.060> put<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.299> head<00:03:33.510> on<00:03:33.540> if<00:03:34.349> I<00:03:34.500> can<00:03:34.680> do

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
ahead and put the head on if I can do

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.469 
ahead and put the head on if I can do
that<00:03:36.769> okay<00:03:37.769> so<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:38.040> heads<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.459> you<00:03:38.940> can't<00:03:39.209> see

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:39.479 
that okay so the heads on you can't see

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:41.719 
that okay so the heads on you can't see
into<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.840> articulation<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.919> looks<00:03:41.220> just<00:03:41.459> kind

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
into the articulation it looks just kind

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.039 
into the articulation it looks just kind
of<00:03:41.790> like<00:03:41.909> a<00:03:41.940> guys<00:03:42.180> wearing<00:03:42.479> a<00:03:42.599> helmet<00:03:42.780> unless

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
of like a guys wearing a helmet unless

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.020 
of like a guys wearing a helmet unless
you<00:03:43.199> really<00:03:43.470> try<00:03:43.829> to<00:03:43.859> get<00:03:44.099> up<00:03:44.250> in<00:03:44.430> there<00:03:44.639> you

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
you really try to get up in there you

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.699 
you really try to get up in there you
can't<00:03:45.239> really<00:03:45.299> see<00:03:45.659> too<00:03:45.690> much<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.260> covers<00:03:46.590> it

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
can't really see too much it covers it

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.530 
can't really see too much it covers it
pretty<00:03:46.739> well<00:03:47.099> but<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.940> still<00:03:48.209> get<00:03:48.359> the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
pretty well but you still get the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.539 
pretty well but you still get the
poseability<00:03:48.989> side<00:03:49.409> to<00:03:49.590> side<00:03:49.799> front<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.340> back

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
poseability side to side front and back

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.849 
poseability side to side front and back
we<00:03:51.120> get<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.329> hinging<00:03:51.989> everything<00:03:52.620> works

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
we get the hinging everything works

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.619 
we get the hinging everything works
really<00:03:53.400> well<00:03:53.669> with<00:03:54.060> Boba<00:03:54.389> Fett's

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
really well with Boba Fett's

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.050 
really well with Boba Fett's
articulation<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:55.979> it<00:03:56.190> would<00:03:56.340> be<00:03:56.489> nice<00:03:56.699> if<00:03:56.909> they

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
articulation so it would be nice if they

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.420 
articulation so it would be nice if they
kind<00:03:57.359> of<00:03:57.449> learn<00:03:58.169> from<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:59.010> figure<00:03:59.280> they

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
kind of learn from the figure they

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.069 
kind of learn from the figure they
already<00:03:59.609> made<00:03:59.909> and<00:04:00.239> made<00:04:00.569> the<00:04:00.690> rest<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:00.989> the

already made and made the rest of the

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.750
