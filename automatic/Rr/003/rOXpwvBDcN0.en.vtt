00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 what helps is again alex and me 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.400
 The whole last week was sick 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.500
 that's why I could not do anything there 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.750
 but yesterday rockstar has posted games 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.080
 that the high live update next 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.330
 Tuesday at 13 may appear like 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.859
 we all know are in there at the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.420
 new high end appartements and the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.789
 possibility finally several times 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.470
 to own apartments what is new now 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.260
 is that we know now there are five 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.449
 Apartments and these are for 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.910
 for example with clipster or richards 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.679
 majestic sounds to me as if 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.180
 So it's really easy 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.579
 any high-rise apartments are 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.050
 and unfortunately not a whole house or something 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.649
 times on the beach as I wished 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.600
 would have 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.160
 There are new ones, too 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.140
 interiors i hope too 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.610
 really five new interiors 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.820
 and not two new interiors 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.140
 which are spread over three apartments 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.570
 then what we already knew four 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.870
 new vehicles include three cars 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.320
 and a motorcycle that 's the way it is 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.500
 a his suv the ines hand then left 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.210
 a supercar called peace and or 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.390
 no a sports car the jockey masako ob 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.390
 my god who thinks this out and 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.920
 the motorcycle think that we are ahead of the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.320
 first car reminds me of the look 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.700
 so a little bit on the led on everyone 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.200
 case one of my favorite cars from 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.460
 Look, I thought he was right 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.119
 hot and I like that even here 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.200
 a tick better 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.090
 he might like to have in the comments 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.560
 Write what you say about the vehicles 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.170
 Coolest finds where you are the most 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.549
 it what otherwise would be still is new 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.619
 also what I already in that time 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.720
 video said that burkhard rifle 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.090
 and that no contact race what you 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.189
 allows the whole time standard race 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.110
 to gamble but just to adjust that 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.329
 you just do not play with yours 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.820
 but can only collide 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.350
 controlled by pc as normal 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.270
 vehicles or obstacles or 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.920
 other objects otherwise your opponents 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.799
 are semi-transparent and you can not 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.390
 more with those collide and 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.030
 Finally, the state of mind 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.409
 statistics as you can see like yours 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.390
 players are on it whether they are 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.369
 are dangerous whether the nets are or 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.290
 as they are mentally inclined 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.810
 new with of course also more 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.989
 clothing options new horns new 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.629
 winner actions 15 new jobs and five 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.300
 new contact mission and what some too 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.250
 again and again 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.380
 asked if in these dlc the hot 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.310
 and I have to say that unfortunately 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.590
 it is not like that 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.280
 some also ask what they are hot 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.200
 okay those are the bank robberies when the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.390
 Bank robberies are not known 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.440
 but I think that's not going to be that way 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.960
 take a long time 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.220
 maybe watchdog will come soon 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.140
 plan it is actually like that then 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.550
 that's her on the release of hot 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.080
 stocks or so lay around a bit 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.630
 somehow to be able to counter 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.080
 but who knows all wild speculation 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.850
 continue to the hot nothing new so 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.770
 much wanted to this short intro video 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.100
 I have just touched truly the 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.560
 So now on the 13th may the new high live 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.720
 updates come out and therefore want to be 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.520
 you now best informed this week 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.960
 otherwise comes a call of duty 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.890
 comments from me where I have to ten times 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.520
 to tell something again and to talk 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.230
 Maybe not necessarily 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.750
 call it such a general comment 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.050
 easy and finally, then the 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.130
 final part of gta 5 conclusion and then 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.080
 Let's go on 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.090
 In that sense, I hope that you 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.130
 Video has fallen if it but forget 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.880
 not to comment on and comment on 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.620
 subscribe to 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.050
 on the channel since and no further 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.050
 want to miss videos that from me 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.100
 the bishop police 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.100
 can choose 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.220
 sc 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.490
