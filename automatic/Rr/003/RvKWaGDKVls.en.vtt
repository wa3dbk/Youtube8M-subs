00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
I mean when you're looking at a balanced

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.280 
I mean when you're looking at a balanced
nutrition<00:00:39.030> program<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.750> comes<00:00:40.020> down<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
nutrition program it comes down to

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.340 
nutrition program it comes down to
protein<00:00:40.980> carbohydrates<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.000> vegetables<00:00:42.629> and

if<00:00:43.680> you're<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> masculine<00:00:44.340> phase<00:00:44.670> that's

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
if you're a masculine phase that's

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.940 
if you're a masculine phase that's
exactly<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> want<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.230> each<00:00:46.559> meal

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
exactly what you want to have each meal

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.029 
exactly what you want to have each meal
think<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> your<00:00:47.670> plate<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.510> thirds<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.260> third

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
think of your plate as in thirds a third

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.160 
think of your plate as in thirds a third
protein<00:00:50.550> third<00:00:51.059> starchy<00:00:51.539> carbs<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
protein third starchy carbs and the

protein third starchy carbs and the
third<00:00:52.469> vegetables<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.309> if<00:00:53.940> you're<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.300> fat

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
third vegetables and if you're in a fat

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.170 
third vegetables and if you're in a fat
loss<00:00:54.750> phase<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.770> think<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.579> smaller

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
loss phase you can think of a smaller

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.110 
loss phase you can think of a smaller
portion<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.800> halves<00:00:59.120> at

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
portion and think of it in halves at

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.779 
portion and think of it in halves at
half<00:01:00.420> protein<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.260> half<00:01:01.649> vegetables<00:01:02.280> it's

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
half protein and half vegetables it's

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.100 
half protein and half vegetables it's
generally<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> major<00:01:03.480> difference<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.080> I

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
generally the major difference that I

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.140 
generally the major difference that I
make<00:01:04.320> when<00:01:04.500> I'm<00:01:04.619> transitioning<00:01:05.280> from<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.760> mass

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
make when I'm transitioning from a mass

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.020 
make when I'm transitioning from a mass
building<00:01:06.510> phase<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> fat<00:01:07.890> loss<00:01:08.130> phase<00:01:08.369> is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
building phase to a fat loss phase is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.910 
building phase to a fat loss phase is
just<00:01:09.210> cutting<00:01:09.750> back<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> starchy<00:01:10.590> carbs

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
just cutting back on the starchy carbs

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.609 
just cutting back on the starchy carbs
and<00:01:11.130> increasing<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.939> veggies<00:01:12.439> so<00:01:13.439> what<00:01:13.590> I

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619

they<00:01:41.340> go<00:01:41.490> bad<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> few<00:01:43.140> zucchini

they go bad so I have a few zucchini
already<00:01:43.920> pre-wash<00:01:44.310> these<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.450> pretty

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
already pre-wash these and it's pretty

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.340 
already pre-wash these and it's pretty
straightforward

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
straightforward

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.710 
straightforward
all<00:01:46.770> we're<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> do<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.520> slice<00:01:48.420> them

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
all we're going to do is slice them

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.010 
all we're going to do is slice them
lengthwise<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:50.570> actually<00:01:51.570> before<00:01:51.869> I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
lengthwise like this actually before I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.219 
lengthwise like this actually before I
do<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.350> should<00:01:52.439> create<00:01:52.979> my<00:01:53.899> frying<00:01:54.899> pan<00:01:55.200> on

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
do that I should create my frying pan on

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.130 
do that I should create my frying pan on
medium<00:01:55.920> heat<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.140> freak

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
medium heat here so just freak

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.290 
medium heat here so just freak
preheat<00:02:01.140> fan<00:02:01.500> while<00:02:02.160> I'm<00:02:02.280> slicing<00:02:02.730> up<00:02:03.090> these

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
preheat fan while I'm slicing up these

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.420 
preheat fan while I'm slicing up these
zucchinis<00:02:03.900> into<00:02:04.590> long<00:02:04.890> strips<00:02:05.670> lengthwise

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
zucchinis into long strips lengthwise

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:16.500 
zucchinis into long strips lengthwise
that's<00:02:08.430> good

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.910
