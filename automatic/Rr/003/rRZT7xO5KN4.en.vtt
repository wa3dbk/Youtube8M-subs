welcome to hard science the show where
we<00:00:09.179> use<00:00:09.360> just<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.660> little<00:00:09.840> bit<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.019> knowledge

us<00:00:16.020> out<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.500> experiment<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.430> this

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
us out with this experiment we have this

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.269 
us out with this experiment we have this
dream<00:00:17.970> Michael<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:18.779> think<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.650> as<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
dream Michael and we think that you as a

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.939 
dream Michael and we think that you as a
master<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.000> all<00:00:21.180> things<00:00:21.449> music<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.500> help<00:00:22.800> us

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
master of all things music you help us

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.400 
master of all things music you help us
with<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.310> yeah<00:00:23.519> okay<00:00:23.910> okay<00:00:24.300> what<00:00:24.930> do<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.050> want

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
with it yeah okay okay what do you want

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.790 
with it yeah okay okay what do you want
to<00:00:25.800> break<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.699> glass<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.720> our<00:00:27.869> voice<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.740> you

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
to break a glass with our voice do you

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.650 
to break a glass with our voice do you
think<00:00:28.980> it's<00:00:29.099> possible<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.939> absolutely

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
think it's possible it is absolutely

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.420 
think it's possible it is absolutely
possible<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:34.079> all<00:00:34.230> glass<00:00:34.500> has<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> resonant

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
possible so all glass has a resonant

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.490 
possible so all glass has a resonant
frequency<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.180> basically<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.110> frequency

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
frequency and basically is the frequency

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.979 
frequency and basically is the frequency
at<00:00:37.770> which<00:00:37.800> an<00:00:38.250> object<00:00:38.550> will<00:00:39.030> vibrate<00:00:39.360> if<00:00:39.809> it's

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
at which an object will vibrate if it's

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.900 
at which an object will vibrate if it's
disturbed<00:00:40.410> by<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> stimulus<00:00:41.460> like<00:00:41.640> sound<00:00:42.270> with

is<00:00:57.950> the<00:00:58.070> voice<00:00:58.310> equivalent<00:00:58.970> to<00:00:59.090> glasses<00:01:00.640> that

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
is the voice equivalent to glasses that

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.520 
is the voice equivalent to glasses that
pitch<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:01.880> hear<00:01:02.240> when<00:01:02.420> you<00:01:02.450> clink<00:01:02.900> a<00:01:02.990> glass<00:01:03.200> or

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
pitch you hear when you clink a glass or

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.470 
pitch you hear when you clink a glass or
rub<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.070> rim<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.340> it<00:01:04.460> is<00:01:04.880> actually<00:01:05.360> the

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
rub the rim of it is actually the

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.300 
rub the rim of it is actually the
natural<00:01:05.660> frequency<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.830> glass<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.040> if

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
natural frequency of the glass and if

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.890 
natural frequency of the glass and if
you<00:01:07.400> can<00:01:07.550> manage<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:07.850> duplicate<00:01:08.540> that<00:01:08.570> pitch

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
you can manage to duplicate that pitch

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.230 
you can manage to duplicate that pitch
perfectly<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:09.800> loudly<00:01:10.190> enough<00:01:10.550> then

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
perfectly and loudly enough then

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.850 
perfectly and loudly enough then
eventually<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:11.810> vibration<00:01:12.350> will<00:01:12.500> cause<00:01:12.680> the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
eventually the vibration will cause the

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.500 
eventually the vibration will cause the
glass<00:01:13.010> to<00:01:13.070> flex<00:01:13.550> enough<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.150> point<00:01:14.360> where

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
for the glass to shatter we're going to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.070 
for the glass to shatter we're going to
need<00:01:25.130> at<00:01:25.340> least<00:01:25.369> 100<00:01:26.180> decibels<00:01:26.600> which<00:01:26.840> is

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
need at least 100 decibels which is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:37.120 
need at least 100 decibels which is
difficult<00:01:27.500> but<00:01:28.280> not<00:01:28.460> totally<00:01:29.030> impossible<00:01:36.130> now

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
difficult but not totally impossible now

we've<00:01:37.250> also<00:01:37.369> got<00:01:37.640> some<00:01:37.670> really<00:01:38.030> old<00:01:38.150> glass

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
we've also got some really old glass

we've also got some really old glass
back<00:01:38.690> there<00:01:38.900> because<00:01:39.350> research<00:01:39.920> shows<00:01:39.950> that<00:01:40.610> a

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
back there because research shows that a

back there because research shows that a
small<00:01:41.360> flaw<00:01:41.720> in<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.080> glass<00:01:42.229> is<00:01:42.410> gonna<00:01:42.470> help<00:01:42.800> us

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
small flaw in the glass is gonna help us

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.100 
small flaw in the glass is gonna help us
because<00:01:43.220> any<00:01:43.340> cracking<00:01:43.700> is<00:01:44.150> gonna<00:01:44.390> start<00:01:44.840> from

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
because any cracking is gonna start from

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.350 
because any cracking is gonna start from
that<00:01:45.290> flaw<00:01:45.740> also<00:01:46.280> tear<00:01:46.490> is<00:01:46.580> very<00:01:46.759> shrill<00:01:47.090> I

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
that flaw also tear is very shrill I

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.740 
that flaw also tear is very shrill I
don't<00:01:47.750> know<00:01:47.810> if<00:01:47.869> she<00:01:47.990> mentioned<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.400> why

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
don't know if she mentioned that why

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.300 
don't know if she mentioned that why
that's<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:50.930> I<00:01:51.140> think<00:01:51.229> we<00:01:51.440> should<00:01:51.590> try<00:01:51.740> doing

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
that's you I think we should try doing

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.740 
that's you I think we should try doing
this<00:01:52.490> but<00:01:52.729> we<00:01:52.820> should<00:01:52.970> try<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.180> with<00:01:53.330> Apple

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
this but we should try it with Apple

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.580 
this but we should try it with Apple
