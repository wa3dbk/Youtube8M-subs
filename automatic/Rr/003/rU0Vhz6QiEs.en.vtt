this<00:02:49.390> might<00:02:49.630> not<00:02:49.750> work<00:02:49.810> with<00:02:50.110> some

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
this might not work with some

this might not work with some
accessories<00:02:50.800> because<00:02:50.950> there<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.370> little

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
accessories because there is a little

some might not work with others one
caveat<00:02:59.200> with<00:02:59.770> this<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.370> case<00:03:00.610> as<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.210> is

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
caveat with this this case as it is is

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.020 
caveat with this this case as it is is
because<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:02.170> is<00:03:02.200> aluminum<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:03.070> does<00:03:03.580> affect

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
because it is aluminum it does affect

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.900 
because it is aluminum it does affect
the<00:03:04.300> antenna<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:05.170> does<00:03:05.470> affect<00:03:05.910> the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
the antenna it does affect the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.320 
the antenna it does affect the
navigation<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.110> if<00:03:08.230> using<00:03:08.560> gps<00:03:08.970> I've<00:03:09.970> seen<00:03:10.180> it

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
navigation so if using gps I've seen it

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.650 
navigation so if using gps I've seen it
drop<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:11.170> signal<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.100> also<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:13.330> might<00:03:13.480> lose

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
drop a signal and also you might lose

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.900 
drop a signal and also you might lose
one<00:03:13.960> or<00:03:13.990> two<00:03:14.230> bars<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.520> want<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.760> make<00:03:15.790> sure

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
one or two bars so you want to make sure

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.390 
one or two bars so you want to make sure
that<00:03:16.030> you're<00:03:16.300> in<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:16.450> strong<00:03:16.780> area<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.680> that's

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
that you're in a strong area so that's

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.560 
that you're in a strong area so that's
the<00:03:18.550> Draco<00:03:19.300> for<00:03:20.940> from<00:03:21.940> everything<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.330> can't

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
the Draco for from everything I can't

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.020 
the Draco for from everything I can't
fade<00:03:22.720> out<00:03:22.840> calm
