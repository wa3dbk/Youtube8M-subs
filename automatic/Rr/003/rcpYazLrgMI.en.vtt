we check the quantities and we check and
in<00:01:15.660> this<00:01:15.990> case<00:01:16.260> where<00:01:16.530> we've<00:01:16.710> got<00:01:16.950> two<00:01:17.220> tons

colored guns and completely black God is

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.910 
colored guns and completely black God is
realistically<00:01:23.700> looking<00:01:23.940> once<00:01:24.620> we<00:01:25.620> have<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
realistically looking once we have to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.130 
realistically looking once we have to
check<00:01:26.160> that<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> labels<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> boxes<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
check that the labels on the boxes or a

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.370 
check that the labels on the boxes or a
marking<00:01:28.710> code<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.910> boxes<00:01:30.330> correspond<00:01:31.110> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
marking code on the boxes correspond to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.680 
marking code on the boxes correspond to
the<00:01:32.040> guns<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.610> actually<00:01:32.940> do<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
the guns that we actually do have in the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.300 
the guns that we actually do have in the
current<00:01:35.540> reason<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.690> that<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.860> wholesale

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
current reason for that is the wholesale

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.130 
current reason for that is the wholesale
say<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.640> things<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.240> send<00:01:39.540> out<00:01:39.660> complete

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
say the things we send out complete

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.980 
say the things we send out complete
cartons<00:01:40.620> and<00:01:40.770> pallets<00:01:41.220> are<00:01:41.370> guns<00:01:41.580> so<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.720> don't

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
cartons and pallets are guns so we don't

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.880 
cartons and pallets are guns so we don't
have<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.350> open<00:01:43.710> each<00:01:43.950> individual<00:01:44.760> carton<00:01:45.890> can

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
have to open each individual carton can

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.370 
have to open each individual carton can
I<00:01:46.920> check<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.610> hopefully<00:01:48.480> can<00:01:48.870> trust<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
I check it and hopefully can trust the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.990 
I check it and hopefully can trust the
codes<00:01:49.650> on<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.980> site<00:01:50.190> that<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.550> factories

codes on the site that the factories

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.430 
codes on the site that the factories
have<00:01:51.150> done<00:01:51.390> them<00:01:51.600> correctly
