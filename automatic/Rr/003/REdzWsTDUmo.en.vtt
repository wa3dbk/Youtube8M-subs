00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.720
 hello youtube friends welcome a 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.790
 more time to the channel of android tips 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.610
 official the channel where you'll find 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.780
 everything you 're looking for on android 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.010
 today I'm going to talk about the new 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:46.129
 device xperia zr of the house are at 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.170
 just like its predecessor the xperia z 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.320
 good as you know are hesperia zetas 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.070
 has just come out currently which 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.829
 has a series of characteristics that 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.230
 well I thought to say the features 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.230
 of the new hesperia zr but thinking about it 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.320
 well I will make a comparison with the 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.100
 hesperia zr and hesperia z 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.770
 good the hesperia zr is a new 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.610
 terminal that has not come to the market 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.710
 still but it's going to come out soon and 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.300
 which we already have a series of 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.800
 defined and official characteristics 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.229
 good as you know the experience is 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.110
 can submerge under water until a 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.850
 meter deep well the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.860
 experience is r can be submerged 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.210
 underwater up to one and a half meters of 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.460
 depth 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.130
 that is, it can be raised half 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.030
 better meter in the dimensions of the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.550
 r experience are 131 millimeters per 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.890
 67 with 4 millimeters by 10 with 4 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.700
 millimeters and the dimensions of 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.330
 hesperia zetas are 130 139 millimeters 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.630
 by 71 millimeters by 7 with 9 millimeters 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.120
 what do we say with this because the ctr is 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.890
 smaller with those going to center one 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.530
 smaller screen but it's more 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.899
 width that I imagine that is wider 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.260
 Well, because as you can submerge 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.550
 meter in meters or you can submerge 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.960
 half a meter more in the water because I 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.490
 I imagine that it is because of this that 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.480
 will be a little wider a little fatter 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.180
 we go 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:29.010
 good the weight of the ctr is 140 grams 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.930
 which is Hesperia z is 146 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.580
 grams the hesperia z pesa can be 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.230
 grams more for this because it 's a bit 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.380
 bigger although it 's thinner but it's 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.950
 larger 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.930
 good 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.959
 let's talk a little more about the 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.540
 hesperia ctr which allows to take 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.269
 photographs and videos in full hd with his 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.740
 13 megapixel camera and a camera 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.480
 front vga 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.550
 in the photos and videos could be 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.190
 do underwater thing that if what 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.500
 we try with hesperia z they affirm us 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.030
 the manufacturers that can break or 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.270
 annoy 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.000
 also has the hesperia is r 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.880
 a screen of 4 with 6 inches of a 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.270
 of a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.690
 which can the xperia z on the screen 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:24.400
 of 5 inches are 0.4 inches more 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.470
 large and resolution 1920 x 1080 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.069
 pixels with which then the resolution 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.340
 The xperia z is much better than the 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.370
 new bone that the new one that will come out that 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.230
 is the hesperia ctr 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.180
 good the processor of experience 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.180
 It was four cores 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.940
 qualcomm snapdragon 4 that runs to 1.5 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.920
 gigahertz and ram memory and the 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.030
 ram memory forgiveness is 2 gigabytes 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.640
 good in this aspect is exactly 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.409
 equal the xperia 7 hesperia zr the two 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.970
 they have the same processor processor 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:01.510
 four cores in the same ram 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:06.850
 which the version of android els sony 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.710
 xperia cdr of 4.1 and the living but if 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.280
 I say since it's going to update very 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:14.790
 quickly to 4.2.2 which is the version 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.030
 latest from android 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.570
 as for your internal memory account me 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.539
 I mean the xperia zr has 8 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.970
 gigabytes that can be expanded up to 32 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:30.190
 gigabytes using a microsd card 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.750
 but in this case he overcomes them again 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.950
 the xperia z which will have a memory 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.050
 Internal 16gb 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.800
 good that is double basically and 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:47.000
 can also be expanded up to 32 GB more 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.000
 with the microsd card 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.380
 the sun hesperia zr has a 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.410
 2,300 milliamp battery with the 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.500
 stamina method which is the method 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.530
 stamina as they are and according to 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.070
 improvement manufacturers means mind 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.140
 significantly its duration 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.000
 this system recognizes when you are not 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.770
 using the screen and deactivates 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.080
 automatically functions that do not 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.130
 you need to keep notifications 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.900
 that yes they are interesting good is a method the 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.530
 which will assure us that you will save 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.530
 drums 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:29.310
 and what about the xperia z so that its 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.400
 30,000 2,300 battery jumpers is a 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.910
 little bit more has a little more than 1000 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.120
 jumpers 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.460
 and the truth is that I do not know if he has this 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.440
 stamina technology because the 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.180
 manufacturers did not name it in their 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.420
 moment so I imagine that he will not have it 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.180
 but I can not say for one hundred percent 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:53.030
 good this new smartphone the sony 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.340
 xperia zr will be available in color 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.030
 black in white in pink and in 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.650
 color and mint color mint color the 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.230
 truth is that I have no fucking idea 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.240
 what color is it so I've put this 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.520
 picture basically so they know which one is 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.250
 the mint color because it's like a blue 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.689
 greenish greenish blue that I do not have nor 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.749
 idea 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:18.330
 and arrived at the million dollar question that 

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:21.449
 it would be that terminal we choose 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:24.389
 Well, the truth is that the new phone 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:27.240
 It will be the best option for those who 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.550
 want to dive in the pool would be my 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.800
 opinion is exclusively for the 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.830
 people who want it to submerge 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:38.129
 in a pool and good in a pool 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:40.919
 because I have to say that as they are 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:44.009
 happen to put it in salt water as per 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:46.560
 example the sea or a lake or any 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:49.469
 another type of water at the end they are going 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.349
 to break this type of technology is 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:54.659
 very cool it's very good you can get wet and 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:57.389
 such but only in fresh water in waters of 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:07:00.599
 pool in the shower as you want but 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:02.129
 good that he is already on vacation in a 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:03.449
 apartment and such and you want your 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:05.909
 terminal to take photos and videos 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:08.909
 under the water I recommend the dream 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:10.820
 xperia zr if not then I recommend the 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:13.240
 sony xperia z 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:16.720
 either because its bigger screen 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:20.700
 has a better pixel resolution and 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.650
 the battery lasts a little longer 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.170
 and well actually those are both 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.180
 better aspects of the taca species and their 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.710
 internal memory which is twice that of 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.750
 the zeta spice that the experience of r 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.330
 Well I hope that I have helped you with 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.250
 this informative video of today and if you 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.840
 He liked to give it a like because that 

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.820
 support me to keep making videos 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.680
 every day I commented any doubt 

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.750
 that you have anything you want 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.690
 you comment to me down here and I then 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:49.980
 I will answer all the comments and we 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.980
 we see another 

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.560
 no no
