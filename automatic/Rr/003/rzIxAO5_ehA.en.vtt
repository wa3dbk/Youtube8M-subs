00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:05.590
 the maserati 2 50f certainly one of the most famous single-seater of the formula 1 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:12.360
 current at 7 years from 53 to 60 but won the world title in 1957 with when 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.539
 manuel fangio in that same season, 24 grand prix argentina monaco france 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.439
 maps you win even at the home of Germans just lugo make a car that accor 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.039
 software several seasons and even wanted steve morse the guide has you 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.429
 defined as one of the best reggae sin cara low lateral transmission 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.480
 powerful engine with 250 horses in this period in these seven years yes 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.370
 it is desired in the technologies of the frenters the drums if you pass the visa and taken 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.649
 could also in the suspension from the solution to the gym add a solution 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.579
 more refined with 4 shock absorbers in order to release the power at its best 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.670
 which we said was very high 100 horsepower liter and especially bad in 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.920
 acceleration phase 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.640
 the cigar bodywork that characterizes the cars of formula 1 years 50 have 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.420
 aerodynamic container chassis suspension function 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.799
 the mechanical organs 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.679
 wheelhouse interior exhaust and front air intake for cooling the 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:09.370
 radiator 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.520
 they represent the only external elements 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.950
 these conformations classify ant fans 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.140
 another purpose of minimizing the pantat resistance to travel 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.750
 higher speed on straights with half string black bodywork 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.530
 from the 50s begins 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.580
 the trial process on the track to improve the values ​​of Chinese 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.070
 fairings around the wheels integrated in the bodywork the cota profiles 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.890
 elongated 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.270
 allow the network to flow in without finding interruptions minimizing 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.930
 the effects the turbulent 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.180
 the passenger compartment with broken glass a given step and shaped to measure 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.550
 around the steering wheel represents one of the best solutions of the time for 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.520
 satisfy a low impact impact aerodynamics 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.289
 the first real step in formula 1 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.759
 in the field of aerodynamic evolution
