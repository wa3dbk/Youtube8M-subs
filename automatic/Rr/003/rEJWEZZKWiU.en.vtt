quality for what you get
first<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.390> all<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.629> hand<00:00:48.899> grip<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.379> really

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
first of all the hand grip is really

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.490 
first of all the hand grip is really
comfortable<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> plastic<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:52.260> this

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
comfortable in the plastic that this

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.279 
comfortable in the plastic that this
thing<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.800> made<00:00:52.949> out<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.510> solid<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.629> seems

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
thing is made out of is solid it seems

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.110 
thing is made out of is solid it seems
to<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:56.300> pretty<00:00:57.300> good<00:00:57.539> plastic<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.969> don't<00:00:59.969> think

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
to be pretty good plastic I don't think

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.009 
to be pretty good plastic I don't think
it's<00:01:00.239> gonna<00:01:00.390> break<00:01:00.989> anytime<00:01:01.320> soon<00:01:01.859> unless<00:01:02.219> you

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
it's gonna break anytime soon unless you

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.980 
it's gonna break anytime soon unless you
misuse<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.229> or<00:01:05.119> if<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.270> load<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.720> wrong

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
misuse it or if you load it the wrong

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.740 
misuse it or if you load it the wrong
way<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:10.340> this<00:01:11.340> thing<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.850> kind<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.479> hard<00:01:12.689> to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
way and this thing is kind of hard to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.719 
way and this thing is kind of hard to
string<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.890> two<00:01:14.159> people<00:01:14.400> it

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
string but if you have two people it

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
string but if you have two people it
makes<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.060> pretty<00:01:15.150> easy<00:01:15.439> this<00:01:16.439> thing<00:01:16.619> is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
makes it pretty easy this thing is

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.690 
makes it pretty easy this thing is
really<00:01:17.130> easy<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> cock<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:19.280> load<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.580> all

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
really easy to cock and load and all

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.929 
really easy to cock and load and all
that<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.240> shoot<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.259> cite<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.680> in

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
that and shoot you have to cite it in

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.310 
that and shoot you have to cite it in
because<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.060> doesn't<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.540> come<00:01:24.840> side<00:01:25.170> it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
because it doesn't really come side it

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.609 
because it doesn't really come side it
in<00:01:25.820> that's<00:01:26.820> pretty<00:01:27.060> easy<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.560> just

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
in that's pretty easy to do you just

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:36.080 
in that's pretty easy to do you just
have<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:31.100> aim<00:01:32.100> some<00:01:33.650> shoot<00:01:34.650> until<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.759> hits<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
have to aim some shoot until it hits the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.219 
have to aim some shoot until it hits the
target<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.630> guess<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:39.240> range<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:39.990> thing

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
target I guess the range on this thing

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.789 
target I guess the range on this thing
is<00:01:40.650> I'd<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.909> say<00:01:43.520> most<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.820> would<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.799> it's

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
is I'd have to say most I would do it's

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.969 
is I'd have to say most I would do it's
probably<00:01:47.280> 20<00:01:47.670> feet<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:48.180> I'm<00:01:48.509> hunting<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.799> I'm

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
probably 20 feet if I'm hunting if I'm

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.190 
probably 20 feet if I'm hunting if I'm
hunting<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> squirrel<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.390> something<00:01:51.420> I'm

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
hunting like a squirrel or something I'm

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.190 
hunting like a squirrel or something I'm
gonna<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.799> at<00:01:53.189> most<00:01:53.909> 20<00:01:54.420> feet<00:01:55.130> but

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.310 

yeah<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:00.230> mean<00:02:00.500> it's<00:02:00.740> cheap<00:02:01.220> and<00:02:01.870> very<00:02:02.870> easy<00:02:03.020> to

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
yeah I mean it's cheap and very easy to

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:15.360 
yeah I mean it's cheap and very easy to
use<00:02:05.470> compact<00:02:06.970> nicely<00:02:07.970> built<00:02:12.760> safety<00:02:14.230> that's

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
use compact nicely built safety that's

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.640 
use compact nicely built safety that's
kind<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.490> nice<00:02:16.640> feature<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:17.300> think<00:02:18.140> some

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
kind of a nice feature I think some

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.420 
kind of a nice feature I think some
hospitals<00:02:19.250> don't<00:02:19.460> have<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.670> safety<00:02:21.160> I'm<00:02:22.160> not

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
hospitals don't have a safety I'm not

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.540 
hospitals don't have a safety I'm not
sure<00:02:23.020> but<00:02:24.020> this<00:02:24.530> one<00:02:24.740> has<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.920> nice<00:02:25.160> one<00:02:25.870> and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
sure but this one has a nice one and

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.240 
sure but this one has a nice one and
what<00:02:28.550> else<00:02:29.950> say<00:02:30.950> about<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:33.320> string<00:02:33.860> I'm

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
what else say about this the string I'm

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.760 
what else say about this the string I'm
not<00:02:34.520> sure<00:02:34.700> how<00:02:34.850> long<00:02:35.030> that'll<00:02:35.360> last<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:36.170> would

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
not sure how long that'll last I would

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.860 
not sure how long that'll last I would
recommend<00:02:37.490> getting<00:02:37.850> another<00:02:38.240> string<00:02:38.690> I'm

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
recommend getting another string I'm

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.350 
recommend getting another string I'm
gonna<00:02:39.080> definitely<00:02:39.950> look<00:02:40.310> into<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.640> as<00:02:41.120> you

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
gonna definitely look into that as you

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.150 
gonna definitely look into that as you
can<00:02:41.510> see<00:02:41.720> it's<00:02:41.870> starting<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.260> fray<00:02:42.770> right

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
can see it's starting to fray right

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.050 
can see it's starting to fray right
there<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:45.160> don't<00:02:46.160> know<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.340> mean<00:02:46.520> if<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.820> take

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
there so I don't know I mean if I take

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.640 
there so I don't know I mean if I take
good<00:02:47.240> care<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.570> it<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:47.870> should<00:02:47.900> last<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.440> long

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
good care of it it should last a long

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.210 
good care of it it should last a long
time

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
time

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.500 
time
I<00:02:49.250> mean<00:02:49.880> I've<00:02:50.270> waxed<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:50.989> few<00:02:51.260> times<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:52.010> I

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
I mean I've waxed it a few times but I

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.290 
I mean I've waxed it a few times but I
just<00:02:53.510> not<00:02:54.080> sure<00:02:54.290> how<00:02:54.440> long<00:02:54.500> that's<00:02:54.890> gonna<00:02:55.040> last

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:06.120 

one<00:02:59.300> of<00:02:59.480> only<00:03:01.510> bad<00:03:02.510> things<00:03:02.959> about<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:03.500> is<00:03:03.769> uh

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.520 

it's<00:03:07.130> hard<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.489> put<00:03:07.700> together<00:03:07.850> by<00:03:08.630> yourself<00:03:09.230> so

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
it's hard to put together by yourself so

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.710 
it's hard to put together by yourself so
that<00:03:09.709> could<00:03:09.890> be<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.040> disadvantage<00:03:10.540> if<00:03:11.540> you're

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
that could be a disadvantage if you're

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.350 
that could be a disadvantage if you're
all<00:03:11.780> by<00:03:11.900> yourself<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:13.489> need<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.060> put<00:03:14.269> it

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
all by yourself and you need to put it

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.630 
all by yourself and you need to put it
together<00:03:14.500> you're<00:03:15.500> gonna<00:03:15.650> probably<00:03:16.370> have<00:03:16.580> a

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
together you're gonna probably have a

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.850 
together you're gonna probably have a
little<00:03:16.790> trouble

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.920 

all<00:03:24.860> right<00:03:25.069> now<00:03:25.580> I'm<00:03:25.700> just<00:03:25.909> gonna<00:03:26.060> show<00:03:26.840> you

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
all right now I'm just gonna show you

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.699 
all right now I'm just gonna show you
guys<00:03:28.360> how<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.420> cock<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:29.810> how<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.200> shoot<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.680> and

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
guys how to cock it how to shoot it and

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.670 
guys how to cock it how to shoot it and
all<00:03:33.709> right<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:37.670> just<00:03:38.480> pulled<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:39.170> trigger<00:03:39.200> back

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
all right I just pulled the trigger back

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.000 
all right I just pulled the trigger back
all<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.129> way<00:03:40.159> and<00:03:40.549> you<00:03:41.030> can<00:03:41.180> see<00:03:41.450> how<00:03:41.659> this

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
all the way and you can see how this

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.350 
all the way and you can see how this
little<00:03:43.010> thing<00:03:43.370> comes<00:03:43.579> up<00:03:43.790> when<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.060> do<00:03:44.180> that

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
little thing comes up when you do that

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.559 
little thing comes up when you do that
and<00:03:45.200> you're<00:03:45.319> just<00:03:45.349> gonna<00:03:45.590> engage<00:03:45.829> the<00:03:46.340> safety

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
and you're just gonna engage the safety

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.229 
and you're just gonna engage the safety
then<00:03:47.569> you<00:03:47.659> can't<00:03:47.870> move<00:03:48.019> your<00:03:48.200> trigger<00:03:49.239> and

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
then you can't move your trigger and

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.440 
then you can't move your trigger and
then<00:03:50.450> when<00:03:50.720> you<00:03:50.840> cock<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.440> though<00:03:52.209> like<00:03:53.209> that

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
then when you cock it though like that

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.569 
then when you cock it though like that
pretty<00:03:53.959> easy<00:03:54.079> you're<00:03:54.439> gonna<00:03:54.530> slide<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.220> metal

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
pretty easy you're gonna slide the metal

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.119 
pretty easy you're gonna slide the metal
bar<00:03:55.909> forward<00:03:56.329> I<00:03:56.659> know<00:03:57.140> a<00:03:57.260> lot<00:03:57.590> of<00:03:57.680> people<00:03:57.950> don't

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
bar forward I know a lot of people don't

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.770 
bar forward I know a lot of people don't
do<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.640> then<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:59.000> metal<00:03:59.329> bar<00:03:59.480> ends<00:03:59.690> up

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
do that and then the metal bar ends up

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.379 
do that and then the metal bar ends up
cracking<00:04:00.260> this<00:04:00.409> part<00:04:00.680> right<00:04:00.829> here<00:04:01.069> and<00:04:01.389> that's

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
cracking this part right here and that's

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.740 
cracking this part right here and that's
why<00:04:03.159> they<00:04:04.159> say<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.519> breaks<00:04:04.849> on<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.209> first<00:04:05.480> shot

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
why they say it breaks on the first shot

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.309 
why they say it breaks on the first shot
or<00:04:06.049> something<00:04:06.230> it's<00:04:07.090> operator<00:04:08.090> error<00:04:08.319> around

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
or something it's operator error around

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.860 
or something it's operator error around
whatever<00:04:09.620> you<00:04:09.829> call<00:04:09.950> it<00:04:09.980> on<00:04:10.220> there<00:04:10.370> but<00:04:11.269> now

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
whatever you call it on there but now

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.270 
whatever you call it on there but now
you<00:04:11.930> can<00:04:12.170> see<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.950> little<00:04:13.879> block<00:04:14.540> is<00:04:15.280> the

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
you can see that little block is the

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.069 
you can see that little block is the
safety<00:04:16.729> and<00:04:16.880> that's<00:04:17.239> holding<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.720> string

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
safety and that's holding the string

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.830 
safety and that's holding the string
that's<00:04:18.470> gonna<00:04:18.650> hold<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:19.010> string<00:04:19.310> down<00:04:19.459> there

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
that's gonna hold the string down there

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.830 
that's gonna hold the string down there
and<00:04:20.840> then<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.380> load<00:04:21.620> it<00:04:21.829> you<00:04:22.130> just<00:04:22.720> put<00:04:23.720> your

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
and then to load it you just put your

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.250 
and then to load it you just put your
arrow<00:04:24.050> in<00:04:24.610> like<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:25.789> and<00:04:26.150> slide<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.110> all<00:04:27.229> the

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
arrow in like that and slide it all the

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.120 
arrow in like that and slide it all the
way<00:04:27.410> back<00:04:27.680> till<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.370> hits<00:04:28.490> that<00:04:28.699> block<00:04:29.000> and

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
way back till it hits that block and

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.409 
way back till it hits that block and
then<00:04:31.130> you're<00:04:31.280> ready<00:04:31.460> to<00:04:31.669> shoot<00:04:31.880> once<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.240> take

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
then you're ready to shoot once you take

00:04:32.419 --> 00:05:15.989 
then you're ready to shoot once you take
the<00:04:32.599> safety<00:04:32.780> off<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.940> let's<00:04:35.150> go<00:04:35.270> shoot<00:04:35.479> it

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:15.999 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:20.459 

alright<00:05:16.719> guys<00:05:16.899> that's<00:05:17.169> pretty<00:05:17.499> much<00:05:17.619> it

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:20.469 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:22.769 

it<00:05:21.159> might<00:05:21.459> not<00:05:21.669> look<00:05:21.729> that<00:05:22.029> powerfully

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:22.779 
it might not look that powerfully

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:25.319 
it might not look that powerfully
because<00:05:23.110> you<00:05:24.069> know<00:05:24.159> it<00:05:24.339> only<00:05:24.579> went<00:05:24.909> that<00:05:25.089> far

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:25.329 
because you know it only went that far

00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:27.899 
because you know it only went that far
in<00:05:25.419> the<00:05:25.509> box<00:05:25.719> but<00:05:26.199> this<00:05:26.799> is<00:05:27.129> not<00:05:27.369> just<00:05:27.549> a<00:05:27.669> box

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909 
in the box but this is not just a box

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.249 
in the box but this is not just a box
this<00:05:28.209> is<00:05:28.389> actually<00:05:28.899> a<00:05:29.729> bunch<00:05:30.779> bunch<00:05:31.779> of<00:05:32.019> layers

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
this is actually a bunch bunch of layers

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.659 
this is actually a bunch bunch of layers
of<00:05:32.469> cardboard<00:05:33.239> stacked<00:05:34.239> in<00:05:34.449> that<00:05:34.629> box<00:05:34.869> so

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
of cardboard stacked in that box so

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.739 
of cardboard stacked in that box so
actually<00:05:36.669> that's<00:05:36.849> it<00:05:36.999> pretty<00:05:37.299> good<00:05:37.449> it<00:05:37.599> went

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:37.749 
actually that's it pretty good it went

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:40.229 
actually that's it pretty good it went
pretty<00:05:37.989> far<00:05:38.319> in<00:05:38.499> there<00:05:38.709> so<00:05:39.069> I'd<00:05:39.849> say<00:05:40.089> it's

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:40.239 
pretty far in there so I'd say it's

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:46.319 
pretty far in there so I'd say it's
pretty<00:05:41.229> powerful<00:05:44.459> so<00:05:45.459> I<00:05:45.489> would<00:05:45.849> not<00:05:46.029> hesitate

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:46.329 
pretty powerful so I would not hesitate

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:48.379 
pretty powerful so I would not hesitate
to<00:05:46.689> hunt<00:05:47.289> with<00:05:47.379> this<00:05:47.589> if<00:05:47.799> I<00:05:47.889> needed<00:05:48.129> to

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
to hunt with this if I needed to

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:58.159 
to hunt with this if I needed to
as<00:05:49.389> you<00:05:49.569> saw<00:05:49.809> my<00:05:50.110> video<00:05:50.589> I<00:05:50.649> got<00:05:50.860> a<00:05:50.919> skull<00:05:51.809> so

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.569 

wrap<00:05:59.169> up<00:05:59.439> here

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:00.579 
wrap up here

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:04.439 
wrap up here
I<00:06:00.610> paid<00:06:02.339> 13<00:06:03.339> for<00:06:03.579> this<00:06:03.759> and<00:06:03.999> then<00:06:04.089> I<00:06:04.179> bought<00:06:04.419> a

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 
I paid 13 for this and then I bought a

00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:53.559 
and a half stars out of five for

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:57.869 
and a half stars out of five for
probably<00:06:54.069> because<00:06:55.259> accuracy<00:06:56.259> is<00:06:56.669> not<00:06:57.669> the

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 
probably because accuracy is not the

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:01.909 
probably because accuracy is not the
greatest<00:06:58.299> but<00:06:58.659> the<00:06:59.079> value<00:06:59.679> and<00:06:59.979> the<00:07:00.249> power<00:07:00.489> and
