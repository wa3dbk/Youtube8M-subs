00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.660 
seal and then after I applied them I
went<00:03:18.640> back<00:03:18.880> in<00:03:19.210> with<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.720> UV<00:03:19.900> seal<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:20.710> used

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
went back in with the UV seal and I used

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.030 
went back in with the UV seal and I used
this<00:03:22.180> instrument<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.140> really<00:03:23.410> really<00:03:23.680> sharp

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
this instrument the really really sharp

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.620 
this instrument the really really sharp
metal<00:03:24.690> end<00:03:25.690> of<00:03:26.410> it<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.800> I<00:03:27.280> took<00:03:27.520> some<00:03:27.730> more<00:03:28.000> UV

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
metal end of it and I took some more UV

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.060 
metal end of it and I took some more UV
topcoat<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.470> put<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.070> in<00:03:30.310> between<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:33.040> that

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
topcoat and I put it in between so that

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.520 
topcoat and I put it in between so that
the<00:03:33.490> stones<00:03:33.820> themselves<00:03:34.030> don't<00:03:34.660> get<00:03:34.960> any<00:03:35.200> and

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
the stones themselves don't get any and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.820 
the stones themselves don't get any and
because<00:03:36.190> then<00:03:36.430> they<00:03:36.640> get<00:03:36.820> kind<00:03:37.150> of<00:03:37.300> blurry<00:03:37.830> but

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
because then they get kind of blurry but

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.910 
because then they get kind of blurry but
to<00:03:39.250> make<00:03:39.430> sure<00:03:39.460> that<00:03:39.670> they<00:03:40.030> stick<00:03:40.770> really<00:03:41.770> well

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
to make sure that they stick really well

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.300 
to make sure that they stick really well
they<00:03:42.430> adhere<00:03:42.880> really<00:03:43.120> well<00:03:43.300> so<00:03:43.630> I<00:03:43.660> came<00:03:43.810> around

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
they adhere really well so I came around

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.990 
they adhere really well so I came around
with<00:03:46.020> some<00:03:47.020> of<00:03:47.170> this<00:03:47.940> stuff<00:03:48.940> on<00:03:49.870> my<00:03:51.000> cuticle

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000
