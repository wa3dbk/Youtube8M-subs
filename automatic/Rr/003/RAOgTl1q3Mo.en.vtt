I'm<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:23.039> using<00:00:23.339> a<00:00:23.429> blank<00:00:23.699> index<00:00:24.060> card

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:24.329 
I'm just using a blank index card

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.359 
I'm just using a blank index card
because<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.169> exactly<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.890> size<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.309> a

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
because that is exactly the size of a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.659 
because that is exactly the size of a
normal<00:00:26.839> my<00:00:27.839> game<00:00:28.259> and<00:00:28.529> then<00:00:29.249> you<00:00:29.279> want<00:00:29.579> to

normal my game and then you want to

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:43.970 
normal my game and then you want to
measure<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.149> out<00:00:31.279> just<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:43.800> you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
line from the bottom of the card that

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.940 
line from the bottom of the card that
shows<00:01:49.920> how<00:01:50.189> big<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.609> the<00:01:51.060> bottom<00:01:51.420> should<00:01:51.539> be

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
shows how big it the bottom should be

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.929

of like that yeah make sure it's
straight<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:02.980> mean<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.190> will<00:03:04.340> might<00:03:04.609> go<00:03:04.820> a

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
straight I mean it will might go a

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.030 
straight I mean it will might go a
little<00:03:05.000> over<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.690> edge<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.350> what<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.769> want<00:03:06.980> to

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
little over the edge so what you want to

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.460 
little over the edge so what you want to
do<00:03:07.160> is<00:03:07.340> possibly<00:03:07.850> cut<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:08.600> or<00:03:08.900> fold<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.350> off

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
do is possibly cut that or fold it off

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.400 
do is possibly cut that or fold it off
so<00:03:10.160> let's<00:03:10.370> just<00:03:10.519> fold<00:03:11.239> it<00:03:11.510> off<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:12.019> yes<00:03:12.260> you

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
so let's just fold it off and yes you

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.250 
so let's just fold it off and yes you
will<00:03:12.560> still<00:03:12.799> be<00:03:12.829> needing<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.370> tab<00:03:13.670> later<00:03:14.090> on<00:03:14.329> so

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
will still be needing a tab later on so

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.650 
will still be needing a tab later on so
but<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.190> will<00:03:16.250> still<00:03:16.430> be<00:03:16.489> too<00:03:16.730> big<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.269> I<00:03:17.450> will

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
but it will still be too big and I will

show you what I mean by tab and yeah
let's<00:03:21.170> go<00:03:21.380> over<00:03:21.769> this<00:03:21.920> again<00:03:26.200> just<00:03:27.200> rip<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.560> off

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
let's go over this again just rip it off

let's go over this again just rip it off
you<00:03:28.040> can<00:03:28.160> also<00:03:28.280> cut<00:03:28.609> it<00:03:28.760> off<00:03:29.350> once<00:03:30.350> again<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:33.590> I

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
you can also cut it off once again so I

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.259 
you can also cut it off once again so I
did<00:03:33.829> not<00:03:34.180> wind<00:03:35.180> up<00:03:35.569> crease<00:03:36.530> it<00:03:36.739> quite<00:03:37.489> low

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
did not wind up crease it quite low

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.500 
did not wind up crease it quite low
enough<00:03:38.569> but<00:03:38.630> it's<00:03:38.959> fine<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:40.280> yeah<00:03:40.639> and<00:03:41.329> then

just fold it back to normal

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.920 
just fold it back to normal
push<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:56.510> down<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:58.700> yeah<00:04:59.030> so<00:04:59.330> that's<00:04:59.540> pretty

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
push it down and yeah so that's pretty

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.810 
push it down and yeah so that's pretty
bad<00:05:00.200> I<00:05:00.560> put<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:00.950> way<00:05:01.100> too<00:05:01.160> close<00:05:01.400> to<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.640> edge

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
bad I put it way too close to the edge

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.720 
bad I put it way too close to the edge
but<00:05:02.240> it's<00:05:02.330> okay<00:05:02.540> for<00:05:02.720> shows<00:05:03.310> looks<00:05:04.310> are<00:05:04.550> not

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
but it's okay for shows looks are not

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:11.670 
but it's okay for shows looks are not
the<00:05:04.880> main<00:05:05.060> thing<00:05:05.770> then<00:05:06.770> what<00:05:07.040> you<00:05:07.100> want<00:05:07.280> to<00:05:07.310> do

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.310 

make<00:05:12.680> another<00:05:13.540> double-sided<00:05:14.540> piece<00:05:15.370> you<00:05:16.370> can

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
make another double-sided piece you can

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.250 
make another double-sided piece you can
fold<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.890> tab<00:05:19.250> down<00:05:19.640> as<00:05:19.880> well<00:05:20.120> so<00:05:20.720> that's

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
fold the tab down as well so that's

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.850 
fold the tab down as well so that's
better<00:05:22.450> and<00:05:23.450> then<00:05:23.630> so<00:05:23.840> you<00:05:23.870> can<00:05:23.990> open<00:05:24.290> it<00:05:24.620> pull
