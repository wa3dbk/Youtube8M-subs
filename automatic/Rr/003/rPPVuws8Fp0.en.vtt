00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.800
 Hello, dear friends from YouTube 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.520
 With you, again, 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.100
 The old processor is strained gloves 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.740
 A long time ago 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.900
 I did not show them any strange game 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.320
 Until today we will see 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.280
 One of my favorite toys 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.240
 This is a "magic pill" 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.740
 Also known as Chinese tablitas 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.940
 Or, also, "the ladder of Jacob" 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.240
 It is a popular game in Mexico and Japan 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.860
 The game consists of 6 wooden strips 

00:00:54.278 --> 00:00:56.438
 Painted in bright colors and tied with ribbons 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.780
 Let them navigate unusual 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.420
 Make a strange visual effect 

00:01:05.622 --> 00:01:07.622
 When you edit the tablet up 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.320
 It seems to come down from top to bottom 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.780
 The name "peace of Jacob" 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.300
 He hints at a dream that was in Jacob's sight 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.380
 And an outstretched hand from heaven to the earth 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.000
 Why did the angels rise and fall without stopping 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.080
 With this game you can build countless numbers 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.200
 As if it were TANGRAM 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.680
 Let's see a few examples of characters: 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 a house. 

00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:07.045
 a snake. 

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:19.495
 a chair. 

00:02:28.532 --> 00:02:30.532
 a man. 

00:02:30.723 --> 00:02:32.723
 Bye bye! 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.860
 dog. 

00:02:44.757 --> 00:02:46.757
 Sentences 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.440
 We can even do with tablets 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.440
 Simple magic trick: 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.880
 We put a coin on a second disk 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.000
 Covered with a top slice, 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.820
 A magic pass, "mantra" 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.620
 And the coin disappeared!
