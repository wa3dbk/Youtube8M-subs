00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.720
 I was talking about good deeds and what 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.980
 that if they are done correctly what is it 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.190
 what was happening with the police that 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.420
 they prevented this motorcycle from being stolen 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.010
 exactly the public city criteria 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.450
 of the federal district its elements are 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.340
 they gave an account through the cameras 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.079
 from this safe city they were 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.939
 stealing a colony Asturias 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.829
 motorcyclist but you think let's see 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.820
 the video if we are going to see it and you 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.820
 draw your own conclusions 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.539
 Surveillance cameras captured the video 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.760
 moment in which a motorcyclist is 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.829
 stripped of his vehicle by a group of 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.250
 subjects in streets of the asturias colony 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.930
 delegation cuauhtémoc the images 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.820
 show when criminals surround 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.850
 to the victim who when resisting to be 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.399
 amagado is assaulted with a weapon tries 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.289
 flee however one of the assailants 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.250
 shoots him and escapes along with his 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.250
 accomplices of the place 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.090
 because the man was on the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.650
 injured road immediately 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.420
 requested the support of an ambulance to 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.340
 help him 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.960
 through the security cameras it 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.810
 followed up on the alleged 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.810
 responsible managing to stop one of 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.600
 they 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.049
 in the description we leave you the league 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.049
 original 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.770
 with writing information for group 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.200
 multimedia image mario espinoza flores 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.479
 I would like all cases to be 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.369
 same as if you still do not assault it in the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.130
 street or at the door of your house this 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.390
 it also happens exactly 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.369
 unfortunately how will we save then 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.259
 we are millions of people in this 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.450
 city ​​and I really say I think that the 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.520
 advertising the police really do their 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.840
 better effort like in this case like what 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.060
 we have seen in some other cases more 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.979
 but it is also true that 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.479
 unfortunately we can be cared for 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.549
 all but when they are dedicated to work 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.020
 or being in that moment we can see the 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.030
 good result hopefully that too 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.009
 who were watching these images and 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.079
 they are dedicated to this type of illicit to 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.909
 scarce a little hopefully not in fact 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.130
 there is a topic that interesting with this 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.739
 the offender who stopped people who 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.329
 I met him between 23 and 25 years old and 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.790
 the same police says that in any case 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:19.519
 that he was found guilty he's going to 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.540
 come out past in the 53 53 years of the 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.040
 jail 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.870
 that is, beyond that, I believe that 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.840
 lesson that grabbed me is that the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.090
 people really think that if they want 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.739
 spend youth and stage more 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.480
 productive of his life locked in a 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.000
 jail in a cage 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.890
 and I know there are things that do not have to be 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.230
 make them treat everyone like everyone 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:45.210
 those who left every morning many 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.400
 thank you very good day 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.230
 we invite you to continue questioning the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.230
 information with the following videos
