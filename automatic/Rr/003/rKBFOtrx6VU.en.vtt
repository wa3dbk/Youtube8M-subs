00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.330 
look at nature oscillator from the guy

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.049 
look at nature oscillator from the guy
who<00:00:07.390> brought<00:00:07.810> us<00:00:08.020> virtual<00:00:08.500> ANS<00:00:08.980> song<00:00:09.700> vox

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059

okay so what's happening here is that
the<00:00:22.110> you<00:00:23.110> can<00:00:23.380> see<00:00:23.560> this<00:00:23.680> little<00:00:23.860> star<00:00:24.250> but<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
the you can see this little star but the

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:45.599 
the you can see this little star but the
camera<00:00:26.380> is<00:00:28.739> making<00:00:29.739> sound<00:00:43.050> by<00:00:44.609> manipulating

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
camera is making sound by manipulating

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.340 
camera is making sound by manipulating
various<00:00:46.000> parts<00:00:46.329> of<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.510> screen<00:00:46.839> we<00:00:47.109> can

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
various parts of the screen we can

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.310 
various parts of the screen we can
change<00:00:47.649> the<00:00:47.890> sound<00:00:48.780> I've<00:00:49.780> got<00:00:49.960> to<00:00:50.050> be<00:00:50.140> honest

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
change the sound I've got to be honest

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.950 
change the sound I've got to be honest
with<00:00:50.530> ya<00:00:51.359> this<00:00:52.359> probably<00:00:52.660> would<00:00:52.780> have<00:00:52.870> been

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
with ya this probably would have been

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.889 
with ya this probably would have been
better<00:00:53.170> if<00:00:53.260> I<00:00:53.469> had<00:00:53.499> screen<00:00:53.949> capture<00:00:54.429> but<00:00:54.899> it's

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
better if I had screen capture but it's

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.360 
better if I had screen capture but it's
really<00:00:56.079> good<00:00:56.320> fun<00:00:56.469> if<00:00:56.589> you<00:00:56.710> take<00:00:56.949> your<00:00:57.190> iPad

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
really good fun if you take your iPad

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.809 
really good fun if you take your iPad
out<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:59.289> know<00:00:59.409> you<00:00:59.710> go<00:00:59.920> moves<00:01:00.280> around<00:01:00.460> and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:00.819 
out and you know you go moves around and

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:02.610 
out and you know you go moves around and
have<00:01:01.480> some<00:01:01.510> headphones<00:01:02.019> on<00:01:02.199> you<00:01:02.289> get<00:01:02.469> some

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
have some headphones on you get some

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:49.930 
have some headphones on you get some
really<00:01:03.159> really<00:01:03.850> crazy<00:01:04.180> stores<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:14.049> frequency

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:59.920 

quality

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.720 

this<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> best<00:02:01.380> opiate<00:02:01.980> this<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
this is the best opiate this is the

00:02:02.730 --> 00:05:26.660 
this is the best opiate this is the
different<00:02:03.090> waveforms

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:45.590 

that's<00:05:27.670> all<00:05:27.910> the<00:05:28.090> way<00:05:28.210> for

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.630 

you<00:05:46.380> just<00:05:46.620> turn<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:46.920> volume<00:05:46.950> down<00:05:47.250> a<00:05:47.430> little

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
you just turn the volume down a little

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.820 
you just turn the volume down a little
bit<00:05:47.820> on<00:05:47.940> that<00:05:47.970> and<00:05:48.510> you're<00:05:49.200> the<00:05:49.320> cool<00:05:49.530> thing<00:05:49.800> is

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
bit on that and you're the cool thing is

00:05:49.830 --> 00:06:00.020 
bit on that and you're the cool thing is
that<00:05:50.040> you<00:05:50.280> can<00:05:50.640> record<00:05:57.710> your<00:05:59.030> your

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
that you can record your your

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:11.390 
that you can record your your
performances<00:06:00.810> if<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:01.080> like<00:06:09.950> and<00:06:10.950> once<00:06:11.160> you're

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
performances if you like and once you're

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.930 
performances if you like and once you're
done<00:06:11.430> you<00:06:11.970> can<00:06:12.710> use<00:06:13.710> iTunes<00:06:14.160> file-sharing<00:06:14.670> to

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
done you can use iTunes file-sharing to

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.610 
done you can use iTunes file-sharing to
get<00:06:15.060> them<00:06:15.180> out<00:06:15.330> there<00:06:15.600> you<00:06:15.630> can<00:06:16.080> export<00:06:16.470> them

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
get them out there you can export them

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.300 
get them out there you can export them
via<00:06:16.800> Wi-Fi<00:06:17.010> or<00:06:18.000> you<00:06:18.330> can<00:06:18.510> audio<00:06:18.900> copy<00:06:19.260> and<00:06:19.620> use

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
via Wi-Fi or you can audio copy and use

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.370 
via Wi-Fi or you can audio copy and use
them<00:06:20.520> in<00:06:20.700> other<00:06:21.000> apps<00:06:21.270> alright<00:06:21.960> guys<00:06:22.170> so

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
them in other apps alright guys so

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.930 
them in other apps alright guys so
that's<00:06:22.500> nature<00:06:23.100> oscillator<00:06:23.520> which<00:06:23.730> i<00:06:23.880> think

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
that's nature oscillator which i think

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.210 
that's nature oscillator which i think
is<00:06:24.240> incredibly<00:06:24.720> good<00:06:24.900> for<00:06:25.200> much<00:06:25.800> better<00:06:26.010> if

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
is incredibly good for much better if

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.340 
is incredibly good for much better if
you<00:06:26.370> take<00:06:26.610> it<00:06:26.820> out<00:06:26.940> with<00:06:27.150> you<00:06:27.390> and<00:06:27.630> capture

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
you take it out with you and capture

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.730 
you take it out with you and capture
some<00:06:28.380> stuff<00:06:28.830> outside<00:06:29.780> alright<00:06:30.780> guys<00:06:30.990> I'll<00:06:31.530> see

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
some stuff outside alright guys I'll see

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.040 
some stuff outside alright guys I'll see
you<00:06:31.800> later
