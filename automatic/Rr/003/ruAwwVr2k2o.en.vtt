 white sugar and nine tablespoons of water 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.860
 first let's make a honey 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.740
 combining sugar and water in one 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.830
 small pot the abyss for five 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.890
 minutes we let cool cut the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.990
 fruit and grind it in the blender 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.200
 we put the raspberries we put in two 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.410
 bowls and we divide the honey in between 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.509
 two fill the pallet containers 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.420
 with one of the fruits and put in 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.729
 freezer for one hour take out and 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.250
 fill with the other fruit and freeze 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.090
 minus four hours as such here we have 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.070
 ready and our mango paddles with 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.290
 raspberry saw how pretty they look 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.640
 Two colors 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.640
 let's try to see 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.500
 Now I can bite but 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.990
 still because when they are round 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.610
 they are more chubby 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:00.130
 they look great if they do not have molds of 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.830
 these I got these redonditos that 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.369
 they look very nice they have this no more 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.349
 it is removed is very fine but you can 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.929
 do with any mold with any 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.180
 disposable glass 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.040
 and a wooden stick is also 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.390
 You can add another fruit so you have 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.760
 a third color do not forget to tell me 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.360
 everything you can think of that another fruit 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.670

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.010
