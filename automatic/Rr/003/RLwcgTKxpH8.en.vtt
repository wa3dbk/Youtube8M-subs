really heavy conscious thought but it's

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.520 
really heavy conscious thought but it's
something<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:56.930> you<00:03:57.019> should<00:03:57.170> you<00:03:57.320> know<00:03:57.350> at

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
something that you should you know at

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.729 
something that you should you know at

per<00:04:03.500> game<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:06.370> think<00:04:07.370> that's<00:04:07.519> all<00:04:07.700> talk<00:04:08.180> about

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
per game I think that's all talk about

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.060 
per game I think that's all talk about
now<00:04:08.570> about<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.870> control<00:04:09.019> aspects<00:04:09.709> of<00:04:09.769> things

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
now about to control aspects of things

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.920 
now about to control aspects of things
it's<00:04:10.250> not<00:04:10.370> really<00:04:10.850> my<00:04:11.000> strongest<00:04:11.600> point<00:04:11.690> I

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
it's not really my strongest point I

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.319 
it's not really my strongest point I
believe<00:04:12.110> my<00:04:12.320> strongest<00:04:12.790> parts<00:04:13.790> come<00:04:14.000> in<00:04:14.030> while

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
believe my strongest parts come in while

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:15.699 
believe my strongest parts come in while
my<00:04:14.510> knowledge<00:04:14.780> comes<00:04:15.019> in<00:04:15.170> in<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.350> next<00:04:15.560> couple

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
my knowledge comes in in the next couple

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.569 
my knowledge comes in in the next couple
of<00:04:15.920> stages<00:04:16.519> of<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.540> five<00:04:17.720> fundamentals

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
of stages of the five fundamentals

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.339 
of stages of the five fundamentals
that's<00:04:18.789> setting<00:04:19.720> up<00:04:19.810> but<00:04:19.959> we'll<00:04:20.049> talk<00:04:20.199> about

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
that's setting up but we'll talk about

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.189 
that's setting up but we'll talk about
options<00:04:20.560> with<00:04:21.069> it<00:04:21.220> when<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.060> set<00:04:22.270> up<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.629> then

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
options with it when you set up and then

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.309 
options with it when you set up and then
within<00:04:23.500> those<00:04:23.620> options<00:04:24.159> how<00:04:24.430> you<00:04:24.490> read

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:25.319 
within those options how you read

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.149 
within those options how you read
there's<00:04:26.319> different<00:04:26.530> ways<00:04:26.590> you<00:04:26.650> can<00:04:26.800> read<00:04:27.039> you

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
there's different ways you can read you

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:28.290 
there's different ways you can read you
don't<00:04:27.370> always<00:04:27.460> have<00:04:27.550> to<00:04:27.669> read<00:04:27.849> the<00:04:27.939> same<00:04:28.120> way

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
don't always have to read the same way

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.820 
don't always have to read the same way
so<00:04:28.930> those<00:04:29.050> will<00:04:29.139> be<00:04:29.199> the<00:04:29.319> next<00:04:29.439> couple<00:04:29.680> of

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
so those will be the next couple of

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.450 
so those will be the next couple of
episodes<00:04:31.050> so<00:04:32.050> hope<00:04:32.830> you<00:04:32.919> keep<00:04:33.069> coming<00:04:33.310> back
