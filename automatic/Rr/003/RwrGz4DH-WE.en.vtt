00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
1080 normally the engine a 25 is like I

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.660 
1080 normally the engine a 25 is like I
yep<00:01:49.270> I'm<00:01:49.420> inch<00:01:49.600> yeah<00:01:49.960> how<00:01:50.080> thick<00:01:50.290> is<00:01:50.440> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
yep I'm inch yeah how thick is it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.969 
yep I'm inch yeah how thick is it
thickness<00:01:51.670> is<00:01:54.479> 9.4<00:01:55.479> it<00:01:56.050> also<00:01:56.229> has<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.560> curvature

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
thickness is 9.4 it also has a curvature

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.920 
thickness is 9.4 it also has a curvature
to<00:01:57.310> design<00:01:57.700> yep<00:01:58.119> so<00:01:58.479> you're<00:01:58.630> going<00:01:58.720> to<00:01:58.780> have<00:01:58.840> a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
to design yep so you're going to have a

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.120 
to design yep so you're going to have a
little<00:01:59.110> bit<00:01:59.350> different<00:01:59.680> thickness<00:01:59.979> in<00:02:00.100> the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
little bit different thickness in the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.219 
little bit different thickness in the
middle<00:02:00.430> versus<00:02:00.820> ill-bred<00:02:01.240> little<00:02:01.300> that<00:02:02.140> are

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
middle versus ill-bred little that are

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.980 
middle versus ill-bred little that are
any<00:02:02.380> notice<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:03.250> curvatures<00:02:03.850> designs<00:02:04.210> it's

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
any notice the curvatures designs it's

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.440 
any notice the curvatures designs it's
nicely<00:02:05.229> in<00:02:05.470> your<00:02:05.530> hand<00:02:05.830> yeah<00:02:06.310> strong<00:02:07.180> metal

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
nicely in your hand yeah strong metal

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.980

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.240 
frame design way it's manufactured this
device<00:02:11.320> actually<00:02:11.530> goes<00:02:11.800> through<00:02:11.830> much<00:02:12.220> more

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
device actually goes through much more

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.980 
device actually goes through much more
