the one thing I hope attendees from the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.270 
the one thing I hope attendees from the
hepatocyte<00:02:48.840> program<00:02:49.290> take<00:02:49.530> away<00:02:49.799> is

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
hepatocyte program take away is

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.679 
hepatocyte program take away is
something<00:02:50.610> they<00:02:50.730> can<00:02:50.879> actually<00:02:51.060> apply<00:02:51.390> when

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
something they can actually apply when

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.360 
something they can actually apply when
they<00:02:51.780> get<00:02:51.930> back<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.260> their<00:02:52.290> actual<00:02:52.739> jobs<00:02:53.069> a
