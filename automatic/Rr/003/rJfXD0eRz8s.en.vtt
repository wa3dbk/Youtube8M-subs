Hi and welcome to a new video of the maemo Games: series!

00:00:06.577 --> 00:00:10.900
I am zehjotkah from meetmeego.org and in this video I'll show you Crazy Hamster!

00:00:21.173 --> 00:00:28.521
Crazy Hamster will be available soon at the Ovi Store, currently there is only a demo version.

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:48.733
As you can hear the music is quite okay.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:01:00.004
At the main menu you can start a new game, change the preferences, show the highscores and the help and buy the full version when available.

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:05.464
Let's start a new game.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.460
The game is a little bit similar to the game lemmings

00:01:18.473 --> 00:01:25.853
You have to help the hamster to arrive safely at home

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:51.343
That was quite boring, but let's see if the difficulty will aument in the next levels.

00:01:57.613 --> 00:02:06.741
You can let the hamster run faster by using the accelerometers of the N900

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:21.442
As you can see the difficulty will aument from level to level.

00:02:29.832 --> 00:02:39.156
As there is this demo available you can try it out and decide if this game is something for you or not.

00:02:40.447 --> 00:02:45.583
