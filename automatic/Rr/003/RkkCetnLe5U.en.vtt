well<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.309> quantum<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:05.970> developed<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.510> for<00:01:06.690> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
well the quantum we developed it for the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.920 
well the quantum we developed it for the
past<00:01:07.350> two<00:01:07.560> years<00:01:07.590> roundabout<00:01:08.570> is<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.630> really

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
past two years roundabout is a really

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.980 
past two years roundabout is a really
stable<00:01:10.110> kite<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.060> well<00:01:12.060> when<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> race<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
stable kite and well when you race in a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.140 
stable kite and well when you race in a
German<00:01:13.500> race<00:01:13.890> serious<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.970> lot<00:01:15.119> of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
German race serious we have a lot of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.870 
German race serious we have a lot of
marks<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.050> 10<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.830> 15<00:01:17.220> turning

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
marks we have like 10 to 15 turning

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.000 
marks we have like 10 to 15 turning
marks<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.240> our<00:01:18.330> races<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:19.860> to

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
marks in our races I really have to

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.590 
marks in our races I really have to
concentrate<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> course<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.330> can't

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
concentrate on the course and I can't

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.270 
concentrate on the course and I can't
concentrate<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> time<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.860> kite<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
concentrate all the time on the kite and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.520 
concentrate all the time on the kite and
the<00:01:24.150> C<00:01:24.300> phantom<00:01:24.630> that's<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.140> easy<00:01:25.320> because

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
the C phantom that's really easy because

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.190 
the C phantom that's really easy because
the<00:01:25.680> kites<00:01:26.040> solid<00:01:26.670> stable<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.720> has<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> good

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the kites solid stable it has a good

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.070 
the kites solid stable it has a good
pull<00:01:28.619> although<00:01:29.220> all<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> time<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.090> that's

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
pull although all the time and that's

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.510 
pull although all the time and that's
the<00:01:31.229> most<00:01:31.380> important<00:01:31.800> thing<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.130> me<00:01:32.190> that<00:01:32.460> I

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the most important thing for me that I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.160 
the most important thing for me that I
have<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> kite<00:01:32.910> where<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> don't<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.990> care

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
have a kite where I don't have to care

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.230 
have a kite where I don't have to care
about<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:35.100> me<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.369> important<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.119> I

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
about for me it's important that I

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.090 
about for me it's important that I
concentrate<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.320> marks<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.800> course

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
concentrate on the marks on the course

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:48.050 
concentrate on the marks on the course
where<00:01:38.369> great

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.000 

so<00:01:49.060> on<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.630> technical<00:01:50.110> side<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.680> kite

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
so on the technical side of the kite

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.000 
so on the technical side of the kite
we've<00:01:51.250> used<00:01:51.790> some<00:01:52.090> new<00:01:52.120> technology<00:01:53.050> which<00:01:53.830> we

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
we've used some new technology which we

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.800 
we've used some new technology which we
took<00:01:54.190> from<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.550> paragliding<00:01:55.030> side<00:01:55.360> into<00:01:55.780> the

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
took from the paragliding side into the

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.710 
took from the paragliding side into the
kites<00:01:56.140> as<00:01:56.380> well<00:01:56.620> there<00:01:57.190> is<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:58.210> internal

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
kites as well there is the internal

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.540 
kites as well there is the internal
strapping<00:01:59.310> along<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:01.080> span<00:02:02.080> of<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:03.310> kite

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
strapping along the span of the kite

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.550 
strapping along the span of the kite
which<00:02:04.360> reduces<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.710> sail<00:02:06.670> tension<00:02:07.380> takes<00:02:08.380> off

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
which reduces the sail tension takes off

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.010 
which reduces the sail tension takes off
the<00:02:08.710> load<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.580> sail<00:02:09.790> and<00:02:10.060> into<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.690> straps

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
the load of the sail and into the straps

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.550 
the load of the sail and into the straps
it's<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.190> higher<00:02:12.430> arc<00:02:12.730> kite<00:02:13.300> as<00:02:13.540> well<00:02:13.780> which

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
it's a higher arc kite as well which

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.000 
it's a higher arc kite as well which
make<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:14.950> more<00:02:15.130> stable<00:02:15.460> better<00:02:16.000> handling

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
make it more stable better handling

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.040 
make it more stable better handling
we've<00:02:18.010> reduced<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.670> line<00:02:18.820> drag<00:02:19.180> again<00:02:19.630> it's

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
we've reduced the line drag again it's

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.890 
we've reduced the line drag again it's
only<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.860> couple<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.850> meters<00:02:22.210> of<00:02:22.330> lines<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
only a couple of meters of lines and the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.960 
only a couple of meters of lines and the
kite<00:02:23.080> really<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.620> can<00:02:23.830> see<00:02:24.040> how<00:02:24.280> rare<00:02:24.760> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
kite really and you can see how rare the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.990 
kite really and you can see how rare the
lines<00:02:25.180> are<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.750> lines<00:02:26.410> are<00:02:26.920> unsheath<00:02:27.550> lines

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000
