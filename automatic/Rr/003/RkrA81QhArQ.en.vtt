I found this hole here it's the large
floral<00:00:49.140> prints<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.309> see<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> Kenzo

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.130 
floral prints that I see in the Kenzo
design<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.559> has<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.980> pale<00:00:53.850> blue

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
design and it has this pale blue

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.600 
design and it has this pale blue
foundation<00:00:55.140> which<00:00:55.379> definitely<00:00:56.100> isn't<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
foundation which definitely isn't the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.189 
foundation which definitely isn't the
standing<00:00:57.000> pink<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.480> see<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.050> still

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
standing pink that we see but it's still

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.619 
standing pink that we see but it's still
in<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.350> same<00:00:58.590> color<00:00:58.829> family<00:00:59.030> the<00:01:00.030> only<00:01:00.390> thing

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
in the same color family the only thing

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.420 
in the same color family the only thing
about<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.050> look<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.530> ladies<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.250> you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
about this look is that ladies if you

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.090 
about this look is that ladies if you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
your petite frame because it will just

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.380 
your petite frame because it will just
overwhelm<00:01:09.030> you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390
