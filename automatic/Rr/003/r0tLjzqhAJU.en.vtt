once<00:01:21.890> Tonga<00:01:22.310> was<00:01:22.340> anesthetized<00:01:22.670> we<00:01:23.300> could

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
once Tonga was anesthetized we could

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.970 
once Tonga was anesthetized we could
clearly<00:01:23.690> see<00:01:23.810> that<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.260> tooth<00:01:24.440> was<00:01:24.650> indeed

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
clearly see that the tooth was indeed

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.220 
clearly see that the tooth was indeed
broken<00:01:25.400> and<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.700> pulp<00:01:25.910> cavity<00:01:26.180> was<00:01:26.780> exposed

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
broken and the pulp cavity was exposed

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.410 
broken and the pulp cavity was exposed
the<00:01:27.920> pulp<00:01:28.100> cavity<00:01:28.310> is<00:01:28.580> a<00:01:28.610> little<00:01:28.880> tiny<00:01:29.060> canal

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
the pulp cavity is a little tiny canal

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.550 
the pulp cavity is a little tiny canal
in<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.630> middle<00:01:29.870> of<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.020> tooth<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.230> goes

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
in the middle of the tooth that goes

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.680 
in the middle of the tooth that goes
down<00:01:30.800> to<00:01:30.980> the<00:01:31.100> root<00:01:31.250> of<00:01:31.370> the<00:01:31.460> tooth<00:01:31.690> normally

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
down to the root of the tooth normally

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.270 
down to the root of the tooth normally
your<00:01:32.840> enamel<00:01:33.080> is<00:01:33.320> covering<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.830> pulp<00:01:34.040> cavity

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
your enamel is covering the pulp cavity

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.700 
your enamel is covering the pulp cavity
so<00:01:34.730> it<00:01:34.850> stays<00:01:35.060> clean<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.390> protected<00:01:36.050> but<00:01:36.590> if

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
so it stays clean and protected but if
