00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.629
 Hello guys 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.640
 already imagined at a certain time knocks 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.689
 that hunger are you going to look for some 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.090
 thing to eat 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.910
 the only thing you think is some 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.060
 killed of life and you do not think it sucks 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.950
 an opener or you 're in the middle of the 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.529
 I kill you, you took something to sing. 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.780
 You've only struggled to eat and you have not 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.149
 remembered to take a blessed from the open 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.340
 cans and this can is not the one 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.859
 comes with leozinho to pull then as is 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.699
 What you can do to open your 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.340
 tin 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.550
 then to April the can without needing 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.230
 an opener to organize a stone or 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.719
 somewhere that has a bit of 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.550
 an abrasive surface tv at home you 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.890
 can appeal to a concrete life 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.140
 something like that is a stone if you 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.829
 have also certain campaign but looks only 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.170
 that cool you come here're seeing here 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.170
 in the house right on the sidewalk 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.909
 I'm going to get my tin in there. 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.610
 that you would not use on round beach 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.100
 in the part that you would pass the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:23.149
 Can you see that part down you? 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:29.380
 it will rub a little until you see 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.380
 which is beginning to separate the tastes 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.319
 It even starts to open up here. 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:55.060
 An hour will come when you go. 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:59.289
 begin to see here in the amendment that 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.289
 It has two metal aluminum foil 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.319
 that they come together up here then 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:09.549
 You'll run just enough to 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.810
 leave that part is start taking off 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.700
 from one another 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.950
 if you're going to win the podium here on the floor already 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.930
 I started to make a little oil and 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.549
 from inside can of tuna 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.069
 done that you will just get 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.200
 This can and squeeze on the next sides. 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.989
 I'll show you a reward 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.900
 after you've gotten enough until 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.000
 you see what is the junction of the blades of 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.250
 metal that is starting to open the only 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.030
 thing you need to pick up is to push 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.030
 there on the side 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.930
 she already started to release here too 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.450
 to yoki with your own hand you can 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.190
 open sometimes she has to jump here to 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.230
 out but not to get the first 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.190
 triathon nÃ© 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:10.640
 there you are without an aperture without anything 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.410
 able to open my right can there 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.820
 You'll ask, but whats the use? 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.940
 for tuna can 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.980
 no, I will not just be doing the same thing 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.980
 with a can of green corn 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.340
 look that 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.500
 I would open 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:47.490
 That's it, I can open it here today. 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.870
 my green corn can equal open the 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.870
 my can of tuna 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.160
 come back here with you right after 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.890
 a little bit here and adjusting the 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:04.200
 a person I can get without having an opener 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.380
 of cans just shaving the part I 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.209
 would open on an abrasive surface 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.950
 I managed to open both the tuna can 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:17.130
 as my corn can is good the staff 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.070
 if they saw that case as I you who 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.620
 they were like a little thing and you just think 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.780
 Something reported in your house and you 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.450
 did not find the blessed of the opener 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.750
 cans a concrete had a surface 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.240
 Brazil as a stone scrubs part where 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.250
 you would open there where you have a junction 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.010
 of the two blades in this way 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.830
 side of the can but here it covers it 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.840
 form a curved junction you like me there 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.910
 you at exactly that point in the 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.320
 curve that was used to seal so 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.790
 then tighten the belt tighten a 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.290
 little more a little less rare a 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.200
 a little bit more there 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:55.950
 But you can open the can without 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.229
 need to open cans per month average help 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.470
 very often the staff until the next 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.470
