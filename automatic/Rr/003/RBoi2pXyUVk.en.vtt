00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.939 

once<00:00:49.059> you've<00:00:49.300> found<00:00:50.140> that<00:00:50.320> comfort<00:00:50.829> with

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
once you've found that comfort with

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.009 
once you've found that comfort with
somebody<00:00:51.309> where<00:00:52.059> you<00:00:52.179> can<00:00:52.329> do<00:00:52.449> nothing<00:00:52.629> and

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
somebody where you can do nothing and

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.500 
somebody where you can do nothing and
just<00:00:53.829> like<00:00:53.949> your<00:00:54.280> presence<00:00:54.699> together<00:00:55.030> is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
just like your presence together is

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.110 
just like your presence together is
enough<00:00:55.960> I<00:00:56.289> think<00:00:56.979> that's<00:00:57.219> when<00:00:57.399> you<00:00:57.579> know<00:00:57.969> that

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
there's no set rules there and that's

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.670 
there's no set rules there and that's
kind<00:01:04.149> of<00:01:04.299> romantic<00:01:04.539> not<00:01:04.839> knowing<00:01:05.199> it's<00:01:05.439> like
