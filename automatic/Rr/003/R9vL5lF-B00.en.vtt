00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
not press the light attack which would

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.440 
not press the light attack which would
be<00:01:43.619> square<00:01:44.119> or<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:46.020> think<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:46.890> X<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.700> Xbox<00:01:48.329> I'm

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
of them and teleport away and then it's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.719 
of them and teleport away and then it's
gonna<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:57.959> a<00:01:58.079> real<00:01:58.500> pain<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.069> the<00:01:59.100> ass<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.549> try

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
gonna be a real pain in the ass to try

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.580 
gonna be a real pain in the ass to try
to<00:01:59.789> get<00:02:00.329> him<00:02:00.420> back<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.079> way<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.229> want<00:02:01.500> them

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
to get him back to the way you want them

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.520 
to get him back to the way you want them
to<00:02:01.679> be<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.479> keep<00:02:03.720> a<00:02:03.899> luncheon<00:02:04.439> on

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
to be so you keep a luncheon on

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.199 
to be so you keep a luncheon on
impressing<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.039> heavy<00:02:05.189> attack<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.759> it'll<00:02:06.179> work

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
impressing a heavy attack and it'll work

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.059 
impressing a heavy attack and it'll work
and<00:02:06.630> then<00:02:06.810> another<00:02:07.020> way<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.289> get<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.770> help<00:02:07.920> off

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
and then another way to get the help off

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.979 
and then another way to get the help off
is<00:02:08.190> by<00:02:08.340> doing<00:02:08.789> what<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.329> did<00:02:09.509> there<00:02:09.569> which

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
is by doing what I just did there which

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.309 
is by doing what I just did there which
would<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.799> counter<00:02:11.160> move<00:02:11.370> which<00:02:12.319> you

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
would be the the counter move which you

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.750 
would be the the counter move which you
can't<00:02:13.530> really<00:02:13.709> plan<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.099> doing<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.459> but<00:02:14.519> you

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
can't really plan on doing that but you

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.610 
can't really plan on doing that but you
can<00:02:14.880> plan<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.209> one<00:02:15.390> gene<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:16.019> then<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.530> I

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
can plan on one gene and then like I

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.990 
can plan on one gene and then like I
said<00:02:16.769> before<00:02:16.920> trying<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.459> in<00:02:17.549> Berserker

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
said before trying to be in Berserker

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.759 
said before trying to be in Berserker
mode<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.540> it'll<00:02:19.019> take<00:02:19.200> me<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.500> lot<00:02:19.709> more

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
mode and it'll take me a lot more

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.150 
mode and it'll take me a lot more
helpful<00:02:20.190> than<00:02:20.519> uh<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:22.290> then<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.920> be<00:02:23.069> an

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
helpful than uh and then not be an

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.009 
helpful than uh and then not be an
inverse<00:02:23.340> Ackermann<00:02:23.579> so<00:02:24.540> now<00:02:24.660> he's<00:02:24.810> got<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
inverse Ackermann so now he's got the

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.990 
inverse Ackermann so now he's got the
ability<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.379> actually<00:02:25.739> destroy<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.280> tower<00:02:26.579> um

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
ability to actually destroy the tower um

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.229 
ability to actually destroy the tower um

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
angry I know that this part when he can

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.240 
angry I know that this part when he can
destroy<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.290> tower<00:02:37.440> can<00:02:37.680> get<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.799> little<00:02:38.069> bit

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
destroy the tower can get a little bit

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.590 
destroy the tower can get a little bit
annoying<00:02:38.489> because<00:02:38.700> sometimes<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.329> kalisch

like press square twice over three times
and<00:02:58.769> then<00:02:58.859> our<00:02:59.370> Strang<00:02:59.639> going<00:02:59.910> over<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.150> a

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
and then our Strang going over to a

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.430 
and then our Strang going over to a
heavy<00:03:00.359> attack<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.780> then<00:03:00.870> it'll<00:03:00.989> he'll<00:03:01.260> be
