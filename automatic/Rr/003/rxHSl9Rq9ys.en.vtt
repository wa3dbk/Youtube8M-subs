00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.405
    STAY RIGHT WERE YOU ARE     

00:00:01.472 --> 00:00:03.540
IT'S CYBERCHASE FOR REAL.

        (SNEEZES)

              HEY,              
              HOW ARE YOU DOING?

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:33.704
         NOT SO GREAT.

        (SNEEZES)               

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.477
                WHAT'S WRONG?   

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:42.879
MY MOTOR IS NOT                 
WORKING SO WELL.                

00:00:42.947 --> 00:00:45.482
                  MY MOTOR NEEDS
                  WORK TOO.     

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.284
  I HOPE WE GET BETTER SOON.

         ARE YOU A KID          
        OR A GROWN UP?          

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.490
        CAN'T YOU TELL?         

00:00:53.558 --> 00:00:58.061
  WELL, YOU SEEM KIND OF BIG    
 TO BE SEEING A PEDIATRICIAN.

        (SNEEZES)               

00:01:03.368 --> 00:01:04.968
    HOW LONG HAVE YOU           
        BEEN SNEEZING?          

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:06.370
                ABOUT A WEEK.   

00:01:06.437 --> 00:01:07.604
                 I THINK        
                 I HAVE THE FLU.

00:01:07.672 --> 00:01:08.905
         HAVE YOU HAD           
          ANY FEVERS?

         ANY HEADACHE?          

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:11.375
              NO.               

00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:13.143
    I THINK YOU MIGHT           
    HAVE AN ALLERGY.

00:01:14.646 --> 00:01:15.579
                         REALLY?

00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:16.913
DO YOU HAVE                     
ANY PETS AT HOME?               

00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:17.414
              NO.               

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:21.051
     YOU MIGHT BE ALLERGIC      
    TO POLLEN OR DUST           

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.686
OR MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE.

     FOR THE REST OF TODAY      

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:29.226

DOING A LOT BETTER, HARRY.

I'M NOT SNEEZING ANYMORE.       

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:31.282

AT THE DATA.

 YOU DID MOST OF YOUR SNEEZING  
    AT INGA'S HOUSE.

      I TOOK CARE OF HER        
          LAST WEEK.            

00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:46.330

    I PREDICT IF YOU VISIT      
THE VETS OFFICE DOWN THE BLOCK  

00:02:49.067 --> 00:02:50.901
        YOU'LL DO A LOT         
      OF SNEEZING THERE.

00:03:02.547 --> 00:03:04.081
  BUT IF I'M ALLERGIC TO CATS   

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.351
    WHY DID I SNEEZE            
WHEN I WASN'T NEAR A CAT?       

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.820
  YOU WERE WEARING DIFFERENT    
     CLOTHES EARLIER TODAY      

00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:11.689
THEY MUST HAVE CAT FUR ON THEM. 

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:12.990
            HARRY:              
          OF COURSE.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.363
     WHAT'S THE TREATMENT?      

00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:20.564
      CLEAN YOUR JACKET,        

00:03:20.632 --> 00:03:21.999
     CLEAN YOUR APARTMENT,      

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:23.501
AND NO MORE
