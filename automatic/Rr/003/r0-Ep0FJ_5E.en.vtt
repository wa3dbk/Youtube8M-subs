00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.300
 an inattention because with a ball 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.849
 long iniesta there was forgiveness month and there was 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.560
 turned its back on all the defenders 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.690
 from the athletic to each corner of the 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.080
 barcelona piquÃ© inside the puff pastry area 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.080
 Bush 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.289
 doing 9 takes advantage of axel to mark 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.210
 the first of the game if it is for auction 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.180
 well the club is 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.180
 starts to activate if inside the area 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.140
 and the unchecking of messi messi makes a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.810
 very good wind that if you go towards the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.180
 left to the right in this case 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.280
 forces its central amorebieta that the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.440
 continues month and is going to get in the area 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.300
 follow month and month and back to be 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.300
 fabregas fabregas making the diagonal 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.670
 nor your football out of this world 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.830
 The goal is outrageous how it goes 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.870
 moving the entire defense from side to 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.440
 balls go four for four and base 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.270
 is the diagonal it falls short on 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.620
 messi and recover the barcelona and neither is 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.220
 avoiding the offside 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.600
 its good opening to the right 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.600
 to be saved 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.190
 fabregas 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:38.540
 then solve this what you want axial 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.540
 or ball inside the area to 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.930
 there's the pass I think iturra is 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.060
 is clearly in the correct position and 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.680
 how you step on the ball with your right and you 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.960
 hit with the left now yes it is 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.950
 by the center of new balls to the 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.950
 hallway is going to hit 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.460
 cedar with what Pedro is doing 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.030
 My God, what is Peter doing? 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.789
 what are you doing but 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.299
 mohamed yes 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.299
 s 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.210
 the original sector of that ball was not 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.420
 the person who wanted to spend the 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:28.130
 ball but ends up taking advantage of that good 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.130
 canary action to mark
