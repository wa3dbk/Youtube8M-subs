00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.760
 hello and welcome to arroux net tv 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.900
 for a new edition of 0.1 drive 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.580
 today I find myself in a place a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.259
 not very particular to ingolstadt in 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.059
 Germany at audi headquarters and more 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.460
 especially in a space actually 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.880
 which was reserved for the presentation of 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.880
 the audi tt 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.320
 here it is this third generation 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.989
 of audi tt here it's even about the model 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.489
 technology really everywhere 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.750
 a lot of techno that we do not see there 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.370
 included here in a system of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.290
 suspension driven by systems 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.970
 electro magnetic there are these fires 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.890
 amateur women the help that should provide a 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.180
 exceptional comfort on the road 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.590
 but what interests us especially on 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.909
 01net tv well it's going on inside 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.559
 that's what we will discover together 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.559
 it is the virtual cockpit 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.970
 which necessarily calls into question when we 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.949
 go into this new audi tt well 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.710
 it's the new ultra dashboard 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.200
 purified since well the old system 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.940
 mmi with the color screen that was placed 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.410
 in the center of the dashboard is 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.060
 outright now deported actually 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.320
 directly in the field of view of the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.970
 driver in place of 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.890
 more traditional counters it's this 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.630
 that audi calls the virtual cockpit 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.010
 it's actually a screen a little bit 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.200
 way of a tablet that the builder 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.550
 can customize and then who especially 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.950
 will you show the indications 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.810
 really very very big we see it by 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.720
 example when navigating the menus 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.250
 etc we activate the map mode here and well 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.650
 we are more about simple indications 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.300
 left right all right as it was 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.410
 the case before the center of the counters 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.420
 now it's downright 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.399
 cartography that is displayed in full 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.350
 screen can zoom in until you reach 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.729
 besides the mode that is actually the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.560
 google street view mode 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.390
 the only real constraint for audi 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.430
 on the display of this screen is fine 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.960
 it is to respect the display of the 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.670
 contour and speedometer 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.780
 it's also on this big color screen 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.550
 we find all the others 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.990
 multimedia functions present on this 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.670
 vehicle not really innovation 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.320
 already knows them but still 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.120
 pretty well done there is this possibility 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.530
 to control his music with the 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.360
 bag recognition when 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.280
 this is for example an mp3 song 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.140
 we would have stored on a USB key 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.180
 there are also telephony functions 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.680
 with voice recognition and he 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.630
 there is always this possibility of 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.390
 control your system with the wheel 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.220
 mmi touch located between the two seats 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.540
 this knob mmi touch we know it 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.220
 already but she is still 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.650
 practice actually since it integrates on 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.120
 the top a little pavement the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.980
 recognition of character it is enough 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.959
 for example in high navigation mode for 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.940
 call a contact to draw the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.260
 letters from 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.210
 the person being called or the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.640
 destination then always has its 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.650
 shortcuts here on with its two buttons 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.780
 the main ones that enable activation at 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.640
 choice b is the radio or its functions 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.370
 reading media files so 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.590
 mp3 etc either the navigation or the 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.090
 virtual telephony functions 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.410
 cockpit is piloted actually to 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.040
 inside the vehicle by a chip 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.090
 nvidia 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.980
 this is what allows him especially 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.780
 to have all this interaction all 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.120
 this personalization with storytellers 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.830
 that we can enlarge or shrink a 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.270
 extremely mapping display 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.370
 fluid with an interaction with 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.460
 flaps that appears from right to left 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.080
 to always facilitate the action in all 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.180
 case interaction with all menus 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.530
 available on the multimedia function 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.670
 since you 're talking about interaction and 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.130
 well it's quite funny since I 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.680
 now joined the passenger seat 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.970
 and we can see that well once 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.560
 we're a passenger we're a little lacking 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.900
 any interaction with the car 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.940
 since the idea above this new 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.050
 virtual cockpit for 10 and 2 laps 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.580
 driver-centric 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.110
 so as a passenger and well I 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.180
 even more the hand on functions 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.340
 such as well and the radio or fly 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.230
 his mp3 music and then I could not 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.670
 leave this center of ingoldstadt without 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.930
 introduce you to another vehicle a 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.160
 other audi tt rs 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.800
 it's actually the version 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.989
 completely autonomous from the tt that has 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.820
 so climbed the pikes peak of a race 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.900
 still crazy enough 20km from 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.900
 completely autonomous way 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.520
 it's over our little 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.020
 presentation of this new audi tt 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.360
 on my side I'm going to enjoy being on 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.530
 place to go to visit the audi museum 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.150
 I just have to give you 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.620
 see you for a next edition 2 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.620
 011 drive on 01net tv
