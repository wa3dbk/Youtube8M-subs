00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.930
 there is a title has also reached the break with a small pavé in the pond a good 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:12.549
 point 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.050
 so for the moment he stung 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.659
 the disc makes that the ipad is really important 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:19.730
 the artistic director 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.929
 in the center of the two doors 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.819
 for the people who have made it an important element this state of affairs at 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:27.560
 tip 6 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.820
 say that the pilot folded ordinary stock 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.720
 to extend his children 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.910
 prevents to see the eyelid 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.910
 at the level of makeup to give some tips 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.150
 previously written afp 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.050
 while slovakia 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.520
 it must also be applied on the premises 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.600
 avoid too light eyebrows it would seem that he did not 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.140
 accessed the query 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.670
 sorel first that of the point 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.020
 this allows 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.780
 the time and date given a new place he had more and more pasta 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.030
 rice and pasta is applied 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.859
 that one 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.859
 I think you have to put qantas evenly 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.530
 on the entire eyelid 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.000
 and on the head 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.730
 something else 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.329
 at the level of makeup more will tell 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.560
 this is the competition the creation of this summer it serves 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.579
 the agenda mbj 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.499
 so on the place ie on paper the value a first stone 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.710
 a color 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.170
 from the deck at the banana level the goal is so this match was 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.960
 chopped to create a large volume 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.780
 after taking out a point a dash 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.110
 I am proud of this way 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.680
 it is in this perspective an exit 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.670
 but soon she is sitting on the foot 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.680
 I hope it's going well here and there is an encouragement for me 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.500
 thank you for your mac 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.400
 react to the article 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.400
 so we're going to ask them reassembled makeup 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.710
 in this sector of activity the lnr 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.700
 but he acknowledged can see it can be applied in a press release 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.990
 egor sviridov three quarters of the eyelid 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.090
 so we apply 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.809
 maternal dubois to the park 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:22.129
 so an applied formula we will start the work of the makeup 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.779
 eyelids 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.779
 you will need 14 years 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.509
 a dish 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:34.449
 a piece like the bullhorn pupils a dumplings brush and scooped a 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.329
 optical network 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.259
 to begin by applying with a big brush in the hand 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.259
 difaâ then certainly marked 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.019
 but as c 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.309
 alas the dew by mm 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.609
 so on the go 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.609
 still not the glitch 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:10.209
 so be careful at the level of half your republic is where I 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.559
 want 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:15.849
 the full clip is often important it is necessary to count to release for me a 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.629
 large and attentive crowd 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.629
 colorful even if obvious 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:27.899
 one in front of the party hall 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:30.899
 hundreds of them forward 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.379
 comes next 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.199
 again like this 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.199
 very high that late 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:46.549
 and finally bmw year 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.569
 reportage during tests 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.400
 such a meter six years 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.329
 the border 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.959
 so it's very important to put this plan on the Belgian mobile eyelid 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.959
 is it going to give balm it can create dollars against it has 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.210
 between garmin 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.110
 and to do that 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.189
 expensive than the menu 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.189
 your full clip will pay you back 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.059
 so you have to put on their whole 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:12.689
 an age plan 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.169
 but it brings out the criminal business and it's much more 

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:21.359
 at the level of ideas and dreams about the climate which is otherwise important 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.180
 it's important to create the right eyelid competitions 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:29.589
 and what we call its members to do but by an off-white 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.240
 we must change but in private 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.240
 stairs on all the part m 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.020
 and terraces 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.259
 we do not make any room 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.229
 and then to the flames in pearly white and we'll put it on top 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.470
 while on the plane 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.470
 waiting for his turn 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.360
 on the one hand the criticism here 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.289
 and I'm going to put the site under water 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.749
 m 

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:12.919
 so do not hesitate to the same sites that bring their skills 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.159
 then you have not yet submitted to d but the fingerprints started to have 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:23.189
 wrong 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.189
 and put under 6 billion 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:29.809
 which is not applied mascara 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.919
 while at the mascara level if you have the time 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.680
 if you apply a host of small towns 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.309
 this cinema this makeup 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:42.909
 so we're going to do it again 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.129
 and we know more 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.370
 all films debates 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.389
 msi to h1n1 is complete 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.820
 so I'm going to try something 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.289
 this is the most important week the title of apple 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.289
 it is important to have an exit certificate 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.380
 doubt you have to know that we 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.689
 basically to be 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:04.759
 more of the cpi 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.870
 leave to bring up an important 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.870
 so if you have a morphology were hostile 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.789
 borne by the global crisis he bounced back yesterday so this part 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.009
 his eyebrows so that the pib will be unveiled 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:21.580
 all trades 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.949
 one thing that I decide but since it is very very important 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.520
 so think that if the dress drawn by his style 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.460
 or not to let the mans go too small 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.610
 I hope that you liked the tu and you bring a dish 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.479
 in Senegal 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.240
 I tell you he said very soon and we find ourselves 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.650
 for the fifth episode these revisions 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.569
 to see if the demand
