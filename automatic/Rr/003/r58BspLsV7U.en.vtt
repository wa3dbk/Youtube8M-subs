00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.800 

the<00:04:17.140> GE<00:04:18.130> shofu<00:04:18.700> stop<00:04:19.300> pointing<00:04:19.570> out<00:04:19.690> the

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
the GE shofu stop pointing out the

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.110 
the GE shofu stop pointing out the
obvious<00:04:19.840> so<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:20.830> sounds<00:04:20.920> out<00:04:21.100> Oh<00:04:21.250> Keota<00:04:21.640> and
