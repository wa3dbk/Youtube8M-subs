lot<00:00:57.480> easier<00:00:57.930> than<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.199> should<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.010> since

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
lot easier than this should be and since

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.400

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
its Gareth is really small you can

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.139
