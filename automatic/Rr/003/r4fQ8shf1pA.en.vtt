00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.780 
time with the samsung series 9 the
macbook<00:02:20.640> air<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.970> hair<00:02:21.629> faster<00:02:22.519> but<00:02:23.519> that<00:02:23.670> is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
macbook air is a hair faster but that is

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.339 
macbook air is a hair faster but that is
also<00:02:23.970> running<00:02:24.209> another<00:02:24.480> different<00:02:25.050> operating

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
also running another different operating

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.130 
also running another different operating
system<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:27.000> really<00:02:27.239> like<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.599> fact<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
system we really like the fact that the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.490 
system we really like the fact that the
panel<00:02:28.349> on<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.800> US<00:02:29.010> 31<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.760> resolution<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.660> 1600

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
panel on the US 31 is resolution of 1600

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.339 
panel on the US 31 is resolution of 1600
x<00:02:31.590> 900<00:02:32.180> which<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.330> higher<00:02:33.540> even<00:02:33.989> than<00:02:34.200> the

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
x 900 which is higher even than the

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.490 
x 900 which is higher even than the
macbook<00:02:34.920> air<00:02:35.160> would<00:02:36.050> which<00:02:37.050> has<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> resolution

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
macbook air would which has a resolution

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.300 
macbook air would which has a resolution
of<00:02:37.890> 1440<00:02:38.340> x<00:02:38.790> 900<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:40.349> audio<00:02:40.680> on<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.130> also

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
of 1440 x 900 the audio on this is also

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.580 
of 1440 x 900 the audio on this is also
and<00:02:41.730> very<00:02:42.420> powerful<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.830> very<00:02:44.370> well<00:02:45.239> tuned

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
and very powerful and very well tuned

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.259 
and very powerful and very well tuned
the<00:02:46.590> speaker<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.130> audio<00:02:47.549> by<00:02:47.790> bang<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
the speaker it's audio by bang and

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.930 
the speaker it's audio by bang and
olufsen<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.680> we<00:02:50.069> are<00:02:50.160> very<00:02:50.190> impressed<00:02:50.760> with

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
olufsen and we are very impressed with

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.809 
olufsen and we are very impressed with
it<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.849> major<00:02:53.849> gripe<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.390> had<00:02:54.569> with<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.380> UX<00:02:56.340> 31

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
it the major gripe we had with the UX 31

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.240 
it the major gripe we had with the UX 31
was<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.390> touchpad<00:02:57.930> which<00:02:58.560> although<00:02:58.950> it's

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
was the touchpad which although it's

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.770 
was the touchpad which although it's
nice<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.670> large<00:02:59.819> is<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.120> nice<00:03:00.299> little<00:03:00.510> glass

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
nice and large is a nice little glass

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.309 
nice and large is a nice little glass
touchpad<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.950> drivers<00:03:02.489> on<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.819> are<00:03:03.540> still

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
touchpad the drivers on it are still

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.080 
touchpad the drivers on it are still
need<00:03:04.440> some<00:03:04.650> work<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:05.220> we<00:03:05.519> found<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:05.970> be<00:03:06.000> a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
need some work so we found it to be a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.170 
need some work so we found it to be a
bit<00:03:06.299> finicky<00:03:06.599> however<00:03:07.319> is<00:03:07.500> sue<00:03:07.709> said<00:03:08.069> that<00:03:08.459> an

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
bit finicky however is sue said that an

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.900 
bit finicky however is sue said that an
update<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:09.989> on<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.230> way<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.890> UX<00:03:14.160> 31<00:03:14.670> we

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
update is on the way the the UX 31 we

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.150 
update is on the way the the UX 31 we
got<00:03:15.090> about<00:03:15.360> six<00:03:15.900> hours<00:03:16.049> on<00:03:16.440> our<00:03:16.560> battery<00:03:16.920> test

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
got about six hours on our battery test

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.610 
got about six hours on our battery test
which<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.489> also<00:03:17.610> fairly<00:03:17.940> good<00:03:18.380> it's<00:03:19.380> not<00:03:19.500> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
which is also fairly good it's not the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.699 
which is also fairly good it's not the
longest<00:03:20.040> but<00:03:20.220> it's<00:03:20.340> not<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.489> shortest<00:03:20.819> either

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
longest but it's not the shortest either

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.699 
longest but it's not the shortest either
but<00:03:22.709> that's<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.549> lot<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:24.299> in<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.709> so

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
but that's a lot to like in it so

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.750 
but that's a lot to like in it so
overall<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.910> UX<00:03:27.269> 31<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:28.459> probably<00:03:29.459> one<00:03:29.609> of<00:03:29.639> the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
overall the UX 31 is probably one of the

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.140 
overall the UX 31 is probably one of the
better<00:03:30.299> ultrabooks<00:03:31.049> we've<00:03:31.200> seen<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:31.739> far<00:03:32.150> it's

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
better ultrabooks we've seen so far it's

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.500 
better ultrabooks we've seen so far it's
got<00:03:33.359> a<00:03:33.389> great<00:03:33.569> design<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:35.060> excellent<00:03:36.060> display

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
got a great design a excellent display

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.420 
got a great design a excellent display
and<00:03:36.660> audio<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.590> gets<00:03:37.709> very<00:03:37.799> good<00:03:38.010> battery

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
and audio and it gets very good battery

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.430 
and audio and it gets very good battery
life<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:39.420> starts<00:03:39.690> at<00:03:39.810> ten<00:03:39.989> ninety<00:03:40.260> nine

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
life and it starts at ten ninety nine

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.890 
life and it starts at ten ninety nine
which<00:03:40.709> is<00:03:40.950> about<00:03:41.760> two<00:03:42.060> hundred<00:03:42.150> dollars<00:03:42.569> less

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
which is about two hundred dollars less

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.389 
which is about two hundred dollars less
than<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:44.250> competing<00:03:44.700> macbook<00:03:45.209> air
