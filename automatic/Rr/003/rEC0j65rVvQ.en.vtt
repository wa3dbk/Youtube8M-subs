00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.480
 heading for maynkrafta game COC Board on 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.279
 an experienced builder and in this category I 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.529
 I will teach you how beautiful to build in 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.210
 our square game as well as future 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.279
 parts I'll tell you about how best 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.120
 just build spawn comfortable 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.940
 organize without difficulty so that people can 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.590
 find what they need and in the first pilot 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.390
 Part of this rubric I want to talk about 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.309
 build a budget beautiful home 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.870
 to build such a house u to any 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.840
 player serval mode 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.360
 surely you zadolbali boxes boxes 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.579
 everywhere the box is at home these who don't 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.710
 knows which he did not work for a long time 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.020
 usually with four corners and usually 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.940
 roofless are most often made from one and 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.770
 same block actually get down to business 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.969
 house shape 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.519
 some don't bother and do 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.320
 the box looks like it is very ugly not 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.240
 it's really hard to make your house bigger 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.610
 believe corners it will be much 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.430
 more beautiful than just a box of 4 with four 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.530
 In some angles, some still show at least 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.869
 a little crete u create a pyramid at home 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.869
 the scope also looks much more beautiful 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.860
 the flesh to create a house of course you can not 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.990
 bother and build houses of boards 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.990
 but it looks a little not appetizing 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.000
 so I can offer you an option 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.550
 such a house you see him now 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.190
 screen it is also made of wood and boards 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.460
 corners made of steel logs from boards 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.010
 between them are glass 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.410
 overlap made also from 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.870
 logs even better add your set yet 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.760
 and spruce logs as well as these boards 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.580
 believe it looks it will be still 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.330
 more effective do not be afraid to combine different 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.520
 block types 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:13.700
 for example sandstone harmonize well with 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:15.890
 oak logs amine brick with different 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.170
 bricks and spruce logs with white 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.510
 wool 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.480
 floor and ceiling will look good 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.850
 the floor of their simple one kind of blocks but 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.980
 see what fits the wall color better 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.080
 if for example the house is mainly from 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.660
 cobblestone make a good floor of stone 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.970
 and if the wood floor looks good 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.750
 from logs you can also decorate your house 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.050
 to laurels 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.850
 benefits did not appear version 1 62 also 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.070
 the pattern on the floor looks nice 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.800
 if you can't think of anything then 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.170
 make at least the floor as a chess 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.110
 layout but better come up 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.120
 original pattern 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.730
 ceiling desirable wool 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.590
 it looks very nice wooden 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.550
 house ceiling is better to make boards 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.560
 second floor balcony second floor advise 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.660
 do is identical to the first will be more beautiful 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.290
 I made the stairs and steps than as 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.530
 simply 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.970
 on the second floor you can make a balcony 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.750
 You can see various variations in yourself. 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.750
 on the screen 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.830
 the roof of the roof is made steps for the house of 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.990
 wood fit cobblestones and stairs 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.210
 for cottages brick steps 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.090
 the roof come in different shapes can see 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.860
 they are now on their screen and that's it 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.500
 In the next lesson we will deal with the internal 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.990
 home decoration and after that we will deal with 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.660
 fine decorations and creating a courtyard with 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.640
