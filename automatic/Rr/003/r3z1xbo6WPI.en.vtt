00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:15.890
 I think it's the main club of the 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:19.610
 country and that is always obliged to do 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.390
 and try to win the championships or the 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.100
 competencies that is participating that 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.000
 directing with that pressure is complicated 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:32.710
 but the technician who arrives is going to 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.900
 meet with a human group and a group 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.760
 in terms of football, it's pretty 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:44.120
 good so it's a matter of 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.970
 you see create a style inside the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.420
 of the team 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.750
 strengthen some things and I think it 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.330
 with what there is more all that there is below 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.680
 I have what it has to be 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.380
 a club that does not expect much that always 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.430
 have the need to earn more in this 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.630
 right now the villains by 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.910
 spoil the championship to others 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.010
 equipment we have not thought about it 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.590
 honestly but what we have 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.050
 thought we need to beat everyone 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.650
 those teams to have chances of 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.460
 put us in the league that has been 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.750
 as our our purpose and what 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.750
 said on many occasions 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.340
 projecting beyond the week that 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.000
 we are working the team that we 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.580
 play play on the weekend 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.810
 but more than thinking what it is that 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.300
 can we be the championship of 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.680
 making it difficult for others to guide 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.400
 what we have to do ourselves 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.020
 for winning your teams our campaign 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.150
 it is fundamental to try to get into the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.570
 liguilla let's do everything possible 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.810
 for that and we work with the certainty of 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:01.940
 let's get it the results do not 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:06.020
 no no I 'm not looking for that he looked for it winning 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.530
 to continue here I 'm not looking to win 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.630
 to get in the group after not 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.450
 I know about that 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.640
 the time is not right to analyze it 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.830
 but what I want to make clear is 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.230
 I'm not looking to win to continue 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.810
 I'm looking to win for this group to get 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.060
 in the league that was my first that 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.180
 It was my mission and my purpose when I took 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.470
 when I took the group, fortunately, 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.810
 gave the first result and there was a 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.490
 heap of result the last date and 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.530
 I hope this date is the same and 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.910
 let us do what is for 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.800
 our part that the channel I have in what 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.319
 let's do and then see what it is 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.440
 what's up with our rival photos 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.350
 and I also think that 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.860
 the processes must be respected 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.660
 in this club is complicated although this 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.780
 club more with the kind of championship that 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.819
 there is 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.250
 there starts to be a kind of 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.450
 despair when you do not win and that you 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.450
 leads to not respecting the processes 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.440
 the work you are doing will cost very 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.690
 good job unfortunately, I do not know 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.800
 gave the results and that led us to 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.320
 the exit at the exit of a person who 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.740
 won a tricampeonato was fighting 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.990
 Semifinals of the Copa Libertadores 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.730
 among others 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.460
 also I do not know do not know do not know not 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.070
 he respected his process but it is colo colo 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.990
 colo colo well and whoever comes to 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.590
 directing has to know that so and all 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.660
 we know that this club expects less than 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.220
 the rest 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.200
 I agree with what he says 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.330
 claudio e 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.470
 but I also think that because of the situation 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.470
 how is the club now 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.540
 is that it is complicated is complicated if 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:57.190
 achieves is the ideal is ideal because with 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.390
 that also not only improves what is 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.830
 the part of this that is the most 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.930
 important the club that is the first 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.480
 team but all the hours all 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.890
 the other areas start to work by 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.120
 example I talk about what are the 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.240
 jugares cadets and young cadets 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.760
 every time they have come already 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.500
 many young people have been promoted 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.739
 cadets is when the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.910
 processes gustavo benitez claudio borghi 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.570
 Jaime Pizarro 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.610
 after that much change is logical 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.840
 that each technician that comes comes with what 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.120
 that he believes is best for 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.640
 get results that's why it gets 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.740
 see a little truncated the step of the 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.050
 young players here to give a 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.210
 example I totally agree is 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.210
 complicated if it's complicated but now 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.210
 I'm in another I'm measured what 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.919
 what is it again in results 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.930
 in results because I think this is not 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.660
 deserves and this group players do not 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.150
 deserves to be in the place where I am 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.040
 I found myself 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.270
 I have not met a leader here 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.270
 in found with several 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.550
 logically that the people who come from 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.400
 down 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.919
 knows the club from from there 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.400
 the cadets of cadets that does 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.590
 have a special identification 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.620
 after those who have arrived on the road 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.960
 I think it came back because of its quality 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.030
 human and for its football quality 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.160
 they have gone they have been gaining a place inside 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.620
 from within the team that was wearing 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.780
 a lot of time here 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.680
 he is a player of a human quality 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.289
 tremendous 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.750
 and that is leader was eduardo logos 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.960
 much less much less to talk about 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.819
 gonzalo fierro 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.150
 just that it takes a long time too 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.500
 has has a lot of leadership and you see that 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.840
 It gives much more 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.730
 felipe flores 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.770
 I believe that without the help of the 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.650
 players without the help of everyone in the 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.210
 help from that group I'm talking to you 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.860
 it was very difficult to get this out 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.860
 they have been fundamental 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.530
 for what you tell me there is no one there 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.930
 several leaders here and everyone has taken the 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.160
 voice and everyone has put their chest when 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.070
 necessary 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:15.280
 and we pretend all together to try 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.280
 take this this moment forward
